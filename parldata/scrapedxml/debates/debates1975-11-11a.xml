<p>No firm information is available, as local authorities are not required to tell the Department of their intentions. While it is not possible simultaneously to restrain public expenditure and generally to maintain or increase the size and quality of the services provided, it is my impression that many authorities are doing their best to maintain their youth service provison in spite of the difficulties.</p>

<p>Is the hon. Gentleman aware that Opposition Members are deeply concerned about the sagging morale of the youth service and the destruction of overall activity in youth service provision? Does he know, for example, that in Liverpool the local

authority has pushed voluntary youth work to the bottom of the urban aid list, and that one London borough has told a voluntary youth body that it will lose all its grant next year? Is the hon. Gentleman surprised, therefore, that young people are totally disillusioned with the Government?</p>

<p>Young people are not the only people who are aware that the Opposition are always asking for reductions in public expenditure in general yet oppose every element of restraint which is planned. Consequently, the Opposition have no credit whatsoever in the country. If the hon. Gentleman wishes to raise with me particulars of the specific cases he mentioned, I shall look into them. There are certain circumstances in which some authorities have found great difficulty in maintaining their youth services. On the other hand, there are others which, despite immense difficulties, have made increases in the service. It is far from true to say that the general morale is as bad as the hon. Gentleman suggests.</p>

<p>Does my hon.

<p>My hon. Friend has put his finger on the point I was trying to make. He has underlined clearly what I said.

<p>To enable the provision of nursery education places to be increased, allocations of resources to local education authorities for the current year have been maintained and &#x00A3;8&#x00B7;5 million has been

<p>What are the criteria by which the Government judge it right to spend many hundreds of millions of pounds on nationalisation while reducing expenditure on nursery education from &#x00A3;30 million to &#x00A3;9 million next year?</p>

<p>The question of public ownership and nationalisation is not one for my Department, but I would point out to the hon. Gentleman that the Opposition have long attempted to suggest that the Government take into public ownership only those things which are failing the nation and therefore cost money. That is not the view of the Government, who also wish to take into public ownership things that are profitable, and which serve the nation well.<br/>
I have already pointed out that, despite very great economic difficulties, we have not ceased to expand the nursery education programme, although it is true that it is not expanding at the rate which many of us would like to see.</p>

<p>Is my hon. Friend aware that the Labour Party came to office on the basis of a manifesto that included the expansion of nursery education? Is she further aware that the sum of money she has reported to the House for next year's expansion of nursery education is less than half that which was spent this year? Does not she think that that reduction of nursery education is against everything for which the Labour Party has campaigned?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1975-11-11a.1115.3" hansard_membership_id="7787" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/17232" speakername="Miss Lestor" colnum="1115" time="">
<p>I am well aware that the Labour Party came to power advocating an expansion of nursery education. I was one of the people responsible for getting it into the programme. If I thought that we were now going to drop it, I should not wish to remain a member of the Government.<br/>
Perhaps my hon. Friend could use her considerable talents to persuade those education authorities that have not taken up their allocations for nursery education in the last year to do so, and to take up their allocations in future years. There

is a myth that the Government are responsible for this failure, whereas some of us have been trying to persuade local authorities to use the allocations available to them.</p>

<p>I hope that the hon. Lady will reconsider her resignation. It would be a disaster to lose both the hon. Lady and the nursery programme.<br/>
Does not the difficulty in which local education authorities are placed arise from recurrent costs? How can the Government reconcile the contradictory objectives of giving capital sums for nursery education and then denying to local education authorities the revenue costs to service the schools?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1975-11-11a.1116.1" hansard_membership_id="7787" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/17232" speakername="Miss Lestor" colnum="1116" time="">
<p>I am delighted that the hon. Gentleman is so concerned about my future and that of the nursery school programme. I can assure him that both are in very good hands.<br/>
Concerning capital expenditure on nursery education, and revenue costs, both are covered. It is perfectly true that the development of nursery education costs a great deal of money, and that some local authorities have not decided to go ahead with it, but the Government make allowance in the RSG settlement for the recurrent expenditure consequences of the capital allocations they make available for nursery education.</p>

<p>Does my hon. Friend agree that it is about time the hypocrisy of the Opposition in this matter was shown up? The hon. Member for Chelmsford (Mr. St. John-Stevas) has already said that the present Government have given an allocation of only &#x00A3;9 million, whereas his own Government allocated &#x00A3;30 million. Does my hon. Friend agree that the future of nursery education depends on the willingness of local authorities to take up their allocations? As my hon. Friend has already said, many of the Tory authorities, including my own, at Redbridge, have not done this.</p>

<p>Is the Minister aware that at a recent conference of educational publishers and of all the leading teachers' organisations, fears were expressed that, because of inflation and the squeeze of public spending, the provision of books will drop by 25 per cent. in the coming year? Is she also aware that at the same conference it was said that the provision of school books per pupil, in Nigeria, is now larger than that in this country?</p>

<p>I am aware of the concern that has been expressed about the whole question of school books. The hon.

<p>This is perfectly accurate. There is a connection, obviously. But I remind the hon. Gentleman that the Bullock Committee, while drawing attention to the question of school books, their quality and availability, also gave instances in which the question of reading standards was not connected simply with the supply of school books. There are many other factors to be borne in mind.</p>

<p>Does my hon. Friend realise that, whilst her Ministry lays down minimum standards for school buildings

and for pupil-teacher ratios, her right hon. Friend has given me an answer showing that the Ministry has no standards whatsoever, or no minimum standards, concerning capitation, or for equipment and materials, which includes books? Is she aware that, even where there is an increase in the real resources spent on education, this can, due to the current economic difficulties, sometimes mean a reduction in these very important materials? Does she not think that it is time the Department had some standards in this respect?</p>

<p>As I stated in reply to a Question by the hon. Member for Wallasey (Mrs. Chalker) on 31st October&#x2014;[Vol. 898, c. 624&#x2013;5]&#x2014;no national information is available subsequent to that which has already been given to the House following the Department's survey of absence in maintained middle and secondary schools on 17th January 1974.</p>

<p>Does my hon. Friend agree that the survey which was carried out showed a massive rate of truancy, that any truancy of this sort is invariably a sign of danger to the young person and to the home concerned, and that it is very important for us to have full knowledge of all the facts, in order to understand how to arrest and deal with truancy?

<p>The survey gave a useful overall picture. It is evident that the system of establishing national returns needs to be more elaborate before any conclusions can be drawn from them. The consultative letter on behavioural problems&#x2014;connected, undoubtedly, with the whole question of truancy&#x2014;which was


sent to interested bodies in May this year, asked for the views of the people concerned. A copy of the consultative letter is in the Library, and we hope to see comments on it before deliberating on what more can be done.</p>

<p>Concerning the survey of 17th January 1974 to which the Minister referred, is the Minister aware that the schools had one month's notice that there would be a survey on that day, that the survey was done by the schools themselves, and that it is known that in certain cases, in order to ensure a high attendance, nobody went to the clinics, and that the schools themselves decided what was meant by truancy?<br/>
Is she further aware that in 1973 the magazine "Where" stated that reliance could not be placed on registers in cases like this?<br/>
Does the Minister therefore agree that we ought to return to the system under which school inspectors made spot checks on attendance, and that only in that way shall we know the extent of this problem, which is certainly a large one?</p>

<p>Given the increasing frustration, resentment and disillusionment, and the possible waste of resources among the 15&#x2013;16 age group, coupled with the desirability to increase nursery education facilities for the rising-fives, would not it be better to allow greater flexibility of the statutory school leaving age, thus giving local authorities some discretion to concentrate their resources where they think most desirable, and not insisting on their doing so on statutory ages which many people believe to be increasingly unsatisfactory?</p>

<p>I cannot agree with that. In my view, the raising of the school leaving age was one of the few good things done by the previous administration. It would be a retrograde step to revert to arrangements of the kind that the hon. Gentleman suggests. On the other hand, as both my hon. Friends have made clear with regard to nursery education, one of the difficulties is that although, in the rate support grant, we provide for the recurrent costs, local authorities are not spending on education the funds which have been allocated to education.

<p>I am deeply moved by the Opposition's great concern about the nursery school programme and their wish now to go back on the raising of the school leaving age, which was introduced by their Leader when she was Secretary of State for Education. I am afraid that it is not possible to give precise figures about the direct grant schools, but the additional cost could amount to &#x00A3;12 million. However, the additional saving, if it went the other way, could be as much as &#x00A3;30 million.

Will he give me the chance to introduce him to many of the students who are suffering real hardship because of inadequate grants, and to many of the staff who are doing a good job and yet are receiving a lower salary than are many people who are doing a similar job in other educational establishments?</p>

<p>I should certainly not wish to go to Stirling University without


the benefit of the counsel and, if possible, the presence of my hon. Friend the Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan). I was appointed to my present position when the universities were about to start their summer vacation. I have so far managed to visit three universities, but I hope to visit more in the future. However, in view of the financial constraints, the message which I have received everywhere is not dissimilar to that which my hon. Friend has put forward concerning Stirling University. There is no doubt that the financial position is a great strain on our universities and I want to pay tribute to the work which they are doing. I do not know of any area in the world where higher education is organised as effectively and so efficiently in cost-benefit terms as in the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>The right hon. Gentleman paid a fine tribute to the universities.

Is he also aware that the university staff are not trying to break the pay limits established by the Government, but that they feel sore at having been let down by the Secretary of State when the starting date was fixed at 1st September and not 1st October?

<p>The Burnham Committee is to undertake a review of the points system, which has a bearing on the number of promoted posts.

<p>I do not think that there should be any effect from phasing out the direct grant. I am hoping that a great number of the direct grant schools will join the maintained system. In the next year we are hoping to make arrangements, within the rate support grant system, which will avoid any deterioration in the staff-pupil ratio, although we shall not be able to make any improvements. Whether the staff-pupil ratio is maintained will depend largely on the local authorities. Although we calculate the national total of rate support grant system on the assumption that expenditure on education by local authorities will reach a certain level, we have no means of ensuring that the local authorities spend the money on education.</p>

<p>The CBI and the TUC take these proposals very seriously, and I hope that the House will, as well. It was a very important meeting that we had at Chequers. Although there were differences between the CBI and the TUC, and between both of them and the Government, they accepted the objectives, as the House has been told, and welcomed the proposals that we have put forward. As for Chrysler, I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will recognise that, for reasons given in the House already by my right hon. Friend and myself, it is better at this stage to say nothing at all&#x2014;[<i>Interruption.</i>] We are talking about the jobs of many thousands of people, which at any rate my hon. Friends who represent the affected constituencies and some hon. Members opposite take as a serious issue. I had hoped that it would be possible to say something before Prorogation. I do not think now that it will be, but the Government will make a statement to the House as early as possible. Certainly, the situation that we have been presented with is something which, I am sure, when all the facts are known, will turn out to be distasteful to hon. Members in all parts of the House.</p>

<p>I have answered this in what I have just said. We are examining the forward programme of expenditure. What was agreed at Chequers was not a detailed national plan; it was an approach to a national strategy, which got a wide response in the CBI and the TUC. We are continually under pressure from both sides of the House in the matter of employment in particular areas. Obviously, any cuts which are required there&#x2014;whether more or less than existing plans&#x2014;will have to be made within a total limited programme, and that is the Government's job to decide.</p>

<p>I thank my hon. Friend for what he has said. I know he speaks not only for the trade union representatives and workers at Linwood but for all Chrysler employees.

However, it is only fair that I should say that, while the Linwood strike record was bad until a year ago, as was the record of Coventry, the situation at Linwood this year has been extremely good, and only a few hundred man-hours have been lost in the first 10 months of this year.</p>

<p>I beg to move,
<q>That leave be given to bring in a Bill to require building societies to lend 10 per cent. of their advances annually to local authorities for providing mortgages to applicants unable to obtain them from building societies.</q>
As part of their economic cuts, the Government have recently required local authorities to reduce the amount they lend to would-be house buyers to half of the &#x00A3;520 million they lent in the previous financial year. As a result many councils are now having to turn down every application for a mortgage, however desperate for a home the family might be. When I applied to my own council at Salford, I was told that it had already had to refuse 135 applicants during the month.<br/>
Local authorities grant mortgages to people who have failed to obtain them from building societies, whether because the house involved is too old, the home-seeker is on a low income or he cannot afford a deposit. Councils, however, frequently grant 100 per cent. loans for house purchase. At the same time, the building societies are bursting with funds.<br/>
After discussions with the Department of the Environment, the 10 largest building societies agreed to lend &#x00A3;100 million to families who would not normally be favourably considered. This may sound a large sum, but compared with the &#x00A3;4,000 million a year that the building societies are now lending it is peanuts&#x2014;about one-fortieth of the total. It is a modest request, therefore, that they should be required to provide four times the amount they agreed to lend&#x2014;that is, &#x00A3;400 million a year&#x2014;to help the less-well-off section of the community.<br/>
Under my Bill, the money would be provided by the societies to the councils, which in turn would grant the mortgages, rather than their being granted directly through the building societies. We could then be more certain that the mortgages were being granted in the required total quantity and to those most needing them. It is obvious that far more low-priced homes could be bought than if an equal total of mortgage money were devoted to financing the purchase of luxury mansions.<br/>
The building societies are under some moral obligation to assist in this way since it was not so long ago that the Government lent them &#x00A3;500 million to keep their lending rates down to 11 per cent. This would give a great boost to the whole building industry, which is now in a serious slump with nearly 200,000 workers unemployed in the building and related trades. There are many owners of poorer types of house who wish to buy better houses but cannot do so until they have got rid of their existing homes. If more mortgages were available for the purchase of the poorer types of house, the sellers would be able to buy the better homes they seek. This would have an effect which would be felt throughout housing. It would help to kill two birds&#x2014;homelessness and unemployment&#x2014;with one stone.<br/>
The Bill would also require the societies to lend the money to the councils at reasonable interest rates, at not more than their current lending rates. Why should councils have to borrow, as they do, at 14 per cent. or even 15 per cent., thus having to charge high rates to mortgagees, when building societies can borrow at lower rates and charge not more than 11 per cent.?<br/>
Another clause of the Bill would permit the Government to require building societies to grant more than 10 per cent. of their annual loans to local authorities if it is thought that they can well afford to do so, if the situation so required and if Parliament gave its permission by Order. No one would be involved in loss

&#x2014;not the Government, not the building societies and not the local authorities. As we say in Lancashire, "There's nowt so safe as houses". The houses themselves provide ample security should there be default in repaying the loans and interest. Indeed, there has been an infinitesimally small loss to the lending bodies.<br/>
As this is almost the end of the parliamentary Session, and since it is hardly likely that the Bill will become law this year, I intend to reintroduce it in the coming Session of Parliament.</p>

<p>I must protest strongly at the sordid way in which the House is being treated over this Bill, even in its dying stages. The Bill was disgracefully handled on Report. A mass of Government amendments was flung at us very late in the day and we made our views clear on the matter then. Today we are faced with exactly the same situation. We are being asked to deal with 186 Lords amendments, with the Government seeking to disagree with or amend some 29 of them. The grouping of those which have been put forward allows for nearly 50 debates, and of course some of the Government amendments to the Lords amendments are quite new.<br/>
We received the printed paper setting out these amendments only today, and only today have we received the Government's intentions on them. They arrived in the Vote Office only this morning, at which time they became available to hon. Members. We did not receive the grouping of the amendments until after one o'clock. In no sense is the House of Lords to blame for this. The other place has done a very thorough job on the Bill, to which I would pay tribute. It has not tried to spin things out. I believe that the Government must acknowledge that their spokesmen in the other place have never suggested that it has.<br/>
The reasons for the chaos are quite simple. First, it is a product of serious mismanagement of Government business throughout the Session. Secondly, the Bill was brought in far too late in the Session anyway. Thirdly, the Bill is very badly constructed and drafted. Fourthly,

it contained so much which was objectionable both in terms of common sense and human liberty that many changes have been forced on the Government. They themselves have had to make a vast number of changes during the passage of the Bill. They have been trying to buy acceptance in that way, but the Bill remains utterly unacceptable.<br/>

<p>I must congratulate the hon. Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Raison) on finding a new means of delaying the House at this stage. I well recall that when consideration by the Commons of Lords amendments to the Local Government Bill took place, over 600 amendments were involved. We did not receive them until an hour or so before we were to debate them. The right hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) was in charge at that time.<br/>
Most of the 186 amendments were made by Conservative Peers. There was only one amendment on Third Reading in the other place. Their Lordships finished their consideration of those amendments last week.</p>

<p>This whole batch of amendments deals with definitions which are now contained between Clauses 3 and 6. The definitions have been moved from various clauses in the Bill to these

<p>I am grateful to the Minister for rearranging the Bill in this way. I said in Committee that it would be far easier for those who are called upon to operate the Bill if all the definitions were put together and a few more were added&#x2014;although I do not know why we should try to make this horrible Bill easier. Perhaps it would have been better if we had made it more difficult to understand, and impossible to operate. I am glad to say that the definitions follow the Town and Country Planning Act 1971, which we talked about very much in Committee.<br/>
There are two points to which I should draw attention. First, Amendment No. 17 is rather more material than just a drafting amendment. It removes the definition of "development land", and that is a major point in the Bill.<br/>
Secondly, the removal of subsections (3), (4), (5) and (6) of Clause 4, those relating to material interest, will be a little puzzling to those who are looking at the amendments to the Bill at this stage. So that we may have it on the record, will the hon. Gentleman say why the subsections concerning material interest are being removed?</p>

<p>The House is in some difficulty in dealing with a Bill which is still as it was before the Second Reading in the Lords. I do not blame the right hon. Gentleman the Minister. It is nothing to do with him, but we have no Lords amendments in the Bill before us, which makes it very difficult for hon. Members to follow exactly what is going on.

hon. Friend and I saw the sense in what he proposed, particularly as all three of us are practitioners. We hoped to make the change on Report, but it has been done properly and adequately in another place.<br/>
Lords Amendment No. 17 deletes the definition of "development land" only because that definition is now contained in Clause 3.<br/>
Lords Amendment No. 26 merely deletes things that are now dealt with in the new Clause 3A, which is to be inserted by Lords Amendment No. 13.</p>

<p>I am trying hard at this short notice to find my way through the variety of definitions and groupings before us. I do not have the number of the amendment in question, but I see that there is to be a new Clause 52D, which states:
<q>Any direction or consent given by the Secretary of State under this Act may be&#x2014;</q>
<q>(<i>a</i>)either general or limited to any particular case or class of case,</q>
<q>(<i>b</i>)addressed to any particular authority or class of authority, or</q>
<q>(<i>c</i>)unconditional or subject to condtions.</q>
That appears to me to be a substitute for Clause 6(2). The whole of Clause 6 is deleted by one of the amendments in the large group that we are considering. Subsection (3) seems to disappear altogether, because it is not reintroduced in the new clause to be inserted after Clause 52. It may well be that the Minister can tell me that it has gone somewhere else. We have seen, for example, that Clause 6(1) has now gone into the new definition clause. Can the hon. Gentleman tell us where Clause 6(3) has gone?</p>

<p>The amendments are to correct a minor drafting error. The main purpose of subsection (8) is to make it clear that any reference in the Bill to an "authority" is a reference to that authority operating within its own area. But the subsection goes on to provide that a reference to a given class of authority&#x2014;for example, a reference to "local authority"&#x2014;is also to be interpreted as referring to the authority of that class within whose area the land is situated. This was needed for some provisions in the Bill, but in other places it has the wrong result.<br/>
For example, Clause 39 gives the Secretary of State power to make grants to local authorities&#x2014;a class of authority&#x2014;when they buy land from the Crown. We want this to apply whether the Crown land which is being bought is inside or outside the area of the particular local authority, but the second half of subsection (8), which it is proposed to delete, would have restricted the power to give grants only to cases where the land was in the area of the local authority. Similar considerations occur with Clause 26, dealing with the compensation payable when one local authority buys from another.</p>

<p>I beg to move, That this House doth disagree with the Lords in the said amendment.<br/>
The amendment, which is an old friend of ours from Committee and the Report stage, would remove the power for an Order setting up a joint board to modify legislation. We discussed the matter at length upstairs and on Report. The other place has chosen to delete the provision entirely. I can only assume that their Lordships did not understand what they were doing, for the power to amend legislation is essential in order to ensure the proper functioning of the joint board, for reasons explained when the Government

amendments were discussed here on Report.<br/>
Moreover, the power may also be needed to protect the position of the constituent authorities. Let us suppose that a joint board was set up. The order might then transfer the functions of the constituent authorities under the Bill to the joint board and the constituent authorities would be left with no powers at all under the Bill. Therefore, they could not even use the powers under the Bill to acquire land for their own use. This is certainly not what the Government would wish to achieve.<br/>
I have demonstrated that this is a necessary power and I believe that all hon. Members have accepted that, as amended on Report, the power is now a limited and reasonable one. Therefore, I can think of no reason why this House should accept the Lords amendment.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1975-11-11a.1150.0" hansard_membership_id="7490" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/32714" speakername="Mr. Graham Page" colnum="1150" time="">
<p>I do not put much weight on precedent when discussing this matter. I dare say that there are precedents for some such wording as the Government wish to retain in the Bill. However, we are dealing with exceptional circumstances and entirely new powers.<br/>
The powers to be given to the joint boards and to the Minister in setting up the joint boards go far beyond what is necessary and, indeed, what is necessary compared with what the Minister will have if this paragraph is removed.<br/>
Clause 2 sets up the joint boards:
<q>as an authority for all or any of the purposes of Part III, Part V or Part VI of this Act</q>
The index of the Bill indicates what the various parts are concerned with. Part III deals with the acquisition of land, the duties of the local authorities in acquiring land, and land compensation. Part V deals with the acquisition of land by the Crown, and the acquisition from statutory undertakers. Part VI deals with supplemental matters and in particular the important clauses about reserve powers whereby the Minister can set up a new body altogether or take over the powers in the Bill himself.<br/>
Therefore, the purposes are fairly wide. Whether they are to be all the purposes of Part III, Part V or Part VI of the Bill depends on the contents of the Order because Clause 29(1)(<i>b</i>) says that the Secretary of State may:
<q>constitute a joint board as the authority to act in that district for those purposes",</q>


which I take to be all or part of the purposes of Part III, Part V and Part VI which are specified in the Order. Therefore, quite an extensive power will be given to the joint boards.<br/>
Clause 2(4) defines what can be put in the Order and it mentions Section 241 of the Local Government Act 1972. That section gives power to modify existing statutes but it is drawn narrowly. It says:
<q>Where any enactment, whether passed before or after 1st April 1974, authorises the formation by a provisional or other order of a joint board</q>
&#x2014;this is what we are talking about in this Lords amendment&#x2014;
<q>or joint committee, the constituent members of which are local authorities, for the discharge of any of the functions of those authorities, the provisional order or order may apply to the joint board or joint committee, subject to any necessary modifications, any of the provisions of this Act.</q>
It is true that the Local Government Act 1972 gives powers by Order to the Secretary of State to modify existing statutes. Sections 252 and 254 give that power. However, they go into great detail and set out exactly what the Secretary of State can do by Order. The Act deals with joint boards in local government and the duties and functions of local government, but it does not go anywhere near as wide as paragraph (<i>b</i>) of Clause 2(5) of the Bill. Clause 2(5)(<i>b</i>) gives the Secretary of State, if he thinks it expedient, the power to make an Order to:
<q>adapt or modify any of the provisions of this Act or of any other enactment concerning the acquisition of land.</q>
It may be argued that the first few lines of subsection (5) qualify paragraph (<i>b</i>). Subsection (5) says:
<q>An order under this section may make such incidental, consequential, transitional or supplementary provision as appears to the Secretary of State to be necessary or expedient.</q>
I am not sure whether the Minister will say that the Acts concerning acquisition of land under this subsection can be modified or adapted only to the extent that such adaptation or modification is incidental, consequential, transitional or supplementary. I submit that it is not qualified by those words because they are followed&#x2014;and this is what the Secretary of State can do in addition to the transactional matters&#x2014;by:

<q>and, in particular&#x2014;</q>
<q>(<i>b</i>) may adapt or modify any of the provisions of this Act or of any other enactment concerning the acquisition of land. </q>
As this clause reads, it is not qualified by the words "transitional", "consequential "or" incidental". It is a complete power to the Secretary of State by Order&#x2014;although it is true that he will have to bring the Order before the House&#x2014;to adapt any statute relating to the acquisition of land. That means the amount of compensation which is to be paid and the procedure for acquisition. That is substantive law.<br/>
Why do the Government want to alter the law in favour of a joint board and to give it those powers? The Bill gives no such power to the Secretary of State to alter the law in favour of local authorities. Thank heavens it does not! However, there would be quite an outcry if we found a clause in the Bill which stated that the Secretary of State could alter the law about the acquisition of land, compensation, procedure for acquisition, compulsory purchase, and so on, in favour of any local authority. However, as the clause was originally drafted for amendment by the other place it gave the Secretary of State that power.</p>

<p>I presume that publicity can be given to this point only through our debates in this House.

Members know how Orders go through this House late at night&#x2014;and if it is only consequential on the Bill and only a matter of procedure, I shall have no objection. However, as drafted it is not a matter of procedure. It is a matter of substantive law and it gives the Secretary of State the power to modify the law relating to the acquisition of land. Their Lordships were perfectly right in taking paragraph (<i>b</i>) out of subsection (5).</p>

<p>I should like to support what was said about this matter by my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page). The Under-Secretary led off by saying that it


is a matter that we have discussed at length in Committee and again on Report. That we should have done so indicates the importance of the issue.<br/>
One of the distinguishing features of the Bill is the powers that it gives to the Secretary of State, and this is a typical example of them. When we have argued this previously we have often been met by the argument, "But of course, the Secretary of State is a reasonable man, and his Under-Secretary of State is, if anything, an even more reasonable man." We are not to be persuaded by those arguments because, while they are reasonable men, I can think of quite a few hon. Members on the Government side of the House, and perhaps one or two right hon. Members on that side, with whom I would not trust any powers whatsoever. Therefore, the House should not rely on the reasonableness of Government in carrying out the powers which the House bequeathes to them by its legislation. The House ought to be very careful about delegating its powers in any way.<br/>
As my right hon. Friend has said, the Order concerned comes on late at night. The biggest sin about delegated legislation, however, is that we have no procedure by which such Orders can be modified. We have either to accept them or to reject them <i>in toto.</i> With an Order of this kind, one may want merely to alter part of the powers which the Secretary of State was using, but we would be unable to do that without rejecting the whole of the Order. If the House had the means whereby it could amend delegated legislation, I might take a different view of the powers being sought by the Secretary of State under these provisions, but until that time comes I must support the arguments that my right hon. Friend has used.</p>

<p>I think that in our deliberations on this particular aspect we came to the conclusion that the key word was the word "incidental". It is true, certainly for myself, that I was influenced by the right hon. Gentleman the Minister and by the Under-Secretary that that was the key word. However, when one discusses this matter in the country one realises that the key word is not "incidental", and that the key factor is the word "incidental" within the context of joint

boards. One has to draw on one's experience of joint board activities and, within a joint board, what happens to consequential items, incidental items and supplementary items.<br/>
From my own experience of joint boards between the London boroughs and the Greater London Council, and more recently from the evidence which has come to light in relation to a district council and a development corporation, I am led to believe that when a joint board is operating the key factors are not so much the elected representatives of the people. They are not, on the whole, very much in control of the actions of joint boards. On the whole, the joint boards are run very much by the officials and officers concerned. There is a great degree of difference between what an officer may consider to be consequential or, indeed, supplementary&#x2014;because it may, instead of affecting 5,000 people, affect only 10 or 15 people&#x2014;and what an elected member may consider to be incidental. There is a great area of concern here that elected representatives will not have proper control over what is going through.<br/>
Therefore, although we listened to the proposition that was put on the last occasion on which this matter came before this House, I must say that I now share the worries that their Lordships have raised. Having talked to my own people and bearing in mind their experience in the field, I now feel on balance that the powers listed in the Bill under this clause are worrying. They are still too wide, and I do not think that the reservations and assurances that we received last time are adequate in terms of protection for individual people and, indeed, in terms of protection for councillors and elected representatives in relation to looking after the interests of those they seek to represent.</p>

<p>Like my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) and my hon. Friend the Member for North Fylde (Mr. Clegg), I am not only uneasy about the suggestion that we should disagree with the Lords amendment&#x2014;indeed, I absolutely disagree with the idea that we should disagree with the Lords; I think that they are quite right&#x2014;but I am also uneasy about the whole of


Clause 2. I shall not go into that matter because I should soon be ruled out of order.<br/>
However, during our hours and hours of deliberations on this matter many of us have felt a sense of unease about the whole possibilities under the clause, by which, even after a public inquiry, it might be possible for local authorities which did not wish to take part in a joint board to be forced into one. Therefore, it is all the more likely that we shall look carefully at amendments to restrict the power of the Secretary of State. We on the Opposition side of the House will look carefully at the reasons why they should be resisted, rather than the contrary, because we feel that the Secretary of State's power is much too wide.<br/>
One of the dangers with a Bill which has been going on for as long as this one, with the enormous complications of it, is that those of us who have had the privilege of being closely concerned with it over the last six months have reached the stage of talking to ourselves. We know more or less what it is all about. The Minister and the Under-Secretary probably know more about it than we do, because they have very thick briefs and we have to think as we go along. We know more or less what it is about, but millions of people outside the House have no idea what it is about.<br/>
It needs to be stated clearly that in the form in which it went to the House of Lords for Second Reading, the Bill gave power to the Secretary of State, provided that he could get an Order through this House without it being annulled, to make
<q>such incidental, consequential, transitional or supplementary provision as appears to the Secretary of State to be necessary or expedient.</q>
In particular, it gave him power to
<q>adapt or modify any of the provisions of this Act or of any other enactment concerning the acquisition of land.</q>
I shall not follow my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby in his textual criticism of the use of the word "and", because he is a lawyer and I am not. The Under-Secretary is a lawyer, and so is my hon. Friend the Member for North Fylde, and I am not. They are all much better qualified than I am. I simply take note of my right hon. Friend's doubt as to whether the use of the conjunction

in that position is sufficiently clear to make it clear that any Order under paragraph (<i>b</i>) must be only incidental, consequential, transitional or supplementary.<br/>
I am, however, concerned about the use of the word "transitional". In what circumstances would such a transitional Order be made? "Incidental" I can understand. "Consequential" and "supplementary" I can understand. But I hope that the Minister will tell us something more about the use of the word "transitional". That seems to be a particularly important matter.<br/>
When I looked for guidance to their Lordships' House to see what exactly was meant and why the Government were resisting the amendment, I looked at the speech of the Minister in the other place, Lord Melchett&#x2014;the only person in that place whom, I think, I am allowed to quote directly, because he is a Minister. On 21st October he said, first, that
<q>Any joint board would need power to manage and dispose of land, and it might therefore be necessary to modify the 1972 Act"&#x2014;</q>
that is, the Local Government Act. I am very surprised that, if that is so, it is not in the Bill. I should have thought that this was such an obvious contingency that if a joint board of local authorities was to be set up&#x2014;and let us remember that we are talking about the possibility of local authorities either coming together voluntarily or in certain circumstances being brought together involuntarily in order to work this Bill by buying up land, and so on&#x2014;it seems fairly likely that it would need to be in a position to manage and dispose of land.<br/>
In that case, I wonder why the right hon. Gentleman has not put this in the Bill in the first place, and why he has restricted this matter to Orders, unless it be the fact that many of us have said all along that there is far too much in the Bill at the discretion of the right hon. Gentleman and far too little in the form of statute law or the law of the land.<br/>
The noble Lord went on to say,
<q>Beyond this general point, the extent to which the power&#x2026;would need to be used would depend on the precise functions and the r&#x00F4;le of a joint board. In some areas the local authorities might want a board to take on the whole function of making land available for private development. In another area the local authorities might want to continue to operate their Housing and Planning


Act powers while leaving the major job of handling land for private development to the joint board.</q>
He then went on to say:
<q>It was to provide this sort of flexibility that Clause 2(1) was drafted in terms of 'all or any' for the purposes of the Bill."&#x2014;[<i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 21st October 1975; Vol. 364, c. 1310&#x2013;11.]</q>
It must be said again that distinctions of the sort which the noble Lord drew in the passage I have just quoted raise wide possibilities for differences in the powers of joint boards. They should, therefore, be covered in the Bill and not be the subject of an Order which contains
<q>such incidental, consequential, transitional or supplementary provisions</q>
as the Secretary of State may determine. Parliament itself ought always to look most closely at matters of this kind.<br/>
No doubt the Minister will say that there is full parliamentary scrutiny, with the possibility of annulment and so on. That is so, but I remind him of what has to be done by the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments. My right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby is Chairman of that Joint Committee, in which I have had the honour to support him now for some 12 months. My right hon. Friend knows better than anyone else how many instruments are made by Ministers&#x2014;of both parties&#x2014;which then come before the Joint Committee, giving us an enormous task in sifting through them. Second, he knows how long these instruments are, and how difficult they are to understand in many cases.<br/>
There will be all sorts of complicated distinctions regarding what should be the powers of joint boards. Although my right hon. Friend is second to none in his defence of the citizen and in his careful scrutiny of Orders, a great burden will be put on the Joint Committee if it has carefully to scrutinise all these Orders and see whether they cover matters only
<q>incidental, consequential, transitional or supplementary</q>
as the Secretary of State may consider expedient.<br/>
If any Order goes beyond that, it is at once the job of my right hon. Friend and the Joint Committee to tell the House that the Minister has exceeded his powers. Although we discharge that duty to the best of our ability, it is a duty which we would sooner not have, because we should

prefer to have these things clearly stated in the Bill.<br/>
As I said earlier, the reason why we are so concerned about Clause 2 is that it has so many worrying aspects. We are concerned at the possibility that local authorities might be forced into joint boards against their will as a result of a public inquiry of which the Secretary of State himself is the ultimate arbiter. We are concerned that this might be done for political or gerrymandering reasons having nothing whatever to do with land use planning or the benefit of the citizen.<br/>
That is why we are examining these provisions most carefully and why, in our view, the other place was right to delete paragraph (<i>b</i>) from the Bill.</p>

<p>The truth is that the whole concept of joint boards under the Bill has not been thoroughly worked out, and the Government are uncertain about what changes would be required in the Bill and any other land acquisition enactments if joint boards came into being. We have been told that changes might be necessary to preserve the position of local authorities acting in their own right in the area of a joint board and to ensure that the joint board was in the same position as that of its constituent authorities. If that be right, I echo the words of my hon. Friend the Member for Melton (Mr. Latham). Why cannot such changes be spelt out in the Bill?<br/>
Without doubt, paragraph (<i>b</i>) gives the Secretary of State a sweeping power&#x2014;power to change the provisions of the Bill and of any other enactment dealing with land acquisition. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) said, it is an open-ended power since it is not limited by the words "consequential, transitional or supplementary" occurring earlier in the subsection.<br/>
Thus, the net result might well be that the powerful joint boards would be set up for specific <i>ad hoc</i> purposes. Moreover, the power given to the Secretary of State is an enormous personal power, and the House of Commons does not like allocating personal power as freely as it would be allocated under this subsection.</p>

<p>This has been a significant debate on a clause which is itself


of great significance, and I hope that the Minister will reply seriously to the points which my right hon. and hon. Friends have raised.<br/>
We on this side acknowledge that at earlier stages of the passage of the Bill the Government modified the original clause by introducing words which made clear that the Order would refer only to matters, which were incidental, consequential, transitional or supplementary provisions. I acknowledge also that my hon. Friend the Member for Hornsey (Mr. Rossi) expressed his satisfaction about that. However, the points made by my right hon. and hon. Friends today have special importance since they reflect the fact that we have had rather more time to consider the matter than we had at earlier stages.<br/>
My right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page)&#x2014;I refer to him first&#x2014;made several strong points against the clause as it stands. I pay special tribute to him. He seems to me to be a one-man Opposition in himself. [Hon. Members: "No."] Obviously, I have said something wrong about my right hon. Friend, since he certainly acts not on his own but always with our party. However, his mastery is superb and he has a wealth of learning, skill and subtlety which commands the admiration of the whole House.<br/>
Several of my hon. Friends made serious comments on the nature of delegated legislation. In our view, even if an Order establishing a joint board requires a public inquiry and the negative resolution procedure, it remains nevertheless an extraordinarily wide-ranging instrument. That has been made only too clear in our debates. We are bound to be concerned at any provision of this width which depends on delegated legislation.<br/>
At this stage, however, it is wise to bear in mind that the clause covers essential provisions in the Bill, apart from those which concern Wales. In particular it covers Part III, the part of the Bill which deals with the acquisition and disposal of development land. In other words, the clause gives to authorities and to the joint boards which we are here discussing the power, and eventually the duty, to acquire development land on a

massive scale, and compulsorily if need be.<br/>
Subsection 5(<i>b</i>), if it is not amended, will be part of the wholly fearsome apparatus brought into being by the Bill, and I wish to make clear our attitude to this entire apparatus. We are absolutely pledged to repeal the Bill. I shall not go into that at length now, but the reasons are manifold. First, it confers on local authorities and joint boards, or whatever other bodies the Government choose to employ, powers and duties which, first, are wholly irrelevant and unnecessary for good planning. Second, they are unnecessary for the recoupment of development gain. Third, they are odious in their attack on the liberty of the individual, on his right to own property and on his protection against the power of public bodies. This is especially obvious when one see the excessive use of delegated legislation here proposed. Fourth, the Bill is calculated to promote both bureaucracy and public expenditure. At the end of it all, therefore, the Bill is purely and simply a Socialist measure about land ownership, and the clause now before us is a good illustration of that.<br/>
4.30 p.m.<br/>
The fact is that local authorities already have enormous powers to acquire land compulsorily for planning purposes. There is no question about that. This measure does not give them something that they do not have already. It is a measure which they do not need except to satisfy their political lust.<br/>
The crucial phrase in the Bill comes in Clause 17, where reference is made to
<q>the desirability of bringing development land into public ownership".</q>
That we cannot accept. That is why we shall repeal this measure if it becomes an Act of Parliament. At the same time, we shall ask all those concerned&#x2014;for example, local authorities, builders, professional associations, developers and planners&#x2014;whether they feel that there are any serious limitations in the present system which prevent them from doing their job. We shall consider such representations carefully and fairly. We shall retain some means of taxing development gains.<br/>
Let me make it clear that we find this measure unacceptable. It is the worst of all the Labour Party's efforts to


approach the problem. My hon. Friends have put forward a number of highly pertinent points on the amendment, and we shall listen carefully to what the Minister has to say before we make up our minds how we shall respond.</p>

The hon. Gentleman says that this is a piece of purely Socialist land legislation. It is Socialist legislation and I am proud of it. I think that the hon.

<p>Certainly, Mr. Deputy Speaker. That is why I did not intend to be tempted to stray further by the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Budgen).<br/>
As the hon. Member for Aylesbury has said, we introduced amendments on Report and made it clear that the powers we sought for joint boards were subsidiary powers. As he rightly said, his hon.

<p>It has been stated that I expressed satisfaction at the way in

which the matter was dealt with on Report. However, I was teased by name in another place for having taken a different view from that taken by some of their Lordships. The Minister is now doing very much the same thing. If he looks at the record carefully, he will see that the words I used in relation to his amendment were that in so far as the amendment proposed by the Government appeared to meet the concessions we had asked for in Committee, I was content. I went no further than that.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman will recall that on Report we had many amendments thrown at us as we have had today, and we had little time to give them consideration. Throughout these proceedings I shall be entering the same <i>caveat.</i> Amendments may be thrown at us which appear to be all right, but we have had no time to study them. The explanations that are offered may sound facile and acceptable, but on studying the amendments we may find that we disagree. That is what has happened to this amendment. On further consideration we find that the concession was not given to the extent we requested. Even though I may have expressed qualified satisfaction on an earlier occasion, I shall have to support my right hon. and hon. Friends on this occasion if they decide to declare their dissatisfaction.</p>

<p>I was not trying to tease the hon. Gentleman. There are times when friendly teasing takes place between us, but on this occasion that was not my intention. I thought the House felt that as a result of the amendments we introduced on Report there was a general acceptance, on both sides of the House, that there were limitations on the power of the Secretary of State in introducing modifications for a purely subsidiary r&#x00F4;le. The subsidiary r&#x00F4;le was spelt out in the amendments that were dealt with on Report.<br/>
I believe that their Lordships have totally misinterpreted the situation. Had they followed on from the debate that took place in this House and introduced specific amendments, I could have followed their reasoning. Of course, we may have disagreed with their Amendments. I believe that they have misdirected themselves and failed to understand the position that the House had reached on Report.<br/>
The hon. Member for Hornsey has said that the Opposition has never had the opportunity to consider the amendments. From an Opposition that cannot consider the amendments we have had some very good speeches. For hon. Members who cannot understand the amendments and who have had no opportunity to study them, they have made good speeches.<br/>
I repeat that the powers of the Secretary of State in the narrow sphere of joint boards are subsidiary powers. If I may tease the right hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Page), by way of contrast the Local Government Act 1972 in Section 254(2) gives the Secretary of State power by order
<q>for applying&#x2026;or amending, repealing, or revoking&#x2026;any provision of an Act passed&#x2026;before 1st April 1974".</q>
The drafting in that Act was somewhat similar except that the powers given to the Secretary of State, on the face of it, would be far more Draconian. I am not saying that the right hon. Gentleman was trying to give Draconian powers to a Secretary of State. Similarly, that is not our intention. I repeat that we have made it clear in the House that these are subsidiary powers.</p>

<p>I would say that the paragraphs in the 1972 Act go much wider. The definition that we are considering severely limits such powers.<br/>
I continue with the reason for our needing the clause in its present form. The hon. Member for Melton (Mr. Latham) asked about the meaning of "transitional". Perhaps an example provides the best explanation. Transitional provision may be necessary where authorities are currently considering whether to serve a notice of intention to acquire following a planning application. It may be appropriate in those circumstances to allow the authorities to continue dealing with the case, notwithstanding the formation of a joint board. No sinister interpretation should be given to "transitional".<br/>
The hon. Member for Conway (Mr. Roberts) made an interesting intervention because there are similar powers in regard to Wales. If the paragraph were to be removed, there would be no way of enabling the constituent authorities to retain power under the Bill. We need the provision to enable constituent authorities to have some powers under the Bill, in the same way as local authorities in Wales have power to make land available for development despite the fact that the land authority there will be the Land Authority for Wales. There is a parallel here between the constituent local authority and the powers of a joint board. I thought that we were in accord on these matters when we dealt with them in this House on Report. Therefore, I hope that with this further explanation I have now fully satisfied the Opposition.</p>

<p>Will the Minister comment on a point raised by my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) and, indeed, by me&#x2014;namely, whether he is satisfied with the wording in line 21 and with the fact that the phrase "and in particular" is sufficiently precise to make sure that subsection (5) and modifications flowing from it can be only
<q>incidental, consequential, transitional or supplementary'?</q>
I should not like to set up my drafting expertise against the Minister's, but if my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby is worried about the provision, I am too.</p>

<p>It is right that Oppositions should delve suspiciously into any provision, because that is what Oppositions are for, but it appears that sinister hidden meanings are being seen in every word in the provision. It is a narrow provision dealing with the appointment of joint boards and also with the restricted powers of the Secretary of State to modify legislation in relation to joint boards.<br/>
The hon. Member for Northampton, South (Mr. Morris) spoke of development corporations and joint boards. In subsection (2) we are dealing with elected members of boards. In regard to planning matters dealt with in the Local Government Act 1972, one-third of such members are to be appointed by the Secretary of State. At least within the provisions


of subsection (2) we are dealing with democratically-elected members.<br/>
I hope I have dealt with all the points that arise on this provision. It contains nothing sinister, despite what appears to have been implied by their Lordships, who seek to delete these words. I emphasise that the situation is exactly as it was when the Bill was dealt with in this House on Report, and that at that time hon. Members found the situation satisfactory. I hope that the House, having heard a full explanation of the situation, will agree to disagree with the Lords amendment.</p>

<p>The effect of the amendments would be to remove the building of a single dwelling-house from excepted development under Clause 3(1)(<i>b</i>) and place it in exempt development in the First Schedule.<br/>
There are two strong objections to this approach. The first is that there might be circumstances where it would be right for an authority to buy land for the building of a single house. By putting the building of a single house into "excepted development" we have recognised that such cases would inevitably be rare, but I can think of a case where the authority might want to build a single house&#x2014;for example, for a park keeper or a local authority worker. However, equally within the terms of the land scheme if there are such cases an authority should have the power to buy the land for such development. In previous legislation&#x2014;for example, the Housing Acts&#x2014;local authorities already have powers to buy land for single houses.

Therefore, I cannot see what possible objection there can be to bringing this development within the scope of the new acquisition powers.<br/>
The second objection is that the amendment will have a much wider effect on the operation of compulsory purchase powers. Let us suppose that an authority proposed to buy an area of land for the erection of 100 or 150 houses. If these amendments were accepted, it is conceivable that the <i>vires</i> of the compulsory purchase order could be challenged on the basis that what was proposed was the building of 100 or 150 single houses and that each house should be regarded as exempt development. I do not regard that as a realistic approach to the situation, but it is a possible approach.<br/>
What is more possible is that the owner of a single plot in the middle of such an area might be able to challenge the order on the basis that the plot is suitable for exempt development and that he intended to carry out such development by building a single house. I do not think the second challenge is likely to arise in practice because I assume, as a practitioner of law and an officer of the courts that the court would take a reasonable view of what Parliament intended to do in this legislation. I also believe that the courts will not accept as a general rule that the fact that the land was suitable for exempt development as well as for other development would take it outside the acquisition power&#x2014;otherwise, all agricultural land would be outside the power because it would be suitable for development within paragraph 2 of Schedule 1. Therefore, to include some housing developments as exempt developments could, from a practical point of view, introduce uncertainty into the exercise of the acquisition power.<br/>
The Government are not prepared to run that risk, especially as the case for including such housing within exempt development is so weak, and we believe that the matter would already fall within the existing powers in the Housing Acts.</p>

<p>I listened with interest to the Minister's explanation. The Bill has an amoeba-like quality. It constantly changes shape and its clauses appear and disappear, jargon is spawned one moment and recycled the next.<br/>
In the earlier days following the White Paper certain single plots were to be exempted. In other words, plots held by people on "White Paper day" were to be exempted from the operation of the Bill. However, following Government amendments the matter appears to have been widened in one sense since they brought all single plots into the Bill, but this has acted to the detriment of the man whose land was exempted in the White Paper. One merit of the Lords amendment is that it places those people back into the position in which they were.<br/>
The amendment sets out to exempt the single plot by putting it in Schedule 1. That, I understand, takes it out of the operation of Clauses 15 and 25. Clause 15, which covers the powers of acquisition, excludes any development specified in Schedule 1, and the Lords amendment has the effect of including the single plot in that schedule. We are concerned that it should be included in the schedule to do justice to the people who originally though that they would be exempted, and there appears to be a strange difference between "exemption" and "exception".<br/>
Clause 25 deals with assumptions as to planning permission on or after the second appointed day. After the second appointed day, any land which is not covered by the exemptions in Schedule I can be bought at current use value. If the single plot were included in the schedule and exempted thereby it could be bought by the State at current use value plus the value of the planning permission to develop it as a single plot.<br/>
That was the position of the owner of a plot on White Paper day. Now, his position has been materially changed. A person who owned a plot would, after the second appointed day, have received market value compensation under the White Paper. Under the Lords amendment he would not get market value compensation but current use value, and there could be a difference in value between those two figures.</p>

<p>We shall be a right bunch of cherry pickers before we have finished. I turn from cherries to the mutton of the argument. Those who say that single plots should be exempted have a good argument in the general sense of equity. I do not dispute that it is a major exemption from the Bill, but it will make the operation of the Bill more practicable. People with single plots will he able to develop them more easily if they are exempt.<br/>
The Minister said&#x2014;I have no doubt that he is right because the same argument was used by the Lord Chancellor&#x2014;that local authorities have considerable powers under other legislation to purchase single plots, and they might need to. But that argument cannot be fully applied to the powers given under the Bill which are blanket powers for more specific purposes.<br/>
The Minister used the illustration of a local authority which wanted to build a cottage for a park keeper. There are others who say that a local authority might want to build a house for a town clerk or another official. That might not be greeted with so much enthusiasm. Local authorities would have power to do that, and to do it without justification.<br/>
For those reasons the House should not disagree with the amendment but should vote to keep the single plot exempted, as was the original intention of the White Paper. We are asking the right hon. Gentleman to go further than the concession which has already been given by him. We are asking him to do the job thoroughly by putting the single plot into Schedule 1.</p>

<p>In speaking to an earlier amendment I said that we were in danger of talking to ourselves because we have lived with the Bill for so long. On this amendment, which is so important, it is essential not only for those who have lived with the Bill but for the people in the Press, who have the unenviable task of trying to report our deliberations, to know what we are talking about. It is


also important that those in places to which I am not allowed to refer who may be listening to the debate should know what we are talking about. We are talking about the word "exempt" which, throughout our discussions on the Bill during the past six months, has changed its meaning.<br/>
In the White Paper which appeared 14 months ago, just before the General Election&#x2014;it was published for the purposes of the General Election, not for the good of the people&#x2014;the proposal was that persons with dwelling-houses in a certain category should be exempt from the Bill. To avoid using the term of art "exempt" I shall say that the intention was that those persons should be completely outside the scheme. The local authority would not be able to acquire the land of persons who had dwelling-houses of a certain sort either under its general powers to do so between the first and second appointed days or under its specific duty to do so after the second appointed day.<br/>
That was a very limited concession. It was limited to "uncles, cousins and aunts", in the words of W. S. Gilbert, that is to say, to people who on White Paper day were building a house either for themselves or for certain named relatives.<br/>
There were two nightmare clauses, Clauses 4 and 5, which we discussed at great length in Committee, and to understand them one needed to be a positive Solon. All the different forms of relationships were involved. I remember that at one stage my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Budgen) and I queried whether in areas where Pakistanis and Indians were numerous the family concession was sufficient because of the family pattern of Pakistanis and Indians.<br/>
On Report the Government brought forward a new proposal. They produced a new schedule of exempt development. Although I have lived with the Bill for so long, I do not know much about it because it changes every week, but I understand that the present position is that exempt development will be outside the scope of the Bill. It will require a new Act of Parliament to get rid of Schedule 1, which contains the limited categories outside the acquisition powers.<br/>
Exempted development is a non-statutory exercise. Concessions were made by the Government. I refer, for example, to the building of houses on land of up to 10,000 square feet. Special concessions are to be made on an extra-statutory basis by means of regulations that we have not yet seen. Their Lordships rightly took the view that the scope of Schedule 1 was limited. The Opposition's attitude is simple. We believe that the Government should carry out their election pledges. People living in owner-occupied houses should not have their land compulsorily acquired from them by the local authority. That is what the Government promised the people. That promise was in the White Paper and the manifesto. It is not unreasonable to ask the Government to carry out that election pledge.<br/>
5.0 p.m.<br/>
Their Lordships seized on the Minister's concession. They said that the Minister had at last admitted that the powers of the Bill were too wide. It is not enough just to state that certain matters may be exempted by regulation made by the Secretary of State. On Report the Secretary of State produced proposals to be included in the Bill rather than the nightmare Clauses 4, 5 and 10, to give exemption to some categories of development. Their Lordships said "The Minister has seen the light. He has exempted some categories. What could be better than now to give him the chance to honour his election pledges? We shall insert into that exempt category an amendment." However, the Minister said "No, I am not in a position to keep my election pledges. That might lead to abuse." The Minister painted a fantastic picture. He and I are good friends. We have always got on very well.</p>

<p>The Minister said that the Government must resist the Lords amendment as otherwise speculators, developers, profiteers and other wicked men would be able to break up large sites into 100 plots and to obtain 100 different exemptions.<br/>
I work in the building industry. It is often said that people using land look for mistakes and for means of evading legislation in Bills dealing with complex matters. From time to time I lecture to


builders about the workings of the Bill. I am obliged to re-write my lecture every week or so when the Government amend the legislation. Builders ask me the question that the Minister posed to the House&#x2014;"Is there any way by which we can obtain individual plot exemptions?" I reply "No, that is not possible under the Bill, even with the Lords amendment." That amendment is not susceptible of the interpretation that the Minister has placed on it. Even if the Minister were right, it is not beyond the bounds of possibility for the right hon. Gentleman to put down an amendment to the Lords amendment, as he has to Lords Amendment No. 13.<br/>
The Minister could have said "I agree that the Government must keep their election pledges to the effect that owner-occupied houses and single plots should come outside the duties and the powers of the Bill. But I am worried that the odd person may make a quick buck if I am not careful. Therefore, I shall put down an amendment stating that for the avoidance of doubt the provision shall not be taken as meaning that estates can be broken up." It is not beyond the resources of the Minister to draft such an amendment. I go further. If it is beyond the resources of the Minister, he can ask my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page), who would be delighted to draft the legislation for him and who would do a good job.<br/>
This is the most important of the Lords amendments. Their Lordships made it for the reasonable purpose of asking the Government to keep their election pledges. I am not the custodian of the Labour Party manifesto. However, if the Minister is the custodian, all he has to do is to agree with the amendment.</p>

<p>I support what was said by my hon. Friend the Member for Melton (Mr. Latham). The Minister said that there were two factors which caused the Government's reaction against the Lords amendment. The first was that the local authorities already had powers under the existing housing legislation. We accept that. Surely the Minister accepted that those powers existed when the White Paper was drawn up.<br/>
The Minister is on slippery ground. The White Paper, which was published before the last General Election, aroused

excitement in my constituency. Section VII referred to "Permanent Exemptions from Acquisition". Great play was made with the word "permanent". Paragraph 34 said
<q>The Government propose to exclude from the scheme the building of a house for owner-occupation on a single plot which was owned by the prospective owner-occupier on the date of this White Paper (12th September 1974).</q>
In normal circumstances that could be regarded as a firm pledge. Indeed, a garbled version of it was repeated in the Labour Party manifesto. People in the marginal constituencies may have been influenced by those words in the manifesto. They may have acted upon that White Paper. It would not be proper to go back on those words.<br/>
The Minister attempted, by means of the wording of the exception, to tidy up the Bill and to remove the complicated dimensions of the extended family relationship and the other doubtful points that we debated in Committee. The Government issued a White Paper in September and produced a Bill the following March. They took another four or five months to make this change. Therefore, they run the risk of being accused of misleading the people. It is the r&#x00F4;le of the Opposition to point out that the Minister has misled the public. I do not think that that is stretching the position too far.<br/>
This afternoon the Minister has a chance to think again, to accept that he misled the public and to say that their Lordships acted wisely, for they have had time in which to reflect on these changes and to put the matter in its true perspective. I do not think that it is too much to ask the Minister to admit that he has misled the public. That is the last thing he would want to do. He is an honourable man. Therefore, he should accept the amendment.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1975-11-11a.1172.0" hansard_membership_id="7399" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/20359" speakername="Mr. Tim Sainsbury" colnum="1172" time="">
<p>We should not spend too long discussing whether people should base their actions on a programme which was set out in the Labour Party manifesto but which has not been published with the <i>imprimatur</i> of the Government and the authority which should go with a White Paper. It is important that we should refer to the contents of the White Paper. If there had been a more enlightened reaction by the electorate to the situation in which the country found itself over a year ago,


we should not have to worry now. However, we can assume that after an election a Government attach some authority to their own publications<br/>
The Minister did not deny that the intention, which was set out in non-statutory language in the White Paper, was to give exemption to the person wishing to develop a single plot. It was read in that way in the Press, whatever was said in the Cabinet, and that served to reinforce that assumption.<br/>
The problem that the right hon. Gentleman found himself facing was whether, as a result of the omission of Clauses 4 and 5, the exemption would be slightly widened or somewhat restricted in practice. We are reminded of the nightmare of trying to follow the debate as clauses change their meaning. Searching through the reports of what happened in Committee one finds that the debate took place on 10th June and that we were discussing the matter at about mid-day on 11th June. This adds an extra dimension to the nightmare quality, as it was by then my birthday, and I could not have been more beneficially employed than in pleading the case of the single plot.<br/>
With the leaving out of Clauses 4 and 5, on which we spent so many happy morning hours, the question is whether we widen the exemption a little or restrict it. As my hon. Friend the Member for Melton (Mr. Latham) pointed out, if the right hon. Gentleman thinks that by widening it a little there is a small risk that some person might be able, by arranging his affairs in an unnatural way, to seek to take some advantage, surely that could be prevented by an appropriately worded amendment, or perhaps by some other measure.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman referred to the Government or local authorities needing on occasions to develop single houses. I know that he would not deny that the Government have powers under other legislation to acquire land, subject to all the appropriate safeguards of inquiry and the Secretary of State's approval. They might use those powers, or try to buy the necessary land by agreement, if they did not already own some land on which to carry out the development.<br/>
The Lords amendment quite rightly gives priority to ensuring that the undertaking contained in the White Paper is

carried out. The impression that was spread abroad was that the developer of the single plot would be exempt&#x2014;totally outside the provisions of the Bill. I do not think that a case has been made out for rejecting the Lords amendment. The small disadvantages could be dealt with in other ways. I therefore support my hon. Friends in saying that the Lords amendments ought not to be rejected.</p>

<p>I suppose that as I own a house with an acre plot beside it, I ought to declare an interest.<br/>
As has been said, those hon. Members who were on the Committee are, in a sense, talking to themselves. I do not have that benefit, because I was involved with other Bills at the time. It ought to be pointed out that the clause is very much against the Labour Party's manifesto, so that it is surprising that the House is not being urged to reject it on that ground. Looking around the Chamber, one finds that there are no Liberals here, no Ulster Nationalists, and only a few members of the minority party, so that we have not a sporting chance.<br/>
The Minister started by saying that the clause was not necessary because he was able to take over or to buy a house under his other powers. He says that he does not need the clause, but it appears that he wants to have it. Why does he want it? Why is he resisting the amendment? As I see it, the amendment to the Lords amendment would give him the right to purchase property below its market value and to confiscate property. I suppose that he will press it through the House as a further confiscation measure, and that is why we must resist it.</p>

<p>There is only one major point that I need to answer. The others relate to differences that have emerged&#x2014;if I may say so, Mr. Deputy Speaker, without being taken to task&#x2014;from a course that we have cantered round many times before.<br/>
The affection in which the hon. Member for Melton (Mr. Latham) holds me is more than reciprocated, in the politest, most political way, but I felt that there were two contentions that he put to us that stretched credulity beyond all imagining. One is that I am responsible for the changes in the Bill during the past few weeks. I can assure him that I should have been delighted if the changes


that we have been debating, and will be debating all through the night, had not been made. It is a little too late for him now to influence his noble Friends.<br/>
When he offers me the prospect of their Lordships' House as the custodians and guardians of the Labour Party manifesto, as his noble Friends did, that, too, stretches credulity to the ninth degree. I agree on this occasion with the hon. Member for Hove (Mr. Sainsbury)&#x2014;with whom I rarely agree&#x2014;that it is to the White Paper that we should look as the only begetter, in a parliamentary sense, of the Bill. It is perfectly true, as the hon. Member for Melton and the hon. Member for Northampton, South (Mr. Morris) pointed out, that the White Paper refers to the building of a single house. The paragraphs in question are 34 and 35.<br/>
I should like to read a little more of the White Paper than the hon. Member for Northampton, South chose to read. I noticed a slight glottal hesitation when he reached the word "acquisition" because, of course, he had seen the words following. Paragraph 34 begins:
<q>The Government propose to exclude from the scheme&#x2026;".</q>
Then paragraph 35 reads:
<q>Other permanent exemptions from acquisition under the scheme will be set out in due course&#x2026;".</q>
It is paragraph 26 that deals with compulsory acquisition. In that paragraph it is very fairly stated that:
<q>Local authorities also buy some land for private development under powers in the Housing and Planning Acts. Local authorities, however, should be enabled to do much more positive and comprehensive planning through ownership; and for this purpose they will be given new and very much wider powers to acquire land for development.</q>
What we are really talking about is the scope under the scheme and the scope of the acquisition power.<br/>
Hon. Gentlemen opposite have not read right to the end of paragraph 35 of the White Paper. I understand that it is because they are out to make, as they believe, a good, solid electoral point, but it is not as solid as they think. The words in paragraph 35 cover not just the single house, the single dwelling. Let us read it a little further:
<q>buildings used in agriculture and forestry; and development related to the extraction of minerals.</q>

Two lines later it says:
<q>the exemptions will also take account of the need not to constrain important industrial development and expansion.</q>
Paragraph 35, with one or two small exceptions, is basically talking about what became the excepted development and was always intended to be.</p>

<p>Is the right hon. Gentleman seriously trying to persuade the House that the specific concessions announced in paragraphs 34 and 35&#x2014;particularly paragraph 34&#x2014;were to be treated as being qualified by the general remarks in paragraph 26? There is nothing in the Labour Party manifesto about that.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1975-11-11a.1176.1" hansard_membership_id="10169" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/20635" speakername="Mr. Silkin" colnum="1176" time="">
<p>The hon. Gentleman must have been enormously tired while we were cantering round that course, because we have dealt with it over and over again in Committee and on Report. There is a difference between a global scheme and the individual situation within it.<br/>
What one is saying, therefore, is that outside the general scheme, outside the scope of the scheme, is the individual plot, but an individual plot might be in the middle of a huge circle to be developed. Common sense would dictate to the hon. Gentleman that that must be so, and that that must have been in our minds at the time of the presentation of the White Paper. Incidentally, I take it, on behalf of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and myself, as one of the nicest compliments ever paid to us that we won the last election on the White Paper on Land.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1975-11-11a.1176.2" hansard_membership_id="7595" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/30476" speakername="Mr. Michael Latham" colnum="1176" time="">
<p>Now what the right hon. Gentleman is saying is that, in normal circumstances, owner-occupiers or plot owners are to be treated as exempted, but when it is a local authority it will no longer be exempted. There was nothing in the manifesto about that.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1975-11-11a.1176.3" hansard_membership_id="10169" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/20635" speakername="Mr. Silkin" colnum="1176" time="">
<p>I have said over and over again that of course there may be global development that will inevitably override. That is the whole point. The point of public ownership of development land is precisely that we must plan properly. But in the normal course of events the building of a single house is outside the scope of the scheme. Of course it is not outside the compulsory


acquisition power. It never was. It was not under the Tory Government or under the Liberal Party when it was in office. It has not been for 100 years.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1975-11-11a.1177.0" hansard_membership_id="9530" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/30511" speakername="Mr. Michael Morris" colnum="1177" time="">
<p>But the White Paper says in black and white, "Permanent exemptions from acquisitions". That is in Section VII. It is not in Section V. If it came under Section V, it would be acceptable, but it comes under "permanent exemptions".</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1975-11-11a.1177.1" hansard_membership_id="10169" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/20635" speakername="Mr. Silkin" colnum="1177" time="">
<p>The hon. Gentleman must read something beyond headlines. He must read what they relate to as well. Paragraph 35 says:
<q>Other permanent exemptions from acquisition under the scheme will be set out in due course but they will include&#x2026;".</q>
The hon Gentleman has not made the point about, for example, minerals being exempted, but that is also under paragraph 35.</p>

<p>These amendments arose from the point raised in the Lords in Committee, when Lord Sandford questioned whether paragraph 1 of Schedule 1, as originally drafted, covered the case of development which would normally be permitted under the general development order, but where, for special reasons, an Article 4 direction had been made requiring express planning permission to be applied for in respect of that development. It was always intended that in such cases the development should remain within exempt development.<br/>
But the original drafting did not achieve this. The present amendments remedy the defect, and ensure that the definition of exempt development remains the same in all areas even if there are Article 4 directions in force in some.</p>

<p>I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that explanation and also for meeting the point raised by my noble


Friend in the House of Lords. Can the hon. Gentleman enlighten the House by explaining what is an Article 4 direction? It is nothing within the contemplation of this Bill and must therefore emanate from other legislation. For the purpose of the record, it would assist the explanation if it could be defined.</p>

<p>Will the hon. Gentleman personally supervise the reprinting of this paragraph? Since we have inserted two paragraphs, (<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>), in line 5, which contains the words "which is carried out," I would suggest that a fresh line should be begun there so that those words qualify both paragraphs. If the printing is not altered, it will look as though the last few words qualify only the new paragraph (<i>b</i>), whereas I believe that they will qualify both paragraphs. I am sorry to be pedantic about the printing, but this is something that will assist those who have to put this measure into operation.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1975-11-11a.1183.1" hansard_membership_id="11129" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/19091" speakername="Mr. Oakes" colnum="1183" time="">
<p>I will certainly look at that point. It is essential that a measure such as this should be correctly drafted and easily understood. I am certain that we shall eventually achieve that. I take note of what the right hon. Gentleman has said.<br/>
An Article 4 direction is made very rarely. It is made by the Secretary of State to exempt from a general development order a particular development in an area because of the nature of the development. Since becoming a Minister, I can recall only one. It related to agricultural development. It was in an area where development was taking place as very marginal agricultural development to such an extent that it altered the planning conditions of the area. An Article 4 direction was made in that case.<br/>
The amendment cures a defect in the original Bill. It was always intended that the development should remain within exempt development. If an Article 4 direction were made in some areas, as the Bill stood it could come out of that category. The amendment cures that defect and ensures that the definition of "exempt development" remains the same in all areas even if an Article 4 direction is in force in one of those areas.</p>

<p>I beg to move, That this House doth agree with the Lords in the said amendment.<br/>
The amendment deletes the restriction on the definition of "agriculture or forestry" in paragraph 2 of Schedule I which excludes from "exempt development"
<q>operations for the erection, improvement or alteration of buildings used for the purposes of market gardens, nursery grounds or timber yards or for other purposes not connected with general farming operations or with the cultivation or felling of trees".</q>
The problem of horticultural buildings was raised in Committee in some detail by the hon. Member for Buckingham (Mr. Benyon), and he returned to the matter later on Report. I agreed to look at whether we had the exception right in its new context.<br/>
The Opposition returned to the point in another place and carried this amendment deleting the restriction on paragraph 2 of Schedule 1 and thus bringing horticultural buildings within exempt development. This change is acceptable to the Government so far as its effect on the scope of the acquisition power is concerned. They were, however, bound to resist the amendment as originally presented because it would also have brought the value of the ability to erect horticultural buildings within the definition of current use value in Clause 25. However, in the other place the Opposition themselves recognised that the current use value implications were unacceptable, for they brought forward an amendment to Clause 25 which would have the effect of restricting the current use value implications of Schedule 1 to paragraph 1, which deals with GDO development alone. On this basis, the amendment to paragraph 2 of Schedule 1 is acceptable, and the Government are prepared to accept it.<br/>
At the end of the day, therefore, though it has taken the hon. Member for Buckingham a long time, he has won the principle of his argument.</p>

<p>I cannot refrain from thanking the Minister for this sensible solution. I recall that


on Report there was a long and inconclusive discussion on this subject between the Minister and the hon. Member for the Isle of Wight (Mr. Ross). In the other place, their Lordships got to the heart of the matter to a much greater degree. I am sure that this outcome will be greatly welcomed by the farming community.</p>

<p>I cannot understand why the hon. Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Mr. Costain) is missing from the Chamber at this very important moment.<br/>
I welcome the Government's decision, though perhaps I may be allowed to ask the Minister one question. I presume that glasshouses in excess of 10,000 sq.ft. will come under this Bill and into the definition of "exempt development". However, I presume also that they will still come under the planning requirements and have to go through the normal planning controls, even though they are exempted under this clause. This was a point which I raised on Report. I do not know that it has ever been answered. However, I have no wish to be awkward at a moment when the Government are</p>

<p>The Government ask the House to agree with the Lords in Amendments Nos. 92, 148, 150, 151, and 153, and to disagree with Lords Amendment 154. We also ask the House to agree with the Lords in Amendments Nos. 149 and 152, subject to modifications.<br/>
The House will recall that on 15th July I made a statement in Committee describing the special provisions that the Government would be making for Church and charity land in the context of the land scheme. Two of the four main provisions I then announced were introduced and accepted on Report. The third the Government sought to provide in another place. The fourth, relating to development land tax, will of course be presented in the Development Land Tax Bill.<br/>
I think that it will be convenient for the House if I restate what these provisions are, including extensions of them that the Government have still decided to make, and then to explain why the Government cannot accept the very wide changes made in another place in these contexts.<br/>
First, the acquisition duty and the consequential suspension of planning permission will not apply to land owned by any charity on White Paper day for any kind of development. This will cover the situation where a mixed development is proposed&#x2014;for example, on a city centre site&#x2014;and where the charity is dependent on realising the commercial value of the site in order to fund that part of the development which is intended for its use. The powers of acquisition will of course apply to charity land just like any other land, as they do under existing legislation, but the Secretary of State will not expect to confirm any compulsory purchase orders for such land unless there are special planning reasons for doing so.<br/>
Second, when authorities acquire such charity land the valuation basis will continue to be market value for 11 years or until the second appointed day, whichever period ends later. This has been extended from 10 years from 12th September 1974 in order to take account of the year that has elapsed since the publication of the White Paper.<br/>
Third, after that time they will get prevailing use value for land acquired&#x2014;in perpetuity. Prevailing use value will also apply to land that came into their ownership after White Paper day so long as it has been kept in continuous charity ownership and use for a certain period. This period I originally announced as 10 years but, following discussions of the point in our debates and those in another place, the Government have decided that

a seven-year period should be sufficient and this is what is now proposed.<br/>
Moreover, the earlier requirement that there should be a building on such land which should have been in charitable use for 10 years has now been removed and the provision will now apply to the relevant charitable land. This I believe is a really important further relaxation.<br/>
Fourth, development land tax will never be charged on any development or disposal of land owned by a charity on White Paper-day.<br/>
These are the main special provisions, but the Government are also providing a number of others which will be of significant benefit to charities. Some are unique to them, and some will also apply to other kinds of landowner. They are as follows.<br/>
First, authorities will be required by statute to have regard to the needs of charities in exercising their functions. That is the effect of Lords Amendment No. 92. Second, the special provisions referred to will apply even though the land changes hands directly from one charity to another.<br/>
Third, in the case of direct testamentary bequests of land to charities, the date when the ownership transfers to them will be the date of the death of the owner and not the later date of the conveyance. Fourth, in other cases the time will be the date when the charity enters into a binding contract to acquire the land.<br/>
Fifth, when a Church acquires land for a place of religious worship, it will be able to do so freehold. This will be provided for in the arrangements for general consents under Clause 41. Sixth, under the excepted development regulations, development of under 10,000 sq.ft. total floor space will be permanently exempted from the acquisition duty.<br/>
I now turn to Lords Amendments Nos. 13, 149, 152 and 154, which were carried against the Government's advice in another place. For reasons which I shall explain, I must ask the House not to accept Lords Amendments Nos. 152 and 154 altogether, and not to accept Lords Amendments Nos. 13 and 149 in their present form.<br/>
First, perhaps I should tell the House that there is another slight mathematical


error. On the supplementary sheet of the Order Paper concerning Lords Amendment No. 149, "Line 6," should read "Line 7".<br/>
The amendments consist of two major extensions. First, they would provide that all charity land, irrespective of when it came into the ownership of the charity, would be exempt from the application of the acquisition duty on authorities and the consequential suspension of planning permission. That is the effect of Lords Amendment No. 13. Secondly, they would provide that when authorities acquired their land, charities would always get market value for it for evermore.<br/>
Moreover, after the second appointed day, or after 11 years&#x2014;whichever is the later date&#x2014;charities would get either market value or prevailing use value, even where the latter might result in compensation greater than market value itself would provide. Not only that, but it would enable the Churches and charities on occasion to receive compensation beyond what they would be able to get now under the existing compensation code, which was introduced by the previous administration. That is the effect of Lords Amendments Nos. 152 and 154.<br/>
This is a proposition that I cannot believe that even Conservative Members would accept. Certainly such overreaching is quite unacceptable to Labour Members.<br/>
The final important change made in another place is the reduction of the period for land acquired by a charity after White Paper day to qualify for prevailing use value treatment from 10 years to one year. This would open the door to abuse whatever the good intentions of the sponsors might be. However, the Government have looked at the matter in as positive a way as possible and they are prepared to bring the qualifying period down to seven years.<br/>
These changes in another place are unquestionably in conflict with the Government's basic aims in making special provisions for Churches and charities which, as has been made clear throughout the deliberations on this Bill, must be consistent with the principles of the land scheme. These aims, I need hardly remind the House, were clearly set out in the White Paper, and since hon. Gentle

men were at pains to quote the White Paper&#x2014;if not as extensively as I should like&#x2014;in a previous debate, perhaps I may quote it in full on this occasion. The aims are
<q>to establish a permanent means:
<ul>
<li>"(<i>a</i>) to enable the community to control the development of land in accordance with its needs and priorities; and</li>
<li>(<i>b</i>) to restore to the community the increase in value of land arising from its efforts."</li>
</ul></q>
A great deal has been said in both this House and another place about the effects that the community land scheme will have on the work of the Churches and charities in this country. It has always been the Government's intention to help the charities to make the transition to the new system. The House will realise from my description of all that we intend to provide for charities that they will in most cases be assisted to an exceptional degree so that they can continue their charitable activities. We are simply ensuring that they, like everyone else, will be able to operate in the knowledge that development land is to be controlled by the community. There can be no getting away from that.<br/>
I must therefore ask the House to accept Lords Amendments Nos. 148, 150, 151 and 153&#x2014;which are paving and minor drafting amendments and do not in themselves affect the charity provisions&#x2014;and also to accept Lords Amendment No. 92. However, I ask the House to disagree altogether with Lords Amendment No. 154, and Lords Amendments Nos. 13, 149 and 152 in their present form, but to agree to the Government's amendments in their place.</p>

<p>I suspect that the reaction of the Churches and charities to the Minister's words
<q>assisted to an exceptional degree</q>
will not be favourable. I accept that we have come a long way since 12th September last year and the White Paper, when the present Labour Government and especially the right hon. Gentleman, had forgotten all about the r&#x00F4;le of the Churches and charities, the work they do and their relationship to land. We have reached the situation where I suspect that this is the biggest thorn in the Government's side.<br/>
It is worth reflecting for a few moments on the path which the Churches and charities have trod concerning the Bill and how


we come now to consider this large number of important amendments. The Churches and charities were amazed to find that they were left out of the White Paper, but they assumed that when the Bill was presented they would be exempt. In fact they quickly discovered that, far from being exempt, their own work was to be made impossible by the Bill as it then stood and that it would impoverish and impede their work, which, I am sure, is recognised on both sides of the House. They made representations to none other than the Prime Minister, who spared an hour of his time for representations from no less figures than the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Cardinal Archbishop of Westminster, the Chief Rabbi, the Moderator of the Church of Scotland and the representative of the Archbishop of Wales.<br/>
6.0 p.m.<br/>
In the early Committe stage the Churches and charities had expected a categorical statement by the Government that, as other parties were beginning to be exempt from the provisions of the Bill, they also would be considered exempt. We had to wait until the very end of the Committee stage. Halfway through the Committee proceedings the Undersecretary of State mentioned that some charities&#x2014;lucky devils&#x2014;would be put into a special category, but others clearly would not. However, that morning it was made clear that it was to be all charities.</p>

<p>Not that morning. I am grateful to my hon. Friend for pointing that out. It was a few mornings later. We had to wait until 15th July for any form of substantive indication about the detailed situation regarding charities. Then, as the Churches and charities had time to reflect on those considerations during the summer months, they began to see that what the right hon. Gentleman was offering was woefully and wholly unsatisfactory.<br/>
Indeed, we come to the early autumn. I believe that the right hon. Gentleman met representatives from the National Council of Social Service and the Churches who were trying to find out how far the Minister would extend exemption and how the interpretation of certain

words would affect Churches and charities. There was a further meeting on 17th October. The surprising thing was that, despite these meetings&#x2014;in fact, as the Lords went into Committee&#x2014;their Lordships themselves were unclear about the Government's concessions. Indeed their Lordships, at the behest of the Minister in another place, recommitted the Bill.<br/>
At that point the Churches and charities wanted a clear definition of what their "own use" was. The right hon. Gentleman has given some clarification this afternoon, but I hope he will repeat and clarify exactly what "own use" means.<br/>
The Churches and charities sought a clear definition of the word "curtilage' as it affected them. They put to the right hon. Gentleman substantive reasons why one year was more than adequate for a continuation of use. I find it extremely worrying that the right hon. Gentleman should impugn the good work of charities and Churches by suggesting that if he reduced the period from seven years to one year it would create a major loophole. If there is no loophole between 10 years and seven years, I fail to see how much greater a loophole there can be between seven years and one year.<br/>
The charities remain extremely worried because of the impact of development land tax and the great difference that the imposition will make to the pre- and post-White Paper day dates. They pointed out to the right hon. Gentleman that even as late as the Finance Act 1974 concessions were given to charities. They do not believe that there is any need for local authorities to have the duty to acquire their land. Time and again they have said, and the media have repeated, that the 10-year period is too short. They know from practical experience that they will have problems in raising loans on their land value, and that will restrict their work. They know from practical experience that this 10-year period will mean that the value at which they can sell their land will be diminished, because it will be well known in the market that if a charity has only 18 months to run buyers will hold off and there will be depreciation in the value of the land.<br/>
The charities and Churches have warned the right hon. Gentleman that the development of church schools will be


affected. I am surprised that the Minister has not yet checked with the Secretary of State for Education and Science, because the church schools have a r&#x00F4;le to play in this country. We are led to believe that the Labour Party still believes in church schools. If so, we would have expected the Government, as they are making concessions all the way along, to have exempted church schools and the universities.<br/>
I have repeatedly asked the right hon. Gentleman whether he realises the impact that this legislation will have on the older universities. I do not think he has turned his attention to the implications of the Bill for those bodies.<br/>
I do not think that adequate compensation arrangements have been made for the Free Church bodies which, as the right hon. Gentleman knows, have a policy of buying land ahead of requirements as the population in certain areas develops.<br/>
The Minister suggested that all legacies and gifts will be at the date of the death of the persons concerned. We welcome that marginal concession. But many people have written their wills at this point and left money and land&#x2014;land in particular&#x2014;to charities and Churches and they, hopefully, will not die in the next 10 years. Are we to say that a gift of land is no longer to be of any value?<br/>
The charities believe that the rigidity of the pre-White Paper date land versus post-White Paper date land will prevent the swapping and exchanging of land which has been the tradition in development in the older parts of our urban areas and in some of the newer development corporation land areas. The charities are to be precluded from undertaking swapping arrangements.<br/>
By resisting the Lords amendments, in particular Nos. 13, 152, 154 and 149, the Government will be depriving an area of our national life of the means of doing its work. They do not yet realise the serious nature of what they are undertaking.<br/>
In another place the Lord Bishop of London made clear the long historical exceptions for Church and charity land in terms of legislation&#x2014;over 400 years. That is a fair length of time. For four centuries Governments of all political

persuasions have protected the land of charities and Churches. Yet we now see a Labour Government determined to overthrow 400 years of exemption.<br/>
Some people say or pretend that charities are not properly regulated. To those who voice those opinions I say that the charities are strictly regulated by the Charity Commissioners. Church land is held in trust and looked after by the Church Commissioners. All other religious bodies are covered by either trustees or Acts of Parliament. Therefore, there is no reason for anyone feeling that there are loopholes here.<br/>
Why do the Government want to go against the traditional policy of Parliament? I remind the right hon. Gentleman that the previous Labour Government, within the Land Commission Act&#x2014;in some ways very much in the same sphere of activity as the Bill we are considering&#x2014;followed the traditional policy towards Churches and charities. The Minister is an honourable man. If it was Government policy from the start to wish to change the status of charitable land, it behoved the right hon. Gentleman and his colleagues to have made it clear to the population at large openly and in full debate.<br/>
What we have seen in the months that this matter has dragged on is a take-over by stealth. Every time we have tried to pin the right hon. Gentleman down, we were told that further deliberations and consultations were taking place. So they were, but not in an open manner which enabled the public to understand the Government's view. I find it difficult to understand why the Government do not recognise that those who run Churches and charities, particularly the latter, do not wish for material gain. They have the sole objective of furthering the work of the community.<br/>
We all know that no State, no Government, can possibly hope to cope with the requirements and demands of those in need. In particular, no Government have ever yet been able to do the experimental work and take up the individual cases that so many charities do. I suspect that the whole policy behind this move to remove the traditional status of charity and Church land is somehow tied up with the Socialist dogma that the local authority knows best.<br/>
It is wrong, when there are these great areas of need in our community and so many charities for so long have done so much, that one of their chief livelihoods should be taken away. I readily concede that the Government have made concessions. The Lord Chancellor himself said that there was a ready recognition of the fact that the charities could not foresee what the Government meant to do.<br/>
Even at this late stage, if the Government believe that statutory undertakers, certain other commercial undertakings and agriculture should be exempt, surely the demands of charities far exceed anything else. My contention is supported by the result of the vote in the other place, when, with a majority of 99, their Lordships told the Government&#x2014;[<i>Interruption.</i>] I would say to the Undersecretary that this is not a laughing matter. I know that they wanted only some charities exempt, but no charity workers are laughing&#x2014;[<i>Interruption.</i>] I am sorry, but even the Bishops, the Cross-Benchers and long friends of the Minister's party have spoken out against this aspect of the Bill.<br/>
It is wrong that the Government should ensure that the supremacy of the State should go over the traditional rights of our charities. If the Government are seeking by stealth to take over the work of our charities, they are doing so in a way which will create what one can only call an economic crucifixion of the Churches and charities. The only redeeming element is that the charities have been given a 10-year lifeline. I am grateful that the point we made on Report has been picked up and that the period, which could have been only nine years, has been put back to 10 years.<br/>
I see in this area great sorrow, great problems for the poor in our community who have been helped for so long by our charities and great problems for our schools and universities which are not wholly State-aided. The only redeeming feature is the 10-year lifeline and the hope that within that time there will be a change of Government.<br/>
My hon Friend has said that we will repeal the Bill. I hope that the charities and Churches recognise which side of the Chamber is supporting their interests and has honestly and loyally supported

them from the first day and pointed out to the Government the error of their ways.</p>

<p>To adapt a metaphor used earlier by the Minister, I think that we are off for another plod around the course. I thank him for what he has done already&#x2014;some concessions have been made&#x2014;but he will not be surprised to learn that I do not think they are enough. They are essentially short-term.<br/>
I intend to confine my brief speech to the Churches. Because the concessions are short-term, they cannot by nature or by definition take future changes into account. It is wrong to legislate in such a way that limits are set to the activities of Churches, of all denominations. Populations shift, people move from city centre to outskirts, from one decaying centre of economic activity to a growing centre of new economic activity, from old towns to new towns. This has been going on since before the Church was founded and it will go on for many years&#x2014;certainly more than the 10 years' grace that the Minister has allowed.<br/>
If Churches are to meet the social and spiritual needs of a shifting population, they should be able freely to dispose of land and buildings which are no longer needed and to use the proceeds to purchase land and build buildings where they are needed&#x2014;in perpetuity.<br/>
The Churches' Main Committee and the Church of Scotland&#x2014;I am speaking primarily on the latter's behalf&#x2014;has said in a memorandum that the Government's proposals would safeguard the position for 10 years but that once a piece of pre-White Paper day land was given up the replacement land would become subject to the restrictions imposed by the Bill as regards development greater than 10,000 sq.ft. As they say, that is a very low figure for the development of children's and old people's homes.<br/>
Finally, the Churches are still subject to normal planning controls. I believe I am right in saying that when they dispose of land they will do so at the same market value as local authorities in a similar situation. I would ask the Minister and the Government to think again. If they accept the Lords amendment, the only difference&#x2014;to use the felicitous phrasing


of the Churches' Main Committee&#x2014;will be that
<q>the Churches would remain free to develop land without the intervention of the local authority and&#x2026;instead of any development value flowing to the community through the local authority and the State, it would flow to the community direct, through the work done for the community by the Churches in the moral and spiritual values which they sustain and the social services they provide.</q>
I would ask the Government, for that reason, to think again.</p>

<p>The question of prevailing use value will lead to enormous problems in the years ahead. I understand from the <i>Official Report</i> of the debate in the other place that the Lord Chancellor said:
<q>'prevailing use value' is the term used to describe a method of valuation, originally conceived in the Planning Act 1947, in which it is assumed that planning permission would be granted for any development by virtue of which the use of the land would be made to correspond with the use which prevails generally in the land round about. "&#x2014;[<i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 4th November 1975: Vol. 365; c. 1028&#x2013;9.]</q>
I can foresee enormous problems in this and arguments about what the prevailing use of the land is in the district. Valuers acting for charities might claim that it is residential land while local authorities might argue that it is gardens or public open spaces. Cases will go to land tribunals and be argued at great length.</p>

<p>Does the hon. Member agree that this amendment is not as generous as the Lord Chancellor would have us believe? In another place he spoke of the prevailing use in the neighbourhood or area of the Church land concerned, but the amendment refers only to contiguous or adjacent land. This is a very precise definition which means only the adjoining piece of land.</p>

<p>I accept that. I would have great difficulty in deciding how to evaluate the prevailing use. The term "prevailing use" might have been used in the Town and Country Planning Act 1947, but that measure was repealed and I do not think that the expression has been used in planning circles since. I can understand why Churches and charities are so worried and I can see great difficulties ahead.<br/>
Churches and charities have been involved in development and have in some cases become speculators. They have had to do this in order to bring in some money. They have sold land at the highest market prices they could obtain. They have not done the actual development because they have not possessed the necessary specialised expertise. I have been concerned with some such developments and have been unhappy about them because the planners have not always agreed with what local people wanted to see done. A development has sometimes moved out of local control.<br/>
However, if we are to take away this right of Churches something must be put in its place. One trembles to think what might happen to the Haig Fund, the Cheshire Homes or the Churches in 10 years' time. They are already facing enough difficulties. I appreciate the Government's point of view, but, if they are not prepared to accept that the Churches and charities should be able to deal with their own land as they wish, some sort of compensation fund must be set up to enable these bodies to continue their good work, which take an enormous load off the State.<br/>
I support the Lords amendment because there is nothing else coming forward to deal with the situation after 10 years has elapsed. I hope that the Government will reconsider whether there is something they can do to help Churches and charities to overcome this enormous problem.</p>

<p>In local government and in this House I have always agreed with the party system and party discipline, and I accept that when the Division Bell rings the Government troops will support the Minister. However, if ever there was a case for having a full House to listen to an argument, this is it. I know that hon. Members on all sides have many other engagements, but I regret that there are only five hon. Members on the Government Benches&#x2014;four Ministers and one PPS. If Labour Members had heard the arguments, I am sure they would strongly oppose having a Whip on this matter. We feel strongly on this subject and we deeply regret that the Minister has chosen to disagree with the Lords in the amendment.<br/>
I have always been dissatisfied with the Government's concessions. When the statement was made by the Minister in Committee, I and a number of colleagues asked detailed and specific questions about how charities would be affected and we were particularly critical about the 10-year rule. On Report, the Minister gave the impression that the Opposition were carping by pursuing their objections. He accused us of exaggeration, and when we claimed that charities were not satisfied he said that the Government were having full and frank discussions with them and would meet their points.<br/>
I cannot quote what the Bishop of London said in another place, but it is an accurate paraphrase to say that he regarded the concessions as very meagre and dry crumbs falling from the Government's table. The Lord Chancellor said of the amendment moving back the 10-year period to 11 years:
<q>I agree that it would be wrong to build that up into a great and important matter; but, at any rate, it will be an addition of convenience that, in the decade now ahead, will help the Churches and charities to meet the situation which the Bill presents them with."&#x2014;[<i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 4th November 1975; Vol. 365, c. 998.]</q>
The Churches Main Committee sent a memorandum to all hon. Members on 6th November stating that it is very far from satisfied with the concessions made by the Government so far. The memorandum states:
<q>unfortunately, most of these special provisions were essentially short-term in their effect and would leave the churches and charities eventually in much the same position as they have always feared ever since this legislation was first proposed.</q>
The exemption on White Paper day land does not concern them. That is satisfactory. The difficulty they face is what happens about land they did not own then. It is not practicable for all Churches, as the Government suggest, to arrange their affairs in respect of their White Paper day land within 11 years.<br/>
The memorandum from the Churches Main Committee states:
<q>Not only is such a period no time at all in the history of churches and charities, many of which have been in existence for hundreds of years, but quite apart from the special difficulty of doing this in present economic circumstances, who is to say what the social needs will be 20, 50 or 100 years hence which the churches and charities must seek to satisfy?</q>

The long-term and on-going work of Churches and charities is very important. For instance, the British Legion, which is very much in our thoughts at this time of year, is building new homes on land which it may have only just acquired. This is one of the reasons why we regard the concessions as so unsatisfactory. I shall not go into the argument of whether Churches should be what the Lord Chancellor described as a special privileged body, but let no one come here and try to pretend that the Churches are satisfied with the concessions. They are certainly not satisfied with them.<br/>
6.30 p.m.<br/>
I move now from the general to the particular and to a matter which I raised on Report. The Government promised then to look at it. It concerns post-White Paper day land which is owned by one charity and is subsequently disposed of to another charity but which in between is owned by a non-charity owner.<br/>
The amendments to Lords Amendment No. 13 and to the later Lords amendment refer specifically to the fact that the land has been owned by a charity, but not necessarily by the same charity throughout. On Report I suggested that this seemed an unreasonably narrow restriction. I could see that the right hon. Gentleman was worried about evasion. I put it to him that it was perfectly possible to imagine circumstances in which one charity found that it had land which was surplus to its requirements but disposed of that land to a developer who subsequently sold it to another charity. The land which was sterilised would therefore be released for a satisfactory community purpose. In such circumstances, two concessions would be lost entirely because the land had gone out of charity possession, if only for a few days, during conveyancing. That is nonsense.</p>

<p>It would not necessarily be out of charity hands even for a few days. Recently I had drawn to my attention a situation in which a former Baptist church had for a number of years been used as an industrial storehouse. Subsequently it was used as a synagogue, and it has remained in that use since. The situation of which my hon. Friend speaks could arise there.</p>

<p>I am grateful for that constructive example. I understood the

<p>I rise with great trepidation at this stage of the debate on a complicated Bill, but it is essential for me to do so because it is important to wave the flag on behalf of British universities. They are great international institutions. I am sure that the Minister has had representations from them, although I am not sure what views they have put to him since his so-called concessions. I have an interest in universities, and I am not satisfied with the present state of affairs.<br/>
I wonder what co-ordination and liaison there is between Departments of State over provisions which clearly have wide ramifications in other sectors. At a time when everyone is complaining about the financial stringency affecting universities, when they are beset at every level with calls to economise, they are facing a provision which potentially could do them great damage simply because their property operations, which are crucial to them, will be hit by these provisions.<br/>
The universities have as good a history of estate management as local authorities. They have worked very closely with the local authorities. They are required by their charters to make such deals in the public interest, and it is extraordinary for the Government to hang the sword of Damocles over their heads. It is not possible for them to sort out their planning affairs within the time scale that the Minister has provided.<br/>
Perhaps I may give a couple of examples to highlight a situation which affects many universities. The Bill will distort and confuse the long-term forward planning of these institutions, and that will be to no one's benefit. Already there have been examples in some parts of the country of an exchange of land between the universities and the local authorities. Or a valuable piece of land owned by a university, but possibly on the periphery of its developments, is offered to a local authority or sold in exchange for a more central site.<br/>
In other instances it is important for the universities to be able to sell land to raise money to pay for other developments on the campus. This practice has come to the fore in university planning on student housing and on developments involving housing associations. Such programmes will be seriously affected. I received a letter which explained how in one of the University of London colleges such developments can arise at short notice. In one instance a very desirable piece of property, suitable for housing, came on to the market but the cost was very high. The university had to do a deal with the National Westminster Bank to lease part of that property in order to secure the money to buy the property and convert it.<br/>
Another instance concerned an old house with land attached to it. By selling the land the university realised &#x00A3;12, 000, which assisted the cost of new student accommodation to the extent of &#x00A3;1,000 per unit. Without that deal the university would have had to charge an extra &#x00A3;2 a week in rent to the students. The Government, like everyone else, are conscious of the pressures on students in housing, yet a system by which the universities can alleviate that pressure is threatened by Government measures. The Minister's concessions do not ease that position.<br/>
There is, therefore, little purpose but potentially much harm in refusing to exempt universities. If we are to maintain standards in our universities, we must allow them freedom in planning so that they may release surplus land and buy land that they require, and to carry out the sort of deals I have described. As things stand, the Government risk causing the universities either to push forward too hastily with their planning activities or to distort their forward planning.</p>

<p>I feel strongly on this subject. I wish to deal with charities such as old people's homes. These charities require greater flexibility than the Government's proposals will afford them. The needs which they seek to meet change frequently, and if they can sell property or land which they may own this will assist them in meeting that changing need. If they wish, therefore, to move into another area of charitable activity, they can do so. The Government must take that into account.


Often the charities move into areas of new need well ahead of the State. Take, for example, the provision of centres for drug addicts, battered wives or single-parent families. Charities often move in long before the State catches up. The Government's proposals will detract from their ability to carry out those activities. They will be deprived of realising the means to meet changing needs since they will be unable to sell their land.</p>

<p>It is a most serious matter that this issue has not been left to a free vote of the House. All parties agreed in Committee that there should be substantial concessions for charities and the Churches. Representations which we received from the Church leaders almost invariably stated&#x2014;rather strangely, perhaps&#x2014;that they supported the principles of the Bill. I do not think they understood what those principles were, but nevertheless they were friendly towards the Government. Now, we are being called upon to vote down what the Churches and charities should be receiving from the Government.<br/>
When the Government announced in Committee that they would accede to the requests of the Churches and charities to be relieved of the burdens of the Bill, we all received pleasant little letters saying "We are so glad that the Government have given us what we asked for." But the Government had done nothing of the sort. Among Members of all parties there was a desire to give the Churches and charities freedom from the Bill&#x2014;in short, to leave them in control in the management of their properties for charitable purposes, and not to hand over that control to local authorities. That is what will happen if the Bill sees its whole life through to the second appointed day.<br/>
Churches and charities, which are the best people to know how to manage Church and charitable property, are being told that eventually that property will be taken away from them and put into the management of local authorities. The main point is that the Government have conceded some relief to the Churches and charities only in respect of land held on 12th September 1974. That is no concession at all, because it takes away the whole possibility of managing that land to the best advantage of the charity. I beg the Minister to think again. He still

has time to give the Churches and charities what they believed they were getting.<br/>
We have been talking in shorthand by speaking of charities. The word covers a great number of bodies without which this country could not operate. If those bodies&#x2014;the universities, the schools, the almshouses, the old people's homes, the British Legion, the Salvation Army and the Cheshire Homes&#x2014;are to be deprived of the right to manage their property as they think fit for charitable purposes, they will be hampered by the fact that it will be taken away from them eventually, at current use value, and then kindly handed back again, perhaps, on the basis of a ground lease with variable rents&#x2014;another taxation on them. We shall then destroy a whole part of our society.<br/>
It is a serious matter that the Patronage Secretary and other Government Whips have not allowed Labour Members to express the sort of feelings expressed by one of them, the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, Central (Mr. McNamara) in Committee and on Report. I believe that the hon. Gentleman is out of the country on a mission, but he could at least have persuaded some of his colleagues to speak in the House according to their conscience.</p>

<p>The right hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) painted only one side of what he described as charitable or Church institutions. Some of us who represent the larger cities have in our constituencies property that has been held for a number of years by various denominations and is now in a terrible state. I do not suppose that any hon. Member present could quantify the number of half-demolished chapels in some such areas.<br/>
I, too, have received objections to some of the clauses relating to churches and chapels, but my correspondents seeking exemption were more concerned not with the redevelopment of a chapel on a site which was in a shocking state, one that had been unused for some time, but with exploiting the land on the open market. I do not consider that that would be in the best interests of the ratepayer or the taxpayer, or of the public generally. It is only right that land which has obviously become surplus to requirements, because a church or chapel on the site can no longer be sustained, should be subject to the Bill.</p>

<p>The local authorities have complete power to purchase such properties now, if they think that they are derelict, unsightly or unrepaired. The charities have power to sell them.

<p>I take the point, but is not the right hon. Gentleman only highlighting the fact that it is difficult to apply a set standard to deal with every contingency? I am the first to admit that there are valuable properties on valuable land that may require consideration. But certain areas are dotted with half-derelict chapels. That is particularly true of the area in which I live and which I represent. I could take hon. Members to any number within a short distance of one another that are an eyesore by any standards, because the church authorities which should have maintained them have never had the money to do so.<br/>
It is true that the local authority could purchase them and perhaps put them in order. I know a local authority that tried to do that with a church, making a compulsory purchase order to retain the building because it had some architectural merit. But the cost of putting the building in a reasonable condition was astronomical, and the whole preservation scheme had to be abandoned. Public spending priorities would not allow the authority to use money in that way.<br/>
Although there may be a case for certain charities, I believe that the Bill is correct and that it contains enough safeguards.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman misses the point. I am talking about areas where the people concerned have no intention of rebuilding a church but are trying to capitalise on a derelict site.

<p>The hon. Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Dean) suffers from the fact that he has only recently entered the argument about the possibility of exempting Church and charity land. If he had been with us on Second Reading, in Committee and on Report, he would have found that the essence of the case made by the Churches was that they possessed in inner city areas chapels and church buildings which had become derelict because of the shift of population away from those areas. The Churches need to be able to realise the value of those buildings at a market rate so that they may build new churches and new chapels in the areas to which the population has gone. That case has been accepted by the Government. That is why I say it is a pity that the hon. Gentleman has come so late into these discussions.</p>

<p>What were we told when we were discussing whether charities as well as Churches should receive some grace? The Government said "Some may receive grace, but we do not like the look of others." There were discussions as to whether educational establishments were worthy charities deserving of special consideration by those of Socialist mentality. We were told that there was a range of charities that should not be given any assistance. Why should this be so? It seems that it is the Socialist mentality that the State shall do all. In their thinking there is no room for any help to be given to a member of the community other than that which is provided by bureaucrats obeying politicians' orders. That is why they want to mop up as much land as they can into what they call public ownership. They do not trust other people to manage, dispose of and deal with land responsibly.<br/>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, South (Mr. Morris) said, we started our discussions on Churches and charities with the Government not prepared to give them any help. There was nothing in the White Paper or the Bill that gave any help. It was only when enormous pressures were brought upon the Government from both outside and inside the House that they suddenly realised they would be in enormous trouble if they failed to give assistance to the powerful voices that were being ranged against them.<br/>
What are the crumbs of comfort to which reference has been made? I must censure some of my hon. Friends for talking about the Government giving concessions. The Government go about clobbering everyone they possibly can. When they say "We shall clobber him a little less than everyone else", they regard that as a great deal. That is their so-called great concession. It is an abuse of the English language. No concession is being made by adopting that attitude.<br/>
The charities and the Churches are greatly disturbed by what is being done. Interestingly enough, in the Divisions in another place two Lord Bishops acted as

Tellers. That was a historic occasion for Parliament. That is an indication of the concern that the Bishops feel for the future of their institutions. It is for those reasons that I say to my right hon. and hon. Friends that we must support the Lords in their amendments and reject the amendments that are being proposed by the Government.<br/>
It is significant that apart from one lone and uninformed voice on this subject&#x2014;I refer to the hon. Member for Leeds, West&#x2014;the Government have had no friends. Not one Labour Member, apart from the hon. Member for Leeds, West, has had the temerity to face the embarrassment of listening to the case being made against the Government, let alone coming in and defending the Government's position. Where are Labour Members? Look at the empty benches behind the Minister. It seems that Labour Members do not have the courage to defend their Government on these matters.<br/>
First, we complain that the period of grace is given to Churches and charities only in respect of land they happened to own on White Paper day&#x2014;namely, l2th September 1974. We have been told by those who manage the lands of Churches and charities that this will cause them considerable hardship. It is part of their land management to transfer and exchange property with others. That movement of property does not necessarily take place between one charity and another; it can take place between a charity and a private owner. It takes place so that a Church or charity may obtain a piece of land that it needs for its purposes. If these bodies continue with that kind of exercise, the land that is acquired by that kind of prudent estate management will not be exempt from the operation of the Bill. The result will be to fossilise the activities of Churches and charities to the detriment of the community at large, which benefits from the activities of Churches and charities.<br/>
The second matter that causes us and the Churches and charities great concern is that the acquisition of their property by local authorities is something over which they have no control. There is no exemption and they are subject utterly and completely to acquisition when a local authority considers that a certain piece of land is suitable for development. The charity or church concerned will get the


market price for that land for only 10 years.<br/>
It might be said that the Churches and charities should start disposing of their land straight away so that they may get their price within the 10 years. However, matters are not quite as easy as that. The value of land in 10 years' time has a bearing on the amount that can be borrowed on it today. If the value of a piece of land owned by a Church or charity reduces substantially in value in 10 years, as it will do under the Bill, the amount that can be borrowed to build a new church, an old people's home or a home for the mentally handicapped, for example, will be restricted. That borrowing being restricted, the activities of charities and Churches will be severely inhibited.<br/>
Therefore, I ask my right hon. and hon. Friends to support the Churches and charities&#x2014;in a way in which the Labour Government and members of the Labour Party are not prepared to support them&#x2014;by voting for the Lords amendment.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Hornsey (Mr. Rossi) and the hon. Member for Northampton, South (Mr. Morris) took the foolish step of seeking to mix religion with politics. They appeared to suggest that all the virtue in these matters was with the Opposition, whose Members had done their utmost to wring concessions out of the Government. They know that there is not a grain of truth in that proposition.<br/>
The Opposition know that on Second Reading my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State for Wales said that negotiations and discussions were in progress at that stage with the Churches and charities. They also know that in Committee I said that following discussions with the Churches and the charities a new clause had been tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, Central (Mr. McNamara)&#x2014;who, in this context, I must emphasise, sits on the Government side of the House and is not an Opposition Member&#x2014;a provision to which the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Crawford) added his name. However, it is almost being sug

gested that the Government on these matters are anti-religion and anti-charity&#x2014;</p>

<p>I am now being told that we are anti-university too.
<q>It is being said that the Opposition are trying to wring concessions out of the Government in order to assist the charities. Let us look at the matter as a whole and not merely in its historical context. I do not know whether any count has been taken by those upstairs in the Gallery who examine the private interests of hon. Members and their outside activities, but I would lay odds that if we were to count the number of lay readers and lay preachers far more of them would be found on the Government Benches than among Opposition Members.</q></p>

<p>I shall tell the hon. Gentleman where many of them are. Many are upstairs at a meeting discussing the economy. I remind Opposition Members that absence from the Chamber is often as a result of contentment and not a matter of embarrassment. Certainly, if my hon. Friends were here I am sure that they would be more embarrassed after having heard some of the Opposition speeches than by anything that has been said on the Government side of the House.<br/>
We have many times been over the ground covered by these provisions. Let us examine the essential difference of approach by hon. Members on the Government Benches and that adopted by their Lordships' House&#x2014;an approach which is now being backed by the Conservative Opposition. We are saying, and we have said throughout, that Churches and charities are by their nature in a special position because of the good they do and also because of their status. I think that is agreed on both sides of the House.<br/>
We are now considering a land scheme for the future, and attempts have been made by the representatives of the Churches, charities and universities in consultation with the Government to find a way in which their interests will not be overridden, as Opposition Members appear to suggest will happen. This is the reason why so many amendments


have been made to the Bill. We want special provisions in relation to Churches and charities that will assist them and to make the transition to the new situation, without prejudice to any commitment into which they have entered in respect of land they owned before they had any knowledge of the scheme. It is not intended, and it never has been intended&#x2014;this is where the Labour Government and the other place are at issue&#x2014;that Churches and charities should remain permanently outside the scheme altogether.<br/>
The effect of the amendments would be widespread. They would have the effect of including in "current use value" the value of any planning permission obtained by a charity in respect of any land acquired at any time. It would mean that the charities would be outside the scheme in respect of receiving the market value for their land in perpetuity. It would create a special category of land, with all the difficulties which that would entail for local authorities.<br/>
A number of valid points have been made in the debate, and I wish to answer them. The hon. Member for Northampton, South and the hon. Member for Ripon (Dr. Hampson), whom I welcome to our coterie on land matters, mentioned the universities, particularly the older ones. Do those hon. Gentlemen realise that 99&#x00B7;9 per cent. of land held by the universities benefits from the White Paper day exemptions? We are, therefore, talking of a tiny, indeed minuscule, fraction of land acquired since White Paper day.<br/>
Let us get the matter in perspective in regard to the question of the payment of market value. The situation in future will be no different from the present position. Local authorities pay market value for the land they now buy, and they will continue to do so.</p>

<p>Is it not a fact that universities go in for exchanges of the kind I mentioned? Therefore, does not the use come within the provision, and will the Bill apply? Is it not also possible that land could be acquired at below market value which had been purchased with UGC money and later could be sold by local authorities at a much higher price, and will not this take that profit out of the Treasury?

Do not these matters amount to an anomaly?</p>

<p>I do not know what the hon. Gentleman means by "exchange" in the university context, because if universities or charities exchange land for a charitable use the provisions of the Bill will hardly affect them. We are talking here of disposal of land rather than of exchange.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1975-11-11a.1214.1" hansard_membership_id="5457" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/15739" speakername="Dr. Hampson" colnum="1214" time="">
<p>The Minister will remember that I gave an example of land in a peripheral area outside the campus.</p>

<p>That is another category, but it is still not exchange of land but rather the sale of land. It may be surplus to requirements, but it does not fall within the ordinary meaning of "exchange".<br/>
The hon. Member for Northampton, South asked about the difference between statutory undertakers and charities. One important difference is that statutory undertakers are ordered by statute to undertake a particular job. It is not true, as the hon. Gentleman implied, that statutory undertakers are exempt from the provisions of the Bill. They are not. They are exempt from its provisions only as they relate to operational land.</p>

<p>I thought I had made it clear that I was not talking of operational land. If not, I do so now. If the charities and Churches could have their operational land exempted, we would be going some way towards what they are looking for.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1975-11-11a.1214.4" hansard_membership_id="11129" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/19091" speakername="Mr. Oakes" colnum="1214" time="">
<p>Very largely as a result of the amendments that have been made, much of the operational land of Churches and charities is exempted. It is not stated as being exempted, but that effectively is what happens as a result of what we have done during the course of the Bill.<br/>
The hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire said that charities and Churches were especially subject to shifting changes. I do not deny that. My hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Dean) made the same point. Churches in the city areas become derelict because of population changes. But there is no cause to believe that charities will be better off in getting their land from the private rather than from the public sector. The reverse might apply. There is no


argument for the proposition that they would be better off. Furthermore they will still buy at market value. This question of buying has to be made quite clear. Churches and charities will be buying at market value, as is the position now.<br/>
The hon. Member for the Isle of Wight (Mr. Ross)&#x2014;I am not inviting him to intervene now, but I recall that I made an offer to give way to him during the course of my reply&#x2014;dealt with the question of prevailing use value and what it meant. He also raised the issue of the words used by the Lord Chancellor in the House of Lords. There is no doubt that there are problems here. In some cases, for example a disused church in the High Street, it is obvious that the prevailing use will be shops. As for the point about contiguous and adjacent, "contiguous" means adjoining but adjacent land need not be physically adjoining. "Adjacent" means "near to". Thus the Lord Chancellor inevitably was right. If there is dispute as to whether something is contiguous or adjacent, or about what the prevailing use is in an area, it can be settled by the Lands Tribunal, as such matters are settled now in respect of market value, which can be difficult to assess.</p>

<p>The Churches chose their sponsors cleverly. We had these original amendments sent to us. I shall not dwell on that point. As regards the issue of prevailing use, the Minister has illustrated what the problems will be. Obviously local authorities will argue when a Church or charity is selling land and claiming prevailing use value, which may be approaching market value. This will lead to enormous problems which may end up in the Lands Tribunal. This could take a year or two to deal with. This is what the Churches are scared about.</p>

<p>It will lead to some disputes. Anything can lead to disputes. On the whole, I think that these will be exceptional. The terms "prevailing use value", "land contiguous", "land adjacent" and so on are fairly easy to understand. In the vast majority of cases agreement will be reached about the value. The obvious example is the church in the High Street surrounded by

shops and office development. In that case there is a high prevailing use value.</p>

<p>Does that mean that the church in the High Street will be pulled down prematurely so that this extra value may be realised?</p>

<p>We are not talking about pulling down churches prematurely. That is returning to the argument about derelict churches and chapels. It is an important strand but not the main strand in our debate. It has been dealt with basically by the Government amendments put forward in Committee.<br/>
The hon. Member for Melton (Mr. Latham) asked what would be the position if land was sold from a charity to a non-charity within a short period of time. The answer is that it would lose its charitable status. If the land is bought by another charity, the time starts to run again. The time would begin from the time at which it was bought by the other charity. If the land left the charity, went to another use&#x2014;I remember answering this point on Report&#x2014;and could then revert to its charitable status and the time elapsed ran from the first charity, it is clear that all sorts of difficulties could be created and there would be the possibility of using such a method as a device for evasion, not by the charities but by others.</p>

<p>The point that the hon. Gentleman has described me as making earlier was not the point I made at all. He said on Report that he would consider the matter carefully and see whether anything could be done. Is he now saying that he has done so and that nothing can be done?</p>

<p>Yes. We considered it carefully when these amendments were considered in Committee in another place. On balance, because of the arguments I have given, we think that no harm will be done by leaving this provision as it is but that much harm could result by seeking to amend it in the way suggested.<br/>
The hon. Member for Reading, North Mr. Durant) mentioned centres for drug addicts, battered wives and so on. We are not talking about such things in this amendment because overwhelmingly such charities use existing buildings. They


take over a building and that building is not affected.</p>

<p>My point is that a charity might find that its original charitable purpose had declined and it might decide to enter a new area. It might need to move away from its existing base. That is the point&#x2014;moving from a need which has declined to another need and a changing location.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1975-11-11a.1217.1" hansard_membership_id="11129" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/19091" speakername="Mr. Oakes" colnum="1217" time="">
<p>When the time arises, that may be so. When it bought other premises, that charity would have to do so in the same way as it does now. There is no change.<br/>
Let me sum up the position with regard to charity land, given not only the amendments made in Committee but the valuable amendments concerning the seven years and the building on the land made by my right hon. Friend today as a result of some of the amendments from the other place. What is the position with charity land, post-White Paper? On buying, I repeat that the charity will buy at market value, as now. There will be a liability to duty if relevant development is being sought. If the charity owned the land, it would have prior right to get it back for development. In the carrying out of exempted development, only the power of acquisition would apply. My right hon. Friend has said that he would not expect to confirm compulsory purchase orders where development was for a charity's operational use, which is similar to what I was saying about statutory undertakers and so on. The charity will also attract the minor benefits in the seven-year period.<br/>
Considerable progress was made after the Second Reading debate. The Secretary of State for Wales announced that negotiations were proceeding. Long transitional provisions are necessary. These have been provided by the Government and meet many of the points made by the Churches and the charities.</p>

<p>I do not think that the Churches and charities ask for permanent exemption, in perpetuity, from this land scheme. The Government could not accept such exemption in perpetuity. We have moved a long way in making the transitional arrangements. Most charities, some of the Churches and many churchmen accept that position.</p>

<p>The Minister said that the Churches had not asked for long-term exemption from this scheme. I received a letter from the Churches' Main Committee, which reads:
<q>The Government have explained the short term nature of their new provisions by their desire not to allow the establishment in perpetuity of a specially privileged class of land-owner. But Churches and charities are by their very nature in a unique position, as the Minister himself recognised in his speech on 15th July, and they have traditionally been treated as such since Tudor times on grounds of the benefit which they bring to the community and the fact that the whole of their resources are devoted solely to the community. None goes into private pockets. What the Churches and charities are asking, there fore, is not that they should be given a privilege which they have not hitherto had, but that they should retain the position which they have always had, and which Governments of all political persuasions have been at pains to maintain.</q>
That contradicts what the Minister said. In the long term the Churches will find it much harder to carry out their charitable and social work. They will find it much harder to pay their clergymen and their ministers, who are the most abysmally paid people in the entire population. The same criterion applies to charities generally. It is not good enough for the Minister to speak as he did this evening. I ask the Opposition&#x2014;indeed, the whole House&#x2014;to support the Lords amendments.</p>

Similar amendments to Schedule 4 and Schedule 10 were accepted as bringing into the Bill the more appropriate legal formula in Scotland where there is a reference to a legal suit. Unfortunately, Lords Amendment No. 57 to paragraph 12 of Schedule 4 was accepted, but that paragraph has no application to Scotland, and the amendment must therefore be removed.</p>

<q>(1A) The first appointed day shall not be earlier than the first date when a draft of regulations under section 3 of this Act excepting one or more classes of development from relevant development has been approved by resolution of each House of Parliament.</q></p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1975-11-11a.1224.5" hansard_membership_id="11129" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/19091" speakername="Mr. Oakes" colnum="1224" time="">
<p>I beg to move, That this House doth agree with the Lords in the said amendment.<br/>
The amendment is not highly significant. It precludes the first appointed day, when the transitional arrangements for the scheme come into force, from being appointed before a draft of relevant development regulations made under Clause 3 has been approved by Parliament. The relevant development regulations are an essential feature of the scheme, as they will define the categories of development which will be permanently outside the duties under Clauses 17 and 18. Moreover, until the regulations are in force, there will be nothing in Clause 21 procedure to bite.<br/>
We have always accepted the necessity for such regulations to be in force and


available publicly before the first appointed day, and would in any case have ensured that this was done. There is, however, something to be said for writing such provision into the Bill. That is what the amendment does, and I am sure that it will find favour with the right hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) accordingly.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1975-11-11a.1225.0" hansard_membership_id="4206" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/20268" speakername="Mr. Rossi" colnum="1225" time="">
<p>I rise to quarrel not with the amendment, which we accept wholeheartedly, but with the way in which the hon. Gentleman presented it. He said that it was not a very important amendment. He said that it would be convenient to have it in the Bill rather than outside it. I recall all the debates when we have asked the Government to spell out in the Bill what are the rights of citizens and not leave it to be dealt with by ministerial action. I wonder that the Minister can say now "It is not very important for this to be in the Bill, because the Minister will do it anyway." What is the legislative process all about, unless it is to define what the private citizen's rights are, unless it is to lay down what a Minister may or may not do in the exercise of his office?<br/>
In contrast to the hon. Gentleman's rather churlish introduction to the amendment, I think that the Lords deserve thanks for forcing it on the Government. The amendment makes it plain that the regulations, which define what is and is not relevant development&#x2014;we all know that the definition of "relevant development" is the key to the operation of the land scheme&#x2014;must be before us before the Minister can declare the first appointed day and bring the Bill into operation. I am grateful to their Lordships for having forced this amendment on the Government and having written into the Bill the date upon which the Minister shall deal with this matter. It is on that basis, and not on the basis on which the hon. Gentleman introduced the amendment, that we support it.</p>

<p>I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Hornsey (Mr. Rossi) that this amendment is of considerable importance. How the Bill could have operated without having the regulations, I do not know. I accept the assurance that it was the intention of the Government to bring in these regulations before the commencement order on the

appointed day, but it is right to have it written into the Bill.<br/>
Can the hon. Gentleman give some estimate of the time when the regulations will be put in draft before the House, and therefore of how soon the first appointed day will be? I imagine that the regulations are in draft already, that we shall be seeing them fairly soon, and that the appointed day will be when we approve them in the House. To have such an estimate would be of great help to those who have to prepare for the operation of the Bill.</p>

<p>I can only reply to the right hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) that it will be done as speedily as possible. I cannot give a more precise date, but work is proceeding on the regulations.<br/>
The hon. Member for Hornsey (Mr. Rossi) never ceases to amaze me about two aspects of this matter. He is always saying that this is of urgent priority and he always uses flamboyant language to describe it. He says that the House of Lords forced the amendment on the Government. We always said that it would be rather stupid for the first appointed day to be in operation before the regulations were in operation, because there would be nothing for the regulations to bite on. We have said that throughout. We have also said that the Government intended to do this and therefore we did not need to spell out the obvious in the Bill. Very well&#x2014;we are now spelling it out in the Bill, and that is the enormous, tremendous, moral and political victory that their Lordships have won over us.</p>

<p>These amendments are all designed to give greater publicity to relevant date orders, that is, the orders that bring in the full duty prohibition provisions of Clauses 18 and 21. Lords Amendments Nos. 34 and 36 strengthen the provision governing the registers of such orders, which the Secretary of State must keep because they are required to be available at all reasonable hours and to be kept in such a way as to enable the public to inform themselves of the details of an order. Lords Amendment No. 27 inserts a new provision requiring each of the authorities affected by an order to do two things&#x2014;to publish a notice of its effect in the Press and to keep a copy of the order available for free public inspection at its main office at all reasonable hours. Lords Amendment No. 35 is simply a drafting amendment.<br/>
These requirements, in addition to those already provided in the Bill&#x2014;there are administrative arrangements which will be made for regional registers to be kept in the Department's regional offices&#x2014;should provide all that is necessary to ensure that members of the public have all the information they need about the relevant date orders.</p>

<p>I do not know what the Minister has in mind as to the way in which the public will inform themselves. Is this to be a register of which there will be something like a requisition for a official certificate of search? Or does it merely mean that the public have to call personally to see it? Is it possible to have some official form which could be sent in, and is there to be a fee for the answer? What is meant?

I am sure that it is a very useful phase and leaves the Minister with what he has claimed that he requires throughout the debates on this Bill, and that is flexibility. But flexibility is not always so very helpful to the public. I hope that the Minister is about to get advice.<br/>
I envisage personal search&#x2014;I presume at Marsham Street. If so, on what floor is this register to be kept? As the Minister knows&#x2014;he is on the 18th floor himself now&#x2014;when the lifts go out of order, it is almost impossible to reach the 18th floor. If the register were to be kept up there, it would not be in such a way as would enable members of the public to inform themselves. That is just a practical point. If the Minister now has that fortunate piece of paper from along the row, perhaps he can perhaps answer my question.</p>

<p>I beg to move, That this House doth agree with the Lords in the said amendment.<br/>
The amendment arises from one in Committee in the other place by Lord Sandford and Lord Aberdare. Their amendment was unsatisfactory in that it provided only for information to be sent by district councils to county councils and not from county councils to district councils. It only required county councils to make information publicly available. It was also suggested that possibly district councils should also make relevant agency arrangements available for inspection.<br/>
The Government are in favour of this type of publicity and openness. They had proposed to achieve this for these agency arrangements by requiring the Land Authority itself to keep and make available for inspection a register of agency arrangements into which it had entered. The Opposition criticised this as being remote and less favourable to the Welsh public than the corresponding arrangements in England in relation to land acquisition and management schemes.<br/>
The Government introduced their own amendment on Report, when it was approved. It requires each tier of local authority to give publicity to the agency arrangements into which it has entered, and is thus more useful than the Opposition proposal would have been.</p>

<p>We approve of the amendment. It is obviously very important that the left hand should know what the right hand is doing in this matter, but I must confess to being a little surprised that the actual duty of informing each local authority lies upon the local authority itself, rather than upon the Land Authority for Wales, which will presumably have been the initiator of whatever arrangements are made with the district or the county authority. I should be grateful if the Minister would explain why the duty lies with the local authorities as opposed to the Land Authority itself.<br/>
Secondly, I should like the Minister to comment on the publicity aspect of this. According to the amendment as it stands there is no duty upon the authorities to give publicity as such. They are required only to let each authority know of the arrangements. There is no duty laid upon them that they shall inform the public that these arrangements have been made.<br/>
There is a great deal of concern in Wales about these agency arrangements, and I am sure that the public&#x2014;and, indeed, the local authorities themselves&#x2014;would like to know the Government's latest thinking on these arrangements.</p>

<p>The amendment was drawn up in response to the proposal produced in the other place by Lord Sandford and Lord Aberdare. It was then felt that, since the matter of agency arrangements was chiefly a question of administrative arrangements to operate the scheme, this was principally a matter of concern both to the district and to the county councils. Since we require that the Land Authority shall work in the fullest co-operation with district and county councils, it was felt that this could best be done by having the responsibility of notifying the agency arrangements arranged in this way.<br/>
As to making extra publicity, the point we are making in the amendment is that the fact of having the arrangements available at local authority offices will extend the opportunities for local people to become as fully aware of these agency arrangements as they may care to make themselves.</p>

<p>These amendments would limit the acquisition power under Clause 15(1) to acquiring development land only&#x2014;that is, land which in the opinion of the authority concerned is needed for relevant development within 10 years.<br/>
If this amendment were accepted, authorities would no longer have power under the Bill to acquire land for excepted development. They would not be able to acquire land which was suitable for relevant development but was not needed within 10 years&#x2014;even if the landowner, for good reasons, wanted to sell to the authority by agreement and it would be sensible for the authority to buy and to keep the land in its existing use until needed for development.<br/>
The basic fact to be considered here is that the Government's proposals for defining the scope of the scheme by reference to the potential scope of the duty leave excepted development outside this category but still within the scope of the acquisition power. The whole concept of excepted development is based on the assumption that, though normally it will not be right for authorities to acquire land for such development, there will be circumstances in which they should do so.<br/>
Perhaps it would be helpful if I were to give a couple of examples where authorities should be able to acquire land which is necessary to facilitate development. It would, for example, be possible to use the acquisition power as the only way of ensuring that desirable recreational development was carried out. Second, authorities should be able to buy land for excepted development in order to achieve better planning. There could be instances when an authority would need to buy land for rebuilding within the terms of Schedule 8 to the 1971 Act, because that would be the only way to achieve the best results in planning terms.<br/>
The effect of these amendments is to remove the power for such acquisitions and, viewed in that way, wreck completely the concept of excepted development. For that reason, I ask the House to disagree with the other place.</p>

<p>The two points made by the Minister might be valid if this were the only power of compulsory acquisition in the hands of the State. But it must be emphasised that these proposals are in addition to the existing powers of compulsory acquisition.<br/>
It is wrong for the Minister to represent the position as being that the State

could not acquire either excepted development land or land not needed for 10 years but for the Bill, even as amended by the Lords. It would be perfectly possible for local authorities to get permission from the Minister to acquire both these categories of land under other Acts, admittedly in circumstances giving a higher rate of compensation to the landowner and admittedly in circumstances giving additional rights to the landowner.<br/>
It is about confiscation that we are arguing and it is about confiscation with reduced powers of objection to the individual citizen that we are arguing in this case. Therefore, the Opposition believe that the Lords were right to restrict the powers given to local authorities in confiscating the private citizen's land.<br/>
We take this view not because we believe that local authorities are by themselves bad organisations. But if the Government thrust vast powers upon local authorities, there are possibilities at least that local authorities will misuse those powers. At present, we see the opportunities that local authorities have for misusing their powers in the provision of subsidised housing. At present, subsidised housing is used and has been used as no less than an electoral bribe. If in the future local authorities are to become the monopoly buyer and seller of development land, their opportunities for malpractices will increase vastly.<br/>
For this reason, we believe that the discretion accorded to local authorities when they are acquiring land under the penal provisions of the Bill should be limited as far as possible. Therefore, if a local authority wishes to acquire either excepted development land or land that will not be required for 10 years, it should do so under previous Acts and not under the Bill.<br/>
It must be made clear that, under the preceding Acts dealing with compulsory acquisition, the scheme was broadly that the acquiring authority would acquire at market value and that the landowner would have a wide right of objection and the right to an individual inquiry concerning each piece of land. But the Bill much reduces the rights accorded to any landowner, whether he be rich or poor.<br/>
This is a Bill for confiscation at current use value. It is a Bill for confiscation at a value that takes no account of the


development value of land. It is also a Bill giving the States the right to confiscate, with reduced powers of objection and a reduced right to demand a public inquiry.<br/>
We are mindful of our duty to try to preserve the rights of individual citizens, whether they be rich or poor, and many landowners are very poor people. [<i>Laughter.</i>] I see one or two Government supporters laughing at that statement. Many individual landowners, in urban areas especially, own one or two houses. Often those houses have been reduced in value, both in capital value and in income, by the interference of the State as a result of rent control. Today we are fighting for the little people who will be ground into the dust by the forced acquisition through the confiscation of the Bill.<br/>
The Opposition believe that it is quite wrong to allow local authorities the wide discretion which previously was built into the Bill by allowing local authorities to decide what would be development "in their opinion". The proposals made by the Lords are good. They are proposals that a second Chamber should be making, because they enhance the right of the individual citizen and say to the State "If you want to acquire two types of development land, you should do so at market value and you should do it in a way that gives the individual citizen the old and considerable rights that he had under the preceding legislation for compulsory acquisition."</p>

<p>I have not taken part in these proceedings since the Second Reading debate, but I tried to follow carefully the discussions in Committee and the proposals now before the House.<br/>
As I understand them the powers of acquisition lying with the local authority depend significantly upon its proposals for planning and use of land on a 10-year rolling programme. I was interested to hear what the Minister said, because there seems to be some contradiction between this situation and the term
<q>&#x2026;which, in their opinion, is suitable for development.</q>
Those words seem to take the power given to local authorities far beyond that intended to be linked to planning proposals.<br/>
The Lords amendment restricts that right&#x2014;I think wisely&#x2014;to land for which a planning use is proposed. But the terms of the Bill as drafted in using the words "suitable for development" seem to take the powers outside those upon which great emphasis was placed in the past and which I thought formed a significant factor in the proposal behind this legislation.</p>

<p>All the reasons given by the Minister for rejecting this Lords amendment are the very reasons, taken inversely, why the Opposition feel that it is right for the House to accept them. There is this great difference between the two sides of the House as to the effect and extent of this land scheme.<br/>
The first of the amendments contains what to us are the highly objectionable words "in their opinion". As drafted, the clause reads:
<q>An authority&#x2026;shall have power to acquire&#x2026;any land which, in their opinion, is suitable for development.</q>
That is a totally selective judgment by the local authority.<br/>
We have argued through this matter at all stages of this Bill, and I shall not detain the House by arguing the case again. However, the Opposition would like to see an objective judgment taken here. If the words "in their opinion" were omitted the clause would read:
<q>An authority&#x2026;shall have power to acquire&#x2026;any land which is suitable for development. </q>
Whether the land was suitable for development could be tested elsewhere, if necessary, by the impartial courts of our land. The moment that we introduce the phrase
<q>land which, in their opinion, is suitable for development</q>
or land which may be acquired by the local authorities, no one may intervene apart from possibly the Secretary of State. We know what the Secretary of State's views are on land acquisition. That is why we are considering the Bill.<br/>
Therefore, on this matter there can be no agreement between the two sides. The right hon. Gentleman says that these amendments seek to turn excepted development into exempted development. Of course, that is precisely what we want to see. We have already expressed our


view on the question of the single dwelling. We have said that that should be exempted from acquisition by a local authority and not, as the Minister would like, only exempted until such time as a local authority thinks that the dwelling is suitable for comprehensive development purposes. In such a situation the private citizen's rights would be much at risk and indeed in danger as became clear from the answer which the Minister gave during the debate on that matter.<br/>
The Minister announced some weeks ago with a great fanfare of trumpets the exceptions concerning the building industry. He told the industry not to worry. He said that the Government would enable it to carry on its work because there would be excluded from the operation of this scheme any development for industrial or commercial property of up to 15,000 square feet or, for housing, up to 10,000 square feet. The building industry was told that this would mean that schemes involving 10 or 12 houses would be excluded from the provisions of the Bill. Those schemes are only excluded to the extent that they are "excepted" and we know that "excepted" means that a local authority can always override a proposal if it decides that the land is suitable for development on a more comprehensive basis. Therefore, these exceptions are really not worth the paper they are written on. Although we may be told that it is intended that it will be done this, that, or the other way, we should like those intentions to be spelt out in the Bill, even at risk of the Undersecretary&#x2014;who is no longer present&#x2014;saying that I get over-excited when I ask that matters be properly spelt out in the Bill.</p>

<p>I shall not go over the ground again, because, as the hon. Member for Hornsey (Mr. Rossi) has said, there is a philosophical gulf between the two parties. However, unlike his hon.

Friend the Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Raison) I believe that one Second Reading speech is enough.<br/>
I know that the hon. Member for Hornsey fully accepts and understands the position. However, he always seems slightly to miss the point that if a local authority when dealing with an excepted development makes a CPO, because it has the power, it is still the Secretary of State who decides whether it can exercise that power. I suppose that it is a matter of emphasis between us, but I do not know.<br/>
I should like to deal briefly with some of the other points. The hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Budgen) made his usual all-stages speech. It was not a Second Reading speech, but it was an all-purpose one. He makes it very well, whether it is apposite or not. As it happens, on this occasion it was not really apposite, because the amendments have no implications concerning compensation. However, I like listening to him and I have grown to listen to what he says with interest. He always says everything well.<br/>
I should like to tell the House what I believe are good reasons why we should not have left acquisition to the existing housing and planning Acts, including the Housing Act 1971, which was the child of the right hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Page). The Land Authority for Wales is not a local authority, and therefore we should have had to make some provision anyway in the Bill for it to be able to acquire. In general, if we made arrangements under the existing housing and planning Acts there would be two types of fragmentation. First, there would be fragmented compulsory purchase orders. They would not be insuperable, but they are messy, difficult and time consuming. Secondly, I am sure that the right hon. Member for Crosby, when considering the matter purely as a draftsman&#x2014;I accept that he dislikes intensely the whole principle of the Bill&#x2014;would accept that it is desirable in a Bill to get all the powers together. Therefore, that would be much better than leaving this to be done, as has been suggested, under the existing housing and planning powers. Indeed, as these powers already exist, the only real objection to them along that line of argument is duplication. However, in my view, as a


matter of tidiness, we should put them in this legislation.<br/>
I promise not to keep the House long on these amendments, because there is this difference which, as the hon. Member for Hornsey fairly said, exists between us. I am sure that I would weary the House if I kept on repeating myself</p>

<p>This is a concession made to the Opposition in another place, since the existing wording under the present compulsory purchase legislation has been considered by the Government and we believe that it is adequate. The effect of these amendments is to restore in respect of compulsory purchase orders under the Bill relating to development land the requirements of Schedule I to the Acquisition of Land Acts, or Regulations made thereunder, that the purpose for which the land is required has to be specified.</p>

<p>My point is that the Minister said that he is prepared to concede this amendment to the other place on the ground that adequate protection existed in the basic legislation of 1946 and 1947. On the face of it, the layman could find comfort in paragraph (2) which is being deleted. Therefore, one is caused to ask how it comes about that we have this superfluity introduced into the Bill at a drafting stage and persisting within the text of it for such a long time when the Minister can now say with such abandon that it is superfluous.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1975-11-11a.1242.1" hansard_membership_id="7490" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/32714" speakername="Mr. Graham Page" colnum="1242" time="">
<p>I agree with my hon. Friend that it is confusing to see the removal of a paragraph which seems to be for the citizen's benefit when he is involved in compulsory purchase. As I understand it, however, the purpose of removing the paragraph is that, as it stands, it says that although, under normal compulsory purchase procedure, the acquiring authority has to specify the purpose for which the land is being acquired, the paragraph states that, far from specifying the purpose, if the authority specifies the reasons for its acquisition, that will be taken to be the purpose.<br/>
It emerged in Committee that we were urging that in the procedure under the Bill we should have the same procedure as normally applies on compulsory purchase orders&#x2014;that the acquiring authority must say the purpose for which the acquisition is being made, so that the person from whom the property is being acquired can say that it should not be acquired for that purpose because it is not a true or worthwhile purpose.<br/>
We got an amendment to that procedure by abolishing the specifying of the


purpose, a concession that if the reasons why an authority wanted to acquire the property were specified, that would be sufficient. The reason might be that the town clerk rather liked the look of the land, with perfectly good reason; but that would not be the purpose for which it was required. It might be required for housing or development or because it was a good planning objective. I now understand that the Minister has conceded the whole of our point and has restored the normal compulsory purchase procedure to this new procedure so far as the acquiring authority must specify the purpose for the acquisition. To that extent, we would support the removal of this paragraph.</p>

<p>I am doubly grateful to the right hon. Gentleman, first for explaining the thoughts which were in my mind, although I shall come back to them, but second and much more for explaining what his hon. Friend meant, which I found some difficulty in understanding, though no doubt he was totally clear in his own mind.<br/>
As between reasons and purpose&#x2014;this is really what it is about&#x2014;I have never understood where the difference lies. I understand that in Spanish, a language with which I have no great acquaintance, there are two words for "why"&#x2014;<i>perque</i> and <i>porque.</i> No doubt, if one can make a distinction between two uses of the same word, one can make a real distinction between "reasons" and "purpose". But the plain reason why the purpose we undertook was to change "reason" into "purpose" was that it seemed not to make all that much difference, it created an equality with previous compulsory purchase provisions and seemed to satisfy my hon. Friends, noble Lords and hon. Members opposite. So who are we to complain?</p>

<p>I think that we should consider Lords Amendments Nos. 43 and 44 together and No. 45 separately.<br/>
Amendments Nos. 43 and 44 treat land with no outstanding interests in the same way as excepted development for compulsory purchase orders. The reason for this amendment is one of logic. There are two ways in which the Bill provides for taking things outside the normal scope of the scheme&#x2014;one by means of the excepted development Regulations under Clause 3 and the other by the use of the concept of outstanding material interests under Clause 4. The different approaches are needed because in one case the exclusion depends on the nature of the development and in the other on the nature of the interest. But from the point of view of Schedule 4 it is logical to have the same treatment, however the exclusion is achieved.<br/>
Lords Amendment No. 45 provides that a certificate to be provided with a compulsory purchase order under paragraph 1(2) cannot be questioned in any legal proceedings. The Bill originally defined a certificate as conclusive evidence of the facts stated in it. The amendment is designed to cover the slight anxiety of some of their Lordships that, if a certificate was to be conclusive, it could bind the Secretary of State in considering a compulsory purchase order. It is difficult to see how this could happen because the Secretary of State would be exercising his discretion on whether to reply on the modified CPO procedure to which the certificate is primarily directed, but the amendment is helpful because it makes the position much clearer.</p>

<p>If the certificates are not to be questioned in any legal proceedings, it will be impossible to carry appeals on matters of law to the High Court if certificates have been granted without proper consideration or if they are invalid.<br/>
I appreciate that the original version of this paragraph was a useful way of avoiding unnecessary evidence in courts, but, whereas a certificate might be conclusive of the facts stated in it, it might still be subject to legal objections because


it was issued in a fraudulent way or without proper discretion being exercised. I am highly suspicious of this amendment. I do not know whether my party supported it in another place or whether it was put into the Bill by the Government, but I do not think it is better than what is already in the Bill. In fact, it is a lot worse because it might preclude a person from questioning the wrong method of issuing a certificate.</p>

<p>Despite listening to the Minister's explanation of the amendment and following what he was saying on the notes he has so kindly shared around, I am at a complete loss to understand the purpose of the amendments, particularly Nos. 43 and 44. Paragraph 1 (2) of Schedule 4 states:
<q>Modications made by paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 below shall not have effect unless the land comprised in the compulsory purchase order is development land, and&#x2026;".</q>
Lords Amendments Nos. 43 and 44 would make that part of the Bill read:
<q>The modifications&#x2026;shall not have effect unless there are no material interests comprised in the compulsory purchase order other than outstanding material interests in development land, and&#x2026;".</q>
In order to understand this, one must turn back to the definitions in Clause 4 where "material interest" is defined in relation to land as
<q>the freehold or a lease, the unexpired term of which at the relevant time is not less than seven years".</q>
Having read that explanation, I am at a complete loss to understand what change the right hon. Gentleman is attempting to achieve. I understand the Bill as it is at present and I understand the definition of "material interest" in Clause 4, but can the right hon. Gentleman explain exactly what is achieved by the proposed changes? Despite having put a wet towel round my head I cannot for the life of me understand these amendments, and I have had a reasonable affinity with this Bill for some months.</p>

<p>From time to time&#x2014;one hopes very rarely&#x2014;a position of confrontation arises between the two Houses of Parliament. When that happens, so the history books tell us, it is always because another place is dominated by a somewhat reactionary political party

whereas the natural governors of this House are my right hon. and hon. Friends. The problem that is presented to me by the right hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) is that the amendment he dislikes so much&#x2014;and which my noble Friends in the other place at first themselves did not like very much&#x2014;was moved by Lord Colville of Culross. It was drafted and supported with considerable vigour by that noble Lord.<br/>
If we are to have confrontation between the two Houses of Parliament which consists of confrontation between the right hon. Member for Crosby and Lord Colville, I prefer to stay neutral. However, I do not think I can. I am there-for in the unfortunate position&#x2014;and I hope that I have the sympathy of the House in this&#x2014;of deciding between the right hon. Gentleman and the noble Lord. I have equal respect, affection and admiration for them, so what am I to do? I regret to say that I have come down on the side of the noble Lord. For these reasons&#x2014;not very good, I confess&#x2014;and for these purposes, I think we had better, perhaps, stick with the noble Lord's amendment.<br/>
The hon. Member for Melton (Mr. Latham) referred to Lords Amendments Nos. 43 and 44. They are particularly important in the case of a material interest in land by charities on White Paper day which under Clause 4 should not be treated as outstanding. They are, however, also of considerable significance to the other authorities and bodies mentioned in that provision, especially local authorities and parish and community councils, to whose land special parliamentary procedure will no longer apply by virtue of Clause 40. Under that clause, if they objected to a compulsory purchase order under the Bill in respect of their land, an inquiry or hearing would be automatic. That should be welcomed by them as giving their land a special measure of protection.</p>

<p>What is the difference between the word "land" as it stands in the Bill and "outstanding material interests" as in the amendment? What material interest other than land does the right hon. Gentleman have in mind?</p>

<p>I refer to charity land as an example of this. It could be development land. Thus, with the Bill as drafted,


the modified CPO procedure could apply to the acquisition of charity land. Charity interests are not outstanding material interests and therefore, under the amendment, the modified CPO procedures could not be applied.</p>

<p>I beg to move, That this House doth disagree with the Lords in the said amendment.<br/>
This amendment would limit the Secretary of State's power to dispense with a public inquiry or hearing into a compulsory purchase order on the basis of a planning permission granted on appeal, to cases where the planning permission was of a kind consistent with the purpose of acquisition.<br/>
Sub-paragraph (3) in the new paragraph 4 to Schedule 1 of the Acquisition of Land Acts, inserted by paragraph 3 of Schedule 4 to the Bill, deals with the situations in which the Secretary of State has power to dispense with a public inquiry or hearing. They are, broadly, where planning permission has been granted for relevant development following the holding of a public inquiry, or where the grant of such

permission would be in accordance with an adopted or approved statutory plan. This definition of the scope of the Secretary of State's discretion to dispense with a public inquiry was inserted at Commons Report stage, following intensive discussion in Committee, and with the Council on Tribunals, which expressed itself content with the approach then adopted.<br/>
This amendment attempts to qualify one of the three heads in sub-paragraph (3)&#x2014;that dealing with the situation where planning permission for relevant development has been granted after an inquiry. It says that in this case, but not in those cases where the grant of planning permission for relevant development would be in accordance with the plan, the development for which planning permission has been granted must be consistent with the purpose of acquisition which the authority specifies when it makes a compulsory purchase order.<br/>
At first glance, the amendment may appear to have some attraction, but on closer inspection it appears that these attractions spring from a misunderstanding of the basic principle of subsection (3), together with a confusion over the respective r&#x00F4;les of planning inquiries and inquiries into compulsory purchase orders.


The principle of the scheme is that development land&#x2014;that is, land needed for relevant development within 10 years&#x2014;should come into public ownership.<br/>
Once it has been settled that land is development land, there is a presumption in favour of public ownership. It is on this basis that it is reasonable for the Secretary of State to have power to dispense with an inquiry. Any planning permission for relevant development makes land development land. There having been an opportunity for those with an interest in the land to object at the earlier stage&#x2014;either to the actual grant of planning permission or to the adoption or approval of the plan&#x2014;there is no case for the Secretary of State to hold a further inquiry into a proposed compulsory acquisition, whatever the purpose for which the authority concerned was proposing to acquire the land.<br/>
We could not accept the general proposition that an inquiry into a compulsory purchase order would be the right place to consider the planning merits of the way in which the authority intended that the land should be developed. Of course, a change in planning proposals will be a matter of concern to neighbouring owners. But, in general, it would not seem to matter to an individual owner whether his land was to be taken for one kind of relevant development rather than another.<br/>
This is the logical and philosophical case against the amendment, and it explains why the Government cannot accept it. But it must be emphasised that all that these provisions do is to give the Secretary of State discretion to dispense with an inquiry where one of the conditions in sub-paragraph (3) is satisfied. It does not follow that the Secretary of State will always dispense with an inquiry wherever he has power to do so. He will have to exercise his discretion reasonably. There may well be cases where it will still be right to hold an inquiry even where one of the conditions is satisfied&#x2014;and a change in planning intentions may be one such circumstance.</p>

<p>The right hon. Gentleman has put forward a most extraordinary philosophical argument. When he left his brief for a moment he turned to philosophy. How he can argue this

on a philosophical basis I am not sure. His objection to the Lords amendment, as he said when reading his brief at the beginning of his speech, is that it limits the Secretary of State's powers to dispense with an inquiry. It would have been better if he had said that he is objecting because he wants to limit the right of an individual to an inquiry. That is what we are talking about.<br/>
I do not care about the Secretary of State's discretion to limit the individual with regard to public inquiries. I am concerned with whether the individual who is having his land taken away will have the right to an inquiry. By his opposition to the Lords amendment the right hon. Gentleman is depriving certain individuals in certain cases of the right to an inquiry into whether their land should be compulsorily purchased.<br/>
Let me go back to the beginning, because I do not believe that the Minister has put the case before the House. The schedule to which this is an amendment is brought into the Bill by Clause 15&#x2014;the clause giving local authorities the power to acquire land in circumstances extended far beyond those applying at present. When using these extended powers, they will use an abbreviated procedure, which is set out in Schedule 4. It is Schedule 4 and that abbreviated procedure about which we are talking.<br/>
What Schedule 4, and particularly paragraph 3, says is that if an objection duly made is not withdrawn:
<q>then, before confirming the order, the confirming authority may if it considers it expedient to do so, and shall if sub-paragraph (3) below applies&#x2014;(<i>a</i>) cause a public inquiry to be held".</q>
It is only if that sub-paragraph applies.<br/>
In the following sub-paragraph we are told when it does apply and when it does not apply. It is always a little confusing to move from the positive to the negative, but this is the way it works. If there has been planning permission given in respect of this land which is to be compulsorily acquired, the Secretary of State may dispense with the inquiry. This is in respect of any planning permission.<br/>
Let us suppose that the planning permission was for desirable residences, perhaps one to the acre, for the development of the land. The local authority may wish to acquire a property for the purpose of


building an abattoir. What has the planning permission for desirable residences to do with the new purpose for which the land is being acquired? We can all think of comparisons between different types of planning permission. It is the height of illogicality to say that the Secretary of State shall deprive the owner of a property with planning permission of the right to an inquiry. There is nothing philosophical about it. It is a practical matter.<br/>
It was stated earlier that paragraph 2 of the schedule had been deleted. That paragraph stated that in future the acquiring authority would not need to state the purpose for which it was acquiring a property. However, that procedure has now been restored. The acquiring authority must state the purpose for the acquisition. What is the purpose of such a statement if no one is to be allowed to question it? It is illogical that an owner should be deprived of an inquiry as a result of this irrelevant planning permission procedure.<br/>
Throughout the debates on the Bill we have objected to the fact that the citizen is deprived of his rights as a result of the compulsory purchase procedure. The purpose of the Bill is to enable the local authority to acquire the development land. But the local authority will be allowed to acquire the land for practically any purpose it thinks fit. The Minister argued that we need not worry about compulsory purchase inquiries. He asked what there was to inquire into. The Bill specifies that development land shall be acquired by means of a compulsory purchase order. That being so, why should the Secretary of State have the discretion whether to hold an inquiry? Let us be honest and abolish the compulsory purchase order inquiries procedure and steamroller the measure through in a dictatorial fashion. It seems that that is what the Minister wants to do.<br/>
While there is power to hold an inquiry, let the procedure be sensible. We do not support the inquiry procedure originally suggested. Their Lordships have corrected the procedure in a small but important particular. I hope that the House will support their Lordships.</p>

<p>I support my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby

(Mr. Page). I am greatly disturbed. From my experience of local government, I know that it is difficult for local authorities to act when dealing with compulsory purchase orders. Many families have grievously suffered as a result of CPOs, but until now owners have had the right to call for a public inquiry. They have had the opportunity at a public inquiry to question the uses to which the local authority states that the land will be put.<br/>
As I understand my right hon. Friend&#x2014;to whom I am grateful for making matters clearer&#x2014;the local authority may wish substantially to change the type of development for which planning permission has been given. The residents in the area know that there is an outstanding planning application for a certain type of development to which they have not objected. A completely different type of development may then be proposed because the local authority has changed political colour or has altered its strategy.<br/>
The Minister says that he may on occasion agree to a public inquiry but, depending on how he feels, he may say that there is no necessity for one. Once again the local people will have to create a furore to get a public inquiry. It is wrong to rely on the energy and resources of the local people to make such a fuss that in the end the Secretary of State has no option but to grant a public inquiry.<br/>
9.15 p.m<br/>
Their Lordships have put forward sensible, straightforward arguments to the right hon. Gentleman. I believe that the right hon. Gentleman wishes to safeguard the rights of the individual. He certainly gave that impression in Committee. If he does not wish to do that, he should say so. Their Lordships have made a contribution here which, if not of enormous moment, is useful, because it protects the rights of the individual and is a safeguard against his having to build up a froth of activity to get a public inquiry. I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will think again and see the considerable merit of the amendment.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1975-11-11a.1254.0" hansard_membership_id="7595" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/30476" speakername="Mr. Michael Latham" colnum="1254" time="">
<p>I was surprised that the Minister should ask the House to reject the amendment, which is one of the most meritorious of all the amendments which the Lords have made against the wishes of the Government.<br/>
As the Bill stands, the Secretary of State has power to refuse a public inquiry into a compulsory purchase order if the confirming authority is satisfied that planning permission for relevant development is in force in respect of the land comprised in the order&#x2014;not specific relevant development but any relevant development. Their Lordships rightly considered this to be unsatisfactory. Justice was critical of this procedure in one of its memoranda.<br/>
Their Lordships want to make sure that the development shall be of a kind that is consistent with the purpose specified as that for which the land is acquired. It is elementary justice that a person whose land is to be acquired shall not have it taken away from him without having the right to put his case. If a person has his land taken away without a specific inquiry, which would be of use to him, as opposed to a generalised inquiry into the development plan which may already have taken place, it is wrong to say that he shall not have that unusual power if the planning permission which is in force is different from that which is envisaged in future.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman was less forthcoming than he usually is. He gave only a brief explanation, and I understand why. He wishes to make progress. None of us has any objection to that, but there are many hon. Members in the House, if not in the Chamber, who are not as familiar with the Bill as is the right hon. Gentleman. In particular, they are perhaps not as familiar with the discussion in the House of Lords on 24th October.<br/>
My noble Friend Viscount Colville of Culross moved this amendment. I am not allowed to quote him, but I am allowed to quote Lord Melchett, who was the Government spokesman. I think that Lord Melchett got himself into rather a mess. That is not directly our concern, except that the right hon. Gentleman has not helped much to untangle it, so we need to get it clear now.<br/>
In resisting the amendment, Lord Melchett said:
<q>In cases falling within paragraph 3(3)(<i>a</i>), the Secretary of State will need to have granted planning permission after a public inquiry for development falling within the definition of 'relevant development'. In that event, the principle that the land falls within the scope

of the land scheme will have been settled. If there was any proposal to carry out relevant development of a kind not covered by the planning permission granted by the Secretary of State, a further planning inquiry would have to be held, if the planning procedure so required.</q>
That is simply not accurate. There is nothing in the Bill to show that a further planning inquiry would have to be held. The right hon. Gentleman has not made any such suggestion. He has told us that in certain circumstances, he would feel it necessary to grant such a public inquiry even if, on the strict wording of the Bill, he was under no obligation to do so.<br/>
On this matter Lord Colville challenged Lord Melchett, who then said, rather differently from what he had said previously:
<q>When deciding whether or not to have an inquiry the Secretary of State would, of course, bear in mind whether the reasons stated by the authority were justified by the previous inquiry. If an authority, having bought land on the basis of a plan, wants to grant permission for some other kind of development&#x2026;the proposal will be subject to public participation.</q>
Again I have to correct Lord Melchett. There is no obligation that the proposal should be subject to public participation. Where, in the planning manuals and Acts, in the circumstances I have described, and to which Lord Melchett was referring, is there provision that the proposal will be subject to public participation? I think that Lord Melchett was in error.<br/>
Later in his speech, he qualified what he had said. He stated that
<q>the Department encourages local authorities to put their proposals to public participation in cases where this would be necessary if the proposals were being carried out by a private person. We propose to amend the general regulations to make it an obligation on local authorities to do so in such circumstances.</q>
It is not that they have to do so but that new Regulations are to be made which we have not seen, the contents of which we do not know and which will make it obligatory to have public participation.<br/>
The House may regard this as an extremely unsatisfactory state of affairs. We are asked to disagree with the Lords amendment based on remarks made by Lord Melchett which have not been fully amplified by the right hon. Gentleman and which are at the least misleading and certainly require elucidation.<br/>
When the noble Lord was dealing specifically with this amendment&#x2014;Amendment No. 55A in another place&#x2014;he said:
<q>The reasons given by the authority go to the merits of the order rather than whether the planning background is such that an inquiry or hearing may be dispensed with. But the reasons given by the authority would be taken into account in deciding whether it was expedient to hold an inquiry."&#x2014;[<i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 24th October 1975; Vol. 354, c. 1774&#x2013;7.]</q>
I emphasise the words
<q>the reasons given by the authority would be taken into account in deciding whether it was expedient to hold an inquiry.</q>
That is simply not good enough for the rights of the citizen. The rights of the citizen should be absolutely clear. If his land is to be taken from him, he should have the right to go to a public inquiry and to put his case in terms which relate to his plot of land. He should not have to go to a general development plan inquiry and try to get his oar in there and be told by the inspector, if it be a structure plan inquiry, that it is too general a hearing to deal with his specific point.<br/>
Here we have an even worse consideration, where an inquiry is held and there is then to be another planning permission different from what was originally in force, different from what was originally envisaged, and then, on the basis of the reasons given by the local authority&#x2014;not the rights of the individual or the specific circumstances of his case, but the reasons given by the local authority&#x2014;the Secretary of States decides whether it is expedient to hold a public inquiry. I do not believe that anyone here who has considered this matter seriously would regard that as in any way a satisfactory state of affairs.<br/>
When the right hon. Gentleman replies to the debate, I hope he will tell us, first, why it was that Lord Melchett, as a member of the Government, in dealing with the amendments, gave to another place what I can only consider a mistaken description of the position. This seems to me to be a matter of some importance. I should like to know why the right hon. Gentleman, in introducing the debate, made no attempt at all to explain it and why he came to the House with so little explanation that he was prepared to stand by and ask this House to allow

people to have their land taken away without the right of public inquiry where a different planning permission was envisaged.<br/>
I call that a disgraceful state of affairs, and I believe that the people of this country think so too.</p>

<p>I warmly support the comments on this matter from the Conservative side. I should not have thought that the House of Lords, in propounding Amendment No. 47, was asking very much. One detected that the Minister seemed to be saying that the amendment neither added nor subtracted anything. I happen to think that it adds quite a lot, and I hope that my hon. Friends will support the House of Lords in this amendment.<br/>
I want to deviate from the general argument and press the Minister about interpretation. It may be that I have come rather too late to the scene. I am by no means a legal or drafting expert, but we are now talking about the contents of paragraph 3, which deals with substitutions for paragraph 4 of Schedule 1. I have been searching the schedule&#x2014;</p>

<p>Precisely, and one learns this through going back to the preceding paragraph 2, which is now deleted. Paragraph 2 read:
<q>So much of Schedule 1 or of any regulations made under the Act of 1946",</q>
and so on. That is now deleted. I emphasise again that I am not discussing this matter as a legal expert. But I wonder how anyone picking up this document would be able to identify the schedule in question.<br/>
Pursuing this argument in a little more detail, I notice that in line 12 we start with the opening of quotations, but I look in vain for their closing. We are invited to substitute "the following paragraph". May we be told which is the following paragraph? The quotations do not terminate anywhere.<br/>
I am at a loss about Schedule I, having seen paragraph 2 deleted. I am also at a loss about "the following paragraph" in that the quotations do not terminate, and there is no one paragraph obviously


to be substituted, but a series of sub-paragraphs.</p>

<p>My right hon. and hon. Friends have made out an overwhelming case. The Secretary of State is seeking to limit the rights of the individual to an inquiry, and we cannot believe that that is correct. His argument is that there is an earlier chance to object during the planning permission process. But that is not sufficient. Circumstances change. I cannot see why the right hon. Gentleman should seek to remove this right.<br/>
Again, what is the value of the requirement on the local authority to state reasons for acquisition if there need not be an inquiry? It is possible for the reasons to change. There is no necessary way in which it is possible to challenge.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman has failed to sustain his argument. I hope that my right hon. and hon. Friends will support their Lordships in this amendment.</p>

<p>With some diffidence, I had better deal first with the matters raised by the hon. Member for Sudbury and Woodbridge (Mr. Stainton). I confess that I thought that he bowled an extremely fast ball. However, I understand that the quotes terminate in page 57, line 41. The paragraph to be substituted is a new paragraph 4 in page 56, line 12, just after the quotes open. I hope that that explains that difficulty, though I must say that, reading it quickly, it does not really explain it to me. However, I am sure that the hon. Gentleman has had time to follow it and has already seen that it is correct.</p>

<p>Perhaps I might be allowed to return to that in a moment. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman is wrong and that we can show it to him in due course.<br/>
I turn then to the hon. Member for Melton (Mr. Latham). His remarks give rise to three comments. First, he and his hon. Friends do not agree with the purpose of the Bill. That is one of the matters on which we can never agree, and

there it is. Naturally, when we introduce a Bill the purpose of which is to give local authorities the power and then the duty to acquire all land on which relevant development is to take place in their areas, I do not expect the Opposition to begin cheering. So when we come to that, of course there is a difference between us.<br/>
Therefore, naturally there is a difference of view concerning development land and whether it should be acquired. Whether the land is development land for one purpose or another logically and philosophically makes no difference. The scheme is concerned with the acquisition of relevant development land by local authorities.<br/>
The hon. Member for Melton spoke about my noble Friend Lord Melchett. On the question of a public inquiry he probably said that there "would" be a public inquiry instead of saying that there "could" be a public inquiry. However, I understand that the position has now been corrected and therefore there should be no misconception about that matter.</p>

<p>This is obviously a most important point. Lord Melchett said:
<q>a further planning inquiry would have to be held".&#x2014;[<i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 24th October, 1975; Vol 364, c. 1775.]</q>
Is the Minister saying that the noble Lord made a mistake and subsequently corrected <i>Hansard,</i> that he was wrongly reported, or what?</p>

<p>No. I am saying that the noble Lord in the long watches of the night or day slipped into saying "would" rather than "could". It is a mistake that some hon. Gentlemen make. Even the hon. and learned Member for Kinross and West Perthshire (Mr. Fairbairn) has been known to make a mistake. I remember that on one occasion he even called me "learned".</p>

<p>Will the Minister explain what would be the meaning if, even in the long watches of the night&#x2014;we have not reached that stage yet&#x2014;the noble Lord had said "A planning inquiry could have to be held"? That would be rubbish.</p>

<p>That is not what I said. I said that the noble Lord slipped into


saying that there "would" rather than there "could" be a public inquiry. He said "would" when he meant "could". There is a sense in which the noble Lord was right, but I shall deal with that matter in a moment.<br/>
I turn to the point raised by the hon. Member for Sudbury and Woodbridge. I have further news for him. The reference to Schedule 1 derives from paragraph 1 of Schedule 4 which deals with modification to the Acquisition of Land Acts. Therefore, it is Schedule 1 of those Acts which is being modified.<br/>
I return to the point raised by the hon. Member for Melton. I was saying that there was a sense in which the noble Lord was right. The noble Lord was talking about participation as well as an inquiry. I hope the hon. Gentleman agrees that where there is a major departure from a plan, there has to be an advertisement. I am sure that the right hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) agrees with me about this, because we can revert to the 1971 Act of which we are both so fond. If there is an advertisement, is there not also the opportunity of participation? Surely that must be so.</p>

<p>I am in some difficulty, because under the rules of order I must paraphrase rather than quote. However, on 24th October&#x2014;c. 1775 of <i>Hansard</i>&#x2014;my noble Friend Viscount Colville of Culross made the point that the Department had just issued Circular 96/75, which substantially modified the old rules about departures and reduced the number of occasions when local authorities have to advertise such departures. Will the Minister comment on that?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1975-11-11a.1261.1" hansard_membership_id="10169" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/20635" speakername="Mr. Silkin" colnum="1261" time="">
<p>I was talking about a major departure from the plan and not about what the noble Lord said. I am concerned with the truth of the matter. I want to put this situation to the hon. Member for Melton and to the right hon. Member for Crosby, with whose rather interesting illustration I propose to deal. The point is that where there is a major departure from a plan, it becomes nearly certain&#x2014;it depends what kind of major departure it is&#x2014;that the Secretary of State would exercise his discretion.<br/>
Perhaps I may use the illustration given by the right hon. Member for Crosby to show the force of the argument. We are

dealing with a compulsory purchase order inquiry, not the planning situation. Someone proposes to sell land which the local authority has said is residential land, but then the authority decides that it will be suitable for the erection of an abattoir. I do not think that an abattoir is a good example because, as the right hon. Gentleman knows, other considerations may apply. Nevertheless, let us assume some rather noisome, unfortunate development for those living nearby. We all know that certain other developments might be considered nuisances by neighbours.<br/>
From the point of view of the person selling the land on which a CPO is placed, it does not make any difference. At that stage there has been a planning inquiry. Now the question is whether there should be another inquiry on the compulsory purchase order. It does not matter to the person selling the land. To whom does it matter? It matters to his neighbours, because there will be a total change in the area from residential to something else which they might not find so attractive. In that case the Secretary of State would use his discretion.</p>

<p>Yes, he would. The right hon. Gentleman would do it just as I would do it in those cases. There is no question about that.<br/>
Let me take a better illustration, which has been put forward by hon. Gentlemen opposite. I want to put the argument as strongly as I can. Let us take the case of someone who owns land part of which has been compulsorily acquired. Let us assume that the authority has zoned all the land for residential purposes and, because it was looking only five years ahead, acquired part of it and then on the other part wanted to build an abattoir, or whatever it may be. The Secretary of State would look at that case and say "This is a bit different. There will be a great difference in the planning procedures regarding that land. Of course there must be an inquiry." In those two examples that I have given the Secretary of State would exercise his discretion.</p>

<p>The right hon. Gentleman is giving illustrations of circumstances in which the Secretary of State would grant a public inquiry, that


is, would not exercise his right to forbid a public inquiry on the ground that one had already taken place. Will he indicate in what circumstances there would not be a public inquiry?</p>

<p>I should like to finish my train of thought. I was hoping that the hon. Gentleman would be very much on it. I was dealing with the point made by the right hon. Member for Crosby who, in his usual histrionic and dramatic fashion, asked "Why on earth does he want to bother with his discretion? He will take it in all cases." I was attempting to give examples of cases in which the Secretary of State would be virtually duty bound to do it. These are important cases, especially as the first one was illustrated by the right hon. Gentleman.</p>

<p>The Minister is persisting in the argument that the compulsory purchase order is for the acquisition of development land and that therefore nobody can argue about it. But the argument which is used in compulsory purchase order inquiries is that there is no reason to acquire the land for the purpose stated by the acquiring authority, that the purpose is not there, or it is a bad purpose. That is the basis of the present CPO inquiries. Is that to go altogether? Is not the objector to have a chance to say that the purpose is wrong, unnecessary, or irrelevant?</p>

<p>This brings us to our fundamental differences. That is why, although I thought that the right hon. Gentleman was chiding me about talking logic and philosophy, it is logic and philosophy that divide us. Our logic and philosophy believe that land on which relevant development takes place should be publicly owned. That is where we differ from the right hon. Gentleman. I am therefore saying that where land exists on which relevant development is to take</p>

<p>place, it does not matter whether it is one development or another. It is relevant development, so the local authority should acquire it.</p>

<p>What is the purpose of the sub-paragraph that their Lordships are trying to amend, that the individual will have the right to a public inquiry if there is planning permission for relevant development? Why take that out altogether if he cannot argue that?</p>

<p>I am trying to explain that the Secretary of State may want to exercise his discretion. I do not expect the right hon. Gentleman to go along with my philosophy, but, looking at it through the philosophical eyes of believing that all relevant development land should be publicly-owned, surely he would want the Secretary of State to have discretion to say, in the case that he gave us, that residential land to abattoir was a major development and a case for discretion.<br/>
The hon. Member for Melton asked whether there were cases where the Secretary of State would not exercise his discretion: of course&#x2014;in the general course of events where he was satisfied that the land was relevant development land and there was no other indication of a planning change which was major or would embarrass or cause difficulty to those living in the neighbourhood.<br/>
What divides us is the political and philosophical division. That is a proper division for two political parties. If Conservative Members feel so strongly about it that they wish to test the strength of feeling in the Lobby, I regard that as perfectly within their rights, and I shall be happy to see the result tested.</p>

<p>I beg to move, That this House doth disagree with the Lords in the said amendment.<br/>
The purpose of the amendment is to limit the Secretary of State's power to dispense with a public inquiry into a compulsory purchase order on the basis of an adopted or approved local plan to cases where there had been a public inquiry into that plan.<br/>
The amendment is not concerned with a very wide point. When it was debated in another place there was no dispute that the combined effect of Section 13 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1971 and the Regulations made under it was to ensure that where there is an objection to a local plan there will always be a public inquiry before that plan can be adopted or approved. But the argument put forward was that, in some cases, a local plan might have been adopted without an inquiry because there were no objections to it.<br/>
In practice, it is almost inconceivable that this will happen. But if it were to happen, there seems no reason whatever for binding the Secretary of State to hold an inquiry into the CPO. The only argument that was put forward for this proposition in the Lords was that, whilst there might at the time have been good reasons for a person not objecting to a local plan, circumstances might have changed by the time the CPO was made. But this could arise equally where there had been a public inquiry into the local plan. It is precisely to allow for this possibility that there is simply a power to dispense with a public inquiry rather than an automatic provision for proceeding without an inquiry.<br/>
There is, therefore, nothing special to distinguish cases where a local plan has been adopted without an inquiry from cases where there has been an inquiry. The amendment is therefore misguided. But the fact that circumstances had changed substantially since a previous inquiry&#x2014;or since a plan had been adopted without an inquiry&#x2014;is precisely the sort of point that the Secretary of

State would need to consider in exercising his discretion on this matter.<br/>
As I have said in many of these debates, the Secretary of State is responsible to the House for his decisions.</p>

<p>The Undersecretary said that in no case, if there was an objection, would there fail to be a local inquiry. The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that the citizen whose land is being taken away from him can require an inquiry into the compulsory purchase order to see that there is a proper purpose for acquiring the land. As the Bill stands, he is to be deprived of that right to an inquiry if there has been an inquiry into a local plan or if there is a local plan which has been approved, whether there has been a public inquiry or not.<br/>
The Under-Secretary of State seeks to justify his argument by saying that a plan would not be approved without a public inquiry if objections were made. That does not meet the case entirely. Under Section 13 of the 1971 Act it is not necessary to have a public inquiry if there is an objection. What is required is another hearing. Even if there were an objection, the Secretary of State need not have a public inquiry but could have some form of hearing which might not be known to the person from whom the property was eventually to be acquired. Secondly, the person from whom the property was to be acquired might not have owned the property at the time of the inquiry into the local plan. Indeed, he might not have been living in the district. In that case, he would not have had the opportunity of objecting. There being no objection, there would be no local inquiry and no other type of hearing.<br/>
I base my objection to what the hon. Gentleman has been saying on the ground that Section 13 does not require the Secretary of State to have a public inquiry in every case where there is an objection. He can avoid having a public inquiry by having another form of hearing before an inspector. In that event, a citizen loses his right to have a public inquiry into a plan to acquire his property by means of a compulsory purchase order.</p>

<p>As, regrettably, the previous amendment was defeated, this amendment becomes even more


important. We are debating the rights of the citizen. As a result of the previous Division, we have limited the objections that a citizen can raise at a public inquiry. We must now press for the provision of a second inquiry. We have heard from my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) some of the reasons for taking such a stance. We must seek to protect the rights of the individual.<br/>
In another place, the protection of the individual citizen was the nub of the discussion. Like my hon. Friend the Member for Melton (Mr. Latham), having read the report of the debate I found the proceedings in another place to be somewhat confusing. The Opposition spokesman was the only participant who concentrated on the right of the individual to have his or her case heard before a public inquiry.<br/>
The Bill seeks to turn the local authority in to the planner, the developer and the organisation which takes the cash. It is only right that when that power is put in the hands of the local authority we should seek to strengthen the public inquiry provisions. Justice wrote to Members of Parliament on 26th September and made the very important point that circumstances could change between the first and second inquiries. The letter reads:
<q>For example, an area of houses may be zoned in the plan for residential purposes, the zoning reflecting the existing use. A proposal to put flats in that area would no doubt be ' in accordance with the provisions of the plan' because it is residential in character, but whether the area was suitable for redevelopment with flats would not have been an issue at the inquiry".</q>
That means that the individual would not have the right to object to the change which had taken place between the main plan and the present situation. That is an important aspect of a second inquiry.<br/>
I have been in local government for many years, and I have always thought that provisions to protect the citizen at public inquiries were not good enough. The individual finds himself in a weaker position than a local authority. The local authority often pays for the services of a legal adviser, sometimes a barrister, to put its case, but the ordinary citizen is on his own and often does not do well under cross-examination. Therefore, the

House of Commons should always try to assist the individual in his appearance at inquiries.<br/>
I thought that the House of Commons was the place where the individual's rights were protected. However, it would appear that the other place is the defender of the rights of the individual. Their Lordships take that r&#x00F4;le while the House of Commons appears to run roughshod over everybody. This is an amendment of importance, and we should seek to uphold it.</p>

<p>I wish to support the arguments in favour of the Lords amendment. Once gain, I wish to refer to the wit and wisdom of Lord Melchett, the Government Minister in charge of the Bill in another place. When resisting an amendment moved by my noble and learned Friend Lord Colville of Culross, Lord Melchett said:
<q>To put all that simply, if there is any valid objection to a local plan there will always have to be a public inquiry into the plan. Therefore, it is our view that the Amendment is not necessary. If there are no objections to local plans&#x2014;if someone has had the right to object to a local plan and thereby force an inquiry and has not done so&#x2014;we take the view that the Secretary of State should have the power to dispense with an inquiry."&#x2014;[<i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 5th November 1975, Vol. 365, c. 1170.]</q>
The noble Lord resisted the amendment because he could envisage a situation in which there would be no public inquiry because nobody had raised an objection. However, that is not the point at issue in this instance. The point is whether a private citizen should have his rights removed by having a compulsory purchase order made against him without having the opportunity of a hearing at which the matter would be considered. The person concerned might have moved into the area after the local plan had been draw up and the local situation might have changed dramatically since the plan was laid. That man might be unaware of what had happened at a previous local inquiry, and that again could cause great difficulty.<br/>
The provision in question envisages the Secretary of State having the power to say that a man's land can be confiscated by the State without his having any right to have the case heard in public. The Minister said earlier that there was a great political divide between the two sides of the House on this matter.<br/>
Indeed there is, because it is wrong that a man should have his house taken away from him without his having the right to put his case in public. That is the simple issue for the public to understand, and that is the important point to be considered as we go into the Lobby in support of the amendment.</p>

<p>I reinforce the arguments of my right hon. and hon. Friends in support of this amendment. We firmly and strongly believe that no private citizen should be dispossessed of his property, be it his home, garden or any piece of land he may own, without the opportunity to have the matter publicly discussed. The issue must first be arbitrated judicially, in public. We do not accept the proposition that the mere fact that there has been public participation in some kind of planning procedure should deny a man the right to have his own personal situation judicially determined in the open if he so desires, so that not only may justice be done but it may be seen to be done. That has always been a principle of justice in this country and it is one to which we should adhere.<br/>
This amendment seeks to avoid the situation when there may not be any kind of public discussion. If there is no objection to a local plan, there is no inquiry. It is only when there is an objection that there is a planning inquiry. We consider that to be insufficient even for compulsory purchase purposes. Here it is even worse. The purpose of the amendment is to insert words which will ensure that a public inquiry on a compulsory purchase can be omitted only after there has been a local inquiry or hearing. If there has been no such inquiry or hearing, there must be a public inquiry when a man is being sought to be dispossessed. I hope that my right hon. and hon. Friends will support their Lordships.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Hornsey (Mr. Rossi) and the right hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) have shifted their ground considerably since the argument on this amendment was pressed in the other place. What they are now saying is that they are opposed to a hearing instead of a public inquiry. If they read the amendment, they will see that that is not what it says. The

amendment says that there shall be an inquiry or a hearing. For the reasons I advanced when I asked the House to disagree with the Lords in this amendment, the arguments which Conservative Members are using when they say that there has not been an inquiry or hearing could equally apply when there had been such an inquiry or hearing. The man concerned could have moved to the area; circumstances could have changed. All of these things could have happened when there had been a hearing. In pressing this amendment, their Lordships were not using even remotely the same arguments as those used tonight.<br/>
The hon. Member for Reading, North (Mr. Durant) put forward a somewhat bizarre proposition, namely that their Lordships&#x2014;that palace of privileges&#x2014;were defending the rights of the ordinary citizens. I would prefer the rights of the ordinary citizen&#x2014;I am certain that Conservative Members would too&#x2014;to be looked after in this matter of inquiries not by their Lordships but by the Council on Tribunals. The Council was quite satisfied with this provision as drafted. It did not ask for any of the additions proposed by their Lordships. When the liberty of the individual and the rights of the citizen are involved, I would back the Council on Tribunals against their Lordships any day.</p>

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I wonder whether the Minister is making the best of his case, or helping it at all&#x2014;it is not a very good one&#x2014;by using such phrases as "palace of privileges" in describing another place&#x2014;</p>

<p>The hon. Member is intervening in a most impertinent manner. I have been here longer than he has.

<p>I seek clarification. I do not know what rights or powers the Under-Secretary has to reply to the debate. The anchor of the case he presented to the House was the responsibility of the Secretary of State, which we were assured would not be abused because ultimately he was answerable to the House. When I asked for examples of the responsibility of Secretaries of State in terms of public inquiries, I received the slick answer that this measure had not come into force. That was a deceptive and futile answer.<br/>
I obviously raised the question of the Secretary of State's responsibility in the context of town and country planning inquiries. All Members of Parliament have considerable traffic with Secretaries of State, of both parties, when trying to bring about public inquiries. Sometimes we are successful; at other times we are not successful. Although I admit that the Under-Secretary has some grounds on which to defend the situation which he described, if he rests his case on the answerability of the Secretary of State he must be more explicit. He must not try to pawn me off by saying that the Bill is not yet law. I referred to the context of the whole procedure.</p>

<p><i>Lords Amendment:</i> No. 49, in page 57, line 46, at end insert&#x2014;
<q>( ) Where the land comprised in a compulsory purchase order consists of a dwelling-house and the occupier of the dwelling-house

<q>( ) Where the land comprised in a compulsory purchase order comprises a dwelling-house together with other land and the occupier


of the dwelling-house duly objects to the order and that objection is not withdrawn, then, if the Secretary of State relies on the foregoing modifications made by this paragraph, he shall not confirm the compulsory purchase order without excluding the dwelling-house from that order.</q>
<q>( ) Where the land comprises in a compulsory purchase order consist of, or comprises with other land, a dwelling-house, the Secretary of State may disregard for the purpose of Schedule 1 any objection made by the occupier of the dwelling-house which in the opinion of the Secretary of Stale amounts in substance to an objection to the provisions of the development plan defining the proposed use of the dwelling-house or any other land.</q>
<q>( ) In this paragraph "dwelling-house" means any building or part of a building in which a person is residing, and includes any other building or part of a building in which a person normally resides but from which he is temporarily absent.</q></p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1975-11-11a.1283.0" hansard_membership_id="11129" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/19091" speakername="Mr. Oakes" colnum="1283" time="">
<p>I beg to move, That this House doth disagree with the Lords in the said amendment.<br/>
It is a somewhat complicated amendment. I therefore hope that I shall be forgiven for going into some of the details of it. Paragraph 3 of Schedule 4 provides for two modifications in compulsory purchase procedure. The first is the ability for the Secretary of State to dispense with an inquiry where the status of the land as development land has already been settled at an earlier inquiry. The second is the ability for the Secretary of State to disregard an objection made on the ground that the acquisition is unnecessary or inexpedient.<br/>
The amendment would disapply these modifications in relation to an objection made by a resident occupier and would provide instead that the Secretary of State could disregard an objection by such an occupier where he was of opinion that the objection amounted in substance to an objection to the provisions of the development plan defining the proposed use of the dwelling-house or of any other land.<br/>
This is an amendment the case for which was never fully explained by the Opposition in another place. Although it appears to disapply the modifications provided for in paragraph 3 of Schedule 4 where an objection by a residential occupier is concerned, it goes on to provide for a different modification in procedure which is taken from Section 132 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1971.<br/>
It is not easy to see what the Opposition were trying to achieve by their amendment in another place. Briefly, the comparison would seem to be as follows. First, on the basis proposed by the Government, the Secretary of State would be able to disregard an objection which amounted to an objection against the principle of public ownership, and as he was disregarding the objection he would clearly not need to hold an inquiry. Even in relation to an objection which could not be disregarded, he would have discretion to dispense with an inquiry where the status of land as development land had already been settled at an inquiry.<br/>
Secondly, under the Lords amendment the position would be as I have stated for all objectors other than residential occupiers, but the Secretary of State would be able to disregard such an occupier's objection&#x2014;and thus not hold an inquiry&#x2014;where he took the view that the objection was really an objection to the provisions of the development plan.<br/>
These are different ways of approaching the same thing, and it is not clear that there would be a great deal of difference between them in practice. Certainly there is a marked similarity between the tests for deciding whether an inquiry may be dispensed with&#x2014;in sub-paragraph (3)&#x2014;and the reliance on the provisions of the development plan in the Opposition's formulation of the circumstances in which the Secretary of State may disregard an objection and thus decide not to hold an inquiry.<br/>
This is not an issue which the Government wish to elevate into an argument of principle, although, with the mood of the House as it is at the moment, I have no doubt that the Opposition will do so. As has been explained in earlier debates, our approach to the disregard of objections is founded squarely on a provision which has been in existence in the New Towns Acts ever since 1946, and we do not see any reason to prefer the formulation in the Lords amendment which derives from the 1947 Planning Act. So far as the link with planning issues is concerned, it appears that the Government's statement in sub-paragraph (3) is both more comprehensive and better adapted to the circumstances of the Bill than the formulation which the Opposition have taken from the Planning Act.<br/>
No convincing argument has been put forward for holding that the provisions governing disregard of objections and dispensing with inquiries should be different for residential occupiers on the one hand and all other objectors on the other. If the argument had been that the modifications in sub-paragraph (3) should simply not apply to residential occupiers, that would be understandable, though not particularly logical. But it is difficult to see what is to be gained by having one basis for objectors generally and a somewhat different one for residential occupiers.<br/>
In these circumstances, there seems to be no case for the Lords amendment. The modifications in sub-paragraph (3) have been the subject of intensive discussion during the Bill's progress through this House, and they have been accepted by the Council on Tribunals. There would certainly need to be strong justification for making a switch at this stage, and no such justification has been put forward. I am at a loss to understand precisely what the Lords were seeking to achieve in their amendment.</p>

<p>At least the hon. Gentleman is right to say that this is a very complicated issue. When we try to explain the provisions of this measure to our constituents, we shall not find it easy.<br/>
In connection with this amendment, for example, Mr. Deputy Speaker, I have in mind a constituent coming into your surgery and asking "Can you advise me as to my rights under Section 15 of the Community Land Act?" When you look at Section 15(4), you will find yourself able to read to your constituent these golden words:
<q>The Acquisition of Land Acts shall apply in relation to the compulsory acquisition of land in pursuance of this section as if&#x2014;
<ol>
<li>(<i>a</i>) this section were contained in an Act in force immediately before the commencement of the Act of 1946, or as the case may be the Scottish Act of 1947,</li>
<li>(<i>b</i>) the Land Authority for Wales, a new town authority and the Peak Park Joint and Lake District Special Planning Boards were local authorities."</li>
</ol></q>
What is more, you can tell your constituent, who will be panting for a reply, that subsection (5) says:
<q>Schedule 4 to this Act in which&#x2014;
<ol>
<li>(<i>a</i>) Part I modifies the said Acts of 1946 and 1947 as applied by subsection (4) above,</li>

<li>(<i>b</i>) Part II deals with the acquisition of land by agreement&#x2026;".</li>
</ol></q>
Therefore, in search of the answer to your constituent's question, you will turn to the magic Schedule 4&#x2014;</p>

<p>Order. The hon. Gentleman is addressing himself to the possibility of one of my constituents asking me for advice and my reading the clause to him. Faced with that situation, I should adopt a much simpler course and say "I do not know".</p>

<p>In that case, Mr. Deputy Speaker, I hope that you would send him to a solicitor who would know and who would make money out of what he told him.<br/>
Having declared that interest, I suggest that you would then say to your constituent that these modifications to the Acquisition of Land Act start off by saying.
<q>Subject to sub-paragraph (2) below, the Acquisition of Land Acts shall apply in relation to the compulsory acquisition of land under section 15 of this Act with the modifications made by the following provisions of this Part of this Schedule.</q>
We are all considering this legislation, but none of us understands it well. [<i>Interruption.</i>] Even the hon. Member for Feltham and Heston (Mr. Kerr) says that he does not understand the amendments very well. It is not always easy to understand the Bill.<br/>
I am encouraged to think that we can have a good debate on this issue as a result of the speech made by Baroness Birk in the other place. As she is a Minister, I believe that I am allowed to quote what she had to say on this amendment, because it may lead us to have a more rational discussion. Her opening words were as follows:
<q>This Amendment has now become the principal Amendment on which we are discussing the question of the owner-occupier. There are one or two brief points that I feel I should make which are absolutely essential, because this thread has run through the stages of the two Second Reading debates and also the Committee stage of the Bill up to now.</q>
Those words can probably be understood both inside and outside the House.<br/>
The modifications in the amendments put forward by the other place are to clarify and strengthen the position of the owner-occupier.<br/>
In closing her remarks on this amendment, Baroness Birk said:
<q>One cannot defend the sort of system we have at the moment where we have so many people still not housed, and say that to continue a free market system would work. Nor can we accept the view that a development land tax alone will make this work. It is absolutely implicit to this whole scheme that the ownership and the planning should go together. I submit that the Government have done everything that is possible within the scheme to safeguard the position of the owner-occupier."&#x2014;[<i>Official Report, House of Lords</i>, 24th October 1975; Vol. 364, c. 1819,1823.]</q>
That is perhaps the crunch of what the Bill is about.<br/>
The implication and the consistent argument which has been put forward today, as on almost every other occasion when the Bill has been discussed, is that positive planning will be the absolute remedy to all the ills to which the present system of planning is subject. In my view this is an alarming proposition. If the negative planning which we now have has done so much harm to the country, I cannot imagine that positive planning can do anything but more harm. It has already been said that positive planning concerns the right of a local authority to take over land and develop it. That is what positive planning is about, and that view was put forward from the Government side of the House.<br/>
Like the noble Lords, we believe that, if there is to be this system of positive planning, the individual who may suffer from that system should be protected. There is no other reason for the amendments which are now being put forward. It is easy to say that the market system has failed and that we can put everything right with positive planning. A lot of people will vote for someone if he says, "By positive planning we shall provide you with more houses. All the profits which are being made under the free enterprise system will be made in future by the State." The Minister may say that under the provisions of the Bill the way that positive planning will work and be paid for is that for every &#x00A3;1 million which is paid to citizens by the State for land, the State will expect to make &#x00A3;4 million and, therefore, a profit of &#x00A3;3 million. However, who will pay for that profit? It will be the other citizens who get the land from the State. That was the whole basis of the Bill. [<i>Interruption.</i>]

If the hon. Member for Feltham and Heston would like me to give way, I should be happy to do so.</p>

<p>It is nice to know that the hon. Gentleman has great interest in this matter.<br/>
I am sure that many votes were gained from people who believed that they would get land from the State cheaper than from private individuals. This is nonsense. The basis of the Bill is that the State will make the profits in future. There will be no cheap land for the individual and there will be less protection for the individual than there is now. I support their Lordships in the amendment because it seeks to protect the individual against the planning provisions in the Bill.</p>

<p>I confess that I could not understand what their Lordships were doing when they passed this amendment. Having listened carefully to the hon. Member for North Fylde (Mr. Clegg), I understand the reasons even less. The hon. Gentleman comes from the same part of the country as myself. No matter how he entertains the House, in his capacity not as a Member of Parliament but as a good solicitor he would explain to his clients rather than to his constituents the exact provisions of the Bill more satisfactorily with the wording as it is than with the amendment which has been passed in the other place. In the circumstances, I must ask the House to reject the Lords amendment.</p>

<p>The Lords amendment here is concerned with the reserve


power for the Secretary of State to rely on a draft or non-statutory plan in deciding whether to dispense with an inquiry. Originally this power operated by substituting the references to such plans for the reference to "development plan" in paragraph 4(3)(<i>c</i>) as set out in paragraph 3(1) of Schedule 4. In the Lords, it was argued that logically the correct substitution should instead be for the reference to "local plan" in paragraph 4(3)(<i>b</i>).<br/>
The Government accepted this point. However, further examination of the drafting of the Lords amendment has shown that the amendment is defective in drafting since it only achieves part of the necessary substitution. The reserve provisions must substitute a draft or non-statutory plan, not for the reference to "local plan" but for the reference to
<q>adopted or approved local plan".</q>
Otherwise, a draft or non-statutory plan could not be relied upon unless it had been adopted or approved, which would negate the whole point of the provision. The Government amendment to the Lords amendment therefore remedies this defect. The principle of the Lords amendment, however, is accepted by the Government.</p>

<p>This is an amendment the subject of which is frequently discussed in this House not only in connection with the Bill but often by many of my hon. Friends on the vexed question of legal aid, entitlement to legal aid and where legal aid provisions shall apply.<br/>
What their Lordships have done in the amendment is to give an objector to a compulsory purchase order the right to legal aid for the purpose of making representations at any inquiry into the order. Therefore, under the Bill any owner, lessee or occupier who objects to a compulsory purchase order would be entitled to legal assistance and representation for the purpose of making representations at the inquiry into the order.<br/>
I am in some difficulties here because in principle I sympathise with the spirit of legal aid being given in cases&#x2014;[Hon. Members: "Ah."] Perhaps hon. Members will wait to hear the full argument. I sympathise with the spirit of the amendment.<br/>
In considering the purpose of this amendment, it is important to remember that as the law stands at present, although legal aid for representation is not available, legal advice and assistance under what is known as the green form scheme are available in respect of inquiries under the Bill. This means that an objector to a compulsory purchase order who wishes to make representations at an inquiry and who is within the financial limits of eligibility for the scheme will be able to obtain advice and preliminary help with his case, including its preparation. This is an important facility which could be extremely valuable in the case of a CPO inquiry under the Bill, and it is there to be used.<br/>
Full legal aid is not available, under the legal aid legislation, for representation before any statutory inquiry. Nor is it available for any tribunal, apart from the Lands Tribunal and the Commons Commissioners. My noble and learned Friend's Legal Aid Advisory Committee, in its 24th Report published in November of last year, having considered all the


tribunals involved, recommended that legal aid should be extended to all statutory tribunals under the supervision of the Council on Tribunals. Although it recommended that it should next study the need for legal advice, assistance and representation before statutory inquiries as defined by Section 19 of the Tribunals and Inquiries Act 1971, which includes an inquiry under the Bill, it gave priority to legal aid for statutory tribunals.<br/>
As the House will know, my noble and learned Friend, although he has considerable sympathy with his Advisory Committee's recommendation that legal aid be made available for tribunals, has had to say that in the present economic situation it would not be practicable to implement the recommendation. In view of this, he has decided not to ask the Committee to embark on its further study of legal aid for statutory inquiries for the moment&#x2014;and I emphasise those last words.<br/>
Nevertheless, in view of the intention to do so when possible, it would clearly be quite wrong for one particular statutory inquiry under one Act only to be singled out in this Bill anomalously for the benefits of legal aid. There are many other forms of public inquiry&#x2014;for instance planning inquiries, an associated field&#x2014;for which legal aid would be equally desirable, if not more so. It is important that the question of extending legal aid to tribunals or inquiries is considered as a whole and that this whole issue should be considered in the context of legal aid and legal services and should be balanced against competing and often more urgent priorities.<br/>
There is another difficulty, apart from the financial constraints which the nation faces at present. That is the nature of a public local inquiry itself. It is not a court of law, nor is it indeed a tribunal. It is intended to be a relatively cheap and informal way of publicly discussing issues and assisting the Secretary of State to come to an administrative or policy decision. Most of what might be called, for want of a better term, "evidence" is assertion or subjective judgment, and decisions are based on policy and merits, which the courts are not entitled to question.<br/>
Moreover, if we accept that legal representation is to be the norm, both

for those who can afford it and for those who cannot, we shall be in great danger of destroying the public inquiry system as we now know it and as it has operated for nearly 30 years. In fact, in more recent times it has been criticised for becoming too formal, too lengthy and too expensive.<br/>
11.0 p.m.<br/>
There is also the question whether the present principle, that costs incurred at inquiries should be awarded only to successful objectors&#x2014;on the ground that the acquiring authority should not have put them to the trouble and expense of having to defend their land against an enforced sale&#x2014;is not a sound one. It might well be argued that anyone who knows that it will not cost him a penny for legal representation whether he is successful or not would not hesitate to employ the services of a lawyer even on the slimmest of grounds. Therefore, the possibility of an unnecessary proliferation and lengthening of inquiries is a further factor to be weighed in the balance of argument.<br/>
It is, therefore, the question of principle just as much as the cost to the public purse which needs to be examined, and it would be quite wrong in this Bill to set a precedent which would have such far-reaching consequences without a thorough examination of all aspects of the matter&#x2014;for how can one logically give rights to legal representation for one kind of CPO but not another, or for one kind of statutory inquiry and not another?<br/>
I have read most of this speech because it is a complex and difficult subject. I have presented it fairly to the House. It is a question of the balance between proper and adequate legal representation for those without the ability or know-how to present their own case&#x2014;a matter about which I, as a practising solicitor, feel very strongly&#x2014;and the difficulty of turning what is essentially a public inquiry into a court of law which it was never intended to be.<br/>
I ask the House to reject the amendment because it would be anomalous to provide legal aid for only one kind of inquiry. We need to look at the balance of arguments between the individual who needs representation by a qualified lawyer and turning public inquiries into an even more tortuous process than they are at present.</p>

<p>I declare an interest as a practising barrister though I think all hon. Members, whether legally qualified or not, must be gravely disturbed at the way the Minister has presented his argument.<br/>
Many of the arguments in the Bill have been discussed before on the Floor of the House and in Committee, but this matter arose only as a result of their Lordships' consideration of the Bill and I hope that the House will give careful and sufficient consideration to their proposal.<br/>
The Minister said he had considerable sympathy with the amendment, and he was plainly ill at ease with his brief when he read out that the green form scheme for legal aid was a satisfactory alternative. As a practising solicitor he should know that the green form &#x00A3;20 scheme is no alternative to being properly represented at a tribunal. Under the scheme, a solicitor may investigate a client's situation and give him the most cursory preliminary advice. It does not provide for the presentation of a case or for the expert cross-examination of town hall people with a great deal of expertise and a firm desire to kick somebody off his land.<br/>
The Minister then gave us the usual administrative argument that there are similar situations, such as other tribunals, where people might want to be defended. He says that the situation we are discussing here could not be considered in isolation from all the others. That is rubbish.<br/>
The Bill is a scheme for confiscation. By it people may be deprived of their land at considerably less than market value. Under the scheme their rights to objection and public inquiry are being eroded. If ever a person should be entitled to legal aid, it is in respect of this Bill. Labour Members, who must spend a great deal of their time dealing with complaints by individual citizens, should be disgusted that the Minister's protestations of sympathy were followed by a turgid reading of a brief with which he obviously disagreed.<br/>
The Minister's third point was that the system of public inquiry would be changed if persons were regularly represented. So it would, because the system of public inquiry today is that on the whole the big battalions are represented.

It is no secret that in this difficult and complex area of the law they are represented by the best-paid members of the Bar. On the whole, the people who are not represented are the little people. If the Minister says that he wants to continue a situation in which the little people are ground under by those who are representing either the big property companies or the local authorities, that is disgraceful. That is not a fit view for someone who seeks in some way to represent the whole of the national interest.<br/>
The real argument, however, concerns Government expenditure. It is interesting that so many of our proposals amount to saying that we will not consider any increase in Government expenditure. This highlights the important philosophical difference between the two sides of the House. Of course, my right hon. and hon. Friends and I are regularly blamed for proposing cuts in Government spending but of not being prepared to say where&#x2014;</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman was not here for the earlier part of my speech. Perhaps I may therefore continue with the point I was about to develop. Surely all hon. Members can agree that in some areas there is a priority for an increase in public expenditure. I yield to no one in my desire for reduced public expenditure, but I, no doubt like many of my hon. Friends, attach a priority to the defence of the realm and to the maintenance of law and order.<br/>
It is terrifying. The Government are proposing to spend about &#x00A3;400 million on the acquisition of land and &#x00A3;50 million on increased administration expenses and to employ 14,000 extra civil servants to run the horrible scheme. Yet at the same time they are watching a dreadful increase in crimes of violence and murder, while police forces are 13,000 men below strength. That is the lack of priority and understanding in Government expenditure to which we attach so much importance.<br/>
On the other hand, I suppose that Labour Members would say that their first priority in expenditure is the extension of the power of the State and that the second, perhaps, is expenditure with a view towards social engineering.</p>

<p>That is one of the matters on which Labour Members disagree with us.<br/>
But is not equality under the law something to which all hon. Members attach high priority, and is not an essential element in such equality something approaching equality of representation? Do we not believe that the bullying landlord or bullying trade union committee should not be able to take advantage of the little man, because the little man cannot afford to be adequately represented?<br/>
Yet let us took at the situation of the little man who wishes to defend his property rights. Before hon. Members sneer at the proposition that I am supporting the rights of the little man, let them remember that we are talking about persons who, at best, have a middling income and a middling amount of capital, and about people with less than that, because the better-off person will not be eligible for legal aid. He will have too much income or capital. It follows that when the little man is defending his property rights he must be defending what is probably his only substantial capital asset.<br/>
Let us consider the position when the little man is defending his property rights in a row with a neighbour, perhaps about a couple of feet of land. All of us who are in the legal profession have spent many days in the county court arguing about sometimes a foot, sometimes even an inch of land. We have seen the most bitter and protracted fights between neighbours. The State has rightly decided that, notwithstanding the expense&#x2014;sometimes even the wasteful expense&#x2014;the individual should be given legal aid to defend such property rights.<br/>
Yet if the little man is hauled before some form of tribunal or inquiry and has to defend his only substantial capital asset against confiscation, after reduced powers of objection he is told that be

cause it is not administratively convenient to give him legal aid he must stand alone against the might of the State&#x2014;at a time when he has to fight the power of a swollen bureaucracy which has behind it wide-ranging discretionary powers, as set out in this abortion of a Bill.</p>

<p>The little man has to fight against such unequal odds that he has little chance of defending his most important capital asset. The whole House should be rallying to the cause of the little man, because in fighting against the measure he fights against confiscation at a time when he is certain to be blinded by the complexity and obscurity of this maze of legislation.<br/>
If the Minister says that he has sympathy but is not prepared to do anything about it, all I can say is that that is what Socialism means. Socialism means kicking the little man into the floor. We are proud to be supporters of the individual. Most of all, we are proud to be supporters of the little man.</p>

<p>I think it should have done so. Maybe the Conservative Government can be severely criticised for not having done so. However, the consequence of a decision in a planning inquiry in the past was not confiscation. Now that there is to be confiscation, there should be legal aid.<br/>
If I have been rather vigorous in putting forward some of my arguments, perhaps I should finish on a quieter note. It is said by the Minister that great profits will be made from local authorities' dealings in land. If that is true, why cannot some of those profits go towards letting the little man defend himself against the great State machine? Why cannot some of those profits be used to provide private legal aid for people who wish to be represented before the tribunals?<br/>
Let the Minister remember that the last attempt at land nationalisation was


to a large extent discredited by the effect of the betterment levy on small land owners. The Minister has been clever in distorting the effects of this extremely complicated and detailed Bill so as to try to take account of many of the criticisms that were justly levelled against the betterment levy and the Land Commission. If he makes the mistake of giving no protection to the little man, this legislation will surely be discredited in exactly the same way as by the betterment levy's attack on the widow's orchard. He is unwise if he stands out against the demand from another place for legal aid in representation before the tribunals. He is playing into the hands of the Tories if he does, because nothing will do better in discrediting the Bill and nothing will give us more justification in our ultimate objective of repealing this legislation.</p>

<p>I speak partly as a barrister who has appeared before planning and housing tribunals and partly as a civil servant who has, without reference to the Minister, signed a number of compulsory purchase appeals. I shall tell Conservatives what happens in the real world, thereby exposing the cant and humbug of the speech of the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Budgen).<br/>
I have signed a number of compulsory purchase appeals relating to London's housing. On no occasion do I remember having looked at the legal arguments which took place at the inquiry. I can honestly say that I know of none of my superiors ever referring to them. I never passed a file to my superiors containing the so-called brilliant cross-examination of lawyers.<br/>
In trying to decide issues on their merits the last thing one wants to do is to turn a case into a dazzling display between so-called brilliant lawyers. If

ever there was an element of doubt in my mind as to what was the right decision to take, I discovered that the best course was to pay a visit to the site. I agree that there may be complicated housing or planning decisions that require to be set out by lawyers, but in 99 per cent. of the cases that come before Departments the argument by lawyers, in the interests of either party, is irrelevant.<br/>
Conservative Members are living in cloud-cuckoo-land. The effect of inviting lawyers to appear in every simple compulsory purchase will result in "jobs for the boys"&#x2014;and certainly in no more justice for the people involved.</p>

<p>God helped them on many occasions and, luckily for them, I was on their side too. As somebody who believes in the principles of justice&#x2014;which I always understood was one of the claims of Socialism&#x2014;I am unimpressed by a member of the English Bar&#x2014;somebody who took an oath to administer justice&#x2014;who tries to mock anybody who speaks of its principles.<br/>
The Minister said that we did not want to turn public inquiries into courts of law. What are the characteristics of public inquiries as opposed to what happens in courts of law? I can speak only from my experience in Scotland&#x2014;because in England they manage to take 10 times as long as we do in Scotland and cases in England cost a hundred times more than they do in Scotland&#x2014;but there are clear rules of evidence to be observed in both countries. The issues are focused and matters are argued according to strict rules of equity. That is the purpose of all inquiries. All inquiries are aimed at


getting the matter right according to simple principles of equity.<br/>
I have taken part in many public inquiries and I believe that the reason why they are so unsatisfactory arises from the fact that there is no criterion in justice by which they are conducted. When there is an inquiry into whether someone should be allowed to make lollipops in his shop, whether motor vehicles should wait outside the shop, whether an airport should be built here or a road there, there is no issue, no restriction and no criterion of justice. Anyone who cares to enter the inquiry can take the ball and kick it into deserts far beyond the inquiry's remit. That is done most often by those who are untrained in focusing the issues and arguing cases.<br/>
Anyone who has been involved in the recent inquiries concerning oil development in Scotland, in Kinshorn or Drambuie, will know that local authorities can come along with proposals into which they have made no sensible investigation and without the proper information. Such proposals are often fatuous in the extreme. They waste the money of everyone, including the humble people whom Labour Members claim they are elected to represent. Their rights are involved more often than those of the "important" people. There is no discipine upon public inquiries as there is in a court of law.<br/>
I am horrified that the Minister, admittedly a member of an alien profession&#x2014;since it is not my half of the profession nor my half of the country&#x2014;should say that the principles of justice which we have cherished in this country through the courts of law should not apply in investigating the simple rights of the citizen when authority is taking away his property. I am horrified by that proposition and I shall never forget to repeat it to my electorate and, if possible, to the Minister's.<br/>
The Minister said that public inquiries were intended to be cheap. For whom? For the local authority? I have usually appeared for the defence at these inquiries. The State has all the money and the facilities to prepare its case. The accused has only his own money or legal aid. A local authority can state any proposition, and the citizen is guilty until he can prove his innocence at a public

inquiry. The hon. Member for Luton, West (Mr. Sedgemore) said that when he was a member of an inquiry he never bothered about the lawyers' arguments. Of course not, because he is typical of Left-wing Socialism. I am ashamed to think that the English Bar ever admitted anyone with so few principles.<br/>
I would be the last person to wish to increase public spending in any way. [<i>Interruption.</i>] The hon. Member for Aberdeen, North (Mr. Hughes) shakes his head. I have defended more of his constituents than he has ever done.</p>

<p>We seem to have lost sight of the proposition that people serve others for the sake of doing so and not to make a profit out of it. The Minister spoke of philosophy. The Government's philosophy is not that the land should belong to the people but that it should be taken from them and put into the hands of the bureaucracy. It is an anonymous bureaucracy acting against defenceless people. It is scandalous that in this neuter form it should be allowed to ride over them and that they should not have the protection of representation and advice. That is the proposition put forward by the Government.<br/>
Labour Members see no harm in adding 14,000 more drones to society, no harm in giving them inflation-proof salaries and pensions, no harm in giving them flash offices at our expense, but when it comes to the individual defending himself against the filthy machine which they are creating they do not mind if the individual suffers, because Socialism detests the individual and is determined to destroy him. The Government are resisting the amendment because they would hate the individual to be able to defend himself against the State machine.</p>

<p>We are getting a little wide of the amendment, but I understood that it was the Conservative Government which introduced inflation-proof pensions for civil servants.<br/>
I go along with the Minister and other hon. Members who would like to make legal aid available to the people who will be affected by this legislation, but many improvements are needed in the legal aid system and they cannot be made in this


Bill. I am sure that many hon. Members are constantly seeing people concerned in litigation who need legal aid but cannot get it. I know of many people of small means who have been unable to get legal aid, and the appeals procedure is couched in mystery. The legal aid system should be burst wide open so that we can find out why legal aid is not available. A lady came to see me in my surgery on Saturday. She told me that she was entitled to legal aid but had not been repaid the &#x00A3;150 which she had spent on legal fees.<br/>
Lawyers are not always the best people to represent parties at public inquiries. I have appeared as a so-called expert on many ocacsions and wished that I could take the case because the lawyers were making such a mess of it. When a Claude Dampier-type person comes up from the Bar and says in an affected voice "Hello, Mrs. Gibson, I am sorry that Mr. X cannot be here; he has been called to Scotland, and I am replacing him", one realises one is on a loser.<br/>
There is the mysterious procedure at the Bar whereby one chooses the judge before whom one wishes to appear. One hears such remarks as "Do not go in front of Mr. Justice X. He is not the person to hear your case. You would do better to go before Mr. Justice Y". My firm lost &#x00A3;300 because of all the jiggling about that occurred in deciding which judge to go before. There was a long delay, the case never came on and a settlement much larger than that originally intended had to be made.<br/>
The lawyers should not have it all their own way. It is often better for a layman to take his own case in front of an inquiry. Sometimes it is better for a chartered surveyor than for a lawyer to take a case.<br/>
I am all for an improvement in the legal aid system across the board, but I shall support the Government on this occasion if it comes to a vote.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Luton, West (Mr. Sedgemore) told us that when dealing with these matters in an administrative capacity he paid no attention to any legal argument that was advanced. That is rather surprising, because he objected to the amendment on the ground that inquiries should not be cluttered up with lawyers. If that were the ground

for his thinking, surely he should argue that there should be no legal representation at all at the inquiries.<br/>
That is not what the Bill proposes. The Bill does not propose that the wealthy man shall not be represented at these inquiries. All that the Bill secures in this regard is that the man who cannot afford to pay for legal representation shall not have it. That is what seems to my hon, and learned Friend the Member for Kinross and West Perthshire (Mr. Fairbairn) and me to be so unfair.<br/>
It was in repect of the person who can not afford to pay for legal representation that the amendment was made. I should have thought that anybody whose interests genuinely lay with the furtherance of justice would wish to support the amendment. The Government are saying "We are providing for you to be deprived of your property. It is true that we are setting up inquiries before which you may voice your objections, but, unfortunately, the machinery that we have to operate this complex arrangement is so complicated, the machinery that we need to deprive you of your property and to enable us to decide what to do with it once we have it is so complicated, that it is very expensive to operate, and therefore you must understand that there will be no money left to enable you to try to stop us from getting your land". That is not a fair way to go about the matter.<br/>
If I may detain the House for a few moments I should like to examine what is at stake when a man is confronted by a compulsory purchase order. As has been said, he may lose his home and what is his primary economic asset and his major interest in life. Those are all substantial matters. There are not many instances when any issue arising before the Lands Tribunal gives rise to so much being at stake, and yet anyone coming before the Lands Tribunal is entitled to legal aid. There are not many matters that arise when one appears before the Commons Commissioners, important though they may be, that rank with those confronting a man upon whose land officialdom descends when a compulsory purchase order is made&#x2014;although important issues come before the Commons Commissioners, right of piscary, turbary and estover among them&#x2014;but one is entitled to legal aid when one comes before the Commons Commissioners.<br/>
I hope that we shall hear where the principle lies that permits legal aid in cases coming before the Lands Tribunal and the Commons Commissioners but not in cases before the inquiries that are to be set up under the Bill. I know that those others are statutory tribunals whereas this is to be a statutory inquiry. I know that statutory tribunals are subject to the supervision of the Council on Tribunals, but that is simply a matter of labelling, a matter of procedure. Where lies the distinction in principle that permits legal aid for those appearing before the Lands Tribunal and the Commons Commissioners but denies it to a man who may be deprived of his home, his livelihood and his major interest?</p>

<p>That is an interesting observation, but I do not see that it diminishes the force of my argument. As Lord Denning said recently, the legal aid scheme ranks with the National Health Service as a social service in this country.<br/>
The way in which to judge is to see what the citizen stands to lose before the proposed inquiry. If a man can lose his home and his livelihood and his major interest, his major economic asset, he is entitled to rank with the wealthy man in having legal representation. That is all that we say.<br/>
It is said that this would cost too much. How much would it cost? We have not been told, but I venture to suggest that it would cost substantially less than the &#x00A3;150,000 a year that the Lord Chancellor announced in the other place last month had already been authorised as expenditure on the law centres this year. I believe that the annual cost of meeting the amendment would be substantially less than &#x00A3;150,000 a year.<br/>
Yet law centres, however excellent they and their work may be, in many instances are subject to political take

over.In one case at least only last month, the founder of a well-known one in South London said that it had been taken over for the furtherance of extreme Left-wing politics. I have seen a banner of one in a demonstration in Fleet Street. Yet legal aid is to be denied to those appearing before these tribunals, although it would put those who cannot afford it on an equal footing with those who can.<br/>
I have spoken vigorously, but if Labour Members sincerely feel that issues of justice and equality are at stake they will join us in the Division Lobby.</p>

<p>I declare an interest, although I do not practise in this section of the Bar&#x2014;it would probably be too complicated for me and certainly too boring.<br/>
I was much heartened when the Undersecretary of State said that he had the greatest sympathy with the amendment. He is surely just the person to have sympathy with it and support it&#x2014;sympathy born of a solicitor who has had many years of practice in dealing with the sort of problems that the small individual will have to face before tribunals of this kind. He should also have sympathy as a Socialist because, although we do not yield quarter to the claims of Socialists that they have a monopoly of sympathy for human beings, we allow that a Socialist has as much sympathy for them, or ought to have if he is true to his creed, as we have.<br/>
It was, therefore, with a great sense of disappointment that we heard the rest of the hon. Gentleman's speech. He did not fully appreciate and was not in full accord with his brief. He simply read the Civil Service explanation. There is no blame to the civil servants, because the Government merely said to them "We have decided not to extend legal aid to these cases, so give us arguments as to why we should not do it." The civil servants, according to their lights, gave the Minister his answer.<br/>
There is a great gulf between us about the Bill. As the Minister has said many times, we have here an issue as to whether the State should take greater power over the private individual. We think that the Bill is the beginning of the helter-skelter down the road to the fulfilment of the Communist manifesto. [<i>Interruption.</i>]


Hon. Members may laugh, but the Communist manifesto requires State ownership of land, if necessary by means of confiscation.<br/>
That aim is being pursued in the Bill. There is, therefore, the deep rift between the two sides. I understand it. I sympathise with the reasons for the rift. But where there should not be a an issue between us, where we should be united, is in the defence of the rights of the individual. Many times have I seen Labour Members rise at appropriate moments and speak in defence of the rights of the small man, the individual, and the oppressed in our society. There are many examples of double standards.<br/>
11.45 p.m.<br/>
If an issue between the establishment and the individual arises, which is the first organisation to contact us? It is the National Council for Civil Liberties. It is always to be seen or heard whenever an issue contrary to the establishment arises. But I have received not one letter from the National Council for Civil Liberties sticking up for the rights of the small man and the individual in the matter of the Community Land Bill.<br/>
We have been witnessing&#x2014;and it is high time&#x2014;a Government campaign on behalf of 2 million people who can neither read nor write. I hazard the guess that a fair proportion of those persons own some sort of property and may be threatened by some facet of the Bill. If these people cannot read or write and if they feel strongly about these matters, why is it that they cannot have the right of representation in a tribunal which raises one complicated issue after another?<br/>
It is not merely a question of going for preliminary advice. Anyone acquainted with the operation of a tribunal or a court will know that the issues are constantly changing, that new issues arise as the days or the hours go by and that it is for ever necessary for someone to rise and correct, to answer and to check. If the only advice that a person charged with a criminal offence had was advice before the trial started, the trial would be a farce. It is no answer, therefore, to say that a person has had preliminary advice before going to a tribunal or that people who can neither read nor write should not have the right of representa

tion and explanation before a complicated tribunal.<br/>
The Minister says that if we grant this right in these cases it will not be available elsewhere. On practically every amendment put forward in their Lordships' House the Advisory Committee's recommendation has been brought out and paraded before us. This has been looked into by the Advisory Committee in its 24th report. Having looked into it, it decided that there was no support for the amendment. I seem to remember hearing the words "I would rather accept the recommendation of the Advisory Committee than of their Lordships' House." But when it does not suit the Minister to quote the Advisory Committee or to rely upon it, he does not do so.</p>

<p>If that is a misunderstanding on my part, I accept the correction. Nevertheless, the fact is that there is a Government Advisory Committee on Legal Aid, as the Minister has told us, which has recommended that there should be the right of legal representation in the tribunal set up under this legislation. There is a double standard about citing authorities and picking those which one will follow and those which one will not.<br/>
Then it is said that this would not be practicable because of the cost. As my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Royal Tunbridge Wells (Mr. Mayhew) has said, what is the cost? Legal aid has been discussed since March, and it surely cannot be beyond the wit of the Government's advisers to give us some assessment of the likely legal aid cost for tribunals in these matters, but the Government have not bothered to do this.<br/>
This is like so many of the subjects that we hear debated in this Parliament. When it does not suit the Government to bother, they do not bother. They have not bothered to give us the cost, so let us hear no more talk about cost. When we are spending &#x00A3;1,000 million on the Industry Act, when it is proposed to spend &#x00A3;1 million a day on the acquisition costs and &#x00A3;1 million a week on the administration of this legislation, let us have no


more talk about the cost of legally representing an individual before the big battalions.<br/>
It is said that the acceptance of this proposal would be anomalous. It is said that if it is granted in this case, why should it not be granted in other cases? My answer to that is that if we cannot immediately have the others, let us at least make a start. In any event, this whole Bill is anomalous. [<i>Interruption.</i>] It is no good the Government saying to my hon Friends that this proposal should not be accepted because it would be anomalous. The whole of this legislation is a grotesque anomaly, and one of the easiest ways in which we could mitigate the full effects of the Bill would be to introduce the so-called anomaly of legal aid representation before the tribunal in these cases.

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. Would you ask the hon. Member for Luton, West (Mr. Sedgemore) to listen to my hon. Friend's speech? The hon. Gentleman attacked the legal profession. My hon. Friend is making a case, and the hon. Gentleman should at least listen to it.</p>

<p>I must confess that I have long since learned to ignore the interruptions of the hon. Member for Luton, West (Mr. Sedgemore).<br/>
The Minister said that if this amendment were approved by this House, there would be a danger of destroying the public inquiry system. My reply to that is that, if the public inquiry system allows an individual's rights to be taken away by confiscation without representation, it is high time that the public inquiry system was destroyed.<br/>
Others of my hon. Friends have referred to the big battalions. It always astounds me how Government supporters can find excuses for why the wealthy, the big, the private enterprise that they pretend to dislike and even to hate should always have rights which are denied to the small man. Before a tribunal of inquiry, the big battalions may be represented. They will run rings round the small man.<br/>
Is this not a double standard which the Government would do well to ponder?

Why should the rich be represented and the poor not? Can any Government supporter stand on a platform in his constituency before a slogan saying "Let the rich be represented, but let the poor go without legal assistance"?</p>

<p>As usual, my hon. Friend has hit another nail on the head. I venture to think that it will be another of the nails in the coffin of a Government who have been responsible for the sort of double standards we are hearing about here.<br/>
The gravamen of my speech is that where there is an issue between the two sides of the House because of the differences between Socialism and Conservatism, that we understand, but that on any issue affecting the private individual there should be only agreement between us. Every action to the contrary by this Government is nothing short of a double standard.<br/>
I want to draw the attention of the Houseto Early-Day Motion No. 691. It reads:
<q>That this House regrets the denial of legal aid to individuals appearing before tribunals, many of whom are under-privileged and unable to afford legal representation; believes that justice is jeopardised when only one side is legally represented; and calls upon the Government to extend legal aid to all tribunals.</q>
That Early-Day Motion was tabled by the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mr. Cant). It was signed by 52 hon. Members, nearly all of whom were Labour Members.</p>

<p>As we listen to the debate, is it any wonder that Conservative Members who took part in the Committee proceedings have constantly questioned the right of the Secretary of State to issue orders and regulations? I am sure that the Minister was as horrified as my hon. Friends and I were to hear that the hon.

<p>I should have thought that any hon. Member in such a situation would have stated what were the years when these matters were under consideration. I wonder whether the hon. Member for Luton, West ever said "No" to any of the applications. Perhaps he exempted them all. I hope that the Minister, like my hon. Friends and I, views with horror a statement of that nature from below the Gangway. Public inquiries were simply tossed out of the window because of the arrogance of the hon. Members for Luton, West, who could not care less what anyone's argument or rights might have been. The hon. Gentleman may laugh about this matter, but there are many people in the land who do not think that it is funny. I am glad that the Under-Secretary does not think it is very funny.<br/>
This debate is mainly about legal aid. The Under-Secretary was fair when he

said that he had enormous sympathy for their Lordships and their desire to give legal aid. He gave three reasons why it was not possible to do so at this time. First, he gave the reason that it would destroy 30 years of planning or public inquiries. Public inquiries have changed a little over 30 years. Thirty years ago there was not the public participation that there is now, and I suspect that 30 years ago the inquiries were not as long as they are at present.<br/>
We have had the Land Compensation Act and growing concern has been expressed about the rights of individuals as we have seen the encroachment by the State. The public inquiry system has changed over those 30 years. It has not been a static situation.<br/>
12 midnight.<br/>
Secondly, the Under-Secretary mentioned the danger of the lengthening of inquiries. Public inquiries already take up a lot of time. But if the rights of individual owners are to be protected, it is no bad thing if they take a few days longer and proper answers are obtained.<br/>
Thirdly, the hon. Gentleman suggested that a precedent would be set. More precedents have been set with this Bill than this House has seen in many a long day. The Bill is full of precedents. The whole idea of confiscating somebody's land for the bogus reasons of State influence is a precedent. If the hon. Gentleman genuinely feels that there is a case for legal aid but that, for one reason or another, it is not administratively convenient or the Secretary of State has been so tied up in trying to straighten out the charity situation that he has not had time to deal with the legal aid question, we do not mind. However, he must tell us now that he has not had time to deal with it but will take it on board. We would then know where we stood. It seems that the Under-Secretary is in favour of legal aid for everybody who qualifies but that it is not convenient at the end of a parliamentary Session to take it on board.<br/>
I come back to my proposition that in life it always seems that if a bus is going one's way and in the right direction one should get on it. This seems an apt moment to show a degree of initiative by accepting the Lords amendment on legal aid.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1975-11-11a.1311.0" hansard_membership_id="3705" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/30940" speakername="Mr. Durant" colnum="1311" time="">
<p>I should like to follow what my hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, South (Mr. Morris) said about the Bill being a precedent in itself and therefore dealing with the whole question of precedent. The Undersecretary talked about helping the public purse. The simple answer to that problem is to drop the Bill. That is the best way to help the public purse from the word "go".<br/>
We are not talking about large sums of money. For example, in the 10 months up to the end of October the Lands Tribunal has given legal aid to the tune of only &#x00A3;1,788. We must bear in mind that if a person has more than a certain amount of money, he will not get legal aid. Therefore, we are not talking about big money.<br/>
It is important to remember that, particularly with development land, the property concerned is very small indeed&#x2014;two up, two down. Such property is often owned by widows and may represent their only capital asset. Widows are quite poorly placed financially. It is important, therefore, for them to be represented.<br/>
With such a complicated Bill, we shall have to breed a new brand of lawyer and solicitor to advise people at tribunals, because they will not understand the implications. Indeed, it has taken us long enough to understand the Bill. Goodness knows how any ordinary citizen will be able to argue his case before a tribunal. Therefore, I am in favour of the Lords amendment.</p>

<p>When I opened this debate on the serious issue of legal aid and the nature of a planning inquiry, I hoped that we would have a serious debate. The nearest approach to that was the speech of the hon. Member for the Isle of Wight (Mr. Ross), with whom I entirely agreed and who has temporarily left the Chamber. He tackled the subject sensibly and properly.<br/>
I said that there might be a case for legal representation at local inquiries. The first two speakers from the Opposition side, one from the English Bar and one from the Scottish Bar, disabused me of that idea. Like them I am a lawyer, although in a different branch of the profession. The difference between us is that I am not so arrogant as to

believe that justice can be arrived at only when lawyers are present. In the majority of cases, justice is arrived at without lawyers being on the scene.</p>

<p>No, I shall not give way. This has been a long debate, and it has been largely irrelevant to the issue we are discussing.<br/>
In my previous speech I read from what was in front of me, which I thought would be more convenient, rather than addressing the House as I am doing now. But I repeat the view which I then expressed&#x2014;that the principle of legal aid before tribunals is good and right. The hon. Member for the Isle of Wight has now returned. I repeat his argument: that there are many spheres where legal aid could and should be granted which take precedence over this one. Therefore, instead of dealing with this matter piecemeal, we should consider the whole matter with a view to its implementation when the country can better afford it.</p>

My point remains. I do not want planning inquiries turned into long legal wrangles at which justice would be denied, not given.

forward and that my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Kinross and West Perthshire (Mr. Fairbairn) was putting forward was simply that some people who objected to a compulsory purchase order might take the Minister's view and not wish to be represented, which is a perfectly tenable view?

<p>If I may turn to the two points that the Minister was making, he objected to the Lords amendment for two reasons. First, he said that to have legal aid, enabling private citizens who otherwise could not afford to do so to be properly represented, would alter the whole character of compulsory purchase inquiries. The hon. Gentleman is a solicitor and he knows that, at public inquiries into any sizeable acquisition under a CPO, a local authority is always represented by leading counsel and junior counsel, in addition to all the expert witnesses from the council's planning, legal and housing departments. The citizen is seriously disadvantaged unless his pocket is deep enough to enable him to employ counsel and expert witnesses to counter the evidence given by the local authority.</p>

<p>The character of public inquiries into CPOs is determined by the approach of local authorities to them. Constituents often complain that they feel frustrated because they cannot fight the power and expertise ranged against them.</p>

<p>We are talking of a limited market. Legal aid is available to only a very few people with small disposable incomes or capital. We are not talking of substantial sums of money. If the Minister is concerned about the impact of this proposal on public expenditure and the fact that he might have difficulty in persuading the Treasury to do what he has conceded is desirable, might I suggest that, within the millions of pounds which the Treasury will determine is to be made available for the operation of the land scheme, provision should be made for a scheme that would enable citizens to feel that justice was being done to them? We are asking not for additional public expenditure but for a provision in that global sum to be determined by the Treasury so that the private citizen can defend himself.</p>

<p>I beg to move, That this House doth disagree with the Lords in the said amendment.<br/>
The terms of the amendment seem to be irrelevant to the purposes of the Bill. The argument put forward in another place in support of the amendment was that since the passing of the Acquisition of Land (Authorisation Procedure) Act 1946 and the corresponding Scottish Act&#x2014;</p>

<p>Order. Will hon. Members conduct their conversations outside the Chamber.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1975-11-11a.1319.1" hansard_membership_id="11129" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/19091" speakername="Mr. Oakes" colnum="1319" time="">
<p>Since the passing of that legislation there has been a considerable number of designations of land of important environmental significance&#x2014;for example national parks, areas of outstanding beauty, heritage coastal areas and conservation areas&#x2014;yet inalienable land of the National Trust, commons, open spaces, fuel and field garden allotments, ancient monuments and other subjects of archaeological interest are still the only categories of land of this kind protected by special parliamentary procedure.<br/>
In the Government's view there is nothing about the community land scheme which suggests that any land in these special areas, which are already well protected under the planning machinery, is more likely to be at risk of compulsory purchase because of the scheme. The Bill does not introduce any new policy in relation to land in national parks or areas of outstanding natural beauty. The Bill is concerned with development land. Land which has been formally recognised in one way or another as worthy of conservation will be most unlikely to be the kind of land with which the land scheme is concerned. Moreover, it has been emphasised repeatedly that the Bill is planning-based, so that planning permission for development which would conflict with the objectives of the designation would not lightly be granted and compulsory purchase for the purpose of such development would not readily be authorised.<br/>
The Government do not accept that there is any justification for using the Bill as a vehicle for imposing on the Secretary of State a duty to bring before Parliament proposals for adding new categories of land to special parliamentary procedures which would apply whether the compulsory purchase order was made under the Bill or under any other compulsory purchase power.<br/>
The objects of the amendment seem to the Government to be entirely irrelevant to the purpose of the Bill. I ask my hon. Friends to reject it.</p>

<p>I do not see why the Minister takes such a view, because in a Bill of such wide-ranging character there is surely no harm in adding extra protection in respect of land which has always been regarded as being worthy of special consideration.<br/>
I wish to refer to the arguments advanced in the other place by Lord Sandford. I shall not refer directly to what Lord Sandford said, but he pointed out with considerable force and clarity that a special category of special land was overdue for consideration. Lord Sandford said that although the Bill did a great deal to promote the compulsory acquisition of land, it did not at the same time take the opportunity to stimulate measures to protect designated land or seek to provide for changes to meet the situation. He regarded that as a remarkable omission by the Government.<br/>
I see no reason for rejecting this extremely sensible amendment and I hope that the Minister will think again. All we are asking is that land which is the site of an ancient monument or the object of archaeological interest specified by an order of the Secretary of State should be subject to special parliamentary procedure. It is surely a curious anomaly in European Architectural Heritage Year for the Government to discard this amendment. I do not think there is any need to go into detail at this hour, but I urge the Minister to think again about this matter.<br/>
The fact that subsection (4) of the amendment asks that the Secretary of State should consult with the statutory advisory bodies, such as the Council for the Preservation of Rural England, the Civic Trust and others, will give little comfort to the many people who have worked hard to protect what is best in our heritage and whose regard for amenity land cannot be open to dispute. Therefore, I ask the Minister to think again about this provision and to allow us to proceed to the next amendment by agreeing to this one.</p>

<p>I wish to support what has been said by my hon.


Friend the Member for Staffordshire South-West (Mr. Cormack). I appreciate that the occasions on which a compulsory purchase order will operate on the type of land with which we are now dealing will be reasonably rare. Having said that, I can think of a case in my constituency where the local authorities have mixed views about a listed building, and indeed there is a difference of opinion on the matter between borough and county. It is conceivable that under the new legislation a public inquiry might have been held.<br/>
It is true to say that their Lordships were able to stand back a little further than did hon Members in Committee and were able to examine safety aspects which might otherwise have been overlooked. I believe that the present provision falls into that category.<br/>
This does not involve any great issue of principle. It involves our having to face the fact that times have changed since 1946 when the original legislation was introduced. That legislation contained certain safeguards in respect of ancient monuments, National Trust and common land. Many developments have taken place since that time, and I acknowledge that Labour Members have played as large a part in those changes as we have. There are now areas of outstanding natural beauty, national parks and many other areas. Therefore, I see no great disadvantage in our adding this dimension of safety.<br/>
We all know that there are nevertheless circumstances in the private and public sectors in which significant buildings have been demolished before an order could be put on them. There are buildings which have orders governing them and which unfortunately fall down. This is an additional safeguard. I hope that the Minister, if he cannot agree to this suggestion, will at least give an undertaking that this type of extension will form part of the Government's programme early in the new Session.</p>

<p>This has been a much more rational debate than the previous one. I was not quite sure what the hon. Member for Northampton, South (Mr. Morris) meant when he spoke about Government action in the next Session. If he is asking me to give an undertaking that

when any listed building, archeological site, national park or anything like that comes before us for consideration we will give special attention to it, I can obviously give such an undertaking.<br/>
The Lords amendment seeks to graft on to the Bill a special parliamentary procedure which we say is unnecessary. It is unnecessary for any responsible Secretary of State of any party to be subjected to that special procedure. The hon. Member mentioned archaeological sites and ancient monuments. It is extremely unlikely that there would ever be representations to the effect that such land should be development land. If there were, any Secretary of State&#x2014;since he has responsibility for ancient monuments&#x2014;would clearly treat the matter with the greatest caution. An overwhelming case would need to be put forward before a Secretary of State went against such a designation. He would be answerable not only to Parliament but to outraged public opinion. I can give the hon. Gentleman the assurance that any Secretary of State would rack his brains before making any decision adverse to such a special interest.</p>

<p>Little safeguards and little assurances&#x2014;if I may speak by leave of the House&#x2014;are not much comfort. The Government's obduracy is illustrated by the Minister's reply. I do not doubt his integrity or his desire to safeguard what we hold dear. Any Bill of this sort&#x2014;</p>

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I think you were a little hasty with my hon. Friend, who distinctly said that he sought the leave of the House. Perhaps you did not hear him because you were consulting the Clerk. He omitted it at first but then asked for the leave of the House.</p>

<p>I disagree with the right hon. Gentleman. The hon. Member was on his feet for quite a few seconds. A Member does not ask for the leave of the House after he has spoken for half an hour. He asks for it before he begins. That is the vital difference.</p>

<p>I should tell the House that if it were to agree to disagree with these amendments I should wish to move a manuscript amendment to Lords Amendment No. 82, to leave out "county area" in the last line of sub-paragraph (2) and insert
<q>area of the county authority".</q>
This has nothing to do with the Peak Park but is consequential on disagreeing with the Peak Park amendments which introduce the term "county area".<br/>
I find these amendments especially difficult, because it seems to me that the whole question that one is deciding&#x2014;that is, whether there should be provided in the Bill a separate land acquisition and management scheme for the Peak District National Park&#x2014;is very difficult and very finely balanced. I am apparently not the only person to find some difficulty in considering this. Some of my hon. Friends take one view, others take another.<br/>
As for Conservative Members, I think it was Lord Sandford who moved these amendments in another place, and when we first considered the question in Standing Committee G the right hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) entered a caveat in favour of the Peak District National Park arrangement. But, after considering it and considering the very finely balanced basis of the two possibilities, I have come to the conclusion that the advice I ought to give to the House is to disagree with the Lords in these amendments.<br/>
The Peak Park covers parts of six counties. If, as the Bill provided, the board were simply to participate in the land acquisition and management schemes of each of those six counties, this could be administratively difficult and there would be no guarantee of consistency of treatment across the park as a whole. That is the first factor that one has to consider.<br/>
1.0 a.m.<br/>
The Government have recognised these as genuine problems. We therefore encouraged discussions between the Peak Park Planning Board and the constituent authorities in the hope that these would lead to an agreed solution. During the

discussions the constituent authorities proposed a compromise solution. Each county LAMS&#x2014;that is, land acquisition and management scheme&#x2014;was to be divided into two parts, one for the Peak Park area and one for the rest of the country. All of the six LAMS relating to the Peak Park were to be identical, and arrangements were proposed for the setting up of a joint committee and other joint arrangements for operating the land scheme within the national park. However, the Peak Park Planning Board did not feel that this went far enough to meet its point of view.<br/>
Accordingly, amendments were brought forward by Lord Sandford in another place to provide for a separate LAMS for the Peak Park, and the Government had to consider their attitude towards these in the light of the proposed compromise solution. At this stage it is important to consider the remaining factors, and, as I have said, I find that these factors constitute an almost insoluble balance.<br/>
First, the arrangements for the making of the LAMS do not in any way prejudge the way in which the scheme is naturally implemented in the Peak Park area. Who actually buys land for development will need to be settled on the basis of the factors&#x2014;for example, the availability of staff&#x2014;set out in Schedule 5 to the Bill.<br/>
Second, whichever solution is adopted, the LAMS will still have to be agreed between all the parties in the area acting jointly. The county authority has no bigger voice than any other authority. It has only certain administrative duties. Therefore, the amendments would in no way alter the balance of power between the authorities involved.<br/>
Third, from the point of view of the operation of the land scheme there is no strong reason for preferring one solution to the other. Either would seem to be satisfactory and to enable the scheme to be implemented effectively.<br/>
Having established the balance, a conclusion must be reached. The conclusion which the Government have reached is that, looking dispassionately at the problem, there is no real need for any amendment, given the compromise solution offered by the constituent authorities. I cannot claim to be strongly in favour of this solution. I can say only that it seems


to be the commonsense one. It leads inevitably to the Government changing their mind, as the Opposition have and as I have no doubt individual people will.</p>

<p>I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for his suggestion. As is well known, and as was said in another place, my hon. Friend and Member for Derbyshire, West (Mr. Scott-Hopkins) and I have throughout supported the six county and the nine local councils in this matter. It is a truly non-party issue, and I feel a little humble to be discussing it with the son of a distinguished gentleman who introduced the Peak Park Planning Bill. What is more, Lord Sandford has done a great deal for our national parks and it was he who suggested these amendments.<br/>
When the Under-Secretary appeared in Derbyshire this summer, he impressed everyone greatly. One Member of the other place said to me that here was a politician who came, said that he wanted to listen and actually did.<br/>
Our case is that by giving separate LAMS to the Peak Park Planning Board we should be creating a great deal of fear among the local authorities. The six counties and nine local authorities disagreed with the amendments because they were frightened that to give a separate LAMS to the park would be like having a Big Brother watching over them. They were frightened about what would happen. As elected representatives in their areas they wish to take an active part in the running of those areas. The amendments which were moved by Lord Sandford and carried in the other place would have had the opposite effect. The members of those authorities would fear for their future. In his winding-up speech in the other place Lord Sandford said that the only reason why he was moving these amendments was that he believed that no agreement could be reached between the local authorities and the parks planning board. I suggest that that is no reason for tabling amendments.<br/>
We must reach agreement between the local authorities and the park planning board. I have heard from the Derbyshire County Council that all the constituent authorities have reached general agreement, and on 24th November they are to meet the park planning board to discuss these proposals. They will discuss sug

gestions concerning land acquired by agreement, the powers of the park planning board where there is a refusal or a delay by the local authority and on mineral rights and where the bulk of capital is produced by the park planning board. Indeed, it is proposed that there will be a joint committee working under the LAMS for co-ordinating and monitoring. Is that not the thinking of people who want to co-ordinate together?<br/>
Sadly one must admit that in the past the high motives which started with these national park boards has not been sustained as much as one would wish. There have been disagreements to which I have already referred. There is the fear that the appointed park boards are sometimes not fully in touch with the wishes and feelings of those who live and work in these parks.<br/>
I should like to refer to what the then Mr. Lewis Silkin said on Second Reading of the National Parks Bill. He said:
<q>I am a believer in local authorities. I believe that the local planning authorities will welcome the administration of national parks as a challenge and as a great opportunity, which they will discharge in a public-spirited manner."&#x2014;[<i>Official Report,</i> 31st March, 1949; Vol. 463, c. 1482.]</q>
I suggest that that view is taken today. If the House rejects, as I hope it will, their Lordships amendments, there will be an opportunity for everyone to get together and work for the public good.</p>

<p>It is bizarre to find at this late hour the hon. Member for High Peak (Mr. Le Marchant) heaping praise upon this part at least of the Community Land Bill and my right hon. and hon. Friends on the Government Front Bench when I, who have been a fervent supporter of this measure, must oppose what my right hon. Friend has said in his belated and, in my view, inexplicable conversion to the view that these amendments should be removed.<br/>
I wish to examine why my right hon. Friend has taken that view. I shall try to disentangle some of the tactical miscalculations which may be behind that point of view.<br/>
I wish to say something about the residents of the national parks. I was born, and have always lived, in the area of Derbyshire national park. I feel strongly


that the Peak District National Park is unique in more than one way. It is already unique as a planning authority. It covers six county councils and nine district councils. It is unique in the type of planning powers which it has compared with the other national parks. It was the first to be designated. It is the winner of more awards, especially in the area of conservation, than all the other parks.<br/>
I point out to all hon. Members who are interested in conservation issues that this national park is threatened more than any other. First, it is threatened because it is one of the smallest and is surrounded by large conurbations. People who enjoy the countryside and rambling and wish to enjoy the amenities of the park know that the weight of their enthusiasm may threaten it unless its powers are strictly laid down and observed.<br/>
Secondly, it is the victim of greedy interests which are prepared to take out of the national park the mineral resources in which it is so rich and which may, in so doing, fundamentally alter its character.<br/>
That is why many people on the Peak District National Park Board hold the unanimous view that positive planning, of which this Bill is the forerunner, should be used by the authority set up by a previous Labour Government&#x2014;set up largely as a result of the inspiration of my right hon. Friend's father. However, my right hon. Friend has now come forward with what seems a lacklustre argument and suggested that we should throw out the amendments.<br/>
Earlier tonight I was told that the amendments would go through unopposed. In the consideration of Lords amendments document which was circulated to hon. Members there is no mention that we should disagree with the Lords in this amendment. That was not proposed. Something has obviously changed my right hon. Friend's mind. However, my mind has not been changed.<br/>
Many of my hon. Friends will not support the Government on this issue tonight. We will vote on the other side. No doubt the hon. Member for High Peak and those whom he can whip in behind him will enthusiastically support my right hon. Friend. I cannot and do not propose to do so.<br/>
There was all-party support in another place, where there was a free vote, and Lord Sandford's amendments were carried. I understand that at that stage the Government were prepared to give the amendments a fair wind.<br/>
I have copies of letters from my right hon. Friend to Alderman Norman Gratton, the Chairman of the Peak District National Park Board, and to the Derbyshire County Council in which he looks sympathetically on what he calls
<q>the force of the arguments for having a separate LAMS for the national park area.</q>
In another letter to Alderman Gratton, my right hon. Friend said:
<q>I stand by the assurances that were given in Standing Committee when this matter was debated. My officials have written to the constituent counties informing them that I am still prepared to bring forward amendments, if necessary, though I would not wish at this stage to do anything to prejudice the negotiations.</q>
The negotiations are still going on. The Clerk to the Derbyshire County Council and others have written to those of us who have the honour to represent constituencies in that area to say that there is to be a meeting on 24th November and that it is possible that agreement will be reached. I do not believe that agreement will be reached. I believe that my right hon. Friend will have to take on the arduous duty of mediating in the matter and of coming down on one side or the other. Perhaps in reply to the debate he will indicate what he would say if that unhappy conclusion were reached.<br/>
We already have amendments which are sufficient and adequate for the purpose that we want&#x2014;the setting up of a separate LAMS for the Peak District National Park. I hope that that will be done.<br/>
Whatever my right hon. Friend and others have heard in their sounding of opinion, the elected members who serve on the Peak District National Park Council are unanimous right across the board, from the leader of the Conservative Opposition on the Derbyshire County Council, Councillor Wilson, to the more Left-wing figure of my friend and former Member of this House Councillor Peter Jackson, that we should have these powers. I believe that we should have them. The amendments put in in another place, which until a few hours ago the


Government appeared to have accepted, would have given those powers to the Peak District National Park.<br/>
I invite my hon. Friends to follow me into the other Lobby tonight, however many Conservative Members support the Government, because we should protect a precious amenity&#x2014;an achievement of a former Labour Government&#x2014;which will for ever be associated with the name of my right hon Friend's father.<br/>
It is inexplicable that my right hon. Friend should come forward and suggest that we disagreed with the Lords amendment because, perhaps on technical grounds, it may be easier to carry the vote that way. The principle is clear. We should vote in the other Lobby, and that is what I urge my hon. Friends to do.</p>

<p>I support my hon. Friend the Member for Derby, North (Mr. White-head). This is another indication of the Government's attitude to the national parks. This issue was first raised in Standing Committee by my hon. Friend the Member for South Shields (Mr. Blen-kinsop), who has a record second to none in this respect. The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland suggested that the Government were sympathetic. These amendments were put forward in another place by someone who also has shown considerable sympathy to the whole idea of the national parks, Lord Sandford, and they were agreed on a free vote. It was apparently intended that we should not divide on party lines tonight, but late in the day it was decided that the Government should again give the national parks the thumbs down.<br/>
Sadly, the present Government have shown very little concern for the national parks. We have waited months for the announcement of their policy on the Sandford Report. They appear not even to have had time to publish their views.<br/>
The key issue is that the national park was to be given the planning responsibility. The whole idea behind the Bill is positive planning, making the purchase of land go hand in hand with the planning authority. If we throw out the amendment, we shall separate the two functions&#x2014;planning remaining with the national

park, and land to be a function of a consortium of local authorities. This will bring confusion to many people in the area. Have we thought how to reconcile the resulting conflict of interest?<br/>
It would have been far better to recognise that in the Peak District National Park we have a national asset, not just for those in the area but for people who live round about. The whole concept of the national park body was that there should be representation not just of those who live in it but if those who live around it and enjoy it. That was the reason for including representatives from Greater Manchester and so on. But the voices of these people are not to be heard when it comes to the use of the land in the park.<br/>
Surely we should try to set up one body concerned with planning and land purchase. We have such an authority: the Peak Park Planning Board. We shall now confuse the issue by having conflicting bodies competing in planning decisions. I ask the Minister to reconsider.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1975-11-11a.1336.0" hansard_membership_id="312" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/3496" speakername="Mr. Nicholas Winterton" colnum="1336" time="">
<p>It is not often that I have anything in common with the hon. Member for Stockport, North (Mr. Bennett). The Peak Park covers some of the most attractive areas of my constituency, so I have a genuine interest in these amendments. The hon. Member for Stockport, North and the hon. Member for Derby, North (Mr. Whitehead) have done the House a service by disagreeing with the Minister.<br/>
It is extraordinary that the Minister should have changed his mind. I am undecided how to vote, but I agree with the hon. Member for Derby, North that the Peak Park Planning Board does a wonderful job. Its task will be made that much more difficult by the Minister's decision. I hope that whoever replies will present a case which we can all understand as to why the Government have taken this decision, apparently at the last moment.<br/>
The area is under great pressure from the large and powerful conurbations that surround it. The Peak Park is a unique feature of the North Midlands and Northwest and it is vitally important to the people living in urban areas that it should remain as undamaged as possible. Its recreation provision for the people of the


area is second to none and it is a wonderful part of the country which must be protected.<br/>
The Minister must present a much better case in his reply. My constituents in the hill villages and elsewhere are interested in this debate and the decision we shall take. The Minister should clarify his position. He has failed to make his case so far.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1975-11-11a.1337.0" hansard_membership_id="7490" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/32714" speakername="Mr. Graham Page" colnum="1337" time="">
<p>I am in the same difficulty as the Minister in trying to decide between two evenly balanced arguments. We start in the Bill by making the Peak Park Planning Board a local authority. From its name one would expect it to deal with the planning under this Bill, and in Committee we pleaded that the action of local authorities under the Bill should be within the framework of planning. The Government accepted our arguments and made amendments recognising that the acquisition powers given to local authorities should be exercised within the framework of planning. My inclination is to say that we should leave the land acquisition management schemes in the hands of the planning board.<br/>
There was great difficulty when the board was set up in getting agreement on the proportion of district council representatives who should be appointed to it, and they do not have a very big representation. Districts might not have as much say in the preparation of LAMS as they would if the schemes were prepared by county authorities. I favour drawing districts into the preparation of LAMS as much as possible. The spirit of the amendment in calling for coordinated planning in the Peak Park area is right. If we can achieve that, together with a greater representation on the board, the Minister is probably right in saying that we should not accept the amendment but should go for another arrangement.</p>

<p>I share the anxieties of my hon. Friends the Members for Derby, North (Mr. Whitehead) and Stockport, North (Mr. Bennett) about the Government's attitude to these amendments. The special and unique character of the Peak National Park have been referred to. My constituency is adjacent to the park and I have spent many happy times in recrea

tion in it. I travel through it about twice a week on normal parliamentary business. I am therefore acquainted with it, and I know of its immense value not only to my area but to the whole country.<br/>
I understand the basic principle of the Bill to be that the planning power and the management and acquisition of land should go hand in hand. That is what the amendments seek to achieve in the Peak National Park, even though the Peak National Park Board is not a local authority within the normal definition.<br/>
I am therefore puzzled by the Government's attitude to the amendments. I share the anxieties which my hon. Friends have expressed and I should like a fuller explanation of the Government's approach to the amendments.</p>

<p>The interesting contributions to the debate underline the dilemma rather than solve it. It is an interesting and curious situation when a Labour Minister, with the help of the Conservative Whip, is suggesting that the House should reject amendments moved by a Conservative peer in the other place, and when he is supported by some Conservatives and some of his hon. Friends but is opposed by other of his right hon. Friends who in turn are supported by Conservatives. That is an indication of the situation we face.<br/>
When I said that I thought there was a balance, I was obviously underestimating, not overestimating, the situation. I fully understand every point made by my hon. Friends the Members for Derby, North (Mr. Whitehead), Stockport, North (Mr. Bennett) and Sheffield, Heeley (Mr. Hooley). I sympathise very much with them. But I must ask them to see it my way. It is a balance, and I needed to come down on one side or the other. The obvious solution was to leave the Bill as it was and to agree with the Lords amendments. I do not think, however, that that would have given the necessary weight to the compromise solution.<br/>
What the right hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) said is right. When the right hon. Gentleman and I agree it is because both of us have a very deep love of local authorities. Most of the time we are fighting one and other on our interpretation of that love. On this occasion we agree. We are trying


to see to what extent the elected representatives, particularly in the districts, can play their part in a matter which is vital both to them and to the country. The factor which tips the balance for me is the compromise solution that has been suggested. I do not know whether it will work, and perhaps it will not, but let us give it a chance. If it does not work, we must think again.<br/>
It might help if I remind the House what is involved. The compromise solution was that each county LAMS should be divided into two parts. One was to be for the Peak National Park area and one for the rest of the country. All the six LAMS relating to the Peak Park were to be identical, and arrangements were proposed for the setting up of a joint committee and other joint arrangements for operating the LAMS within the national park.</p>

<p>I should not have described it as infinitesimal. I do not think that the hon. Gentleman who disagreed with me earlier would have regarded it as infinitesimal.

<p>choice, but someone must make it and advise the House what to do. I am advising the House to try it. If it does not work, we can look at it again. There is time. But as the counties themselves have come up with this compromise solution, let us give it a chance and see that it works.</p>

<p>I beg to move, That this House doth disagree with the Lords in the said amendment.<br/>
The point of this amendment is to postpone the date for the making of the land acquisition and management schemes from 31st December 1975 to 29th February 1976. This is an issue we have debated several times in Committee and on Report. We have been over the ground so often on this point that I do not want to weary the House with it for too long tonight.<br/>
In the view of the Government the local authorities, most of which are getting on very well with the job, have had ample notice of this. They have contributed to the discussions on it for over a year. In the light of this I do not believe that it would be of advantage&#x2014;indeed, it would be a positive disadvantage&#x2014;if the date were postponed from that which the local authorities have always known, namely 31st December 1975.</p>

<p>In the view of the Opposition, this is an important amendment. I am glad to see the Secretary of State present. It seems probable that he has set some sort of parliamentary record in that throughout the proceedings on this important Bill he has not managed to utter one word. He did not speak on Second Reading. He did not speak&#x2014;perhaps understandably&#x2014;in Committee and he did not speak on Report or Third

Reading. So far this evening he has not spoken.</p>

<p>I am most grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his invitation to join these debates. It is true that I have missed a number of speeches from the Opposition Benches, and evidently the more interesting ones. I am in the uniquely happy position of having a fellow Minister in the Department who is also a Cabinet Minister. I cannot think that the House wants two Cabinet Ministers joining in on the same Bill. That would be at least one too many. As far as I can understand it&#x2014;it is hard for us to know who is in the Shadow Cabinet&#x2014;there is only one member of the Shadow Cabinet who has taken part in these debates and even he left the whole of the Committee stage to someone who is not a member of the Shadow Cabinet.</p>

<p>I am delighted that the right hon. Gentleman has broken his "duck". I cannot say that his contribution was particularly helpful. People were beginning to wonder whether the right hon. Gentleman's heart was in the Bill.<br/>
This is an important amendment. The House will recall that when we discussed this point on Report the Minister behaved in a most extraordinary way. The bullying tone he adopted was disgraceful. He has boasted of his love for local government tonight. Anyone who wants to know what his attitude to local government is capable of being should look at the proceedings on Report, when, talking about the implementation of the schemes by the unfair date of 31st December, he said:
<q>I believe that the overwhelming majority of local authorities are prepared to do this. If they are not prepared to do this by 31st December my right hon. Friend is prepared to do it for them. My right hon. Friend has quite a lot of power in this matter. Not only can he step in; he can create organisations that can step in and he can even find


other local authorities&#x2014;there are plenty of good local authorities all over the country&#x2014;who would be prepared to step in on this basis.</q>
<q>I am sorry that it is clearly in the morning because I should like every local authority that is deliberately dragging its heels to listen to what I have to say. They know perfectly well, and have known for the past eight months or so, that this is exactly what the situation would be."&#x2014;[<i>Official Report,</i> 13th October 1975; Vol. 897, c. 1092&#x2013;3.]</q>
Although they were made at an obscure hour of the morning, his remarks have been very much resented. They were disgraceful remarks to make in the House.<br/>
When the Bill came before the other place, Baroness Birk, who spoke on behalf of the Government, was rather more emollient. Apologising on behalf of the Minister for Planning and Local Government, she said:
<q>there is an important time and space difference between talking at 2 o'clock in the morning and talking at about 8.20 in the evening.</q>
That is a novel constitutional doctrine. Does the right hon. Gentleman accept it, and will he withdraw the odious threats he made on Report?<br/>
In referring to comments made by hon. Members, Baroness Birk was wholly unsupported by the facts. She is recorded as saying:
<q>the comments made on that occasion clearly indicated that a number of Members of another place were getting rather exercised and were feeling weary and emotional.</q>
That is nonsense, as is borne out by the record of our debate. Just as the noble Baroness apologised for the right hon. Gentleman, so I suggest that the right hon. Gentleman should apologise on behalf of the noble Baroness.<br/>
I should like some substantiation from the right hon. Gentleman on the intriguing pronouncement by the noble Baroness that
<q>It is general practice that once a Bill has had its Second Reading in another place, anybody can go ahead, particularly if it is a Government measure, on the assumption that the Bill will be passed and be on the Statute Book. As a Bill goes further along and gets through its Committee and Report stages in another place, and it even gets accepted by noble Lords opposite that the Bill will get on the Statute Book, as they have this Bill, then one can say that it has become constitutionally acceptable. If anything happens in between, then there is a change."&#x2014;[<i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 27th October 1975; Vol. 365, cc. 105&#x2013;107.]</q>
I find it hard to know what the noble Baroness was talking about. It is an

odd remark for a Minister of the Crown to make.<br/>
The amendment is extremely moderate. It was spoken to in the other place by Lord Ridley, who is a prominent figure in local government. The Minister will recognise that Lord Ridley is a responsible, moderate, sensible and highly experienced person. I should be surprised if the Minister were not prepared to take seriously his views.<br/>
Lord Ridley pointed out that Northumberland&#x2014;his county&#x2014;could not be ready with these schemes by 31st December. He said that the amendment, which sought to delay, until the end of February, the date by which the schemes must be presented, was supported by the Association of County Councils and the Association of District Councils. A substantial part of the local authority world has therefore joined in the pleas to the Minister to be allowed this extension of time.<br/>
The date of 31st December, on which the Government are apparently insisting, was set many months ago when it could not have been known that the Bill would not reach the statute book until mid-November&#x2014;if it does. In putting in that date the Government may have expected to get the legislation through some months earlier. In those circumstances the date of 31st December would have provided at least an arguably reasonable time for local authorities to prepare their schemes. The Bill will not reach the statute book until the middle of November. This means that local authorities will have only the period between mid-November and 31st December in which to prepare these extremely complicated schemes. That is a wholly unreasonable proposition, and the Lords amendment is meaningful and sensible. The only objection to it that I can see is that it would improve an ineradicably awful Bill.<br/>
Has the Minister any grounds for asserting, as he has asserted, that local authorities are dragging their heels? Does he expect them to be on time? What about Northumberland, which I have quoted already? Has the Minister any reason to believe that Lord Ridley was wrong? What about the Peak authority, which we have just been discussing? After all, the question of who is to be the Peak authority has been settled only this evening. Is


that authority to have its schemes prepared by 31st December?<br/>
Why is not the Minister sensible about this? Why does he go on being so obstinate about it when all the logic is against him? It is absolute nonsense that these schemes have to go ahead before the structure and local plans are ready. But, even accepting that they may go ahead, it is absolutely clear that the whole balance of argument is in favour of the Lords amendment and against the Minister.</p>

<p>In opening the debate somewhat briefly, the right hon. Gentleman said that we had often been over this ground. Perhaps it is unfortunate that we seem always to go over it at a rather eccentric hour. This time we are a little later than when we discussed the matter in Standing Committee. I do not know whether that makes us wiser or more emotional. Even their Lordships discussed it at what was for them the extremely late hour of half-past eight.<br/>
There is another feature of the late hour at which we discuss this subject. Each time we discuss it at a later date, and, as my hon. Friend the Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Raison) has just observed, that means at a later date than was anticipated when the date of 31st December was first included in the draft Bill. That is not without significance. If that date were right originally, it is scarcely logical&#x2014;certainly it has not been explained or excused here, in Standing Committee or in another place&#x2014;for the Government to insist on including that date even as the date of the possible enactment of the Bill gets later and later.<br/>
That is not the only factor affecting the relevance and rightness of the date. We must note what has been said about the structure of local government. At this moment I hesitate, apart from the risk of being ruled out of order, to enter into discussing the merits and demerits of a two-tier structure of planning. If I did so, we might be here even longer. However, undoubtedly the two-tier structure is the background for land acquisition and management schemes, and it is also why the Royal Town Planning Institute, which I hope will command at least the Minister's ear and attention on this issue, is so concerned about the date of this proposal.<br/>
It refers to the potential source of controversy between the two levels of local government. We are all aware of the possibilities and actualities of occasional disagreements between the two levels, but we cannot fail to be aware that when that disagreement occurs it is a source of confusion, delay, additional cost and annoyance to the public.<br/>
In that connection we have to note the concern of both the Association of County Councils and the Association of District Councils which was mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Aylesbury. It is interesting that when, on a previous occasion, we were going over this ground, the right hon. Gentleman's excuse for not wishing to change his mind was that he had had no representations from local authorities. If that was an adequate reason then, I hope he will be able to explain why, now that he has had representations from the local authority associations, he is not paying attention to them.<br/>
2.0 a.m.<br/>
We are assured also that adequate progress is being made. I find it hard to accept that excuse for not changing the date. Baroness Birk said in another place that the Government did not have detailed information about progress in each county area. If the right hon. Gentleman does not have detailed information, how can he be so confident that progress is being made?</p>

<p>Lady Birk was speaking for the Government. I hope that those hon. Members sitting below the Gangway opposite who are so used to opposing the Government will nevertheless find it possible to agree occasionally with their spokesman in another place.<br/>
The local authorities are busy at this period of the year with their budgets, which are commanding a not inconsidable proportion of the time of senior officers and chief executives. The Bill will place an extra burden on them, although their task could scarcely be made more difficult than it is this year.<br/>
There are economic difficulties. The Government require that there should be no additional recruitment to local authority staffs, and most hon. Members


welcome that. But then the Government place an additional responsibility on the staffs of local authorities. Therefore, the additional burden can be fulfilled only by the existing staff, which means their neglecting for a period the work they would otherwise have been doing.<br/>
Thus we thave the peculiar situation that, at a time of unparalleled pressure on local authorities, particularly on the senior officers and chief executives, the Government are placing an additional burden on them while asking them to ensure the greatest possible restraint in their budgets and to recruit no more staff.<br/>
There will be a unique burden on local authority officers, but the right hon. Gentleman decides that the original date must stay. He offers no real reason or excuse. Those officers are being forced into this extra work against a ridiculous pressure of time, and I cannot believe that their approach to the work has been helped by the Minister's bullying attitude. It is not a very satisfactory approach and I do not think that he would regard it as a very apt way of showing his much-boasted love of local authorities. It is more like a love-hate relationship if in the early hours of the morning such threatening words have to be uttered.<br/>
At this time the local authorities are looking at their budgets. I hope they have noticed that they can reclaim the cost of these schemes in due course, but it was not until 5th November that, in reply to a Question from me, the right hon. Gentleman made this absolutely clear in respect of land acquisition and management schemes, when he said that local authorities had been advised that as soon as the Bill received Royal Assent they would be directed to open land accounts. I had hoped that the right hon. Gentleman would be able to inform us that the local authorities had long been made aware of this. If they are being threatened, encouraged, incited or whatever it is to prepare these schemes, they might have been encouraged a little more had they been made aware of it much earlier.<br/>
I do not think we should underestimate the task. Schedule 5 to the Bill explains what is required. It is immediately clear that there is a good deal of work involved in preparing a land acquisition and management scheme. One would hope that

the first part, the co-ordination of action, would not require too much work by the local authorities, at least if they are capable of working happily together. The second part is the requirement that the scheme should include action under the Act. One is immediately led to wonder how local authorities are meant to deal with this aspect if they cannot know until tomorrow, perhaps, what land they will have to acquire, what will be exempt or excepted or whether there will be some new category introduced to confuse us still more.</p>

<p>May I draw my hon. Friend's attention to paragraph 1(<i>f</i>) of Schedule 5, which states
<q>such other matters as the Secretary of State may direct"?</q>
These are also to be considered by the local authority in drawing up a land acquisition and management scheme. How are we to know between now and 31st December what those other matters are to be?</p>

<p>I am grateful to my hon. Friend, because that is a most interesting sidelight on the preparation of schemes. It is rather like the South Sea Bubble to have words like "such other matters as I shall in due course direct". In other words, if one is lucky one's functions are not taken over by another authority, and if one is unlucky it will be Bootle to take over Brighton, or something like that. That is just another aspect of the scope of work that could be involved. It is all very well for the Secretary of State to expect this to be carried out by the State, to refuse to change his mind and then come to the House and change the burden of work which the local authorities will be expected to carry out and the various categories of development.<br/>
I cannot understand why the right hon. Gentleman should expect these LAMS, which we are led to believe are vital to the satisfactory operation of this legislation, to be prepared effectively against so much uncertainty about the type of land and development they are to cover, what special arrangements the Secretary of State will direct and a large number of other relevant matters which are subject to change as the Bill winds its comparatively weary way&#x2014;</p>

<p>Before my hon.

<p>I am always grateful to be reminded of Russian proverbs, because I do not regard myself as an authority on them, either in translation or in the original.<br/>
I return to my point, and, although the Minister may profess surprise and even hilarity, it is a serious one. If we are to have this legislation, presumably we should all be interested in having it work as smoothly as such an appalling piece of legislation can be expected to work, with the local authorities given the best chance to bring it into operation smoothly and with the minimum of friction between the various levels of local government.<br/>
Why, then, do we have to rush these important land acquisition and management schemes? Why cannot the right hon. Gentleman accept that we are likely to get better schemes better prepared if more time is available? I ask him to recognise that it is unrealistic at this stage to expect local authorities to rush through these schemes by the date in the Bill. Most of us recognise that the date of 29th February suggested in the Lords amendment is a very modest amendment.</p>

<p>I remind my hon. Friend that Clause 16(4) says:
<q>or such later date as the Secretary of State may agree in any particular case.</q>

It may be that the Secretary of State intends later in this debate to indicate that he will consider rather a lot of special cases and that if the local authorities cannot meet the deadline he may give a general directive that the date be extended.</p>

<p>The Minister will give his right hon. Friend an additional burden unless he accepts this modest extension. It is a realistic change.<br/>
The Lords amendment suggests that the scheme should be prepared by 29th February next year instead of by the end of this year. If we did not want next February, the February after that would probably be appreciated. However, if we have to keep to this date a large number of local authorities will have to rush because they will not know whether the Secretary of State will see fit to consider granting an extension in any particular case. Indeed, the Secretary of State has left himself little time to determine which, if any, special cases should be allowed. Moreover, he does not have the people to assess the situation. Therefore we shall rush schemes, and some of them will be bad schemes, because of this extraordinary reluctance to accept even the most modest amendment.<br/>
I urge the Minister to reconsider this matter. We do not ask him to give way on an enormous matter of principle, but we ask him to recognise good sense.</p>

<p>I was not privileged to travel with the Minister over this ground before and therefore I did not originally intend to intervene. However, I have been so disturbed by the interventions from the Government Front Bench, which have been commendable only for their brevity, that perhaps a contribution might not be amiss.<br/>
Even my untutored eyes, looking at the schedule to see what exactly is expected of a local authority, recognise that there is something wrong with the Bill.<br/>
For those hon. Members who have not applied themselves as closely to Schedule 5 as my right hon. and hon. Friends, let me point out to them some of the things which are expected of local authorities


over the next six weeks. For instance, they must review
<q>the services of persons qualified and experienced in the acquisition, management, planning, development and disposal of land which are so available".</q>
After the development gains tax, the development land tax which is in prospect, and the whole reform of local government, where will these people with these considerable qualifications be found? Will they be found within the ranks of local government? Will they be poached from other authorities, or will they have to be drawn from private practice? What salaries will have to be offered to secure their services when they realise that this Bill can have only an ephemeral life? That is the first problem. The Minister has certainly not given me any reassurance on those matters. It may be that when he winds up this debate he will have something to say, but for the moment he has treated the House with less than courtesy. I am bound to give voice to my concern about this aspect of the matter.<br/>
Schedule 5 paragraph 3 provides that
<q>(1) Each scheme shall contain&#x2014;
<ol>
<li>(<i>a</i>) arrangements for the co-ordination of action by the authorities, including action under this Act".</li>
</ol></q>
If we take as an example the Kent County Council, does that provision mean that it must consult every district council in Kent, of which there are many? How will it find time to do that? According to the Minister it only has six weeks. We also understand that each scheme shall contain,
<q>(<i>b</i>) arrangements, where appropriate, for the use by one authority of officers or servants employed by another authority".</q>
Does that mean that the chief executive of the Dover District Council may be loaned to Shepway to determine what land should be acquired and developed in that particular authority? That would cause considerable consternation in my constituency.<br/>
Paragraph 3(<i>c</i>) provides that each scheme shall contain
<q>where appropriate, provisions for the transfer of sums between authorities".</q>
This is most disturbing, because it will have a considerable effect on the rates charged in various areas. What kind of sums will be transferred, for instance, from Dover to Thanet? Those are the

type of matters which my constituents will want to know about. So far I have heard nothing from the Minister concerning these matters. It may be that those of my right hon. and hon. Friends who were privileged to serve on the Committee had the benefit of the Minister's views. I suggest that he should make more free of them to the whole House, because some of us have not had the benefit of his experience and advice upstairs.<br/>
We then have,
<q>arrangements for determining matters of dispute between the authorities".</q>
That opens up an important matter. The Minister envisages considerable friction as a result of the introduction of the Bill between the various district authorities in Kent, for instance, which have so far lived harmoniously. Before setting the district authorities by the ears and introducing disharmony, I suggest that the right hon. Gentleman should give the county council a chance to work out the scheme with care and in detail. That cannot be done in six weeks.<br/>
One can take a charitable view and say that the Minister is ignorant of what he is attempting to impose on county councils. But, more likely, he is arrogantly indifferent to what he is attempting to do.</p>

<p>The right hon. Gentleman nods assent. The House and, indeed, the country should take full account of that. After months of debate, when he had the benefit of the experience and carefully thought out views of my hon. Friends, the right hon. Gentleman blandly admits that he is arrogantly indifferent to what he is about to impose on an already overburdened local government structure.<br/>
In fact, the matter is more sinister than that. My hon. Friend the Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Raison) has already made the point that the Minister is seeking to take over the concoction of these plans. In other words, he is not proposing to leave any vestige of independence in this crucial area to the county councils. The right hon. Gentleman may take his own bland jocular view. We and the country must form our view. We have become accustomed to the notion that the Bill will be a constitutional outrage. Unless this modest amendment is accepted, I believe


that it will be an administrative outrage as well.</p>

<p>I moved an amendment of this kind, though not with this date, when the Bill was before this House on the last occasion. Therefore, I support the Lords amendment.<br/>
It seems common sense that the date 31st December, whether the Minister will extend it or not, should not appear in the Bill. I suggest that the right hon. Gentleman should take the date which is to be applied to Scotland&#x2014;1st April. Some people might think that a suitable date for the Bill. If 1st April is to apply to Scotland, why not to England?<br/>
Local authorities do not have sufficient planning or estate management staff. For example, my county council has one estate manager and a couple of assistant clerks. For it to get a land acquisition and management scheme set up by anything like 31st December is not conceivable. The Bill is supposed to be flexible. Let us have some flexibility in this respect. It does not make sense as it is.<br/>
If these things are to be done, we shall have to pay through the nose to get the necessary staff. I was recently approached by a district council to see whether I could get a visa for a Pakistani gentleman to join its planning staff. I do not suggest that the man had not the ability to do the job, but that shows the difficulty being experienced in getting staff.<br/>
I vividly remember over a year ago advertisements for staff at a salary of &#x00A3;4,750. We got no replies to those advertisements. Indeed, we got no replies until the salary offered was near &#x00A3;6,000.<br/>
The Minister must know as well as the rest of us that there is a great shortage of qualified planning staff. Perhaps the best thing we could do would be to go out and join planning teams. We could make fortunes if we did, but that would not do the country much good.<br/>
It is nonsense to insist on 31st December. I believe that date will have to be extended, and the time to admit that is now.</p>

<p>Surely the important part of this subsection is that which says:
<q>&#x2026;or such later date as the Secretary of State may agree in any particular case.</q>
If the right hon. Gentleman is going to exercise his discretion responsibly and

fairly, it follows that the date "not later than 31st December" may be no less unreasonable than any other, but if it is not, it is important to seek to get him to change it. I do not know in what circumstances the Secretary of State is likely to agree a later date in any particular case. I am not aware that he has yet stated the circumstances in which he would use his discretion.<br/>
What troubles me is that, when given the opportunity to explain himself more fully, he made it absolutely clear that he would not exercise his discretion to extend a local authority's time: what he would do is move in some other organisation which would be prepared to ensure that these matters are concluded by 31st December. His hon. Friend said on 13th October that if it were not prepared to do this by 31st December, the Minister would do it: that he had a good deal of power in the matter&#x2014;[<i>Interruption.</i>] I am dealing with the Minister's intention. If he intends to be fair-minded and to use his discretion judicially, the question is different, but if he is manifesting a positive desire to be unjudicial, we must think again.</p>

<p>In six weeks the Minister or the Secretary of State has to decide whether it is right to act in this manner by granting an extension. I fail to see how this discretion can be exercised fairly and judicially when there is so little time to determine whether an extension should be granted in any particular case. That is surely one of the best reasons for arguing that there should be at least a modest general extension if for no other reason than to allow him to determine how he can best find the cases in which a longer extension can then be granted.</p>

<p>I am grateful. Of course it is not just a matter of six weeks. There will be five days for Christmas and five weekends, so that is at least 15 days off the 42 days which may be left. We are talking about 25 or 27 days in which the local authorities must come to these arrangements.<br/>

<q>&#x2026;or such later date as the Secretary of State may agree in any particular case"&#x2014;</q>
are just verbiage. They are the velvet glove behind which the mailed fist of Socialism is wearing holes.<br/>
We have heard and read the contention of Ministers that this Government have great concern for local authorities. If the Government are not prepared to allow local authorities ample time to make arrangements, they are showing their contempt for these authorities and this should be made clear to the public.<br/>
If it is being suggested that local authorities should be puppets on the string of a Socialist State, we all know where we are and we shall be able, with greater agreement, to support the Lords amendment and show that we, at least, want to see some sense put into this senseless, doctrinaire and tyrannical piece of legislation.</p>

<p>I have been listening to this debate for five hours and I have not always agreed with the line taken by my hon. Friends on some amendments, particularly the proposal relating to legal aid. However, this amendment is an important test case.<br/>
The Minister has a great reputation in local government. I have spent many years in local government and I know of the immense problems it is facing, especially with the reorganisation and the current economic situation.<br/>
We are talking about just two months in the history of our country. We want the date put back because the Bill has moved a little more slowly than expected and therefore local authorities will need a little more time to prepare their plans. What could be more reasonable?<br/>
If the Minister does not move on this amendment, I have serious doubts about us making progress tonight.</p>

<p>The Minister will earn the good will of the House if he chooses this as the amendment on which to give way.<br/>
It is a very practicable amendment. The Bill says that LAMSs shall be prepared, but this is a bit of a farce. The Minister tells us that, as far as he is concerned, they have been prepared while his noble Friend in another place said there was no information on how many of these LAMSs had been prepared for the slaughter of the property owner. The LAM-ing season seems a little short this year. Local authorities are supposed to have the schemes ready within the next 30 working days. This is a complete farce.<br/>
We suspect that considerable time and money has already been spent in drawing up schemes in anticipation of what might be in the Bill. Neither we nor local authorities even know what directions the Secretary of State will give under Schedule 5.<br/>
On the last occasion this subject was debated, we were told that if local authorities had not prepared schemes by 31st December, the Secretary of State would do the work. But what staff has the Secretary of State to do this work? Has he already engaged staff? If so, where are they? Are they tucked away in Marsham Street? Or will he take busy civil servants off other work to do the job that local authorities cannot do because he has not given them enough time?<br/>
The amendment is practical and this cannot be a party matter. Local authorities are obliged to prepare these


schemes and it is a matter of pure practical sense to give them more time to do so.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1975-11-11a.1359.0" hansard_membership_id="1843" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/12961" speakername="Mr. Budgen" colnum="1359" time="">
<p>I wish to make only a brief intervention. The Minister seems to be facing a difficult time. He has to organise this scheme within six weeks. He will have to recruit staff to go through the long process of consultation and preparation. He will have to do that through the Civil Service. Sometimes my hon. Friends are critical of the Civil Service, but it has acquired a great reputation for steady conscientious work in which there has seldom been any suspicion of carelessness or dictatorial behaviour, far less of corruption.<br/>
But the Civil Service is totally unsuited to getting all this work done in six weeks. It will take a vigorous dictator to kick people very hard, to knock them about and tell them what is to be done. Perhaps the Department could pay one of the Minister's Friends from the Tribune Group to act as a civil servant to get this done. He is the sort of chap who will kick everybody in the teeth and tell anyone who objects to belt up or he will kick them into the ground. Perhaps the right hon. Gentleman could get the hon. Member for Luton, West (Mr. Sedgemore) to bash the proposal through in six weeks.<br/>
We therefore want to know whether the Minister can obtain any of these useful and charming persons to help him in the judicial and civilised mode of government that he advocates.</p>

<p>I wish to reinforce the views expressed by my hon. Friend. I must comment on the excellence of the drafting of the amendment in another place. It was certainly most expertly done and I am sure the whole House would like to pay tribute to the noble Lord who moved it.<br/>
I rise, however, to ask the Government why they are in such a hurry. What would be the disadvantage of delaying for a few weeks the completion of the schemes? The Prime Minister has told us that it will now for ever be the natural order of things for there to be a Labour Government. If that is so, why the hurry? Could we not wait until 1984? Why not wait until the schemes are prepared? We should still by then have the same

Prime Minister and the same obdurate Minister for Planning and Local Government sitting on the Front Bench smirking and refusing to budge an inch.<br/>
Are the Government worried that things are not going very well? Do they fear that perhaps the popular support of 29 per cent. of the electorate who put them into power is slipping away from them? Are the sands of time running out? Do the Government feel that they must hurry and grab people's property before they are prevented from doing so? Is that why these six weeks are so important? There are only 25 shopping days left to Christmas and it is not possible for the local authorities to complete their plans in time. My own local authority has made this point to me. What is to be lost by another few weeks? Why cannot the Minister for once say "I agree with what the Opposition have said. We shall make this small concession"?<br/>
I do not know how the plans will be implemented. Who will implement them. Which people at present doing nothing are available to put the plans through if local authorities drag their feet?<br/>
The reputation of the House is diminishing as Governments put through absurd Bills at such hours as 2.40 a.m. and refuse to listen to reasonable, sensible suggestions which would ameliorate the effect of the Bill. If the Government want this legislation to stick on the statute book, they should do everything they can to make this side of the House accept it. Admittedly, there is a long way to go, but this would be a little start along the road, late in the day. Such a conversion would at least show willing and a co-operative attitude.<br/>
The Bill will be repealed. The crash is not very far away. A borrowing of &#x00A3;975 million was announced a few days ago, and probably the Government will have no majority in the coming Session. The sands of time are running out. That is why the Government want to get the scheme by 31st December<br/>
Would it not have been better for the Government to be a little more conciliatory, and to show a little less of the attitude that the gentlemen in Whitehall know best? The Government would have done better to be a little less dictatorial and accept some of the points made by my right hon. and hon. Friends.


Why do not the Government wish their legislation to stick, and seek co-operation? A little of the spirit they advocate for industry might very well have been imported into the Bill.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend's speech is so fascinating that I should like to hear him dilate at greater length. Would he care to consider that the answer to one of his questions is that the Government have given a pledge to some union that this legislation will be in by 1st January 1976?</p>

<p>It is not for me to speculate, or to dilate, which is something I would never seek to do. The question should be put not to me but to the Minister. Was the date of New Year's Eve part of the social contract? Does the small print that has not been shown to us contain that date as the date by which the plans must be completed? If so, we can happily accept the amendment, because the social contract is a busted flush. It has been torn up by one party to it, so we, too, can tear it up. All the sacrifices made by everyone who is not a member of a trade union have stuck, whereas the sacrifices the trade unions were supposed to make have been welshed upon.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend has a great deal of knowledge of the way in which the Civil Service works.

<p>Nothing would worry me more than to see the hon. Member for Luton, West (Mr. Sedgemore), whose usual diligency has deserted him, removed from his profit under the Crown. We would no longer be able to see the living example of Socialism and to heat his pearls of wisdom and good sense day after day. We would be deprived

not only of the pleasure of seeing and hearing him, but of hearing the true nature of the threat which he poses to our society. I very much hope that it will not be the hon. Gentleman who will implement this plan.<br/>
I hope that the Minister will see sense at this late hour. I know that he has ready his bucket and spade to go off tomorrow to some sunny shore to relax after the strenuous time that he has had with the Bill. My hon. Friends are prepared to give up their hare coursing to stay here through tomorrow. It is no disadvantage to us if he has to delay his holiday. On the other hand, he might get away very much more easily if he were to make one small concession.<br/>
If we were to seek to make major pieces of legislation such as this more or less acceptable to both sides we would not have the in-and-out on-and-off processes that we have seen with the betterment levy, the Land Commission and now this silly Bill, one after another. If only the Government could understand that it is necessary even for Socialist Governments to legislate by consent. They could start at this late hour by accepting the excellent amendment in the name of Lord Ridley.</p>

<p>During this debate many questions have been put to the Minister. I hope that he will answer them. So far not one voice has been raised in support of the Minister, unless we count all the antediluvian grunts from below the Government Front Bench, which I do not. In any event, the source of those grunts has now disappeared.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Burton (Mr. Lawrence) has said&#x2014;I accept his mathematics&#x2014;that we have very few days, assuming the Bill is enacted, before 31st December. In that short time the local authorities have to do a great deal of work. As my hon. Friend the Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury (Mr. Ridley) has said, why is there this great hurry? What is so magical about 31st December except that the following day is a Bank Holiday? I would not have thought that that in itself was particularly magical. I could have understood it if we had been arguing, as was being argued earlier, that we should have a six month delay.<br/>
It will not have escaped notice that in May of next year there are to be many district elections throughout the country. In those elections the Labour Party will be annihilated. We shall gain control of Leeds, Manchester and Birmingham, to name but three cities. We can easily understand why the Minister wants things to happen before those happy events come to pass.<br/>
I hope that the Minister will tell us the meaning of the phrase in subsection (4):
<q>or such later date as the Secretary of State may agree in any particular case".</q>
Does he envisage anything contained within that phrase being activated by him or by his right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for the Environment? Secondly, is it correct that the first appointed day will be 5th April? Statements have been made on this matter in the other place, but we should like the date to be confirmed in this House.<br/>
The subject of staff has been mentioned by a number of hon. Members&#x2014;including my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Dover and Deal (Mr. Rees), the hon. Member for Isle of Wight (Mr. Ross), and my hon. Friend the Member for Hove (Mr. Sainsbury) in a succinct speech in which he stressed the importance of manpower and staffing considerations. Local authority staff are engaged in preparing structure plans and local plans. They are also trying to cope with nearly 500 circulars sent out in the first nine months of this year by four major Departments of State. Additionally, they have to cope with the counterinflation and consumer protection proposals, and also with the circulars relating to the cuts in expenditure. This work will place a heavy strain on chief officers in local authorities and also on committee chairmen and councillors. Furthermore, in a little over a week or so the Secretary of State will be announcing his conclusions on the rate support grant, which also will impose a tremendous amount of work on senior staff and councillors. All this is happening at a time when local authorities have only a month or so left before they reach the end of the year.<br/>
The Minister has often spoken about the good will of local government, and my hon. Friend the Member for Chippenham

(Mr. Awdry) dealt with this aspect. As a Government Whip at the time I well remember how both sides, in a genuine love of local government, worked together on the Local Government Bill. My right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) was also heavily involved in that work. I hope that the Minister, even at this late stage, will show good will and flexibility to the local authorities.</p>

<p>Does not my hon. Friend agree that by 31st December this year it will be physically impossible for district, borough and county councils to consider reports submitted to them by their officers, to carry out consultations, and to submit plans or schemes for each area?</p>

<p>My hon. Friend makes a practical point. He was at one time my county councillor, and he knows that county authorities are now undertaking a cycle of meetings at a time when an abnormally heavy work-load is falling upon their shoulders. The Government will lose nothing by showing flexibility in this matter and I hope that, even in a Bill as bad as the present one, they will display some vestige of good will.<br/>
Having heard the powerful arguments advanced from various sides of the House&#x2014;[<i>Interruption.</i>] We are dealing with dedicated, professional people and elected representatives trying to cope with a great deal of legislation. They have many problems, not of their own making. It does no one any good to giggle at such things. Will the Minister look at this again? I am sure that he is not trying to dictate to local authorities. What he said a month ago was unfortunate but let us put that behind us. Let him listen to the views of the House and accept this amendment. Let him show us that the good will he has spoken about is real.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Ashford (Mr. Speed) always speaks with moderation, understanding and intelligence. It is necessary to treat the points he puts forward with considerable gravity. They are important and they will be dealt with. Perhaps I can deal first with one or two points that were not of such a high level. First, there was the curious attack made on my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State. It was a silly attack because I have to accept the fact, reluctantly, that my right hon. Friend was on


record long before me as being in favour of the public ownership of development land. It was rather childish to say that he was half-hearted about this. It is almost beyond comprehension.<br/>
The other childish argument was that because this Bill has come late in the Session it must mean that the date of the LAMS must be pushed forward. It it childish, because anyone who went through those long days and nights in Committee knows perfectly well that at the beginning the Opposition were moving amendments to alter the date of the LAMS. At that time they might have thought that the Bill would be delayed. As far as the Government were concerned everything was on course.</p>

<p>No, I will not give way. I am dealing with the trivialities. I want to get to the important point. Let me get the trivialities out of the way, the stupid points, so that I may deal with the serious points made by the hon. Member for Chippenham (Mr. Awdry), the right hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) and the hon. Member for Ashford. I have to answer their points because they concern the important case. That case is that between today and the 31st December there is insufficient time for authorities to get together for the making of the schemes embodied in the land acquisition management schemes. If that is so, how is it that local authorities managed to get together some time ago? [HON. MEMBERS: "How many?"] I cannot give that information to the House. At the moment the schemes are unofficial. The hon. Gentleman should know after all these months that the LAMS have to be made by 31st December. They will not officially be given to the Secretary of State until after that date.</p>

<p>No one could possibly accuse you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, of having gory locks.<br/>
As so many local authorities have been able to agree their LAMS, why should there be this difficulty? The local authority associations knew as long ago as last November that they would have to make their LAMS and they got on with it. Some fell behind because they came across genuine difficulties which could not be avoided. That occurred in surprisingly few cases. The hon. Members for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton) and Chippenham can be reassured that in those cases of course my right hon. Friend is prepared, and understandably so, to give what latitude he possibly can give. There has never been any secret about this. Of course he has the power, and he will willingly use it.<br/>
The question was what would happen if there were authorities which, for one reason or another, perhaps encouraged, perhaps off their own bats, deliberately, when they could have got on with their schemes, avoided doing so. What would any sensible Secretary of State do? He would use his powers.<br/>
That is what I was saying, not in anger or, I hope, bullyingly or hectoringly in the early hours of the morning. If hon. Members care to check, they will find that I used the word "deliberately", because I was talking about authorities that deliberately behaved in this manner.</p>

<p>Can the right hon. Gentleman explain two things?

Secondly, before the Bill&#x2014;which, God help us, I pray will never be passed&#x2014;by what right has he been encouraging local authorities to indulge in schemes that may never come into being?

<p>I just have to differ from the hon. and learned Gentleman. Is it not a bit of a mouthful to keep saying land acquisition and management schemes? We live in an age of abbreviations and initials and I feel as innocent as a new-born lamb in defending that one.<br/>
I regret to say that I do not see what on earth the hon. and learned Gentleman is driving at in his second criticism. If one has any consultation with local authorities&#x2014;and I have told the House that there have been more consultations with local authorities about this than about any other Bill ever produced&#x2014;it follows that the whole position must be put to them and that they must be made aware of it and that they should make such plans and preparations as are neces

sary. The right hon. Member for Crosby knows perfectly well that, when he was introducing his Local Government Bill, he was having consultations with local authorities. I do not think that he had as many as I have had, but he had consultations.</p>

<p>I hate to reveal matters that may or may not be confidential, but perhaps I shall in this case. There was one member of one association&#x2014;if I do not identify it, that may help&#x2014;who at the last meeting about a month ago was asked whether he was in favour of an extension of time. I wanted to find out what the feeling was, not among those deliberately thwarting the scheme, but among those who might get into some difficulty, and there are some who might. He wanted an extension, from 31st December to 31st January. Some thought that we should keep to 31st December, but nobody thought that we should go further than he asked. I find that an interesting situation. I do not know whether I have broken a confidence, but I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will forgive me if I have.<br/>
But the hour is getting late and I feel that we should come to a decision on this matter. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will agree.</p>

<p>No. I have given way eight times. It is enough. [HON. MEMBERS: "Not enough."] Of course it is enough. I cannot imagine any Tory Minister who would have given way so often.

<p>I regret that the Minister was not prepared to give way to me, because there is one point on which I should like clarification. He clearly said that a number of local authorities were in a position to present their schemes to the Department. Is he implying that certain officers of local authorities have indicated to him that they have given some thought to schemes, or that those schemes have passed through committees and are therefore council policy?<br/>
If the right hon. Gentleman is saying the latter, I do not believe there is very much behind what he says because, if one has followed the Press and local authority meetings, one finds that there has been little or no mention of these LAMS. If that is the case, the right hon. Gentleman is sadly misleading the House, because I do not believe that many elected members of local authorities have considered these LAMS, which are so important and must be submitted to the Department by the end of the year.<br/>
I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will comment on this aspect. Having been in local government for a number of years, I am aware of the procedures of local authorities. Will the right hon. Gentleman confirm whether the schemes he has mentioned with some local authorities say they are in a position to send have been considered by the elected members? Does not the right hon. Gentleman intend to answer me?</p>

<p>There is an important point, I feel, that perhaps has not been covered. We have heard from the Minister that a number of local authorities have prepared land acquisition and management schemes. If this Bill does not become an Act, who will have to make good the money that may have been spent in making the preparations for these schemes?</p>

<p>Would my hon. Friend not agree that if money has been spent in bringing forward these schemes and the Bill does not become an Act&#x2014;it is very likely that it will not&#x2014;somebody will be surcharged if the district auditor gets on to it? This is a very good reason for a council never spending money on the preparation of a scheme until a Bill has become an Act of Parliament. It would seem to me that only the very improvident councils will have done anything at all.</p>

<p>I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his intervention. What also slightly worries me on this same aspect is that it is a very serious matter in local government when the district auditor comes in. We have had instances of this type of action and it is something that this House should deprecate.</p>

<p>Whether or not the Bill becomes law, the expenditure of funds on the preparation of such a scheme by any local authority would be without authority. The district auditor should surcharge any such authority regardless of whether the Bill becomes law, because money would have been spent without legislative authority.</p>

<p>That may be so. A local authority will have stopped doing other


things in order to be busy preparing a land acquisition and management scheme. With all the officers busy doing this work, the normal planning applications would have to be put on one side.</p>

<p>I do not wish to enter into that controversy. This is a serious matter. There has been an inference by the Minister that many local authorities&#x2014;even right-wing Conservative local authorities&#x2014;have been preparing land acquisition and management schemes at public expense. This concerns me, because I do not believe that it should be happening.</p>

<p>We are getting into something of a muddle. We are now faced with a position in which numbers of local authorities have been acting illegally. Are we now to be faced with a Bill to indemnify the local authorities which have been making illegal preparations for a Bill which is not enacted? Presumably it is to be done retrospectively. Otherwise the muddle will be compounded yet again. That is the first thing that strikes me as being unclear. We should have an explanation before we allow our deliberations to go any further.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton) made a perfectly reasonable point. He asked the Minister a specific question, and the Minister rose and said that he thought that my hon. Friend was being tetchy.</p>

<p>The Minister then complained that it takes him some time to get up to speak because of his bad leg. We entirely sympathise with that. But he was just about to answer this clear and specific question, or so I understood, when suddenly he sat down and said that he would not say any more. Who is being tetchy?<br/>
Here we are, trying to get to the bottom of this ludicrous situation, doing our best patiently to understand what is at stake, and we have a Minister who said earlier that he had given way eight times and that was enough. It is not for him or for

any other Minister to ration the number of times that he gives way on this or any other serious question. We are here to examine this legislation.<br/>
I see that the Minister looks rather less tetchy now. Perhaps we shall have his answer to the question asked by my hon. Friend the Member for Macclesfield, less tetchiness, and a little more patience. We need time to examine this legislation. I hope that we can expect to have our questions answered fully.</p>

<p>I did not intend to intervene, but I have been listening for the past hour to pleas being made to the Minister to listen to arguments which have been put to him, as he admitted, in a reasonable and responsible way.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman began to answer in a reasonable and responsible way. Then he came to the point where he said that he had had consultations with the local authorities, as was his custom and as he felt was the custom of his predecessors in the Conservative Government. He said that he felt that it was a proper responsibility on his part to have extensive consultations and he told us about his consultations with the County Councils Association and the Association of District Councils.<br/>
Tonight, we have asked the right hon. Gentleman to listen to the responsible advice resulting from consultations which Opposition Members have had, and it all seems to be asking him whether he will not give two months more. The right hon. Gentleman said that such a representation had been made to him, and he added that in confidence one of the associations had asked not for two months but for a one-month extension. It so happens that I am a vice-president of the district councils association, so I am concerned to know which of them made that request. Finally, the right hon. Gentleman said that he had dismissed this representation, just as he has dismissed the representation which was made to him by Opposition Members.<br/>
The Minister has been tetchy and less than courteous to the House. He said that my hon. Friend the Member for Ashford (Mr. Speed) was always responsible and reasonable. Unfortunately, we have had no such responsive reasonableness from the right hon. Gentleman. I


thought that he was such a person. I have seen him in his office, and I have always felt that he was such a person. But tonight he is letting down himself and his whole Government in the utterly intractable position that he is adopting.<br/>
I have not heard a single loose speech in this debate. It has all been constructive argument. We have not asked him for another year. He said that in Committee he had been asked for another year. Tonight, he has been asked for two months. He has turned down our request. He has not even bothered to answer the request for one month.</p>

<p>Perhaps I can suggest why the Minister has not answered. It has been said that local government has been spending this money wrongly, but it will get complete compensation from the Exchequer. We have been constantly assured that local authorities will not expend a penny&#x2014;they will get all the money back. Will this be paid out from the Exchequer in compensation for something which has been paid out illegally under the Bill?</p>

I do not want to make a long speech, but I invite the Minister to rise to his feet. I know that we all can get rather irritated at this late hour, and he must be very tired having borne the burden of this horrid Bill for so long. He must long to shed the weight of it from his shoulders. However, I hope that he now feels that the time has come when he would be well advised to get to his feet and answer the points put to him by my hon. Friends, and especially by my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) who put his question very quietly and temperately.<br/>
I hope that I can tempt the Minister, who is now revealing more of his normal characteristic good nature, mirth and cordiality, to rise to his feet and deal with these points. If he does not do so the time may come when I shall ask your leave, Mr. Deputy Speaker, to move a dilatory motion in order that my hon. and right hon.

<p>Yes, that too. We should like the Minister to address us from a "recumbent posture", like Albert and the Lion, if he cannot stand at the Dispatch Box. One is tempted to think that he is so bemused by the LAMS that he remembers the biblical quotation,
<q>He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb dumb before his shearer, so opened he not his mouth".</q>
It is about time the Minister opened his mouth because many points have been put to him forcefully, yet moderately. People are concerned for the good name of the Government of this country. One might say, "Would that we had a Governor-General."<br/>
I hope that the Minister will heed what has been said. People who are earnestly concerned, deeply troubled and have the good name of local government at heart, are looking to the Minister, as the custodian of the rights of local government, to give reasonable answers to reasonable questions. If he will not give those answers, I think that the House should adjourn until he feels able to do so.</p>

<p>The right hon. Member for Crosby, if I understood him correctly, asked how, if local authorities were making LAMS before the appointed day&#x2014;he felt that would be illegal, though on what basis he did not say&#x2014;the payments could be justified.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman, who knows his own Local Government Act 1972&#x2014;

at least I hope he does&#x2014;knows that anything which, in the opinion of the authority, is of advantage to the area is a justifiable expense.<br/>
I thought I had made that clear to the right hon. Gentleman&#x2014;I was really talking to him at that moment&#x2014;when I said that the LAMS were not due to be made until 31st December and not due to be submitted until after that date.

Costs incurred in the preparation of LAMS both before and after enactment can then be charged to these accounts."&#x2014;[<i>Official Report,</i> 5th November 1975; Vol. 899, c. <i>198</i>.]</q>
I take the point about the Local Government Act. But surely this is a different point. Is the right hon. Gentleman saying that they can be reimbursed centrally before and after enactment? This seems an important point.</p>

<p>The amendments require the Secretary of State, before directing authorities to devise a land acquisition and management scheme, to consult those authorities. It was always envisaged&#x2014;indeed, it is essential&#x2014;that that would

be done. But the Opposition in another place suggested that it would be helpful to write the provision into the Bill. It is only writing into the Bill that which would naturally happen, and therefore we see no reason not to concur with the Lords.</p>

<p>I beg to move, as an amendment to the Lords amendment, in subsection (2), leave out "county area" and insert
<q>area of the county authority".</q>
I shall be asking the House to agree with the Lords amendment, but that amendment was slightly defective.<br/>
The Lords amendment requires that when a land acquisition and management scheme has been made or revised the county authority shall send copies of the scheme to parish councils in the area, or that in Scotland where a scheme is made or revised by a general planning authority that authority shall send copies of the scheme to district councils in the area.<br/>
The amendment follows a point raised by the Opposition in the other place and simply repeats for land acquisition and management schemes something that is already provided for in Schedule 8, where there is provision for a declaration of a disposal notification area. It will thus help to keep local authorities which are not authorities for the purposes of the land scheme informed of the arrangements for implementing the scheme in their areas, which is something that hon. Members on both sides of the House would wish to see. This gives effect to the Lords amendment.</p>

<p>I beg to move, as a manuscript amendment to the Lords amendment, leave out from 'area' to end.<br/>
It is our intention to leave out the whole of paragraph (<i>b</i>)&#x2014;namely, to delete:
<q>the desirability of bringing development land into public ownership</q>
as one of the criteria for local authorities in the exercise of their functions. This would leave only
<q>the desirability of securing the proper planning of their area</q>
in the exercise of their functions.<br/>
In another place their Lordships originally carried an amendment which reversed the order of the two requirements in the Bill and included the word "then" at the end of the planning consideration. In other words, the amendment from another place provided that every authority
<q>shall have regard to (<i>a</i>) the desirability of securing the proper planning of their area and then (<i>b</i>) the desirability of bringing development land into public ownership.</q>
Their Lordships later agreed to the dropping of the word "then". I have asked myself why they agreed to that, but it has become apparent that they took the view that it was not for them to try to undermine one of the principles of the Bill. I have no such inhibition. We are concerned with a thoroughly odious principle. The manuscript amendment seeks to establish clearly and unequivocally the overwhelming priority of planning and to do away with the ownership consideration.<br/>
Of course, we are also discussing Lords Amendment No. 83. I support their Lordships in saying that if we are to have the ownership criterion it should follow rather than precede the planning criterion. I should point out that Baroness Birk said:
<q>we are prepared to accept the Amendment as we feel it is some improvement on the one moved before."&#x2014;[<i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 5th November 1975; Vol, 365, c. 1236.]</q>
Baroness Birk was talking about the dropping of the word "then". She referred to the Government's position on this issue. I hope that the Minister will tell us why the Government are trying to reverse Amendment No. 83. I can see no reason for doing so. I understand that it can be argued with a good deal of logic that Clause 17(1) does not have much significance in any event. I am sure that some of my learned colleagues will be able to correct me if I am wrong, but I suspect that the phrase
<q>shall have regard to the desirability</q>
would cut very little ice in any court of law. I cannot believe that that phrase imposes a strong onus on anyone to do anything when it comes to a legal test.<br/>
4.0 a.m.<br/>
The real punch behind the Bill lies in the reserve powers that the Secretary of State proposes to give himself in Clause 47. In that case the decision lies not


with the courts, but with the Secretary of State. That is clearly in keeping with the ultimate dictatorial tone of the entire Bill.<br/>
However, let us assume that the provision has some kind of symbolic significance. It is an invitation to local authorities to use their powers to acquire for acquisition's sake rather than for planning purposes. But this purely ideological consideration should not be allowed to prevail. Surely it should be made clear that planning considerations are paramount.<br/>
The Government in their White Paper&#x2014;a document that was introduced in the hectic run-up to the October election&#x2014;laid emphasis on two matters&#x2014;first planning and, secondly recoupment of development gain. At that time they were not laying emphasis on ownership for ownership's sake. The truth is that the Government's Bill is concerned primarily with ownership for ownership's sake. The cat was let out of the bag in the Lords debate on 28th October when Lord Melchett, replying for the Government, said that the Bill dealt with community land ownership and not with planning in itself. In other words, what the Government are interested in is community ownership rather than in good planning. That is the truth and the public should realise it.<br/>
Let us be charitable and assume that planning plays some part in the exercise. Despite that assumption, the Bill is wholly unnecessary to achieve good, positive planning. The power needed to achieve this so-called positive planning already exists. I quote from Section 112 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1971. I am sure that this quotation will meet the approval of my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page), who was the architect of that legislation. Indeed, I believe that it was a consolidation measure and, therefore, some Labour Members no doubt had a hand in it too.<br/>
Section 112 of the 1971 Act is headed "Acquisition and appropriation of land" and reads:
<q>The Secretary of State may authorise a local authority to whom this section applies to acquire compulsorily any land within their area if he is satisfied&#x2014;(<i>a</i>) that the land is required in order to secure the treatment as a

whole, by development, redevelopment or improvement, or partly by one and partly by another method, of the land or of any area in which the land is situated; or (<i>b</i>) that it is expedient in the public interest that the land should be held together with land so required; or (<i>c</i>) that the land is required for development or redevelopment, or both, as a whole for the purpose of providing for the relocation of population or industry or the replacement of open space in the course of the redevelopment or improvement, or both, of another area as a whole; or (<i>d</i>) that it is expedient to acquire the land immediately for a purpose which it is necessary to achieve in the interests of the proper planning of an area in which the land is situated.</q>
To quote extracts from that Act is not perhaps the most agreeable way in which to entertain the House, but I am making an important point. For the benefit of those Labour Members who, understandably, find a certain drowsiness coming over them, I wish to illustrate the point by quoting a line or two of a document issued by the Central Office of Information entitled "Town and Country Planning in Britain". It was published this year and sums up what I have just quoted from the 1971 Act. It states:
<q>Since the Town and Country Planning Acts of 1947, local planning authorities have had general planning powers (subject to ministerial approval) to buy land compulsorily in order to secure the comprehensive development or redevelopment of land in their areas (other powers are used to provide specific public services such as housing, roads and public open spaces). The Town and Country Planning Act 1968 (now consolidated in the 1971 Act) extended the planning purposes for which land in England and Wales can be compulsorily purchased&#x2026;Compulsory purchase powers have been used extensively to promote the comprehensive reconstruction of commercial and civic centres in urban areas (in many cases those damaged during the second world war) and to re-plan other areas of large cities and towns to support a growing population, to provide better living conditions, and to cope with the increasing volume of motor traffic.</q>
It is quite evident that this Bill is wholly unnecessary for good planning. All the powers for such planning already exist. Not only that, but they have been exercised time and again by local authorities. The planning aspects of the Bill are entirely fraudulent because they are unnecessary. Why do we need the Bill? We have never been told, except perhaps by Lord Melchett.<br/>
In legislative terms this is a measure which could be very easily repealed. One of the characteristics of it is that there are only two relatively minor appeals


to do with blight in the repeals provisions. The business of repeal is something which we take seriously. We would be open to discussion about what, if anything, is needed in planning terms. We have the Bill and must try to let it do as little damage as possible if it reaches the statute book. One way to do this is to do what we are proposing in the manuscript amendment and what the Lords propose in their Amendment No. 83&#x2014;namely, to assert quite clearly the supremacy of planning considerations over "land grab" considerations. It is important that we have an effective planning system and that that system should not be vitiated by the philosophy behind the Bill.<br/>
The Bill will do a great deal of damage to confidence. To a large extent planning depends on mutual confidence between local authorities and the public. The local authorities are deeply worried, if they have any sensitivity, about the damage to this relationship which the Bill is liable to cause. Both the manuscript amendment and Lords Amendment No. 83 are of great importance. They give us a chance to prevent the Bill wrecking the relationship which has existed for a long time and which is so important to the well-being of the country. I hope that my right hon. and hon. Friends will support me in the Lobby on this issue.</p>

<p>You have a charming and convenient way of dealing with the procedure, Mr. Deputy Speaker.<br/>
I shall deal first with the manuscript amendment. The Government have never concealed the fact that the Bill is about the public acquisition of land, based on a planning framework. The object behind the Bill which left this House for the other place was the public acquisition of land. That object applies to both the short-term and the long-term provisions.<br/>
The philosophy of Labour Members is that it is in the best interests of the community as a whole that land should be developed by the community as a whole rather than by the individual, except in special cases, and that development should take place within a planning framework, not in grabs. We are talking not about confiscation, as was suggested by the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Budgen), but about acquisition by the local authority with a proper price for the land being paid to the person who sells it. In that way the local authority and the community are able to benefit from the development.<br/>
The amendment to the Lords amendment is a wrecking amendment in that it makes changes in the Bill which left this House for the other place. The Bill is about public ownership, and it is right that it should impose the duty which it contained when it left this House.<br/>
I come to the curious Lords amendment, which may at first sight seem to be semantic, which changes the order of precedence between planning and public acquisition. The Bill is primarily concerned with public acquisition, and it is right that acquisition should come first in the order of precedence. We have made clear in Committee, on Report, in another place and again in this House that the basis of the acquisition is the planning of the area. Planning considerations must be taken into account before there can be public acquisition.<br/>
This seemingly semantic Lords amendment turns the formulation of the duty completely on its head. We have emphasised that public acquisition is the handmaiden of planning, but that does not mean that the Bill is wholly a planning Bill. It is specifically a Bill about public acquisition and it is, therefore, right that the public ownership of development land should be mentioned first in the statement of the general duty in subsection (1).<br/>
The hon. Member for Aylesbury implied that Conservative Members were concerned that planning considerations should be placed second, but those fears were not shared by the main organisations concerned with planning when the original amendments to the general duty were under discussion. The Royal Town Planning Institute was content with the form of the subsection as it left this House. The Town and Country Planning Association also said that the amendments made to Clause 17 met the concern it had earlier expressed about the link between the Bill and planning.<br/>
4.15 a.m.<br/>
There is a subtler objection to the amendment, and it might find more favour with the Opposition than the objection I have just posed. If the general duty is
<q>to secure proper planning and to bring development land into public ownership in accordance with such planning",</q>
the duty of securing proper planning seems to be related essentially to the acquisition of development land. But this is not right, because authorities have other functions under the Bill in addition to the acquisition of development land&#x2014;and, indeed, in relation to development land there are already valuable planning safeguards written into the Bill in subsection (2) of the clause.<br/>
One example of a function that might be left unqualified by planning considerations if the amendment were adopted is the acquisition of land that is not development land as it is now defined in the Bill. The House will recall that development land is now defined as land needed for relevant development within 10 years. But the acquisition power goes wider than this and may cover, for example, land needed for excepted development in certain circum

stances.It is clearly important that authorities' purchases of such land should also take place within the framework of established planning policies, and this could be lost in the reordering of the duty proposed by the Lords.<br/>
Another example is the management and disposal of land. Clearly it is important that here, too, authorities should have regard to planning considerations in exercising functions that do not consist of the acquisition of development land. The clause deals with disposal, but only in a broad sense&#x2014;that is that authorities should acquire development land with a view to disposing of it for development by others or developing it themselves. The words would not cover the method of disposal, which might specifically be designed to help towards the achievement of planning objectives.<br/>
The Lords amendment is therefore objectionable both on the general grounds that it makes nonsense of a duty which is to be included in a Bill dealing with public ownership and because, like some of the other Lords amendments to be discussed on Schedule 6 and on Clause 23, it would be likely in practice to be actively harmful from the point of view of achieving a proper relationship between the operation of the scheme and the planning system.<br/>
I therefore ask the House to reject the amendments proposed in the other place and doubly to reject&#x2014;if that is possible&#x2014;the manuscript amendment proposed at this late stage by the hon. Member for Aylesbury.</p>

<p>I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Raison) for moving the manuscript amendment to which, for all I know, my name ought to be added&#x2014;we can discuss that later. It was a matter of total indifference to me whether we accepted the Lords amendment to put (<i>a</i>) before (<i>b</i>), or left the Bill as it was and put (<i>b</i>) before (<i>a</i>).<br/>
We are now discussing the most ideological part of this horrible Bill. We are discussing the proposition that every local authority should have regard to the desirability of bringing development land into public ownership and develop the land itself, or should make it available for development by others. I do not regard it as desirable that local authorities should


bring development land into public ownership. Least of all do I regard it as desirable to bring development land into public ownership if the objective is to bring about the proper planning of the area. I have heard nothing from the hon. Gentleman or from the right hon. Gentleman earlier, to imbue me with any confidence that local authorities will bring about the proper planning of their areas by taking development land into public ownership.<br/>
The existing planning system does not seem to work very well. Is it cheap? Does it save staff? Does it work fast? Is the planning system responsive to public opinion? Is the system of planning appeals in the Minister's own Department satisfactory? There are many parts of the planning system that are so manifestly unsuitable that there is absolutely no reason to believe that local authorities are likely to improve discharging their duties under the Act by bringing development land into public ownership. All we have seen from the use of the existing powers of local authorities in many ways has been muddle, delay, cost and waste.<br/>
If hon. Members support the manuscript amendment, they will be saying very firmly that they disagree with the central principle of the Bill. We do not believe that it is desirable to bring development land into public ownership. In the present situation we consider that the local authority planning system is already breaking down and will be made even more chaotic by the Bill. The sufferers will be those who need houses. Their situation will be worsened by Clause 17 if it remains in anything like its present form.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend the Member for Melton (Mr. Latham) argued strongly in favour of the amendment, but the Under-Secretary argued even more strongly for it. He said that the whole purpose was to take development land into public ownership. Why mention that at this point in the Bill? Clause 17 says that the acquiring authority must consider the desirability of the whole purpose of the Bill in taking development land into public ownership. But if it has already been decided by the Government that local authorities must take the land into public ownership, what is the point of repeating that injunction in this clause? We are really concerned at this point

that when local authorities are carrying out the order of the Government that they shall take land, they should do so in a way which fits in with proper planning.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Raison) attributed to me the appropriate section of the Town and Country Planning Act 1971, but it was the Town and Country Planning Act 1968&#x2014;passed under the last Labour Government&#x2014;which gave local authorities power to acquire land when
<q>it is expedient to acquire the land immediately for a purpose which it is necessary to achieve in the interests of the proper planning of an area in which the land is situated.</q>
Surely all that was necessary in this clause was to repeat that provision, if it was thought necessary, although I think it unnecessary. Surely the local authorities are still bound to look at their acquisition of development land from the planning point of view.<br/>
In Committee we were assured that the Government appreciated that acquisition should be for the proper planning of the area. The Minister said that it would all be done within the planning framework. That is what the manuscript amendment is intended to stress&#x2014;that is to say, that a local auhority must have proper regard to the proper planning of its area. The clause does not need to be messed up with what the hon. Gentleman says is the whole purpose of the Bill. It is clearly desirable that, if a local authority is to take development land into public ownership, it must have regard to the proper planning of its area in doing so.</p>

<p>There are two ways of considering the drafting of the clause. The first is that there is a fundamental flaw in it which will prevent the Government from achieving their object. If one legislates that a council shall have regard to the availability of something, it is open to the council to conclude that whatever one has in mind is not available and to act accordingly.<br/>
The clause as drafted requires councils to have regard to the desirability of bringing development land into public ownership. On that view of the matter, since 95 per cent. of the councils would consider it undesirable that such land should be brought into public ownership, they may proceed accordingly. Are the Government satisfied that this drafting will achieve their purpose?


The other view is that it is a statement in an operative clause of the Bill&#x2014;a statement of purpose which, for the reasons just given by my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page), is wholly unnecessary. The powers are provided. The purpose of the Bill is set forth in the preamble. This is a wholly otiose statement of a principle which will be obnoxious to 95 per cent. of councils and it ought to be deleted.</p>

<p>I am puzzled why the Minister finds this amendment, either in its original form or in its improved manuscript version, difficult to accept.<br/>
My right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) has quite rightly pointed out that when we look at these amendments, in both original and manuscript form, we ought to look first at the sentence that comes before the position in the clause where the amendment would be made. The heading is "Duties of authorities" and the clause reads:
<q>In exercising their functions on or after the first appointed day every authority shall have regard to&#x2026;.".</q>
As my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Royal Tunbridge Wells (Mr. Mayhew) pointed out, we may or may not approve of the functions that the local authorities have been given under the Bill. They are set out very clearly. We do not have to repeat them at this point. Surely the Minister, with his acknowledged affection for town planning&#x2014;I do not know whether it extends to local authorities, but perhaps they are included&#x2014;could find our proposal acceptable.<br/>
Having put in the preamble something about the exercise of functions, we should ensure that regard is paid to "proper planning". I admit that that phrase is perhaps not very well defined, but it has respectable parenthood in Section 112 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1971. Subsection (1)(<i>d</i>) states:
<q>that it is expedient to acquire the land immediately for a purpose which it is necessary to achieve in the interests of the proper planning of an area".</q>
It is rather more fully described in that section. I suspect that this phraseology may go right back to the 1947 Act, where similar powers were first to be found. The Minister would normally wish to acknowledge with pride anything that was in that Act. Therefore the words "proper

planning", although perhaps not particularly well defined, can be found in the legislation dating back quite a long time. The definition seems to be recognised, perhaps, by the reaction of the professional bodies to which the Minister has referred as being one which they find acceptable and reassuring.<br/>
The history of this part of the Bill is strange to say the least, because although we are now quite rightly and property talking about how we ensure that planning is given its right place in the scheme of things, or a slightly better place, when we first gazed with astonishment at what was presented to us in the Bill we found that reference to planning was almost entirely absent.</p>

<p>I am grateful to my right hon. Friend. That came a little later in the clause. But it has been added here to meet the numerous objections that were raised. As my right hon. Friend said, local authorities were invited specifically to disregard proper planning.<br/>
The modestly favourable reactions from the professional bodies to the amendments now made are perhaps attributable to their sense of relief that the Bill is not quite as horrid as before and is now merely nasty. In my view, we should not attach too much importance to this apparent approval. It may also be accompanied by the feeling of some professional associations that no Ministry will try to implement all the parts of the Act. There is a widely held professional belief that it is unworkable and, therefore, that no one will try to carry out the full panoply of it.<br/>
We cannot take that attitude. If we are asked to enact a measure, we must have regard to what may eventually result from it. The power may become the duty, with the local authorities having to acquire all land on which virtually any development is to be carried out.<br/>
The Minister said that the Bill was about public ownership. We ask, public ownership of what? If, after the second appointed day, the duty is to be laid


on local authorities to acquire all development land, they will have to decide what is to be development land. Therefore, they are brought up against the dual responsibility which remains one of the fundamental criticisms of the Bill and which, I suppose, we can remedy only if we accept the manuscript amendment. It is the dual responsibility of being both the developer and the planning authority.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Raison) referred to the damage to confidence. My hon. Friend for Melton (Mr. Latham) spoke in very uncomplimentary terms of the public view of the town planning mechanism and said that it was not regarded with universal approval as being a cheap and efficient system or one which produced the right result. I hope that we shall find ways of improving it.<br/>
The damage to confidence which would result from the dual responsibilities of local authorities as both developers and the bodies controlling development could be very great unless we make it clear that, in carrying out the functions which unfortunately they will be saddled with under the Bill, the local authorities must first have regard to proper planning. For that reason I welcome the manuscript amendment, which is a further improvement to the Lords amendment, in that it makes proper planning the first and most important consideration.<br/>
If we accept the amendment, we shall go some way to reassuring those who are seriously concerned about the ability of an authority to carry out this dual responsibility of development control and development without damaging the planning mechanism of which we are justifiably proud, even though it needs improvements, and which has worked better than anything in most of the developed countries since 1947. I do not believe that we should do such damage lightly. We must carefully consider an amendment of this type which is likely to help to mitigate that damage. Therefore, in my view we should welcome the amendment.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend the Member for Hove (Mr. Sainsbury) made a powerful speech in support of the amendment. Of course it is undesirable that land should be taken into public ownership, and that is the first principle behind the amendment. To do such a

thing would be a monstrous mistake. Indeed, the statistics support the argument that the reason why we have a housing shortage is precisely the extent to which we have always involved local authorities in development. The Bill will make the situation 65 times worse. That is undesirable and the Minister cannot be surprised to learn that we object to it.<br/>
Moreover, there is a question of priority. That theme runs through all the speeches that I have heard. The amendment seeks to lay the emphasis on planning. The Minister said "There is no need for this. The Bill is about the acquisition of land. Planning will take care of itself. There will be planning in any event." That is exactly what we doubt.<br/>
I should like to quote an example. In my constituency there is a village with a population of just over 2,000. In that village an enormous development on about 50 acres is to take place because of some calculations made by the Land Commission years ago. The Land Commission was the last fatuity introduced by the Socialist Government which is comparable with the present business. The calculations were made so long ago that the authorities do not even remember why they thought they wanted the land. However, since then several developments have gone broke, partially due to the machinations of the Government. The plans were changed, and instead of the density being so many houses to the acre, the figure has now practically doubled to save the situation for those who have invested. In effect there was no plan; acquisition came first.<br/>
The unfortunate people who live in this small place now see the prospect of their village being more than doubled in size for reasons which no one can explain. They come to me and say "Please, can we have a town plan or something similar?" This is not really the fault of the county authority or of any other authority. The proposals were put forward by a Government who thought that it would be a good idea at some stage in the game, because of some macro-plan concerning the South-East. That is precisely the type of situation which my hon. Friends envisage if the Bill is passed without this amendment. I do not believe that that is an exaggerated fear. I hope that when


the Minister replies to this debate, which concerns a matter of principle, he will not try to sweep that fear away by accusing my hon. Friend the Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Raison) of making Second Reading speeches.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Aylesbury made a good speech and pointed out that the heart of our objection to this miserable measure is contained in and could be put right by the amendment. The arguments are in no way complex. It is a matter of basic principle. We say that the plan must come first and that if there is to be acquisition it should be in terms of the plan. To amend the Bill in the way suggested in another place would achieve that situation. I hope that the Minister will address his mind to this matter and give us a more adequate answer than the one he put forward in his original rejection of the amendment.</p>

<p>I cannot understand the Minister's rejection of the amendment from the other place. I felt that he was saying that the Government accepted that proper planning was a premise which came first and that the subsequent desirability of bringing land into public ownership was the meaning of the Bill. The hon. Gentleman spoke of proper planning first and then said that the objective of the Bill was to bring land into public ownership&#x2014;in other words, that the Bill was to work under the umbrella of the overall premise of proper planning.<br/>
That is what has emerged from the other place. I did not take part in the Committee stage, but I have read the debates and heard this short discussion on the amendment. In effect, the other place has said that there is a better way of doing what is proposed in the Bill. We have argued strongly why proper planning should come first and the bringing of land into public ownership should come second. We are saying not that one is more or less important than the other but that one should come first. That is precisely what has been suggested in the other place. We have another place for mature consideration of some of these factors. I suggest that this amendment provides a better piece of drafting than is in the Bill.<br/>
I thought that the Minister in his opening speech&#x2014;I listened carefully; I hope that I am not sleepy&#x2014;said that the Government regarded proper planning as a first requirement and that the Bill was designed to bring about the development and public ownership of land. That is the purpose of the amendment. We expect the Government to accept wisdom from the other place&#x2014;sometimes we get wisdom from there&#x2014;and not to reject it out of hand.</p>

<p>I agree with the hon. Member for Canterbury (Mr. Crouch) that sometimes we get wisdom from the other place. Indeed, we have already accepted some Lords amendments.<br/>
I turn now to the manuscript amendment and the amendment from the other place. I apologise to you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, if there was any implication in what I said that you were in any way remiss when I referred to a Second Reading speech. I think you have known me long enough to know that I would not make that kind of accusation. However, it is implicit in a manuscript amendment when it goes to the root of the Bill. Therefore, any hon. Member who moves a manuscript amendment will find himself in Second Reading territory almost immediately. I suggest that we passed that stage long ago and are now dealing with amendments from the other place.<br/>
The effect of the manuscript amendment would be to cut out everything except planning responsibility in Clause 17.<br/>
I repeat that the Bill is concerned with the public ownership of relevant land and that that public ownership shall take place within a planning framework. We have tried to make that clear throughout all stages of the Bill.</p>

<p>I do not propose to give way to the hon. and learned Gentleman, who has just walked into the Chamber. This has been a long debate.<br/>
It is a matter for the House how long we go on with this debate. Opposition Members know that they will not convince the Government about this matter, because it affects the principle of the Bill. Equally, I know that we shall not convince them.<br/>
There are a number of important amendments from the other place which merit considerable discussion. We can discuss them when we are even more tired this afternoon or we can do it before we reach that state. I suggest that it is better to concentrate on arguments which might produce some benefit than to have a futile, continuous discussion of principles in which neither side will convince the other.<br/>
4.45 a.m.<br/>
I would be the first to admit that out planning system has faults. However, for the hon. Member for Melton (Mr. Latham)&#x2014;whose knowledge of planning matters, as I have said before, is probably second only to that of the right hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Page)&#x2014;to criticise the system really surprised me. Although our system has its imperfections,</p>

<p>The amendments require authorities to have regard to the considerations listed in paragraph 1(1) of Schedule 6 not only in disposing of land, as at present, but also in considering what use should be made of land before disposal. They are to meet the point raised by the Opposition in the Lords that more should be said in the Bill about the management of land, and particularly agricultural land.<br/>
The amendments work by amending paragraph 1(1) of Schedule 6, so that authorities must have regard to the factors set out there not only in disposing of land, but also when managing land prior to disposing of land, and when managing land prior to disposal. The particularly important factor in this context is in


sub-paragraph (<i>c</i>), which requires authorities to have regard to the needs of agriculture and forestry. This, taken together with the new amendments, will mean that authorities, in exercising their functions under the land scheme, must have regard to the management of agricultural land in their ownership. It was always intended to achieve this result through issuing guidance to authorities, but the Government accept that it would be helpful to draw particular attention to this in the Bill itself.</p>

<p>I beg to move, That this House doth disagree with the Lords in the said amendment.<br/>
The amendment deals with the preparation by authorities of five-year rolling programmes. It would put the matter on a statutory basis. There is no argument between us about whether there should or should not be rolling programmes or about what they should contain. The point at issue is somewhat narrow&#x2014;namely, whether there should be a requirement laid down in the Bill.<br/>
Rolling programmes are not a new invention contained in the Bill. Over the years they have been adopted as the best means of planning and controlling public expenditure in many sectors&#x2014;for example, nationalised industry investment, road-building and school-building. They have been adopted by Governments both Labour and Conservative. The most recent example is local authority transport expenditure. However, there is never any reference to such a programme in legislation.<br/>
Section 6 of the Local Government Act 1974, of which the right hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) will be aware, is solely concerned with transport supplementary grant. Rightly, there is no mention in that Act of transport policies and programmes. It is the rolling pro

gramme which forms the basis of the grant payment. To write the rolling programme into the Bill is unnecessary. It could be potentially dangerous to institute the precedent of putting the provision in a statute. I ask the House, in accordance with the precedent set by both sides of the House in different forms of legislation, to state that we disagree with the Lords in this amendment.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1975-11-11a.1406.0" hansard_membership_id="4206" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/20268" speakername="Mr. Rossi" colnum="1406" time="">
<p>I cannot possibly agree that this is a narrow point. This is a broad point of principle. It is not right for the Minister to look at other circumstances where there are five-year rolling programmes and to say that they are precedents that the Bill should follow. The programmes that he has instanced are mainly programmes for investment. Here we are dealing with something quite different&#x2014;namely, the public acquisition of people's private property. We are dealing with the operation of a local authority in an activity that concerns the citizens and residents living within its area. They will be involved in the intentions of the authority regarding the development of their land.<br/>
If it is intended to have five-year rolling programmes for local authorities&#x2014;and we are told that they will be required by the Secretary of State to prepare such programmes&#x2014;the programmes will have to be made. They will have to state the land that it is intended to acquire within five years so that the necessary borrowing requirement provisions may be made. If that is the case, we feel that as well as the Secretary of State, the people living in the locality of the local authority are entitled to know what land within the five years the local authority intends to acquire.<br/>
Lip service is paid to the concept of public participation. We are being told the whole time that there must be public participation in planning. Here we are dealing with an extension of the planning and use of land, we are dealing with the development of the land itself. It is a matter of great importance to residents in any locality to know what land within a period of five years their elected councillors are proposing to acquire in their names.<br/>
This matter is important not only to residents as a whole but also to those likely to be affected by acquisition proposals&#x2014;in other words, those whose land


is likely to be taken. If a person's land, his house, or his garden are within a programme in the short time scale of five years, he is entitled to know whether blight will affect his property in any way. This can best be revealed to him by the plan being published in the town hall where he can go to look at it. Therefore, because it is both necessary and desirable that these plans should be published, I ask my right hon. and hon. Friends to support the Lords amendment.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1975-11-11a.1407.0" hansard_membership_id="2727" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/13673" speakername="Mr. Costain" colnum="1407" time="">
<p>The Minister by his remarks on this Bill has shown how determined he is to nationalise land while at the same time paying no regard whatever to development prospects.<br/>
I have spent a great part of my life in work connected with the development of large areas, and I know that no sensible developer&#x2014;or indeed anybody interested in providing accommodation&#x2014;would wish to act in any way different from the course of action laid down in the provisions of this amendment. We must remember that an ordinary developer has limited finance at his disposal. He has a rolling programme of five years. Some local authorities believe that these programmes can be undertaken within a period of three years, but that is not the case.<br/>
We believe that the amendment would lay down safeguards in ensuring that development was properly carried out. It will give the Secretary of State the opportunity to know what policies are being pursued by local authorities and at the same time it will give the public a chance to evaluate what is taking place. But the Minister does not care about these considerations. He just wants to nationalise the land and to take any profit he can from it. We are certainly not happy with the situation, and if we are to put up with this Bill the Minister will have to produce a better case than we have heard so far. Unless we produce a rolling programme on the lines laid down in the amendment, the process just will not work.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1975-11-11a.1407.1" hansard_membership_id="7490" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/32714" speakername="Mr. Graham Page" colnum="1407" time="">
<p>It is preposterous that the Minister should seek to resist this amendment. All it does is to let the public know whose land is involved in a five-year rolling programme. It is surely only a matter of common decency that

those affected should be aware of these matters.<br/>
I cannot understand the Minister's reasons for rejecting this amendment. Is he trying to avoid any blight on property affected in a programme? If he is, he should not be taking that course. Provision should be made for blighted property to be acquired in such a programme, and those affected should be told right away.<br/>
The Minister said that the amendment was unprecedented in a Bill. I would reply by saying that the whole Bill is unprecedented. We have to take this exceptional course in order to protect the public and the interests of individuals.<br/>
I am not concerned with precedent in this Bill. Precedents apply to normal, ordinary legislation&#x2014;but this Bill is not normal, ordinary legislation. It is extraordinary. It is a wholly new system for seizure of land. We want to protect the public by letting them know what the programmes are. It is good local government to prepare a programme of that sort and to publish it so that those concerned may know what progress is being made. I cannot see any reason why a reasonable provision of this sort should be resisted.<br/>
Ministers have apparently come to the Box since four o'clock yesterday afternoon determined to resist every reasonable amendment inserted in another place. This debate is yet another example of this. It is a reasonable amendment which would improve the Bill. It would certainly improve the position of those who may be affected by it.</p>

<p>I want to take up a point raised by my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page). No one could possibly argue that this was not a Bill designed to take away the rights of the individual citizen. [<i>Interruption.</i>] Of course it is. It is a confiscatory Bill. Let us get that clear.<br/>
Many of us over the years have been concerned with the question of blight. If the amendment is accepted it may help individuals whose properties are affected, giving them an opportunity of knowing the future of their property. Is it unreasonable that those who won land and property should be given fair notice


that their properties are affected? Should there not be some provision for blight? My right hon. Friend has rightly said that there is no provision for this. I would like to hear what the Minister has to say about the individual who has property which is affected in a small but important way and where blight is the factor affecting them.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1975-11-11a.1409.0" hansard_membership_id="312" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/3496" speakername="Mr. Nicholas Winterton" colnum="1409" time="">
<p>I find it extraordinary that the Government should be resisting this eminently suitable amendment. As a Government they believe in a planned society and a planned economy. This amendment is all about planning&#x2014;five years ahead. Not only does it give the public an idea of what is to happen but it also gives those whose property or land is affected an idea of what is to happen. It is important that individuals owning property, large or small, should know where they stand.<br/>
The Minister did not advance an argument that could be supported by hon. Members. I regret to say that I do not believe that any thinking Labour Member would resist this if they were not whipped. It is a pity that in such an important debate on a Bill of constitutional importance so many unthinking people will go through the Lobby voting down a well-thought-out amendment.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1975-11-11a.1409.1" hansard_membership_id="8461" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/18103" speakername="Mr. Mayhew" colnum="1409" time="">
<p>In justifying the stand he is taking on this amendment the Minister said that it would not be necessary to incorporate it into the Bill. It is useful to compare his attitude on this amendment with the attitude of the Government on Lords Amendment No. 83, which dealt with whether there should be included in the Bill under Clause 17 (1) these words about the desirability of bringing development into public ownership. I would have thought that everyone accepted that for practical purposes it was totally unnecessary to incorporate those last words into the measure. But the Minister said that they should go in. Everyone agreed that every councillor concerned with putting the provisions of this measure into operation knew that the Government regarded it as desirable that they should use powers conferred on them.<br/>
Here, when there is abundant practical reason for incorporating a reference into the Bill to the five-year-old rolling programme, so as to enable individuals to

know in advance what a council has in store for them, the Minister says that we cannot have the amendment because it is unnecessary. It looks as though he should have included further words in Clause 17(1) to the effect that the authority shall have regard to the desirability of bringing development land into public ownership but keep quiet about it until the last possible moment so that it will not make itself liable to pay compensation for blight.</p>

<p>One characteristic of planning authorities is that they frequently get the plans wrong. They have an amazing capacity for making plans for five years ahead on assessments which prove to be substantially in error. The citizen has a right to see those plans and to challenge them. I have a profound scepticism of the wisdom of any authority which is essentially anonymous and answerable to nobody. If an authority has no duty to publish its ambitions, the individual cannot challenge the powers which the authority takes until itself. That is why its stupidity&#x2014;or its wisdom&#x2014;should be preceded by light. It is wrong that powers against the citizen should be taken without warning. I am sure that all hon. Ministers agree that they are made wiser by criticism of their ideas.<br/>
The Bill is about what is stupidly called the public ownership of land, which means that land which belongs to members of the public shall cease to belong to them. All the land in this country belongs to the people.</p>

<p>I assure you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, that my hon. Friends and I would not detest you even if you were a laird. By that speech the hon. and learned Member for Kinross and West Perthshire (Mr. Fairbairn) has shown his detestation, distrust and contempt of local authorities in both Scotland and England. He implied that right from the start of his speech. I find it amazing that he should regard local authorities of all bodies as being responsible to nobody. They are responsible to their electorates. That is the purpose behind the Bill&#x2014;that development land should be put into the hands of the responsible authority, the authority responsible to the people of the area.<br/>
Some important observations were made by the right hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) and by the hon. Member for Windsor and Maidenhead (Dr. Glyn). They asked why the Bill did not specify individual sites over a five-year period, and the hon. Member for Hornsey (Mr. Rossi) seemed to pursue this line. There is nothing in this provision to hide. The first difficulty about a rolling programme that identified specific sites over a five-year period is that it could produce a kind of duplicated planning system that could easily come to supplant the

existing development plan system but not be subject to any of the procedures for public participation and inquiry built into the system by successive Governments over the years.<br/>
The hon. Member for Windsor and Maidenhead accurately came on to the second point. If sites were to be specifically listed in that way, unnecessary blight could be created. The idea of a rolling programme is that land policy statements are issued by local authorities to give general guidance not least to builders&#x2014;I tell that to the hon. Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Mr. Costain)&#x2014;about the authority's general ideas on acquisition over the five-year period. It would be clearly wrong to lay down that sites and areas should be specified for the rolling programme for the five years. That could jeopardise the existing planning system without any possibility of public participation and, secondly, it could cause unnecessary blight.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1975-11-11a.1412.0" hansard_membership_id="4206" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/20268" speakername="Mr. Rossi" colnum="1412" time="">
<p>I do not follow that reasoning. We are giving local authorities the duty to consider the desirability of acquiring land 10 years ahead. That specific obligation has been placed on local authorities. In discharge of that obligation they must consider individual sites, or otherwise the obligation is meaningless. We are saying that if within those 10 years the authorities are considering individual sites, they must declare them within the shorter period of five years. The authority must know precisely what is intended if it is to be able to calculate its borrowing requirement within a five-year rolling programme.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman says that we may be supplanting the existing planning system. That is not so, because, as we have been told throughout, the consideration of acquisition must be against the planning background and in accordance with plans already agreed and laid down. Rather this could fill in the detail of plans already evolved under the planning system against which the classification system would operate. Certainly, on the question of blight, if there is to be this duty only within the local authority as to the sites it is going to acquire within the five-year period, the owners should be told at the earliest possible opportunity.</p>

The sort of thing we have in mind for a rolling programme is where it will be necessary, for example, for a local authority to know how much land it may require for industrial or commercial or housing development by private builders or for its own statutory housing requirements.<br/>
We do not expect specific sites to be laid down. The acquisition programme must, under the terms of the Bill, follow the planning background. If there were a statute-based list of sites, there would be a danger of that list beginning to take precedence over the ordinary planning of the area. It is the very thing that the Opposition feared would happen, and it is the thing we are trying to prevent by avoiding a specific five-year programme of individual sites.</p>

<p>The Government are turning the local authorities in this context into a situation parallel with that of new town corporations. Any sensibly run new town has a five-year programme. It could not sell anything without it. Surely these authorities should have the same procedure as the new towns in such circumstances.</p>

<p>happen with a local authority and a new town. There is a strong parallel between the rolling programme in the Bill and the existing procedure of the new towns. Nevertheless, there are differences. A new town is a designated area for a specific purpose and very often, although not always, it is on virgin territory. The planning provisions within a new town are quite different from those in a local authority.</p>

<p>The Lords amendment would create grave danger to planning because of the precedence the list might take. There is also the problem of blight. We shall remind local authorities that, whichever way they draw their plans, they must try to do so in such a way as to avoid blight in any particular area. It is implicit that they will do it in any event. They must look, too, at hardship caused by non-statutory blight which may be created. Both statutory and non-statutory blight would be enhanced by producing lists with a rolling programme of specific sites in the way the Opposition imagine it should be done.</p>

<p>These amendments relate to binding contracts which were discussed in Committee, on Report, and in another place.<br/>
When the Bill was originally introduced in this House we had provided only for owners in possession, not for those with binding contracts. An amendment correcting this point was made in Committee. However, in so doing, we retained the qualification in both cases of
<q>being entitled to possession of the land".</q>
The Opposition argued strongly that a person owning a material interest in the land should not also have to have possession before he could serve a notice of election. It was argued that a landlord whose tenant's lease had nearly expired and who had obtained planning permission with a view to carrying out development on expiry of the lease might well wish to take advantage of the clause to ascertain the intentions of the authorities concerned towards his land. As he may not be "entitled to possession" of the land, the clause as drafted might have precluded him from doing this.<br/>
The Government accepted the force of the Opposition's argument and accordingly put forward a further amendment on Report removing the condition as to entitlement to possession in the case of a person with a material interest. That was accepted by the Opposition. The effect, however, was to leave it open to a freeholder whose tenant had a material interest&#x2014;for example, a year lease&#x2014;to seek to frustrate his tenant's development by serving a notice of election.<br/>
This amendment would prevent that happening, whilst at the same time permitting a freeholder, whose tenant's lease has not long to run and who himself proposes to develop the land when that lease has expired, to serve a notice of election and ascertain the authorities' intentions as to the land. [Hon. Members: "Hear, hear".]<br/>
I am delighted that this amendment has so much vocal support from my hon. Friends.</p>

<p>I do not think that the Under-Secretary believed a word of what he said. Indeed, I did not understand what he said. The hon. Gentleman got it right on Report, but had it altered in the House of Lords. The result is that a person with a material interest,

who has only a short time with someone else in possession, will be unable to exercise the election under the clause.<br/>
We urged the right amendment in Committee. I should have thought that the right amendment was achieved on Report. These second thoughts put us back almost to square one.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman has not satisfactorily explained the position to the House. I do not see why I should explain it for him. I object to the amendment.</p>

<p>This is the first time that I have intervened in the debate, and I intend to be brief. I intervene almost automatically in support of my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) who, in a previous incarnation, I invariably followed on planning Bills.<br/>
I think that the Under-Secretary, whose tribulations I understand, having at times lost my place when dealing with a lot of amendments from the Government Front Bench, would be wise to accept my right hon. Friend's implied offer to explain what the Minister has singularly failed to explain. Indeed, we are fortunate to have my right hon. Friend here, because he understands not only what the Government are trying to do but cannot explain but why it is thoroughly wrong that they should be trying to do it. I suggest to the Minister that he listens to my right hon. Friend explain what the Minister could not.<br/>
In the interests of comity, the Minister might have moved a vote of thanks to the learned Clerk at the Table, who helped him through some rough water. He was glad to get out of it into the smooth reaches of his brief, which he read to the best of his ability. Like my right hon. Friend, the learned Clerk has materially assisted the House over the last 10 minutes.</p>

<p>Of course I welcome that intervention so late in the debate by the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Griffiths), who was my predecessor at this Box. I only wish that his intervention had not been so silly.<br/>
The right hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) said earlier that we had rejected every amendment from another place. [<i>Interruption.</i>] That is what he said in a speech on the last amendment.


He may be suffering from shock because we have accepted the amendment, but I would remind him that we accepted a series before that.<br/>
For once&#x2014;it is very rare&#x2014;the right hon. Gentleman is wrong. The amendment puts the matter right and does not revert to the position before Report. A person having a material interest can serve a notice of election if the person in actual possession does not have a material interest. Now, hopefully, after many attempts, I think that we have got it right with regard to genuine contracts.</p>

<p>The Minister deserves some congratulations on at last getting it right, but if he wants to make progress with his Bill, it was hardly sensible to say that the intervention of my hon. Friend the Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Griffiths) was silly. [<i>Interruption.</i>] Hon. Members below the Gangway resort to that kind of tactic when they hear something they do not like. If they continue to conduct themselves in that way they will tempt us to tax our memories and recall their conduct in Opposition and do our best to emulate their example&#x2014;although I do not doubt that we shall not be able to get so low.<br/>

<p>The Opposition put down amendments in Committee which would have provided for the loss of compulsory purchase powers under all other legislation. These were unacceptable because there could be cases in which an unforeseen requirement for land, for example for a road, a school, or local authority housing, could arise within five years and where it would be reasonable for an authority to use compulsory powers for this purpose. It is, however, reasonable that under the Schedule 7 procedure an authority should effectively be required to make a clear decision on whether to buy the land for private development and it is therefore reasonable that they should lose their Planning Act powers as these are the other powers under which they might buy land for private development.</p>

<p>We thank the hon. Gentleman for going part of the way to meeting the case we put in Committee.

The Government have gone part of the way towards meeting us, but we regret that there are still some small holes through which local authorities will be able to go.</p>

<p>For the benefit of the right hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) it looks as if we are keeping up the pace.<br/>
Paragraph 7(1) provides that a notice that an authority does not intend to acquire land may be expressed subject to a condition. The kinds of conditions that may be imposed are set out in paragraph 8(1), the last condition (6) being
<q>any other condition to which the Secretary of State has given his consent.</q>
This has caused the difficulty. I agree it may have been drawn too widely. We have solved the problem by providing that the only other conditions allowable will be those specified by the Secretary of State in Regulations would be subject to the negative resolution procedure and any new conditions needed would therefore be subject to parliamentary scrutiny.</p>

<p>I am not clear how this meets the points we raised in Committee on this matter, when we understood that the Secretary of State would have power to give consent to particular conditions relating to particular matters affecting a particular property. Our objection in Committee was that anyone dealing with the land would not know whether the condition included by the local authority had received the consent of the Secretary of State, as is required by the clause. The private individual would have no means of knowing.<br/>
The Minister is suggesting that this could be overcome by the condition being specified in Regulations and the Regulations being published. They would then presumably be available for the individual concerned to see. He could check whether the consent had been given. I

cannot see how the Secretary of State could come to the House to apply for Regulations, since we would have to consider whether to annul them. The Regulations will deal with a condition to be included by a specific local authority in a specific notice for a specific piece of land. The condition may be peculiar to the piece of land in question. I am not sure, therefore, how procedure related to regulations would help us in these circumstances.</p>

<p>We are dealing here with a reasonable attempt to solve a very difficult problem. It is the uncertainty problem which the hon. Member for Hornsey (Mr. Rossi) has put to us, not the situation itself. We are dealing with
<q>Any other condition to which the Secretary of State has given his consent.</q>
I accept that it might be uncertain to the recipient of the conditional notice whether the condition was one to which the Secretary of State had given his consent or whether it could be challenged as not being one of the permitted conditions.<br/>
Putting this in Regulations will provide the opportunity of seeing exactly to which conditions the Secretary of State will have given his consent, and the fact that this is subject to parliamentary scrutiny will enable the House to take up points as and when they arise.</p>

<p>It will not be easy to scrutinise the Regulations and say whether they are within the powers of the Secretary of State. I assume that the words "Any other condition" would be interpreted as <i>ejusdem generis</i> with the first five conditions. When the Statutory Instruments Committee decides whether the Regulations made under this provision are within the <i>vires</i> of the Secretary of State, it will not be easy for it to specify the limits to what can be done in Regulations. If "Any other conditions" are <i>ejusdem generis</i> with the first five conditions the Committee will have to interpret them within that limitation, I presume.</p>

<p>The amendments provide that where the Secretary of State decides not to confirm a compulsory purchase order made after the relevant date for designated relevant development&#x2014;that is, when the full duty is in force&#x2014;the suspension of planning permission for relevant development shall be lifted from the land in question, if the Secretary of State so directs.<br/>
Once the full duty is in operation, authorities in an area will have to acquire between them all the land needed for designated relevant development<br/>
But there might be very limited circumstances in which, even when the full


duty was operating, an authority ought not to acquire land even when it considered it was needed for designated relevant development. For example, there might be cases where the Secretary of State decided that the development should go ahead without public ownership.<br/>
What is required here is a very limited power to cover special situations. The amendment therefore works by enabling the Secretary of State to remove the automatic suspension of planning permission where he refuses to confirm a compulsory purchase order. The procedure associated with an order will enable the Secretary of State to consider any special circumstances which might justify refusing allowing development to proceed without his confirming the order. Thus, where the full duty is operating, relevant development without public acquisition can occur only after full consideration of all the issues. Given the principles of the land scheme, this must be the right approach.</p>

<p>I beg to move, That this House doth disagree with the Lords in the said amendment.<br/>
Here we are back to disposal notification areas, which have occupied so much of the time of the House and Committee. The amendment is unnecessary. Worse still, it could be damaging to the real interests of those with properties in areas which may be declared development notification areas. It provides that an authority cannot declare a disposal notification area which would include any dwelling-house unless it first carries out

adequate public participation as defined in the 1971 Act. The amendment appears to be based on a misunderstanding of the purpose and effect of disposal notification areas in providing for some prior procedure before such an area can be declared. The amendment assumes that the declaration of a DNA will have far wider implications than in fact will be the case.<br/>
6.15 a.m.<br/>
The prime purpose of the DNA provision is to enable an authority to safeguard the position of an area in respect of which it is considering acquisition. Authorities will identify land for acquisition in their rolling programmes and it will then be for them to decide whether or not to use the DNA provisions. To use them will have certain advantages, as it will enable authorities to learn of land coming on to the market. It will also have considerable advantages for the owners of land in the area.<br/>
The procedures under Clause 23 enable owners to require an authority to purchase their land if there is blight and if, in response to notification, the authorities state that they intend to acquire. It follows from this approach that the declaration of a disposal notification area will not have any particular consequences for owners of land in the area. The fact that a DNA has been declared will not in any way prejudge the decision of any compulsory purchase order that might need to be made.

<p>Acquisition of the area as a whole. That can be of benefit to the people in the area, because they can then make application for the blight provisions to come into effect. I consider that the amendment weakens rather than strengthens the safeguards for owners of properties in potential disposal notification areas. The Government's approach is to insist that any DNA must conform


with the planning framework and rest on the procedures for public participation and inquiry as set out in the Planning Acts. There is power for the Secretary of State to veto any DNA which does not provide that basis of control.<br/>
We accept that there must be arrangements for publishing the existence of DNAs when they have been declared. That is adequately provided for in the arrangements for publicity and registration in the land charges register. That is clearly laid down in Schedule 8. I ask the House to reject the amendment as both unnecessary and damaging to the real interests of those with property in areas which may be declared development notification areas.</p>

<p>We have listened to the most extraordinary statement. We have been told that it is advantageous to have one's throat cut. The Minister is suggesting that disposal notification areas are for the benefit of those with property in the areas concerned. It can be said that covenants on property to keep it residential are beneficial, but what happens when a local authority creates a disposal notification area? A person might decide, while having a bath, that he had better sell his property over the next 12 months. He must notify the local authority and the authority can stop him from selling. That is the great benefit, we are told, of the disposal notification area.<br/>
We believe that there should be full publicity before a local authority passes a resolution declaring an area to be a disposal notification area. Clause 23(2) provides that
<q>An authority may pass a resolution declaring any land in their area to be a disposal notification area".</q>
In other words, anybody in that area who intends to sell his property may be stopped from selling it. Therefore, we wish to add a provision requiring publicity to be given to the proposal before the resolution is passed,
<q>provided that in the case of land on which there is at least one dwelling-house such resolution shall not be passed</q>
unless certain publicity has been given.<br/>
This proposal deals with a matter that has been of great concern to people when they appreciate that they may fall within a disposal notification area. Such

a designation may be imposed on any kind of property, not necessarily only on slum property. We must remember that in this respect we are talking not of action areas but of areas where a local authority may wish to take control of a property standing in two or three acres of ground. The Minister said that there was no question of anybody losing his rights, but surely he cannot maintain that the establishment of a disposal notification area does not take away the rights of a property owner.<br/>
Before a resolution is passed, the amendment would require publicity to be given to the preparation of local plans. The situation is set out in Section 12(1) of the Town and Country Planning Act 1971, as follows:
<q>A local planning authority who propose to prepare a local plan shall take such steps as will in their opinion secure&#x2014;
<ol>
<li>(<i>a</i>)that adequate publicity is given in their area to any relevant matter arising out of a survey of the area carried out by them under section 6 of this Act and to the matters proposed to be included in the plan;</li>
<li>(<i>b</i>)that persons who may be expected to desire an opportunity of making representations to the authority with respect to those matters are made aware that they are entitled to an opportunity of doing so; and</li>
<li>(<i>c</i>)that such persons are given an adequate opportunity of making such representations;</li>
</ol>
and the authority shall consider any representations made to them within the prescribed period.</q>
That is a duty that is already laid on local authorities by Parliament before those authorities prepare local plans. The local plan sets out planning ideas only in respect of that area. A local plan does not say, "You shall not sell your property without giving us a chance to take it from you"&#x2014;but that is what a disposal notification area does. Such an area will cause far greater damage to the rights of property ownership than will the preparation of local plans. It will undoubtedly cause damage to owners of dwelling-houses within a disposal notification area. The Lords amendment applies only to dwelling-houses. It deals only with the item that has proved of great concern to people who are beginning to understand the meaning of the Bill&#x2014;namely, with disposal notification areas. Clause 23(2) contains one of the most damaging provisions in the Bill.<br/>
I hope that the Minister will accept the Lords amendment because it will give


a little relief to those who own dwelling-houses within what the Minister likes to call a "DNA". Those initials hide the true meaning of that concept&#x2014;namely, an area in which an owner will not be allowed to sell his property without first notifying the local authority, and, indeed, may possibly be stopped from selling it.</p>

<p>A few minutes ago the Under-Secretary was kind enough to make some pleasant remark about me. I reciprocate by saying that I have always appreciated the answers that he has given to the Committee and the House. But he fell below his usual high standard in introducing this motion to disagree with the Lords. For anyone to try to pretend that a disposal notification area is of benefit to the citizen is ludicrous. The purpose of such an area is stated clearly in Clause 23 (1) which says that
<q>An authority may exercise the powers conferred by this section for the purpose of obtaining information about disposals of development land.</q>
The local authority does not want to obtain the information for the good of its soul, or to fill itself up with paper&#x2014;although that will certainly happen. It wants information so that it may subsequently undertake substantial acquisition in the area. The reason for requiring the information before undertaking that acquisition is that if anyone is rash enough to want to carry out development, the local authority can get in first and suspend the planning permission and make a compulsory purchase order. That does not seem to be of great benefit to the citizen.<br/>
When the Lords tabled this amendment, and subsequently Lords Amendment No. 140&#x2014;which I understand the Government are to accept, with a change&#x2014;they were wisely drawing a distinction between the present wording of Schedule 8(1) and that of Section 12 of the Town and Country Planning Act. The publicity arrangements in Part III of Schedule 8 of the Bill are not very wide. The schedule provides that:
<q>(2) As soon as practicable after passing the resolution, the authority shall&#x2014;
<ol>
<li>(<i>a</i>) publish a notice of the effect of the resolution and naming a place or places where a copy of the resolution, and, in the case of a resolution affecting a part only of the area, a map on which that part of

the area is defined, may be inspected at all reasonable times, and</li>
</ol></q>
All hon. Members know exactly what that means, from their constituency experience. It will be a small advertisement in the local paper, and possibly one notice, written in legal jargon, pinned up outside the town hall&#x2014;a notice which only those with knowledge of the matter can understand. For the private citizen this is meaningless, because he is unlikely to understand it or to know whether his home is being threatened.<br/>
The provisions in Section 12(1) of the Town and Country Planning Act are much wider. They place a duty on the local authority to conduct a much more substantial participation exercise. It is required to see that adequate publicity is given in its area to any relevant matter and to ensure that persons who may be expected to desire an opportunity of making representations to the authority are made aware that they are entitled to do so. Specific duties are placed on the local authority under Section 12&#x2014;duties wider than those in Schedule 8 of the Bill. If we are to try placing on the statute book a law that says that people should be required to notify their local authority before disposing of their property, so that the local authority can decide whether it wishes to acquire it, the least we can do is to tell people that they have the right to object, and to circularise them in accordance with Section 12. I am amazed that the Minister, who is normally a reasonable man should seek to resist the amendment.</p>

<p>I cannot emulate the expertise of my hon. Friend the Member for Melton (Mr. Latham), but I invite the Minister to explore further his thesis that a development notification area confers a benefit upon the owner of property. The Minister says that the disposal notification area concept enables the owner of property to claim compensation for blight, but the very argument in our discussions on Lords Amendment No. 93 in respect of the five-year rolling programme&#x2014;that it enabled compensation to be claimed for blight&#x2014;was rejected. It is impossible to avoid the impression that the Minister is changing his mind from amendment to amendment in a manner that borders on the frivolous.<br/>
The Minister rejected our amendment to Lords Amendment No. 83, on the


ground that it was unnecessary, when it was clearly necessary. He rejected Lords Amendment No. 93, which was necessary, on the grounds that it was unnecessary. Now, he advances the argument that the DNA confers great benefit on the householder because it enables him to claim compensation blight, when he has rejected the argument that we advanced on Lords Amendment No. 93 that it allowed compensation to be claimed for compensation blight. What ground is the Minister advancing, or is he taking a frivolous, light-hearted approach to amendments which were seriously considered in another place and deserve to be accepted by him?</p>

<p>I am worried about the disposal notification areas. I am no scientist or biologist, but I believe I am right in saying that DNA is a vital ingredient in the cell structure and a basic aspect of human life. I cannot conceive that a disposal notification area has much to contribute in that sphere.<br/>
I am doubtful whether the Under-Secretary appreciate the implications of disposal notification areas upon the ordinary householder. Those who take a not too close interest in the proceedings of the Houses of Parliament may be vaguely aware that there is a Bill called the Community Land Bill. If they have read the White Paper, any other publication, or newspaper comments on the Bill, they may be under the impression that it applies to development land. Those people will probably think that development land could properly come within public ownership without any damage being caused to their affairs. It would not occur to a home-owner who does not regard his home as having development potential that legislation which is concerned with development land could affect his ownership of his home or anything he did with it if he moved elsewhere.<br/>
Yet people who live in the disposal notification areas are liable to find that their rights are affected in a nasty and remarkable manner. I go along with my hon. Friends who have commented on the extraordinary behaviour of the Under Secretary of State in advancing the theory that the concept of the disposal notification area is not dangerous to the rights of individual home-owners but is positively beneficial. It baffles me.<br/>
I am not a member of the legal profession, but there are many legal gentlemen around me, including the Under-Secretary of State. He may even have had some passing experience of conveyancing. Anyone who owns a home knows of the uncertainty and distress that can result when what he thinks is an agreed deal does not go through. Even in the most perfectly regulated market, mixed economy, or whatever system the Government are seeking to create&#x2014;it changes frequently&#x2014;it is unlikely that we shall have a balance of supply and demand and absence of gazumping and other techniques in the house market. With DNAs we can be certain that transactions affecting ordinary people's homes&#x2014;single houses owned by people who want to move from one town to another&#x2014;will be delayed.<br/>
People will find that they have to notify the local authority. I know that the Under Secretary is just waiting to say that here I go again criticising local authorities, but let us face the fact that they are not the perfect administrative machine. There is a local authority of a not inconsiderable size not very far from here, of which it is said that it sometimes takes over a week for correspondence to get from the front door even to the desk of the person meant to be dealing with it, let alone to the top of the pile&#x2014;and what happens when that person is on holiday or on strike? The idea that there will be a reply in a month is not borne out by the experience of planning legislation of those of us who are at the receiving end&#x2014;not inside the local authority, although I have been that at one time&#x2014;of the non-delivery.</p>

<p>I appreciate the point that my hon. Friend is making, but I am saying that the likelihood of any reply before the maximum time allowed is very small. In town planning legislation, as we are only too unhappily aware, there are some local authorities that just laugh if it is suggested to them that they can give an answer to a planning application in less than six months. They say that they are very busy, or that the planning


committee meets only every month, or something like that.<br/>
The public has an unhappy experience of the reaction of local authorities. They are very busy people and, sometimes, unfortunately, we make them busier by giving them too much to do. We must anticipate that local authorities will make a meal of this provision and will get into a muddle and ask for extensions, make one decision and then want to change it because it is the wrong decision. All this will have a serious effect on people owning homes in a disposal notification area.<br/>
I do not want to go into the hideous cost of the administrative bureaucracy that will be created for a disposal notification area.</p>

<p>I am being invited to do so, but perhaps my hon. Friend will enlarge on that a little. Undoubtedly disposal notification areas are one of the most ghastly aspects of this bureaucratic nightmare that we are being asked to process at a very appropriate time in the morning for nightmares.<br/>
It is not without significance that questions have failed to elicit any information from the right hon. Gentleman as to what assumptions are made about the number of disposal notification areas in his costings for the scheme. It appears that no serious assumptions were made about the number of and expenditure on disposal notification areas and the number of property transactions that would have to be processed. All the assumptions and the costings of the scheme seem to have been based on even more frivolous ground than was apparent.<br/>
We shall have delay, cost and bureaucracy, and, most of all, we shall have a serious risk that a number of people owning homes in a disposal notification area will find when they try to sell their property that the local authority will delay; and so the deal will fall through and there will be a ripple effect and a whole series of deals will fall through, and a lot of people will be upset. People should be given the opportunity to express their views on the matter indirectly, and they should be made more aware of the

circumstances in which they are likely to find themselves, so that it does not come as an unpleasant shock at the last moment, when people have thought that they have set the sale of their house under way, to find out, probably from their legal adviser, that the local authority cannot proceed and that there is no way in which to help.<br/>
This is another of those instances when one hopes that the Government will look at all the circumstances and will consider the implications for those likely to be involved. What is there to lose in accepting the Lords amendment? In his helpful manner, the Under-Secretary has tried to persuade us that this system will actually be helpful to people living in disposal notification areas. He has not explained why it would be helpful. Can he give us any reason for not accepting the Lords amendment? What would be the cost to those who might be affected?</p>

<p>It is incumbent on the Minister to explain one or two simple points. We should have some indication of the number of these areas and he should take notice that a very large number of people own fairly large houses with reasonably-sized gardens&#x2014;perhaps with an orchard. These are the very people who will be affected by the Bill.<br/>
All that the Lords amendment attempts to do is to give them a measure of protection. As my hon. Friend the Member for Hove (Mr. Sainsbury) said, these are people whose rights are being taken away by the Bill. It is about time people realised that the Bill applies to very small holders of medium-value property. My hon. Friend mentioned the problem of delay, and there are other facets, such as the difficulty of selling, and perhaps the almost impossibility of selling to anyone but the local authority.<br/>
The provisions in the schedule are not sufficient. There should be far better machinery for informing these people of the position they are in by being in a disposal area and if they are single occupiers of dwelling-houses. The Government should accept the Lords amendment.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1975-11-11a.1436.1" hansard_membership_id="7651" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/29898" speakername="Mr. Lawrence" colnum="1436" time="">
<p>My hon. Friends have put their finger on the principal reason why the Government are ashamed to give publicity to this facet of their Bill. The Government appreciate that these disposal


notices will affect owner-occupiers, and may do so in a big way. The Labour Party's election manifesto said:
<q>The Labour Government will take into public ownership land required for development, redevelopment and improvement. These proposals do not apply to owner-occupiers, whose homes and gardens will be safeguarded.</q>
Sixty per cent. of the population are owner-occupiers. The Government dare not alienate them for their semi-Communist principles of a desire to take all land. The Government are moving in stages towards the full aim of public ownership of land, but cannot move too fast because of the owner-occupiers among the electorate. That was why they went out of their way in the manifesto to say that owner-occupiers would be safeguarded.<br/>
But under these provisions there will be no safeguarding of owner-occupiers who will be affected. The amendment would give publicity to the fact. It would mean, if the 1971 Act provisions were applied to the Bill, that owner-occupiers would be given the opportunity to object. One can understand owner-occupiers in a whole street or whole area of a town rising up in an extremely agitated way against their local councillors, if they are Labour, or against their Member of Parliament, if he is Labour. People should understand why the Government are reluctant, on this issue of fundamental justice and interference with the rights of the individual, to give ample warning of the incursions about to be made on them so that they may make representations and protect themselves.<br/>
For the Minister to pretend&#x2014;as though we are particularly stupid at this time of the morning&#x2014;that there is an advantage to people to have these notices over them, and that in some way they will benefit from the blight that will result, is an insult to our intelligence.<br/>
At moments like this it is surely incumbent on the Minister to come clean. If the Government have some diverse reason for wanting to defend their Bill without giving these fundamental rights to people, it is only right and proper that they should say so. If they do not say so, the people will know how to judge them.</p>

<p>I am sure that the House is aware that what is coming to the fore yet again is the difference of

philosophy between the two sides of the House&#x2014;a point to which the Minister referred earlier. In rejecting the amendment the Government are rejecting a small protection for the individual by way of the publicity called for in the amendment.<br/>
Earlier in the course of our debates the individual was asked to trust the benevolent discretion of the Secretary of State, but now he is being told that he will be deprived of the benefit of blight provisions. I do not think that the Under-Secretary of State has explained at all adequately to the House why, if the amendment is not accepted and if the information is not given to him, the individual house owner or occupier can thereby be deprived of the benefit of these blight provisions.</p>

<p>Whatever Opposition Members may or may not think of the principle of disposal notification areas, what I was trying to describe to the House is the effect of the amendment from the other place on people who would be living in disposal notification areas.<br/>
Two things are being confused here. One is publicity and the other is participation. There is no issue between us on the need for publicity concerning a disposal notification area. Clearly it is essential in the interests especially of the people in the area that there should be full and adequate publicity where a disposal notification order is being made, and that is provided for in the Bill. The amendment from the other place seeks to go beyond that: it wants publicity and public participation.<br/>
May I spell out again what could be the detrimental effect of the amendment on people living in a disposal notification area? Where local authorities carry out a public participation exercise in precisely the way that their Lordships request in the amendment and then declare a disposal notification area, some of them, having done this, might wish to claim that the planning issues had been adequately dealt with by means of this process. This is something we do not want to happen, and neither do hon. Gentlemen opposite. The result could be to bypass the ordinary procedures for public participation and public inquiry under the Planning Acts. We are not discussing disposal notification


areas generally but are discussing the effect of the amendment from the other place.<br/>
There is one reason why we as a Government think that it would be wrong to accept their Lordships' amendment.</p>

<p>Surely the hon. Gentleman is now admitting that our proposals to strengthen the public inquiry provision were right. He is now saying that there is insufficient public inquiry facility and, therefore, that this provision must be made.</p>

<p>I am not saying that. I am stressing the need for publicity, but I am saying that if the Lords amendment were accepted the ordinary planning process could be bypassed by the device of using public participation on the disposal notification area.<br/>
We heard this discussed in relation to the five-year programme. The five-year programme that we were discussing earlier will not list sites and, therefore, cannot be used for the foundation of a blight notice. The disposal notification area comes much further along the line for the local authority. It is not the rolling programme, and one gets this constantly with disposal notification areas.<br/>
I said on Report that anyone would think that the entire length and breadth of England, Wales and Scotland was to be one huge disposal notification area. I say now that the rolling programme is not a disposal notification area. A</p>

<p>disposal notification area is far more concrete than that where an authority has made up its mind about a relatively small area that it is in the interests of the authority that it should be notified where people intend to sell within that area because it has development plans for the area as a whole.</p>

<p>The Opposition have asked what possible advantage there can be in living in a disposal notification area. The right hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) said that anyone in such an area would have to tell the local authority if he intended to sell and that the authority could stop him from selling. If the authority says vaguely to that person "We want this at some time in the future," he can say to the authority "Oh, no, you don't. You buy it now, at market value." That is the advantage that a person gets if he is in a disposal notification area. If it is not declared a disposal notification area, he does not get that advantage.</p>

<p>I know that that is going beyond the subject matter of the amendment, but it is a problem to which reference has been made. The main point of the amendment is that it could be used by an authority as a device to bypass ordinary planning procedures. For that reason, we ask the House to reject the amendment from the other place.</p>

<p>I beg to move, That this House doth agree with the Lords in the said amendment.<br/>
The amendment excludes from the requirement to notify disposals in DNAs

a transaction which is not for valuable consideration. Of course it is acceptable. It was a Government amendment in response to a point made in the Lords Committee.</p>

<p>It would help us if we could identify the amendment. Line 10 on page 23 is the end of subsection (7), which does not contain paragraphs (<i>a</i>) or (<i>b</i>). The Notice Paper therefore must be wrong. I wonder whether the Chair can assist us, because we do not know what we are amending.</p>

<p>The Minister will try, but he would like to point out that the


effect of the amendment, even if we are not quite certain where it arises, must be exactly right and something which the hon. Gentleman will appreciate. It was introduced in the Lords to meet a Lords Committee point.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1975-11-11a.1445.0" hansard_membership_id="4206" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/20268" speakername="Mr. Rossi" colnum="1445" time="">
<p>I understand the right hon. Gentleman's explanation of the amendment he intended to move, but the amendment on the Notice Paper is not the one that he has moved. The amendment on the Paper seeks to add two paragraphs to the Bill in a place where they clearly cannot go. The Paper is therefore incorrect. Is there a precedent for this? What happens when an amendment is moved which makes nonsense of the Bill?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1975-11-11a.1445.1" hansard_membership_id="10169" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/20635" speakername="Mr. Silkin" colnum="1445" time="">
<p>The answer is that Lords Amendments Nos. 123 and 126, to which we agreed in the last group taken formally, were paving amendments to No. 127.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1975-11-11a.1445.2" hansard_membership_id="4206" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/20268" speakername="Mr. Rossi" colnum="1445" time="">
<p>With respect, that is still not the solution. I believe that I know it, but I do not know whether I should help the Minister. Having teased him sufficiently to show that he is not clear what he is moving, I would say that his amendment should be inserted in line 6, since it should be an amendment to subsection (6), not subsection (7). That is my guess, but it is for the Minister to tell us what he is doing.</p>
</speech>

<p>Might I suggest to the Minister that it would be a novel practice to start throwing amendments into the air and hoping that they land in the right place in the Bill? I realise that he has to sustain himself with a certain amount of optimism in our passage through the Bill, but this is overdoing it. If the right hon. Gentleman cannot immediately clear up the matter beyond doubt, we should leave this amendment and come back to it another time. We should not leave the matter to chance.</p>

<p>The information I gave was correct. Amendments No. 123 and 126 were paving amendments. Now we come to Amendment No. 127.</p>

<p>If those other amendments were paving amendments, why was not Amendment No. 127 taken with them? No. 123 and No. 126 were taken with the fifth group of amendments which we discussed at about 5 o'clock yesterday. It

is nonsense to deal with the matter in this way.</p>

<p>This is a very serious incident. I have some sympathy with the Minister. He has had about enough and he does not know which amendments we are discussing. This will get us into even more confusion than we are in at present.<br/>
It is clear that we cannot go on discussing the Bill any longer. The Minister cannot lead us. He does not know where he is. The simple solution would be to adjourn now. When we return refreshed we shall be able to identify the amendments we are supposed to be discussing.</p>

<p>I am a member of the senior house of the legal profession.

It does not conform with the lineation or pagination of the Bill. There are no subsections in line 10 of page 23.</p>

<p>For someone who had been introduced to the concept of LAM-ing, which I understand means some obscene form of bureaucratic tyranny, I should have thought that pagination was quite a decent English word. For a Scot to produce it at this hour of the morning shows that he has spent the night over his dictionary.<br/>
Let us deal with page 23, line 10. Regardless of any previous amendment, paragraphs (<i>c</i>) and (<i>d</i>), which have no application whatever, cannot be added to Clause 23(7). That makes nonsense, and no attempt by an English solicitor to cure the nonsense will convince a Scottish counsel that he has done so.</p>

<p>I must attempt to assist the hon. and learned Member for Kinross and West Perthshire (Mr. Fairbairn) and the hon. Member for Mid-Bedfordshire (Mr. Hastings). Since they were leading me, and since both of them refused to divide against the group of amendments which included Lords Amendments Nos. 123 and 126, the paving amendments, I assume that they were in favour of them. Since they were in favour of them, they should have known what they were doing.<br/>
Are they really now looking a gift horse in the mouth? If we could fit the amendments in and they made sense I believe that the Opposition would welcome them, as they were welcomed in another place.<br/>
I urge hon. Members to turn to page 23 of the Bill. The effect of Lords Amendment No. 123 is to alter paragraph (<i>a</i>). It says
<q>Subsection (5) shall not apply to</q>
and there we insert Lords Amendment No. 123 to amend paragraph (<i>a</i>).<br/>
Lords Amendment 126 deletes paragraph (<i>b</i>), which is
<q>a disposal to any authority, or</q>
and (<i>c</i>), which is
<q>a disposal to the Crown".</q>
Then comes subsection (7), which after line 10 will read
<q>(<i>c</i>) to a transaction which is not for valuable consideration,</q>
<q>(<i>d</i>) to a disposal, or a contract for a disposal, to any authority or to the Crown</q>

<p>No. The word "or" has been taken out by Lords Amendment No. 125.<br/>
The subsection continues:

<p>I beg to move, That this House doth disagree with the Lords in the said amendment.<br/>
Subsection (9) of Clause 23 already provides that when an authority has served a counter-notice to a disposal notification stating that it intends to acquire the land, or has failed to serve a counter-notice within the required period of four weeks, the blight provisions of the Planning Acts shall apply so that those within the protected categories can serve a blight notice on the authority requiring it to acquire their land in advance. The protected categories are residential and agricultural owner-occupiers and owner-occupiers of premises with a rateable value not exceeding &#x00A3;2,250.<br/>
The effect of the amendment is to provide that anyone with a material interest in land, and not merely those within the protected categories, could serve a blight notice. The effect, therefore, would be to remove the present limitation that applies to residential and agricultural owner-occupiers and owner-occupiers of property whose rateable value does not exceed &#x00A3;2, 250. Those are the only categories of persons entitled to serve blight notices. The system is designed to protect those who suffer the greatest hardship from blight&#x2014;for

example, residential owners who need to sell their houses because they have to move to other areas. It has always been accepted hitherto that this protection should not be extended to other categories&#x2014;for example, the absentee landlord&#x2014;</p>

<p>That has been accepted by both sides of the House. The hon. Gentleman may recall that we have cantered round this course before. The blight categories were carefully considered by the Opposition when they were in Government when dealing with the Land Compensation Act 1973. Part V of that Act contained a number of important provisions concerning blight. The Conservative Government took the same view that we have taken. That is one reason for my expecting the Opposition to support the Government on this matter.</p>

<p>At this time of the morning there is nothing I enjoy more than a canter round a course to which I am accustomed. The right hon. Gentleman has been carefully quoting Acts dealing with blight which were passed by a Conservative Government of which I was a member. I remind the right hon. Gentleman that before that I introduced the Planning Blight and Worsenment Bill. The Labour Government of the day saw fit to reject it.<br/>
In arguing in support of the Lords amendment I contend that blight, if proved, should be capable of remedy. The right hon. Gentleman has said that we should reject the amendment because it widens the area of blight. I believe that if a subject of the Crown suffers, it matters not whether he be rich or poor. It seems that we are in the process of saying "If your property is of a certain kind and under a certain rateable value and you suffer a wrong, that wrong shall be put right. If, however, you suffer a wrong and your rateable value is above a certain figure, and if your property is of a certain nature, you shall not be recompensed by the State." I totally reject that point of view. There is either justice or injustice. The amendment provides for justice for all and not merely for a few.<br/>
I reject the right hon. Gentleman's arguments. If there is blight and the State induces it, the State should recompense those who suffer. That is why I


say that their Lordships have been right to present us with the amendment.</p>

<p>I congratulate you on your energy at this hour of the morning, Mr. Deputy Speaker.<br/>
These amendments would enable the Secretary of State to revoke all or part of a disposal notification area declared by an authority at any time rather than within the time limits at present specified&#x2014;that is, 28 days from receiving the copy resolution from the authority, or longer if it requires more time.<br/>
There may be instances&#x2014;for example, where a new or revised local plan is drawn up&#x2014;where there is a change in the planning strategy for the area such that the land concerned is no longer allocated for relevant development. In this situation there may be a case for terminating all or part of a DNA which was justified against the earlier planning background.<br/>
As the Bill is drafted, there is provision in paragraph 4 of Schedule 8 for the authority itself to terminate a DNA, but none whereby the Secretary of State can initiate such action once the initial right of "veto" has expired. It seems desirable that there should be control over this situation, and the purpose of the amendments is to enable the Secretary of State to have a continuing power of revocation instead of just the initial power, which is all that is provided at present.<br/>
The amendments achieve this aim by removing those provisions in paragraph 2 of the schedule which relate the Secretary of State's functions&#x2014;his right of "veto"&#x2014;to the initial declaration of a DNA. The effect of these changes is to

allow the Secretary of State to require all or part of a DNA to be terminated at any time.</p>

<p>I wish to raise two matters. First, will the Secretary of State have power to revoke a disposal notification area without consulting the local authority? Judging by the way in which the Minister introduced this matter it looks as though there is a complete right of veto given to the Secretary of State to revoke a DNA at any time without telling the local authority or consulting anybody. It seems rather high-handed of the Secretary of State to take such an attitude.<br/>
Although I am not in the least in favour of DNA resolutions, I at least wish to point out that if the Secretary of State wishes to override the resolution of a local authority, we should be certain that he consults the local authority in question before he takes that step.<br/>
Secondly, when a local authority has passed a resolution, will it be registered as a local land charge, and is there any obligation on the Secretary of State to remove that charge? I believe that it is important that he should do so. The DNA registered as a LLC&#x2014;or, in simpler language, the disposal notification area registered as a local land charge&#x2014;will be an encumbrance on the property. When the owner comes to sell, the purchaser will make his local search and, if the property is within a DNA, that will reduce the value of the property. If that property is removed by the Secretary of State, It should be removed as quickly as possible from the local land charge registry. I am not sure whether a local authority when it revokes a DNA has to remove the matter from the registry. If that is not the case, I hope that the Secretary of State will see that that procedure is followed.</p>

<p>I have to admit to the right hon. Gentleman that there is no obligation on the part of the Secretary of State to consult. In practice I can give him the assurance that the Secretary of State would do so. With regard to the question of the local land charge, I agree that it is an important obligation that the entry should be removed. There is an obligation under the local land charges rules to do this.</p>

<p>I beg to move, That this House doth agree with the Lords in the said amendment, as amended.<br/>
I move this motion on the strict understanding that our old friend, Lords Amendment No. 127 is also a paving amendment for Lords Amendment 140. I very much regret that, but I gather that the reason for this grouping was that it seemed better to have separate debates on these two different amendments rather than to have the same paving amendment leading in. Perhaps, after all, it did work out on the first debate.<br/>
The amendment excludes from the requirement to notify the disposal of a private dwelling-house which is the owner's only or main residence on a plot of up to one acre or such larger area as the authority may decide as reasonable having regard to the size and character of the house. The amendment is acceptable, including the paving amendment, in so far as the exclusion from the requirement to notify disposal of a house relates to a house on a plot of up to one acre. What is not acceptable is the added qualification dealing with such larger area as may in any case be required for the reasonable enjoyment of the house as a residence. I hope to explain why. It will take me a little time and I hope that hon. Members will bear with me.<br/>
As I have explained, one aim of disposal notification areas&#x2014;there are others&#x2014;is to enable an authority to endeavour to buy land at an early stage once it has made its development areas, so that the cost is not increased by the build-up of high base values for development land tax purposes. It makes no difference to the vendor but it makes a great deal of difference to the local authority because the lower the base value the cheaper the authority gets the land, since it gets it net of tax. For the vendor it is exactly the same.<br/>
At the same time a declaration of a disposal notification area can be helpful to owners of land in an area where an authority is proposing to acquire because it provides them with the opportunity, if the land is blighted and if they qualify on the basis we have talked about&#x2014;within the terms of Sections 192 of the 1971 Act&#x2014;to acquire the authority to purchase. If an owner does this the amount that he gets is protected, as in other blight situations, by Section 9 of the Land Compensation Act 1961, which provides that the compensation in circumstances of this kind is not to be reduced by the fact that values on the open market may be affected by the threat of compulsory purchase.<br/>
Now that substantial progress has been made with the drafting of the Development Land Tax Bill. it is clear that it is unlikely to be of any benefit to the authority in terms of avoiding the build-up of high base values if it is informed of sales of owner-occupied houses which are the sole or main residences of the


owners and stand in up to one acre of ground. This is obvious because there is no net of development land tax applicable in this instance since the house standing on one acre of ground is exempt from development land tax. At the same time, it would not be right to take away from the owners of such houses the potential remedy for blight that is inherent in the declaration of a DNA.<br/>
The Lords amendments, therefore, exclude from the notification provisions the sale of such owner-occupied houses, but they leave the owners of such houses the option of notifying if they wish to do so. This will not only provide the opportunity of serving a blight notice if acquisition is intended, but it will also enable the local authority to reassure a prospective purchaser when it does not wish to acquire, even though the property lies within a DNA, and serve a counter notice accordingly in response to a disposal notification.</p>

<p>I beg to move, That this House doth disagree with the Lords in the said amendment.<br/>
The effect of the new subsection is that if the second appointed day occurs before the lapse of a period of 11 years from White Paper day, compensation in respect of compulsory acquisition during the balance of the 11-year period of an interest in land owned throughout the period since White Paper day by a pension fund would have to be on the basis applicable before the second appointed day, that is to say, at market value as opposed to current use value. In essence, the amendment puts pension funds on all fours with Churches and charities.<br/>
As we said on Report, we regard Churches and charities as separate and distinct from other institutions because of their nature. Therefore, I do not agree that they are on all fours with institu

tions&#x2014;particularly financial institutions. As my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Dean) said, with Churches we are dealing with small pieces of land in inner city areas which become available as a result of a church having to be moved because the population has moved. That is quite different from the position that arises with pension funds.<br/>
There is little distinction between the investment of a pension fund as a company and other forms of corporate investment, so on philosophical grounds a distinction between pension funds and other institutional investors would be hard to draw. There are those general and wide reasons why there is a total difference between the Churches and charities on the one hand and pension funds on the other.<br/>
7.45 a.m.<br/>
But there are a number of other matters. I hope that the House will bear with me at this hour of the morning, because some concern has been expressed about the investment level of pensions funds as a result of the Bill. There are therefore some things that I should like to spell out in looking at exactly how the Bill will affect investments by pension funds&#x2014;indeed, how little it will affect them. I want to do so by looking at certain cases of both developed and undeveloped land and get rid of some misconceptions that have arisen in the financial Press and some journals interested in the Bill.<br/>
First let us take the case of sites which are already developed. Will they be acquired? So long as they continue in their current use, the position is unchanged from what it is at present. What then is the position if an existing property is to be rebuilt within the limits of an increase of 10 per cent in the floor space existing before rebuilding? Rebuilding on this scale would come within the scope of the excepted development regulations. The duty of local authorities to acquire will not apply to such rebuilding, the power to suspend planning applications will not apply, nor would compulsory purchase orders be approved unless they could be justified on special grounds.<br/>
So this leaves only development on a scale which is quite different from that of the present building. I am not aware that this is in fact the sort of investment which pension funds have been in the


habit of making, but let us suppose that they have done so. In such circum stances, they will have a prior right to a leaseback which the Schedule 6 procedures will in practic provide.<br/>
Let us now take the second leg&#x2014;the question of the valuation for purposes of compensation if the land is acquired. Current use value means just what it says&#x2014;value in its current use as a developed site. It is a value that reflects&#x2014;and which will continue to do so under the land scheme both before and after the second appointed day&#x2014;the assumption that planning permission to rebuild within the tolerances set out in Schedule 8 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1971 would be granted.<br/>
What would not be within current use value after the second appointed day is an increase in value attributable to the expectation that a planning permission would be granted for a development in excess of Schedule 8 tolerances. In the case of the commercial properties which constitute the bulk of the pension funds' investments, the change will mean very little. Such expectations are already heavily discounted by the market. Thus, in practice, there will be little difference in the compensation payable before and after the second appointed day.<br/>
Having dealt with the case of developed sites, let us now consider a second type of case&#x2014;where undeveloped land has been bought at a price reflecting the fact that it is ripe for development, or where a site with buildings on it has been bought at a price reflecting the hope of planning permission for early and major redevelopment. I stress, as I did in Committee and on Report, that the move to current use value will be gradual&#x2014;the second appointed day cannot be brought in until the duty to acquire land for all relevant development has been applied to all authorities.<br/>
This is frankly some considerable time off and, unless the investment in the land was with very long-term purposes in mind, or highly speculative&#x2014;which seems unlikely in the case of pension funds&#x2014;it should be possible for the development to be achieved before the second appointed day is reached. If the land is acquired by a local authority prior to development, compensation will be on the full market value basis currently

applying. If the authority grants planning permission and decides not to acquire, and the development has not yet been carried out by the second appointed day, that planning permission will still confer value for compensation purposes after the second appointed day. Again, therefore, there is no reason why the Bill should have any significant effect on the value of land acquired by pension funds before White Paper day.<br/>
Finally, I will deal with the more general allegation that it is not worthwhile for pension funds to invest in property at all in future. It follows from what I have said that there is no reason why the market in existing property should be affected by the scheme. As regards investment in new development on land which has passed through public ownership, it is true that freeholds will no longer be available, but investing institutions are well accustomed to leaseholds, and there has been no problem in the past for investors negotiating satisfactory terms in, for example, the new towns. There is no reason why their experience should be any different in future.<br/>
It has been made clear that leases of 99 years or more will be available, and this should allow ample flexibility for the negotiation of arrangements which will provide the necessary stability for investment portfolios, a satisfactory income, and an ability to realise the investment on satisfactory terms if desired.<br/>
I have gone to some length to discuss the question of pension funds in regard to their relationship with Churches and charities and the differences between them, and to dispel many of the rumours which have been circulating by showing in what a very limited way the Bill will affect the pension schemes, largely because, of course, their investment is not in the type of development which would be affected by the community land scheme.<br/>
I hope that the House, having heard my explanation of our belief in the difference between Churches and charities, which are highly exceptional cases, and pension funds, which are a much more commercial investment, and of the very limited way in which pension funds would be affected by the scheme at all, will disagree with the Lords amendment.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1975-11-11a.1461.0" hansard_membership_id="4206" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/20268" speakername="Mr. Rossi" colnum="1461" time="">
<p>The hon. Gentleman's explanation has indicated the appalling lack of appreciation there is of the problems of the pension funds under the Bill. He has sought to minimise and belittle the impact of the Bill on pension funds, but those intimately concerned, the pension fund managers, who have studied this Bill in depth and are fully alive to its consequences, take a wholly different view.<br/>
It is not for the hon. Gentleman to belittle these anxieties and to dismiss them as newspaper rumour. The people expressing them are professionals intimately concerned with the day-to-day management of pension fund assets. They know what they are about, this is their daily business, and if they say that the Bill is disastrous to pension funds, the hon. Gentleman can take it that it is.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman makes great play of the fact that if the site is to be rebuilt there is a 10 per cent. tolerance, and if the redevelopment takes place within that tolerance none of the dire effects of the Bill will be attracted to it. That 10 per cent. tolerance is not worth a row of beans because the current costs of demolition and reconstruction in inflation terms exceed the anticipated value and the extra revenue to be derived from that 10 per cent. It has already been overtaken and passed by inflation. The additional cost of demolition and reconstruction disposed of that great 10 per cent. concession that is being trotted out the whole time. It is not worth anything at all.<br/>
For a redevelopment to be viable today, it must be in excess of a 10 per cent. capacity, and, of course, it is at that point that the State starts dipping its hand into other people's pockets&#x2014;in this case into the pockets of the pensioners who have invested money over their working lifetime in order to provide for their old age.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman said that pension funds do not look at long-term investment in property for redevelopment purposes&#x2014;that that is highly speculative. It is the very essence of pension fund investment in property. The hon. Gentleman need not pretend that this is the first time he has heard of this, because we discussed this in some detail on Second Reading, in Committee and on

Report stage. Various statements were made from this side of the Chamber as to the policy of pension funds in these matters.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman has had the time between Second Reading and now to check with the pension fund managers, and he need not merely check with those firms in the City providing pension funds as an adjunct to insurance company activity. He can check with the pension fund managers of the nationalised industries. They will tell him what is their investment policy for their retired miners, their retired electrical workers, their retired manual workers. We have had the figures trotted out at each stage of the Bill. We have been told of the quarter of a million miner pensioners whose pensions are at risk because of this measure. We have that on the authority of the pension fund managers.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman cannot come here and blandly dismiss the advice that we are receiving from those quarters, and read out to us a brief that says, "Do not worry about it. It is not going to affect these people at all." I do not know who writes these briefs for the hon. Gentleman, or what experience the writer of that brief has in pension fund work, or whether the gentleman who wrote that brief has spoken to the nationalised industries' pension fund managers and gone into the figures with them, or with the managers of private pension funds. I am sure that if, if he had, the House would not be treated to the nonsense contained in the brief read to us, because it does not accord with the information given to us by the professionals who work in this field day in and day out.<br/>
I remind the hon. Gentleman that we have already told him that the policy of a pension fund, investing the earnings and savings of people, and providing money against their old age, is to find Victorian and Edwardian commercial properties, looking 150 years ahead in regard to the potential of the site. Within a 150-year term investment such a site has the possibility of being redeveloped not merely once but possibly even three times. Each time a redevelopment takes place on that site, a building is constructed to meet modern requirements, so that modern rents can be obtained. The income basis of the pension fund is increased at each redevelopment.<br/>
It is that increase in rental base at each redevelopment which enables the pension fund to pay out pensions which keep up with the level of inflation. That is not speculation. That is sensible, prudent investment in bricks and mortar on behalf of people who want pensions which will support them in their old age. That is what the hon. Gentleman is destroying.<br/>
8.0 a.m.<br/>
I have been told by the pension fund managers that since their properties can be acquired after the second appointed day at current use value, the value of those properties in pension fund hands will be reduced immediately on the passing of the Bill and that, as the second appointed day approaches, they will continue to decline in value. It is obvious that if there is a decline in the value of the assets from market value to current use value&#x2014;antiquated building value&#x2014;on the second appointed day, that obviously reflects the value as of today because the value as of today must reflect the value ultimately to be obtained on the second appointed day, and, as we get nearer the second appointed day, the value goes down until it reaches that point.<br/>
I wonder whether the hon. Gentleman has consulted the Treasury on the effect that will have and how it relates to present Government economic policy in requiring greater investment in industry. The hon. Gentleman may ask what is the relation between the two. I will tell him. If the asset value of a pension fund goes down, that asset value under the average pension fund trust deed has to be made up by the industry concerned out of its revenue. That is its obligation.<br/>
Whether it be ICI, Tate and Lyle or the National Coal Board pension fund, the effect of the passing of this Bill is to reduce the asset value of the properties, with a rapid decline in the value of those assets down to the second appointed day. Each year, or whatever the accounting period may be, that decline in asset value must be made up out of the revenue of that industry. If the revenue of that industry is making up the asset value of its pension fund, it has so much less for reinvestment in industry in order to expand our production and our economy. I shall be very surprised if the hon. Gentleman has given any thought to that possibility. It that matter had been considered, I am

certain that a different view would have been taken of it.<br/>
I am not conjuring these thoughts out of the air. I have taken the best advice available to me. What I have said about asset values and about the impact that this will have on industry can be supported fully by those professionally concerned in these matters.<br/>
Is the Minister aware that already this year ICI has had to make up the value of its employees' pension fund by &#x00A3;30 million merely because of the effects of inflation? That sum will be increased immediately the Bill is passed and the &#x00A3;30 million, plus whatever will be charged to ICI, will mean that that much less money will be available to be invested in industry.<br/>
Who will be affected by these provisions? On Second Reading, in Committee and on Report we talked about the miners and electrical workers. We quoted the number of retired people whose pensions were subject to and put at risk by the effects of the Bill. However, I have been given another figure. At present there are 12 million people subscribing to pension funds. They, together with their dependants, make up one half of the total population of this country. Therefore, one half of the total population of this country will be affected. We are talking about a Bill which is intended to bring money to the community and which is meant to be for the benefit of the community, yet we are undermining the provisions which people are making for their old age.<br/>
What are we doing and how are we doing it? We are merely shifting the value of assets from one half of the population into the hands of the local authorities. The straight transfer of asset value into the hands of local authorities will be done by the town halls. The Minister must explain the position. He must obtain the views of that half of the population that will be affected.<br/>
Today we are discussing the Bill in hypothetical terms. However, after the Bill has been enacted and the immediate effects upon those pension funds become obvious, the chicken will come home to roost on the Labour benches. We shall see how many votes this measure is worth to the Opposition when the people realise what the Bill will do to their pensions and their insurance policies.<br/>
We are making our case. We are not able to defeat these provisions, but we wish that we were able to do so. We know perfectly well that the Minister, having read the brief which was placed in front of him, without considering the matters which we are now putting to him will insist that all his hon. Friends are whipped into the Division Lobby. The Government will carry this measure, and then they will live to rue the day.<br/>
The Minister also mentioned that these pension funds were not analogous to charities and Churches. The dividing line between charities and non-charities is very fine, and difficult to define in legal terms. Is the Minister aware that, for example, the City of London General Pension Society, although a pension fund, is a charity and that it will escape what most of the pensions funds will have to undergo because it gets just inside the legal definition?<br/>
The real difference between a pension fund and a charity is that the beneficiaries of the pension fund have to enter into a contractual obligation to pay a proportion of their earnings into the fund. In consideration of that, their employers pay in a sum, and ultimately those people will benefit as the beneficiaries of the fund. The mere fact that it is a contractual obligation in law takes it outside the concept of charity and therefore it will not be accepted for registration by the Charity Commissioners. But a trust fund is non-profit making. Nobody makes a profit out of it. The only people who derive advantage are the beneficiaries in the same way as beneficiaries derive benefit from a charity. Therefore, the dividing line between charities and pension funds is very fine.<br/>
For the reasons that I have given regarding the appalling, not the minimal, impact that these measures will have on pension funds, that the dividing line between charities and pension funds is very fine, and that they are non-profit making enterprises, we, and the Lords in their amendment, ask that pension funds be treated similarly to charities.<br/>
That is not a tremendous deal in itself, because the original intention to give charities and Churches complete exemption from the legislation has been denied by the Government. Churches and chari

ties are to get a miserly 10-year exemption from the worst affects of the Bill. At the end of 10 years their time runs out. The amendment seeks to give pension funds a similar 10-year exemption.<br/>
I do not want to detain the House too long at this hour of the morning. I hope that I have put the argument clearly and that my right hon. and hon. Friends will support the amendment.</p>

<p>I certainly rise in support of this Lords amendment because, apart from the Churches and charities, it is the most important matter that we have discussed since we started our deliberations yesterday afternoon.<br/>
The pension funds have already suffered from the Government's proposals, and there is no question that they will suffer substantially more in the years ahead. Both in Committee and on Report we suggested various methods to help the pension funds. We tried replacement development and other definitions which the Government felt unable to accept. This is the last chance, as I see it, for us to do anything for them.<br/>
I imagine that hon. Members have seen the handout from the group representing pension funds. In it they point out:
<q>Pension fund activities are similar to charities in the field of investment"&#x2014;</q>
the hon. Member for Hornsey (Mr. Rossi) also made that point&#x2014;
<q>and it is here that the cases overlap. It is only in relation to compensation for acquisition of pre-White Paper Day investments that the pension funds are claiming a similar treatment to the charities. Thus, if the Church Commissioners or the Trustees of a University College Fund bought land pre-White Paper Day in order to use income and capital to provide benefits to clergymen or dons, it is difficult to see why they should receive a more favourable treatment in this respect than the trustees of a pension fund who bought land to provide benefits for workpeople in industry.</q>
That is a plausible case. We are only asking for them to be put on the same basis as are Churches and charities. The amendment is not asking for much. It is what happens when the investment runs out, when the reversionary interest falls due, which is the great problem for these funds.<br/>
The Government have not appreciated the Bill's effect on a large number of


worthy trust funds. This is another instance in which the Government will have to help if these organisations cannot do the job themselves. I am sure that this appeal will fall on deaf ears, but I hope that even at this late hour the Government will see some sense.</p>

<p>I am touched by the concern of the hon. Member for Hornsey (Mr. Rossi) about the effect of the Bill on the Labour Party and the Labour movement which he so vividly described. I am also impressed by the way in which he accepts so blindly, almost hysterically, anything that the investment managers tell him. When he was talking about the miners' pension fund, I expected some of my hon. Friends from mining constituencies to complain about the Government's action. [HON. MEMBERS: "Where are they?"] They are not here, perhaps because they do not have such touching faith in the investment managers as do hon. Members opposite.<br/>
But who is on the Front Bench with me, obviously feeling great concern about the hon. Member's remarks about the effect of the Bill on the Treasury and pension funds? The Chancellor of the Exchequer. He is not pulling me down, worried about the effect of the Bill.<br/>
There is a good deal of special pleading about the pension fund element of investment in property. As I have said before, I understand that the proportion of investment by pension funds in property&#x2014;not only in property affected by the Bill&#x2014;is 17 per cent. As I have said before in a long statement, only a fraction of that 17 per cent. will be affected. That is the position, and that is why my hon. Friends from mining constituencies&#x2014;[HON. MEMBERS: "Where are they?"] They are not here because they do not share the anxieties that the hon. Gentleman is trying to propagate throughout the country by spreading alarm, fear and despondency, in the interests not of the pension funds but of the general property investor and speculator whom he is truly trying to defend and represent.</p>

<p>That is precisely what I am trying to say to the House. That was also the burden of the rather long speech I made in the first instance. [HON. MEMBERS: "Answer the question."] I have answered. My hon. Friend is satisfied, and if he is not complaining I do not see why hon. Members opposite should complain.<br/>
It is far better that investment takes place in manufacturing industry and not in speculative ventures as it has done in the past. If the Bill goes some way towards redirecting pension funds into manufacturing industry, it will have a spin-off which will benefit the country.</p>

<p>The main purpose and effect of the amendments is to enable the Secretary of State, with the consent of the Treasury, to prescribe further bodies to which modifications of the compensation rules affected by regulations under subsection (2) are to apply.<br/>
Amendment No. 157 adopts the affirmative resolution procedure, not only in respect of that power but in respect of subsection (2), for which the negative resolution procedure had been provided.<br/>
It is always desirable that the authorities or bodies to which the particular provisions will apply should be specified in the legislation, but in the case of this clause that is not possible. First, the intention is that the modified compensation rules should apply to all transactions between public bodies where the vendor body is not liable to development land tax, but because the development land tax bill will not be enacted until after this Bill the clause cannot contain a complete list. Therefore, subsection (1)(<i>a</i>) specifies only the major authorities among those which draft clause 10 of the White Paper on development land tax proposals said should not be liable to tax.<br/>
The clause, as amended, provides that the Secretary of State may, by order, with

the consent of the Treasury, specify bodies in addition to those at present mentioned whose land transactions as vendors or purchasers will be governed by the modified land compensation rules. A further amendment alters from the negative to the affirmative procedure any addition to the lists.</p>

<p>As the clause stood originally, the Secretary of State had discretion whether or not to make regulations setting up financial hardship tribunals. The Secretary of State could also decide when they should be set up. The effect of the amendments is to make it mandatory that the regulations be made before the second appointed day. The Government amendments achieve the same effect, but for the sake of clarity and for drafting reasons they do so by amending Clause 7, which contains the main substantive provisions concerning the second appointed day. We do not think that there will be many if any cases of hardship arising from the change to CUV.</p>

<p>The right hon. Gentleman's speech was spoiled by his latter remarks. The financial hardship tribunals are important. During earlier stages we pressed for the tribunals to be mandatory. I think that the amendments that the right hon. Gentleman has brought before us make them, in effect, mandatory. Therefore, we need not bother about the disagreement with Amendment No. 158. The right hon. Gentleman's substitution for Amendment No. 159 is sufficient. We are grateful to him for putting forward the amendments.</p>

The amendment has the effect of providing that the Secretary of State may make Regulations to enable financial hardship tribunals to deal with the case of deceased persons who, if they had survived, would or might have been entitled to additional payments under the section. The Opposition moved amendments in Committee and on Report seeking to ensure that the right to make a claim, or the benefit of a claim which is accepted by a tribunal, can pass to the personal representative of any person entitled to make a claim. My hon. Friend undertook that, as it has been ascertained that this could not be achieved by process of general law, the intention of the amendment would be "placed in

the Act". The amendment accordingly provides that the Regulations make such provisions as are expedient.</p>

<p>I beg to move, That this House doth agree with the Lords in the said amendment.<br/>
We propose that the House should waive its privilege. This is necessary because this matter falls within the privilege of this House.<br/>
The effect of the amendment is as follows. It is intended that in cases where authorities buy land from the Crown the price they pay should correspond with what it would have cost them under the community land scheme if the land were in private hands&#x2014;that is, market value less the amount of any development land tax payable by the vendor. Because the Crown will not be liable to pay development land tax, the clause makes special provision designed to achieve that result. The arrangement is that the acquiring authority will pay market value but will then receive, under the authority of Clause 39, a grant representing the amount of tax which would have been payable.</p>

<p>On this point I feel that the House is slipping in its duty, because it is being less than vigilant over matters which the House receives from the other place and which cost the country money. Many of the provisions that we have discussed throughout the night have to be carried, in money terms, by the Government, and at the present time it is not within their power to spend that money. Therefore, the House should be much more careful in dealing with amendments that come from the Lords, many of which should be ruled out of order. We should stress to our Ministers time and again to look carefully at what the House of Lords is doing. Certainly in the last hour three or four amendments will add to the Government's monetary burdens in one way or the other. The other place is totally out of order in discussing these matters, passing amendments on them and then

bringing them to the House of Commons for consideration. We as Commons Members should assert our authority and tell the Lords that they have no right to come to such conclusions.</p>

But in this case it is the Government who have suggested that this House should waive its privilege. If the House agrees to waive its privilege.

This sort of thing is not good enough.

<p>I beg to move, That this House doth disagree with the Lords in the said amendment.<br/>
The effect of the amendment would be to remove the comprehensive control which Clause 43 gives the Secretary of State over all disposals of material interests in land, regardless of the powers under which the land was acquired, by making all such disposals subject to the consent of the Secretary of State. It would substitute a provision that he could make regulations prescribing the terms under which an authority could dispose of any material interest in land which had been acquired under the powers provided by the Bill.<br/>
It is unacceptable to the Government to draw a distinction between land acquired under the Bill and land acquired under other statutory provisions. Local authorities will continue to be able to use their existing powers, for example, under the housing and planning Acts, to acquire land for private development. Given this, it would be unacceptable to have a situation under which the disposal of land acquired under the Land Bill and disposed of for private development was subject to control, whereas land acquired under other powers and disposed of for the same purpose was not.<br/>
It has been made clear that the intention is to issue general consents to disposals which will give local authorities

wide flexibility to dispose of land without the need for specific reference to the Secretary of State in individual cases. Where a local authority wishes to dispose of land on terms which are not covered by the general consent, it will be free to come to the Secretary of State and seek his consent to other terms. This approach combines the advantages of giving a wide measure of discretion to local authorities with flexibility to deal with special cases on their merits and by reference to the particular circumstances of the case.<br/>
If the Secretary of State had to attempt to foresee and provide for all circumstances within the Regulations provided for in the amendment the result would inevitably be that there would be cases in which local authorities would want to dispose on terms which would be precluded by Regulations but which the Secretary of State might be prepared to consent to having regard to the particular circumstances of the case. The only answer to that problem would be to have a consent procedure for cases not covered by the Regulations but the effect of that would be to render the amendment nugatory.<br/>
The approach to the matter by way of Regulations is, therefore, undesirable, on the ground that it would remove flexibility and the possibility of giving speedy approval for disposals on exceptional terms in circumstances where speed may be important. It is, furthermore, unprecedented in relation to the giving of consents to the disposal of land. The extent of the control over land disposals by local authorities has varied from time to time, but, where control has been exercisable, it has been achieved by a requirement for the consent of a Minister, and not by Regulations.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1975-11-11a.1483.5" hansard_membership_id="10169" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/20635" speakername="Mr. Silkin" colnum="1483" time="">
<p>The Government see no reason to go as far as the Lords amendment now does to give an owner of a material interest an absolute right of veto over the making of a planning application on land in which he has an interest. The Government are therefore prepared to agree to the Lords amendments only with the deletion of paragraph (<i>b</i>) in each case. I ought to explain that by leaving out head (<i>b</i>) is meant in each case leaving out from "relates" in line 6 to the end of line 7 of Amendments Nos. 181 and 183.<br/>
It is our view that the inclusion of paragraph (<i>a</i>) affords adequate protection to the landowner. The Planning Acts already require anyone applying for planning permission on land which he does not own to serve notice on the owners. There is then an opportunity for the owners to make representations to the local planning authority, which can take them into account in reaching a decision on the application.<br/>
There are, furthermore, two specific provisions in the Bill that adequately protect the landowner. First, there is the original provision in the Bill&#x2014;as now slightly amended by the amendments introduced by the Government in the Lords. It has the effect of widening the Planning Act provisions relating to notification.<br/>
Secondly, there is specific protection for an owner's position in the "prior right" provisions in paragraph 2 of Schedule 6. Under these provisions, anyone applying for planning permission may have a prior right to negotiate to carry out development on the land if it is acquired by an authority. Paragraph 2(4) of Schedule 6 specifically provides that a person making a planning application shall have the benefit of the prior right provisions only where his application to

carry out development on the land is accompanied by the written consent of all those with a material interest in the land. The Government therefore accept that there is a need to protect the position of the land owner when there is a planning application from a third party, but they maintain that this protection is afforded by paragraph (<i>a</i>) of the amendments together with the prior right provisions and that paragraph (<i>b</i>) of the amendments are unnecessary.</p>

<p>It is not without significance that, at the end of a very lengthy consideration of the Bill, we return again to the rights of the individual property owner. There has been some limited strengthening of those rights since this appalling Bill was presented. One consequence of the Bill is that now a planning application from a third party can trigger off a sequence of events that could lead to a farmer's being deprived of his farm by compulsory purchase without the opportunity to do other than protest ineffectively.<br/>
There is no need to go through the sequence of events that causes this to happen, but it is a direct consequence of the provisions in the Bill that again the rights of the individual property owner are seriously diminished in a way not shown at all in all the Government publicity and the White Paper. Because of this potential loss of rights of property owners, we regard head (<i>b</i>) of Lords Amendments Nos. 181 and 183 as essential.</p>

<p>After the excitement of the night, hon. Members may agree that it is a pleasant relief to turn to the subject of the problem of dwelling houses rated as boarding houses. There are premises in my constituency, and elsewhere in the United Kingdom, that are used solely as private dwelling houses, but they are valued and described for rating purposes as boarding houses. There are at least 50 such premises in Llandudno alone.<br/>
Some of these premises have no recent history of use as boarding houses. Nevertheless, they are valued and described as such in the valuation list, because in arriving at his valuation and description the valuation officer is required to envisage them as being vacant and to let. If, in his opinion, the premises would then command a rent commensurate with rents of boarding houses, they must be valued and described accordingly, irrespective of whether they are, in fact, occupied for that purpose.<br/>
The Minister of State, Treasury, the hon. Member for Llanelli (Mr. Davies), confirmed this view to me in a letter dated 15th September last. He wrote:
<q>I can understand the concern of your constituents at the situation which has apparently arisen but, as far as the Valuation Officer is concerned, there can be no suggestion that he has acted incorrectly.</q>
The concern of my constituents arises from the fact that they are unable to obtain domestic rate relief together with the facility for the payment of rates by instalments and to obtain rate rebates where appropriate. Their inability to obtain these things, particularly domestic rate relief, derives from the fact that the local rating authority, Aberconwy Council, takes the view that domestic rate relief should be available only on those premises described in the valuation list as private dwelling houses, which alone attract the domestic element of the rate support grant under the 1974 Regu

lations and similar regulations made previously.<br/>
I have a great deal of sympathy with the council's view. At the same time, it is clear that, under Section 48 of the General Rate Act 1967, where a property is used exclusively as a private dwelling, as defined in the Act, the ratepayer is entitled to domestic rate relief. Section 48 provides:
<q>Every rating authority shall reduce the amount which, apart from this subsection, would be the amount of the rate levied by the authority for any year on any dwelling-house".</q>
"Dwelling-house" is clearly defined in Section 115(1) as
<q>a hereditament&#x2026;used wholly for the purposes of a private dwelling or dwellings".</q>
It follows that it is not necessary for the hereditament to be described as a dwelling house in the valuation list for the local authority to give rate relief.<br/>
Furthermore, the Act requires that relief shall be given. It seems to me that the Aberconwy Council is in the wrong in not granting that relief. I should be glad if the Minister would confirm that that is the position under the 1967 Act.<br/>
Why should the local authority give rate relief on premises that do not attract the domestic element of the rate support grant, the distribution of which is by reference to the rateable value of dwelling houses as certified by the valuation officer? Of course, the valuation officer cannot include in his certificate properties used as private dwelling houses but described as boarding houses.<br/>
This results in the situation that, if an authority gives domestic rate relief, the relief cannot be recovered through the domestic element of the rate support grant, and the relief so granted by the authority is in fact being met by the remainder of the ratepayers of the district. Surely that was never the intention of Parliament, or of the Government who introduced the rate support grant in 1966. The intention was that domestic rate relief should come from Government funds.<br/>
Commenting on Aberconwy Council's practice of using the valuation list to decide which properties qualify for domestic rate relief, the Treasury Minister, in the letter of 15th September to which I have referred, describes it as "somewhat restrictive". He adds:
<q>The law is quite clear and the proper test is to consider the actual use of the property


rather than the description of it in the valuation list.</q>
The law may indeed be clear&#x2014;as clear as the braying of an ass often is&#x2014;because it provides two different definitions of a dwelling house: one, in Sections 48 and 115 of the General Rate Act, to determine the entitlement of the ratepayer to relief and the other, in Statutory Instrument No. 428 and its predecessors, to determine the amount of the domestic element of the rate support grant payable to the local authority. The former definition includes dwelling houses valued and described as boarding houses, while the latter excludes them and confines itself to
<q>&#x2026;dwelling houses in the area as certified by the valuation officer.</q>
No one would dispute the superiority of the Act over the statutory instrument in an area of conflict such as we have here, or the need for the two definitions to be brought into line in the interests of all concerned, and in particular in the interests of justice to the ratepayers, especially those paying boarding house rates without relief for their private dwelling houses. It would not be necessary to amend the rate support grant regulations to allow the valuation officer to certify these properties for rate support grant purposes. He could certify them on the basis of actual use and specifically for the purposes of the regulations.<br/>
Another suggestion, and one favoured by the Association of District Councils, is that there should be an amendment of the rate support regulations to allow certification by the treasurer and the district auditor of the rateable values of any properties on which domestic rate relief was granted but which had been classified as dwelling houses by the valuation officer. I am told that the district auditor already certifies mixed hereditaments, so there can be no earthly reason why he should not certify dwelling houses valued and described as boarding houses.<br/>
I hope that the Minister will seriously consider these two proposals. I shall be surprised if he does not say that this is among the matters being considered by the Layfield Committee. He may dare to suggest that the final resolution of the problem should await its report and consequent Government action. Meanwhile, he may say that Aberconway Council should follow the practice of some other councils, which is to grant

relief from rate revenue. But such an answer would not be satisfactory. The local authorities and their ratepayers are being hard done by while this situation, which is manifestly wrong, continues. There is no doubt that the Government are taking unfair advantage of them in giving them less by way of domestic rate support grant than they are required to give by way of domestic rate relief.<br/>
Some of my constituents in the predicament that I have described have been advised to apply to the valuation officer for reclassification of their premises as dwelling houses and the valuation officer will probably lodge an objection to their proposals. I understand that he has already done so in 30 cases. It is not for me to pre-empt the judgment of the valuation court, although I have my own opinion of the value of the advice that my constituents have received.<br/>
Others may consider taking the local authority to court for failing to pay domestic rate relief to them as required under Section 48 of the 1967 Act, or they may resist an application for a distress warrant for rates calculated at the full poundage, or they may appeal to a Crown court against the rate. It would not be proper for me to comment in advance on any such proceedings as may be contemplated. Some of the constituents involved are pensioners in their seventies and they find it difficult to understand why they should be involved in court proceedings of any kind. It frightens them. Their understanding of the law in this matter is justifiably imperfect and their financial resources are very limited. They depend on the Government, with all the legal advice available to them, to declare what and who is right or wrong. I shall expect the authorities to act on the advice of the Government.<br/>
I shall only mention one case, but it is typical. Mrs. Peggy Emery is aged 77 and lives on her pension at Ludlow House, Clifton Road, Llandudno. Her home has not been used as a boarding house for more than a decade. Her rates this year are &#x00A3;239. There is no domestic rate relief and no possibility of a rate rebate. Something must be done for her and others like her.<br/>
The Government must make a clear statement on two issues&#x2014;that of domestic rate relief for those in private dwellings rated as boarding houses and on whether


such relief, when granted, should not be recoverable by the local authority through the domestic element in the rate support grant.</p>

<p>Having gone through a rather lengthy night, I hope that hon. Members will bear with me while I try to explain the somewhat complex problem that we have had presented to us. I do not propose to suggest that we should wait for Layfield. That is the first and last time I shall mention that name.<br/>
The problem is in two parts. The first concerns the description and the rateable value of the property in the valuation list. In every town hall there is a valuation list giving details of property on which the local authority will levy a rate. Among other things, the valuation list will give a description of each property. It will also show a rateable value for the property. The question posed by the hon. Member for Conway (Mr. Roberts) is how a property can be described and valued as a boarding house when it is used for entirely different purposes.<br/>
Here we must go back to the basis of our present rating system. All property liable to be rated will be given a value based on its rental value in the open market. The task of compiling and maintaining the valuation list is the responsibility of the valuation officers of the Inland Revenue. When valuing property, they will both describe and value the property as if it were vacant and to let. This is a long-established principle which is supported by the courts.<br/>
Therefore, it does not matter for valuation purposes how a property is actually used. The question to be answered is what possible use or uses would govern the level of rent obtainable if the property were offered for letting in the open market. This is the decision which the valuation officer must take, based on his experience of the property market together with the facts of the particular case.<br/>
However, I would emphasise that each case is decided on its own circumstances, and if any ratepayer disagrees with the decision made by the valuation officer concerning his property, he may appeal to the local valuation court. The hon. Mem

ber's constituents, about whom he is so understandably concerned, certainly have this avenue open to them. They may go to the local valuation court and say "I do not agree with the discription of my property given by the valuation officer; nor do I agree with the rateable value he has decided." The valuation panel will look at all the facts of the case again and, if it so decides, it may change both the description and the value of the property.<br/>
Let me also advise the hon. Member's constituents not to be put off by the word "court". I know this sometimes worries elderly people. One does not need to be represented at a local valuation court and no costs need be incurred. The proceedings are informal.<br/>
So much for the valuation problem. I cannot intervene in this, nor would it be right for me to do so. Parliament has provided an appeal system which will ensure that everyone is dealt with fairly and on the same basis.<br/>
The second part of the problem concerns the granting of domestic rate relief. All domestic ratepayers have their rate poundage reduced each year by a specified amount in the pound. This year the Government decided that in Wales domestic ratepayers would have their rates reduced by the very high figure of 36p in the pound. Perhaps our generosity here has made the hon. Member even more determined to pursue this matter.<br/>
Domestic rate relief is distributed by rating authorities under the terms of Sections 48 and 115 of the General Rate Act 1967. These provide, in effect, that the rating authority is to grant domestic relief in respect of any hereditament which is used wholly for the purposes of a private dwelling. Here I would emphasise that the decision to grant such relief is based on the actual use of the property. I must also emphasise that the decision lies with the rating authority. However, on the facts as presented to me by the hon. Member, I see no reason why the Aberconwy rating authority should not grant domestic rate relief for so long as the solely domestic use continues.<br/>
Why, then, does it not allow the relief? I understand that the council concerned has decided to allow such relief only on property described in the valuation list as a dwelling house. Therefore, if something is described as a boarding house or


shop, but is now used only for domestic purposes, it will not get relief. There is certainly no need for that approach and it does not appear to me to square with the governing legislation.<br/>
I understand that the rating authority adopts this practice because it believes that any relief that it pays in respect of property which has a commercial description on the valuation list will not be recouped through the domestic element of the rate support grant. That may be so; I would not dispute that the way the domestic element of the grant is calculated can lead to this result.<br/>
The calculation is based on the total rateable value of all property which is described as a dwelling house in the valuation list. But an addition is made to the sum so calculated to allow for any relief granted to partly domestic property called mixed hereditaments. This addition might in some areas be sufficient to cover relief both to the mixed hereditaments and to property such as we are now considering, and in other areas I accept that it will not do so. The grant cannot be so finely tuned as to be dealt with pound for pound.<br/>
If this is a problem I shall certainly ask my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State to consider whether any arrangement should be made to take account of relief in respect of property such as the boarding houses in question. The hon. Member's suggestions, and those from the association, will be included in my request to my right hon. and learned Friend. This, however, does not affect the issue of the liability of the rating authority to grant domestic rate relief on the basis laid down in the Act.<br/>
In our first attempts to deal with the problem we made inquiries which showed that no other authority in England or Wales was creating this sort of problem. We must therefore ask the Aberconwy rating authority to look again at its practice here and to consider whether it conforms to the criteria for entitlement to domestic relief in the provisions in the General Rate Act 1967 which I mentioned earlier. If it eventually comes to the conclusion that its current practice in this matter is not soundly based in law, it will, I know, hasten to put things right.<br/>
If, on the other hand, it comes to the opposite conclusion, it is not for me

or my right hon. and learned Friend to interpret the law in its application to the circumstances here. I could only advise, first, that the simplest way out of the difficulty is for the hon. Member's constituents to appeal to the local valuation court against the description of this property in the valuation list. If they succeed in getting it altered to dwelling house, all is well.<br/>
Otherwise, I am afraid that they can question the decision only in the courts, and I accept the reluctance with which that step would be taken. This might most conveniently be done by their paying only the domestic rate poundage on their property and then arguing the legality of the council's decision by way of defence against legal action for recovery by the rating authority, thus putting the onus on the other side. However, I hope that the issue will be resolved without the necessity for litigation of that kind.<br/>
Like the hon. Member, I have confined my remarks to the issue of the description of the property and the question of domestic relief. But he also mentioned rate rebates, and, as I am sure he realises, exactly the same point arises on these benefits. The entitlement depends on residence in a hereditament which is a dwelling house within exactly the same statutory definition. I agree that, if their other circumstances qualify them for a rebate, people who use a hereditament described as a boarding house wholly as a private dwelling appear to be entitled to a rate rebate, and they should press their local authority to grant them one. I can assure the hon. Member that if a rebate were granted in these circumstances, there would be no question whatever of the Government's not paying the 90 per cent. rate rebate grant on it.<br/>
To sum up; there are certain remedies available to the hon. Gentleman's constituents. I appreciate some of the difficulties because of their age and reluctance to take those courses of action. I hope that, after what I have said, the local rating authority will at least look again at its procedures.</p>
