<p>asked the Minister of Pensions whether, in view of the investigation into the household means test in connection with the unemployed, he will immediately institute an inquiry into the present system of granting pensions to dependants of men killed in the war, with a view to withdrawing the present test of pecuniary and financial need before a pension can be granted?</p>

<p>The present system of granting pensions to the dependants of men killed in the war, contained in the Royal Warrant of 1940, was accepted by the Government following the recommendations of my Statutory Advisory Committee who gave the subject exhaustive consideration. I see no grounds for any modification of the system.</p>

<p>A Royal Warrant of 1st November, 1920, made provision for increasing pensions for disablement due to war service prior to 4th August, 1914, to the Great War Warrant rates appropriate to the degree of disablement found. The latter rates were based on the cost of living figure obtaining in 1919 which is considerably in excess of that obtaining to-day. The hon. Member will therefore appreciate that there is at present no justification for a further increase.</p>

<p>It is not possible to give a categorical answer. Some such cases have been accepted, but the question whether the death of a serving soldier who is shot by a sentry can be regarded as attributable to Service must be determined in the light of all the circumstances of the case. If the hon. Member has a particular case in view and wishes to communicate with me on it, I shall be glad to consider it.</p>

<p>asked the Minister of Pensions why numbers of soldiers' wives and families, in receipt of allowances from the War Grants Advisory Committee, have been instructed to send in their pay-books and that grants made have been withdrawn; whether any change in policy has been adopted in consequence of the increase in pay to serving soldiers, and will he indicate what the changes are?</p>

<p>Instructions have been given that the recent increase of pay granted to serving soldiers is always to be disregarded in assessing war service grants. There are, however, frequent changes in other directions in the financial circumstances of families; and in so far as these diminish or remove the hardship on which a grant was based the grant must necessarily be adjusted.</p>

<p>I have made inquiries about the supply of equipment in the area to which the hon. Member refers. The full authorised issue of equipment has been made to the borough of which it forms part: but since the recruitment of part-time wardens exceeds the authorised establishment it is not possible to make an individual issue to the whole of the personnel, though the shortage in this particular area is not great. Further supplies of equipment will be made as soon as they are available.</p>

One must always keep in mind the fact that, unsightly as d&#x00E9;bris is, there are many other things to do in the way of repairs to street damage&#x2014;gas mains, water mains&#x2014;and to people's homes.

<p>As I intimated in reply to a Question by the hon. and learned Member for North Hammersmith (Mr. Pritt) on 17th instant, prison buildings of the cellular type are in themselves exceptionally strong and appear to afford a high degree of protection against blast and against fire risk. To attempt to move large numbers of prisoners from their cells to other accommodation during an air raid, more particularly at night, might well expose them to additional risk; and the provision and use of special shelters has therefore been limited to particular establishments where individual buildings are below the normal standard of constructional strength.</p>

<p>Will the Minister bear in mind that some prisoners have, I think, been killed? They were in the top storeys of a prison.

<p>asked the Home Secretary whether, under the new merger scheme of the London Fire Brigade and the Auxiliary Fire Service, a regular fireman and an auxiliary, injured on duty, will now both be treated on the same scale, or whether the auxiliary fireman will still have to apply to the public assistance authorities after the first fortnight; and whether he is aware of the feeling of grievance at the latter arrangement?</p>

<p>The scheme in question provides for a new basis of payment of full-time Auxiliary Fire Service officers. These officers, in common with other members of the Auxiliary Fire Service, will remain eligible for the grant of injury allowances and pensions provided for in the Personal Injuries (Civilians) Scheme. As regards the suggestion that auxiliary firemen will have to apply to the public assistance authorities, I should like to make it clear that there is no question of any auxiliary fireman having to apply for public assistance. Under the Personal Injuries (Civilians) Scheme, application is made for temporary injury allowances, covering incapacity for work following an injury, to a local office of the Assistance Board, who, in this matter, act as agents of the Ministry of Pensions.</p>

<p>The allotment of billets for military personnel is a matter for the police.

<p>I will, with permission, now make the promised statement about the functions of the Ministry of Works and Buildings.<br/>
The Ministry of Works and Buildings will be responsible for the erection of all new civil works and buildings required by any other Government Department. It will take over to begin with the whole


organisation of His Majesty's Office of Works, including their present responsibilities for the erection of buildings for other Civil Departments and for Service Departments, and the work of the Ministry of Supply, including the new buildings section of the Ordnance Factories and the approval of plans of new private factories or extensions of existing private factories, to the cost of which the Ministry of Supply is contributing.<br/>
Highly specialised work at present carried out by the Service Departments, either by direct labour or through contractors (such as the civil engineering works of the Admiralty; the construction of aerodromes or aerodrome buildings; fortification and defence works); and work overseas will remain with the Service Departments.<br/>
The responsibility for maintenance and repairs of buildings and equipment in use by the Service Department or the Ministry of Supply will remain with those Departments, except in so far as a transfer to the Ministry of Works and Buildings may be mutually agreed to be convenient.<br/>
The Ministry of Works and Buildings will be responsible for the licensing of private building, and for determining the priority of proposals for rebuilding buildings damaged by air raids.<br/>
The Ministry of Works and Buildings may arrange, by agreement with the Service Departments or the Ministry of Aircraft Production, to erect on their behalf new works and buildings not of a highly specialised character, such as stores or depots or houses and buildings of an architectural nature, and for the supervision of contracts for the erection of new private factories or the extension of existing private factories required for war production.<br/>
The Production Council will lay down the general order of priority of building work. The Minister will be a member of the Production Council and responsible for the Works and Buildings Priority Committee. He will determine the application of the directions of the Production Council to the priority of particular buildings, subject to appeal, if necessary, to the Council.<br/>
The Minister will be empowered to call on all Departments retaining responsibility for the erection and maintenance of build-

ings and works of construction (including Departments concerned with work carried out by or on behalf of local authorities or public utility undertakings) to furnish from time to time such information as he may require as to the present and prospective demands of themselves and their contractors for labour and materials, and any points ancillary thereto.<br/>
The Minister will be responsible for such control or central purchase of building materials not at present controlled as may be necessary.<br/>
The Minister will take steps to institute research into such questions as the adoption of substitutes for building materials which are in short supply, or the modification of designs and specifications with a view to expedition, and to ensure that the results of past and future research are promptly communicated to all concerned. For this purpose he will make full use of the Building Research organisation of D.S.I.R. He will be empowered to call on Departments retaining responsibility for building to satisfy him that they are making full use of the results of research in this connection.<br/>
It is clear that the reconstruction of town and country after the war raises great problems and gives a great opportunity. The Minister of Works and Buildings has, therefore, been charged by the Government with the responsibility of consulting the Departments and organisations concerned with a view to reporting to the Cabinet the appropriate methods and machinery for dealing with the issues involved.</p>

<p>Will not this division of functions to which my right hon. Friend has referred lead to considerable overlapping? Would it not be desirable to effect rather more co-ordination in respect of planning for building purposes? If we are to wait until the end of the war for a report by the First Commissioner of Works on the buildings required to provide millions of our population with habitations, what is to be done now for the people who require accommodation? Is there to be any planning undertaken for the civilian population during the war?</p>
