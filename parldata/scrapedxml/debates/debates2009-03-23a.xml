	<p pid="a.1.6/1">I thank my hon. Friend for that reply. It is clear that children who live with drug-addicted parents face a specific set of risks, including emotional or physical neglect and abuse, and ingesting the drugs or substitute drugs that their parents take. After Lord Laming's report, which was published on <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-12">12 March</phrase> and detailed what went wrong after the death of baby P, what further steps will my hon. Friend take to ensure that the best practice that exists in some places becomes standard practice across the country?</p>

	<p pid="a.1.7/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that question, because it raises an important issue. The first family intervention programmes targeting substance misuse are under way, and they are particularly important for chaotic families whose lives are affected by substance misuse. They help misusing parents to improve their parenting skills, and also offer protection to their children. We hope that up to 20,000 families will be able to access this support.</p>

	<p pid="a.1.8/1">Given the Government's treatment of Professor David Nutt, the independent adviser whom the Government appointed, in haranguing him after he had published an academic paper in his own right as an academic, do the Government fear that they will no longer be able to get good quality, independent advice on their drugs policy because scientists will be fearful of getting a morning call from the Home Secretary demanding that they apologise for disagreeing with her?</p>

	<p pid="a.1.9/1">The simple answer to that is no. The hon. Gentleman will be aware that we take the advice of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs very seriously. We agreed with much of its advice on cannabis and on ecstasy, but we have to take a judgment based on a wider picture, including the harm that drugs do. It is up to the advisers to advise, but it is up to the Government to take the decisions.</p>

	<p pid="a.1.10/1">We welcome what the Government have done and their proposals for the future, but does the Minister not agree that we also have to deal with the dealers? We need a hard-line policy to extend the amount of time that they spend in prison. Previously, people who ended up on drugs and went to prison could voluntarily go and get cleaned up, but that has now been taken away. What can we do to ensure that people who are on drugs get the support that they need, and that, more importantly, we take a hard line against the dealers?</p>

	<p pid="a.3.0/1">I agree entirely with my hon. Friend that enforcement is a key part of the Government's drugs strategy, but it is also important that we do not have a revolving door policy in relation to drug misusers and prison. That is why we must ensure that misusers have appropriate treatments before they get caught up in prison, as well during any time spent in prison, and that there is a seamless transition on coming back out into the community.</p>

	<p pid="a.3.2/1">I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman's support, and I should like to pay tribute to the work that he has been doing on this issue. He will be aware that the chemical to which he refers is widely used in industry, and we are looking at how alternatives can be provided to allow legitimate practices in industry to continue. He should be under no illusion, however; we do intend to take the action that he is calling for.</p>

	<p pid="a.3.4/1">We made no secret of the fact that the UK Government were disappointed by the political declaration that came out of the long deliberations, and also the conference itself. We did not support views on difficulties concerning use of the term &quot;harm reduction&quot; in the declaration. It is inconsistent to refer to millennium goals that talk about tackling HIV and AIDS, but to do and say nothing about clean needles. We signed up to the declaration reluctantly, but we will continue the process to ensure that harm reduction gets a fair hearing.</p>

	<p pid="a.3.6/1">I am not sure that we would agree with the hon. Gentleman's figures, but let me tell him something about cocaine. There is no evidence that its use has risen in recent years. Its wholesale price is rising, as are seizures of the drug, and the purity of cocaine on the streets is falling. Taken together, those factors suggest that the action that we are taking on cocaine has been successful.</p>

	<p pid="a.4.0/1">The British crime survey is the best guide to trends in violent crime. The latest figures, for the BCS year ending September 2008, showed that 2.2 million incidents were experienced by adults in England and Wales. Since 1997, violent crime is down by 40 per cent., which is equivalent to 1.5 million fewer incidents.</p>

	<p pid="a.4.1/1">I am grateful to the Minister for that answer. He will know that many of our constituents are concerned about knife crime, given that the number of people being stabbed to death is at a record high. My constituent Mr. Roger Lambert, of Lydney, watched the BBC 1 programme &quot;Stabbed: The Truth about Knife Crime&quot;, and contacted me about the matter. He is so concerned about what happens to those who go out with a knife and take someone's life that he wants&mdash;I said to him that I did not agree&mdash;the Government to consider bringing back the death penalty to deal with the problem. What can the Minister say to make Mr. Lambert comfortable about safety on our streets and the risk of being stabbed to death by a knife?</p>
</speech>

	<p pid="a.4.2/1">What I cannot say to the hon. Gentleman's constituent is that I am in favour of the death penalty or that it will be brought back, but I can tell him and other people throughout the country what we are doing to tackle knife crime issues, which are very particular in some parts of our communities. The hon. Gentleman could mention to his constituent that people found in possession of a knife are now far more likely to be charged, and on being charged they are far more likely to be imprisoned. That applies to possession offences, of course, but if somebody is caught using a knife, they can expect much stricter penalties. The hon. Gentleman could also use some of the latest statistics, which were published on <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-04">4 March</phrase>. The Department of Health figures show that among those aged 13 to 19, there were 31 per cent. fewer admissions to NHS hospitals for stab wounds in the nine English TKAP&mdash;tackling knives action programme&mdash;regions from June to November 2008, compared with the same period in the previous year. That compares with an 18 per cent. reduction in non-TKAP areas over the same period, and it is extremely encouraging, although there is clearly much more to be done.</p>

	<p pid="a.4.3/1">The Minister will be aware that almost half the victims of violent crime have stated that their perpetrators were under the influence of alcohol. Why have the Government not accepted in full the very sensible proposals of Sir Liam Donaldson to try to put a floor price on alcohol? Does he not accept that it is the cheapness of alcohol that has caused the binge drinking culture in our Committee&mdash;<i> [Laughter]</i>&mdash;in our city centres. Will he look carefully at these proposals and reconsider the Government's approach?</p>

	<p pid="a.4.4/1">I must admit, Mr. Speaker, that I have never noticed binge drinking in the Home Affairs Select Committee, particularly as I often attend it at half-past 10 in the morning. Seriously, however, my right hon. Friend raises a serious point. The Government's view is that the matter is of serious concern, but we do not believe that the introduction of a minimum floor price is the right way forward at this time. We do believe that the establishment of a mandatory code for alcohol, which will tackle some of the irresponsible promotions in our streets and city centres&mdash;the likes of happy hours and &quot;Drink as much you can&quot; offers&mdash;is one of the steps that we need to take if we are to tackle the binge drinking culture. We should also remind everybody that binge drinking is not acceptable and that using the influence of drink as an excuse for doing something is unacceptable to all hon. Members and indeed to the vast majority of people who drink responsibly.</p>

	<p pid="a.5.0/1">Sadly, my student intern was mugged in Hemel Hempstead on Sunday. She is a very outgoing and gregarious young lady who is now very frightened about going back into the town centre. The town centre is covered by CCTV cameras, but she is worried, quite rightly, that the person who mugged her was not concerned about those cameras or about the punishment&mdash;he just wanted to get her money. What are we going to do about that?</p>

	<p pid="a.5.1/1">I am sorry about the horrific incident that happened to the hon. Gentleman's intern. Such an incident would trouble us all and I am sure it is of great worry to her. The fact that the CCTV is there, however, will hopefully provide evidence, which can be used. One of the best deterrents for people who conduct such awful crime is the knowledge that they will be caught, put before the courts and&mdash;obviously, the evidence is needed&mdash;given the sentence that they deserve. For the sort of attack that the hon. Gentleman has described, the sentence should be a severe one.</p>

	<p pid="a.5.2/1">Will my hon. Friend consider the issues surrounding incitement to violence? As he will be aware, many of my constituents and people across the UK were extremely angry at the attack made on our troops in Luton last week by a small al-Muhajiroun-related group with a history of attempting to incite violence and racial division in our town. Will he review the specific circumstances of what happened so that such an incident never happens to our troops again?</p>

	<p pid="a.5.3/1">It is fair to say that we were all appalled by the incident in Luton to which my hon. Friend refers. In many instances, incitement to hatred is against the law, and one would expect the incident to be investigated and prosecuted.

It should not, and must not, happen, and those who break the law should be prosecuted.</p>

In addition, there were a further 15,420 detections resulting from the original case involving the DNA match. Those occur when, for example, a suspect, on being presented with DNA evidence linking him to one offence, confesses to further offences.</p>

	<p pid="a.8.3/1">My hon. Friend is absolutely right. The case of Mr. Hodgson last week demonstrates how the DNA database and the use of DNA can prove people innocent after a period of time, and also how it can ensure both that innocent people are removed from an investigation at an early stage so that they receive justice, and that important police resources are not used up on false investigations or investigations that will not come to a conclusion. Those hon. Members&mdash;they are largely on the Opposition Benches&mdash;who throw up their hands in outrage at the idea of the DNA database need to have a sensible answer as to how we will make up for the difference made each month when more than 3,000 matches on the database provide the police with the ability to investigate and bring to justice criminals, including some who are convicted of the most serious offences in this country. Opposition Members may for political reasons want to throw that opportunity away, but I do not think the British people want to see that protection done away with.</p>

In that way, it is very different from having a police record. I think people are sometimes unclear about that distinction. My hon. Friend makes an important point about the blanket approach taken to retention. That is why in the consultation and proposals we will bring forward, we will look at a system of stepping down individuals over time in terms of the retention of their profile, and a differentiated approach, possibly based on age, risk or the nature of the offence involved.</p>

Our objections to that are first that it is unfair to those who are here legally and are contributing, and secondly that we fear it would act as a further pull factor for even more attempts at illegal immigration.</p>

What steps have the Government taken since to follow up the recommendations of that report, which recognised the severe concerns of places such as the London borough of Southwark, where a large number of child welfare issues relating to this issue are starting to manifest themselves? What may appear culturally okay to some communities is certainly not okay when it is causing serious child welfare problems in this country.</p>

The evidence from Pentameter 2 was that they can be found in any area of the country, urban or rural. The hon. Gentleman says that only one police officer in his local force has been trained, but he might be referring to the single point of contact. Every police force in the country has a single point of contact, but numerous police officers receive training in human trafficking. For example, every police officer in the country has been sent a DVD produced by UKHTC to raise awareness of the issue. Training in human trafficking is given in the initial police learning and development programme, the special constable initial programme and the PCSO programme. That will be fully in place by the end of this month, and by the end of the year it will be extended to initial training for detectives, domestic violence training, public protection officer training, road policing training and the National Policing Improvement Agency trafficking and senior investigating officer training. That will all be overseen by the UKHTC, and plenty of work is being done to ensure that police officers are aware of that horrible crime, should they come across it.</p>

We asked the Migration Advisory Committee, which determines which occupations are shortage occupations, to review the list. It will shortly report to us again on its current assessment of which occupations have shortages. Secondly, we have been clear that if an occupation is in shortage, it does not mean that the only approach should be for us to fill the shortage by bringing in migrant labour. That is why, working with my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Innovation, Universities and Skills, we have already determined that we will use the publication of the shortage occupation list every six months to trigger skills reviews for the jobs listed under those shortage occupations. We will focus on upskilling workers in the UK, making the UK less dependent, even for filling shortages, on migration in the future.</p>

	<p pid="a.14.4/1">This is a good opportunity for the Home Secretary to be honest about the points-based system. She tends to refer to it as the &quot;Australian-style&quot; points-based system, because we all admire the way in which the Australians deal with immigration. Did she notice that last week, the Australians, who put an annual limit on work permits, reduced that limit? They said that it was prudent to do so in a recession. Will she admit that a Conservative Government could follow that policy, because we will introduce an annual limit, but that she cannot? Will she therefore stop trying to fool people into thinking that we have an Australian-style system? Only under a Conservative Government will we have Australian-style control over immigration numbers.</p>

	<p pid="a.15.0/1">On the contrary, I have already announced&mdash;I reiterated this today&mdash;that we have the ability, through the points-based system, to raise the bar. We will do that. The impact of that, alongside the economic circumstances that we face, will be fewer migrants coming to the UK from outside the EEA. We will successfully reduce the number of migrants coming in during these difficult economic times. If we are talking about honesty, as the hon. Gentleman favours a cap, although I do not know what sort of a cap it is&mdash;a UK Tory cap&mdash;perhaps he would like to give us some background. Perhaps he could say how many people he thinks the cap should cover, what its level should be, and how it could be made more effective, given that it would cover only one in four migrants to this country, whereas the points-based system covers half of them.</p>

	<p pid="a.15.3/1">We are on track to introduce identity cards this autumn, and we have already started to issue ID cards for foreign nationals. Next month, we plan to award two contracts for the national identity scheme: one to upgrade our passport application systems, and one for the biometric database to deliver the next generation of passports and ID cards. Later this year, we will award the ID contract itself. As is normal, the contracts have been written to protect the public purse, with standard clauses on what would happen in the event of termination. Cancellation of the ID cards contract, and partial termination of the application and database contracts, would cost about &pound;40 million in the early years. Therefore, as I have made clear on many occasions, scrapping ID cards and the identity database will not free up a large fund of money to spend on other priorities.</p>

Obviously, I know Nottingham well, as that is where my constituency is. I congratulate my hon. Friend on the work that he has done with One Nottingham, and Alan Given and everyone else on their work running it. Crime has dropped significantly in Nottingham as a result of the work that my hon. Friend and others associated with One Nottingham have done. One of the most important things to which my hon. Friend draws attention and to which One Nottingham has drawn attention, is that not only is enforcing the law important, but that if we are to bring about change over time, the early intervention that my hon. Friend has pioneered and passionately argued for time and again is crucial. Breaking the cycle of crime and deprivation is surely one of the great social challenges that we all face.</p>

The Home Office has funded nine regional co-ordinators across the country, based in each police region. It will be their responsibility to ensure that we recruit not only more specials but more employers to the cause, so that they release people to become specials in their communities. As the hon. Gentleman will know, the commitment is to pay those employees at their normal wage for at least two days a month, so that they can conduct special policing. I should also say that the Home Office has also taken part in the scheme; 12 Home Office staff work as special constables. I hope that that answers the hon. Gentleman's question.</p>

	<p pid="a.21.1/2">In October and November, all European and then G20 countries agreed to recapitalise the banks. In November, both the European Union and the G20 agreed on co-ordinated fiscal action to support employment and growth. Just as in the previous summit in December, Europe led the way towards a global climate change deal, which we hope to secure in Copenhagen later this year. Europe has now made proposals in advance of the G20 meeting in London to reshape the global financial and trading system and to do what is necessary to build economic recovery across the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.1/3">First, we agreed that the global challenges we face today cannot be met if nations turn inwards to a protectionism that&mdash;history tells us&mdash;in the end protects no one. Our agreement to</p>
	<p pid="a.21.1/4" class="indent">&quot;avoid all forms of protectionist measures&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.21.1/5">will require careful monitoring by the World Trade Organisation. The Council agreed to encourage international trade by facilitating more trade credits, and the Council called for a</p>
	<p pid="a.21.1/6" class="indent">&quot;swift conclusion of bilateral trade negotiations and of the...Doha Development Agenda.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.21.1/7">Secondly, we agreed measures to put to the G20 for global agreements to reshape the regulation of banks and financial services. We agreed that all systemically important institutions should be subject to appropriate regulation and oversight, and that this would extend to include hedge funds and the shadow banking sector. We pledged to protect the world's financial system from non-transparent, non-co-operative and loosely regulated jurisdictions, including offshore centres and tax havens. We welcome the progress that has already been made by Switzerland, Austria, Andorra, Lichtenstein and other countries, and look forward to seeing them implement the international standard&mdash;<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i></p>

	<p pid="a.21.2/1">Order. The way we do things is that we hear the statement that the Prime Minister has to make, and then questions are asked of him.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2009-03-23a.21.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1997" speakername="Gordon Brown" colnum="21"  time="015:32:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090323/debtext/90323-0003.htm#0903235001102">
	<p pid="a.21.3/1">We call on all those countries yet to endorse the OECD standard to do so urgently.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.3/2">The Council also agreed to improve supervisory co-operation by pushing forward with colleges of supervisors for all major cross-border financial institutions. We also agreed to adopt international principles on remuneration in the financial sector, based on an approach that rewards long-term success rather than excessive risk-taking. We called on the Council and the European Parliament</p>
	<p pid="a.21.3/3" class="indent">&quot;to rapidly reach agreement on the legislative acts relating to credit rating agencies, the solvency of insurance companies, the capital requirements for banks, and cross-border payments and electronic money&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.3/4">At its next meeting in June, the Council will take its first decisions on regulation and supervision following the de Larosi&egrave;re report. Our policy is that regulatory rules should be set at an international level but that direct supervision is a matter for our national authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.3/5">The Council was clear that by acting together, the European Union can</p>
	<p pid="a.21.3/6" class="indent">&quot;put its financial sector on a sound footing, get credit flowing to the real economy and protect its citizens from the worst impacts of the crisis&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.21.3/7">as well as helping to build a stronger economy for the future. The Council welcomed the Commission's proposal to double, to &euro;50 billion, balance of payments assistance so that those within the European Union have the support they need to deliver the fiscal stimulus required to ensure their recovery. But with global capital flows in 2008 down by more than 80 per cent. compared with 2007, and with the financing gap for emerging economies this year up to $800 billion, this is not just an issue for central European, eastern European and emerging economies. Because of the continuing risk of contagion, it is an issue for every country in the world. It is vital that we increase the resources available to the International Monetary Fund to ensure that it can intervene to stabilise economies, stop the crisis spreading, and return the global economy to growth.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.3/8">The Council called for a very substantial increase in resources available to the IMF, and agreed that, for their contribution to this increase, EU member states should as a first step provide on a voluntary basis a fast temporary support of IMF lending capacity in the form of a loan of over $100 billion. The Council called for continued</p>
	<p pid="a.21.3/9" class="indent">&quot;international coordination of fiscal stimulus measures.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.21.3/10">It agreed that:</p>
	<p pid="a.21.3/11" class="indent">&quot;Good progress has been made in implementing the...Economic Recovery Plan&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.21.3/12">and that while we must ensure fiscal sustainability in the medium term,</p>
	<p pid="a.21.3/13" class="indent">&quot;the size of the fiscal effort (around 3.3 per cent. of EU GDP or over &euro;400 billion) will generate new investments, boost demand, create jobs and help the EU move to a low-carbon economy.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.21.3/14">We agreed a further &euro;5 billion to be invested in stimulus projects in energy security, renewable energy and broadband. The agreement provides for at least &euro;220 million of additional investment in UK carbon capture and storage and offshore wind projects.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.3/15">We have seen an unprecedented fiscal injection in almost every major economy: in France, a package worth &euro;26 billion with further recent measures worth &euro;2.6 billion; in Spain, an infrastructure package worth &euro;11 billion alongside other measures, with the IMF estimating a total stimulus of 2.3 per cent. of GDP; and in Germany, not one but two fiscal stimulus packages totalling &euro;82 billion&mdash;1.5 per cent. of its GDP this year and 2 per cent. of GDP in 2010. As the Council concluded, Europe's determination is</p>
	<p pid="a.21.3/16" class="indent">&quot;to do what is necessary to restore jobs and growth.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.21.3/17">The Council also reached important conclusions on energy security and climate change, on the eastern partnership and the relationship with the United States. The Council remains committed to working for a worldwide and comprehensive climate change agreement in Copenhagen. Following the December council, Europe became the first continent in history to make legally binding the detailed policies required to set itself on a path to a low-carbon economy. There is a commitment to a 30 per cent. reduction in emissions, provided that other countries make comparable commitments according to their capabilities. But our success in Copenhagen will depend on unlocking negotiations with developing countries. The Council therefore agreed that within the framework of a future comprehensive climate agreement, the European Union will take on its fair share of financing for green technologies, reducing deforestation and protecting the poorest from the impacts of climate change.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.3/18">The global economic downturn is no time to walk away from our commitments to the developing world. The Council agreed that Europe should continue to play a leading role in supporting developing countries in order to avoid jeopardising the progress achieved in recent years and undermining their economic and political stability. The Council agreed that commitments to increase development assistance and to deliver on the millennium development goals must be honoured. The Council also emphasised the importance of promoting stability, good governance and economic development in the eastern neighbourhood.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.3/19">Finally, in looking ahead to the informal EU-US summit to be held in Prague next month, the Council welcomed the inauguration of President Obama and reaffirmed the strategic importance of transatlantic relations. At this moment of international economic crisis, we are showing that Europe and the world can work together to achieve co-ordinated interest rate cuts, substantial fiscal stimulus, banking reform, new rules for tax havens and new rules for remuneration. I commend this statement to the House.</p>

	<p pid="a.23.0/1">Before asking the Prime Minister about his statement today, may I ask him about reporting back to the House on the outcome of next week's G20? Given that it is taking place on the day when the House rises, will he consider a statement that evening?</p>
	<p pid="a.23.0/2">Before turning to the economy, I welcome what the Prime Minister says in the communiqu&eacute; about the climate change agreement in Copenhagen. I also agree with what he says about the importance of not walking away from developing countries at this time.</p>
	<p pid="a.23.0/3">On the economy, I want to ask about trade, financial reform and the recession in Europe. First, on trade, this communiqu&eacute; talks about the importance of the Doha round, but frankly, so did the last one and the one before that. Since then we have seen &quot;Buy America&quot; programmes from the US Congress, higher agricultural tariffs in India, French Ministers boasting of repatriating jobs from Slovenia back to France and the Prime Minister talking about &quot;British jobs for British workers&quot;. The task of the London summit should be urgently to agree the key issues of the Doha round. That should be the key aim. Will the Prime Minister confirm that the existing trade rules in fact allow countries to double their revenues from tariffs? Is freezing existing tariffs not a pretty minimum acceptable outcome for the London summit?</p>
	<p pid="a.23.0/4">Secondly, on financial rules and financial reform, we need rules that force banks to hold more capital when the economy is strong. We have been pressing for such counter-cyclical capital requirements for more than a year now. Will this communiqu&eacute; mean that that actually happens, and do we not need the same sense of urgency when it comes to the supervisory colleges of regulators? The Prime Minister's office announced that they would be established by the summer, but the communiqu&eacute; is now talking about it happening by the end of 2009. Can the Prime Minister tell us whether the deadline has slipped?</p>
	<p pid="a.23.0/5">I agree with the Prime Minister that it is better to have co-ordination than a single European regulator that overrides national regulation, but would it not be easier to resist such a European regulator if he would accept that the tripartite system that he put in place in 1997 simply has not worked and needs reform? Does he not need to admit that clearly and frankly today?</p>
	<p pid="a.23.0/6">Next, on recession in Europe, the Prime Minister repeatedly lectures everyone in this House and beyond that he is uniquely forging a consensus in Europe on how to deal with recession. Does not that claim now look completely ridiculous? Are there not three examples of that? The first is whether we in Britain can afford a fiscal stimulus, the second what that stimulus should consist of, and the third whether he is any good at actually implementing the measures that he has announced. Let me take each in turn.</p>

	<p pid="a.24.1/1">There will be a question if you are patient.</p>
	<p pid="a.24.1/2">Is it not remarkable&mdash;that is a question&mdash;that today the CBI, which is the organisation responsible for representing businesses large and small, said&mdash;<i> [Interruption.] </i>Labour Members should perhaps spend a bit less time filling out their expenses and listen to the CBI. The CBI said that</p>
	<p pid="a.24.1/3" class="indent">&quot;a further significant fiscal stimulus is unaffordable and would lead to businesses and households retrenching&quot;.</p>

	<p pid="a.24.2/1">Order. Mr. Austin, for a few months you have been quiet, and now you have begun to shout again. You just cannot do that. I keep telling you that you cannot do it.

	<p pid="a.24.3/1">Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I thought the hon. Gentleman was getting better, too, but I am an optimist.</p>
	<p pid="a.24.3/2">The CBI says that the Chancellor</p>
	<p pid="a.24.3/3" class="indent">&quot;needs to... deliver a clear and credible plan for restoring the public finances to health&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.24.3/4">Is not the CBI right and the Prime Minister wrong?</p>
	<p pid="a.24.3/5">Last week, we had the worst set of public finance figures in our peacetime history. We are forecast to have the largest budget deficit of any G20 economy next year&mdash;almost twice as large as for the G20 as a whole. Is the view in Europe not clear? As the German Chancellor says:</p>
	<p pid="a.24.3/6" class="indent">&quot;We should not be competing for the most unrealistic fiscal stimulus&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.24.3/7">Is she not right?</p>
	<p pid="a.24.3/8">Let me put it another way. This week, the Prime Minister goes to south America. Will he confirm that only one country in the whole of south America entered recession with a higher deficit than Britain&mdash;not Argentina, not Paraguay, not Uruguay and not Ecuador, which all managed to balance the books better than the Prime Minister? Is it not something when the British Prime Minister has to go to a conference in Latin America to get a lecture on fiscal responsibility and prudence?</p>
	<p pid="a.24.3/9">The Prime Minister is criticised in Europe for not only affordability, but the make-up of his stimulus. No one else is copying his policy of cutting VAT. Indeed, the consensus in Europe is that it made things worse. The French President said:</p>
	<p pid="a.24.3/10" class="indent">&quot;We won't be repeating Gordon Brown's mistakes&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.24.3/11">and that the VAT cut had &quot;absolutely not worked&quot;. The German Finance Minister said that the debt will take a generation to pay off.</p>
	<p pid="a.24.3/12">The Prime Minister is not only wrong about affordability and VAT; everyone thinks that he is getting implementation wrong, too. Can he not see that, when his various schemes exist only in a press release, they do not help build confidence and instead destroy it? The home owners mortgage support scheme and the recruitment subsidies for the unemployed were announced months ago, but are still not available. Should he not listen to the German Chancellor, who said that</p>
	<p pid="a.24.3/13" class="indent">&quot;if we want to make a real impact, you really must implement the package first before you talk about the next step&quot;?</p>
	<p pid="a.24.3/14">Instead of listening to his lectures, we should all be clear about what the Prime Minister is delivering&mdash;a longer recession than the United States or the eurozone, the fastest rise in unemployment since records began and the worst public sector deficit in British peacetime history. When will the Prime Minister understand the need for change? Should that change not start with his acknowledging properly and apologising for the mistakes that have led this country to that position? Is it not time to start now, with &quot;Sorry&quot;?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2009-03-23a.25.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1997" speakername="Gordon Brown" colnum="25"  time="015:32:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090323/debtext/90323-0004.htm#0903235001108">
	<p pid="a.25.0/1">I will deal with each point in turn, but is the central point not that, in the face of a global recession, unemployment and a loss of output, alone in Europe and alone in the rest of the world, isolated even from the Conservative party in Europe, the Conservatives' only response to the recession is to cut public services and public spending, except for the &pound;200,000 that 3,000 people will get in inheritance tax?</p>
	<p pid="a.25.0/2">Our priorities are to raise the pension for everyone, which we are doing; to raise child benefit for everyone, which we have done; and to ensure a VAT cut for everyone. The Conservative party's policy is a &pound;2 billion tax cut for the smallest number of people in Britain&mdash;the 3,000 people who will benefit from an inheritance tax cut. Is it not time for the Conservatives to face up to the fact that their policy is a 6p a week cut in the licence fee for the many and a &pound;200,000 cut in inheritance tax for the few? Usually in times of difficulty, the few who have money help the many; only the Conservative party says that, in times of difficulty, the many should come to the aid of the few. <i> [Interruption.] </i>What am I on about? I am on about the Conservative policy, which Conservative Members say is a priority. At a time of crisis, they say that there is nothing for pensions, nothing for child benefit, nothing for public services except cuts, but tell us today that they are going ahead with an inheritance tax cut, which will help 3,000 people and give them &pound;200,000 each. At least the shadow shadow Chancellor spotted that that was a difficulty, but he is not here because he is so out of synch with the Conservative party. He disagrees on VAT, the married couple's allowance, Europe, and now the inheritance tax cut. The Conservative party is out of touch with the rest of the country. <i> [Interruption.] </i>They will have to face up to that one day&mdash;their priority is an inheritance tax cut for the few, whereas ours is to help the many.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.0/3">As to trade&mdash;[Hon. Members: &quot;Hooray.&quot;] I know that the Conservatives are grateful that we have moved off what I will be coming back to in a minute. As to trade, we are working with the developing countries to see whether we can get a trade deal, but I have to tell the right hon. Gentleman that the problem is not Britain or Europe. The problem on the trade deal&mdash;as he would see, if the Conservatives were serious about it and if they wanted to face up to it&mdash;is that we have to get an agreement between America and India on very difficult and sensitive negotiations, which we are trying to move forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.0/4">As for the colleges of supervisors, which the right hon. Gentleman mentioned, I have to tell him that instead of none having been established, as he said, 25 colleges of supervisors have been established to cover the financial institutions right across the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.0/5">As far as delivery of policies is concerned, the right hon. Gentleman might want to notice that 90,000 companies are already benefiting from the schemes that we have put in place. He might want to know also that large numbers of people are benefiting from the greater support that we are giving in income support to those who are unemployed and who need help with their mortgages. None of those policies is supported by the Conservative party.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.0/6">As for the right hon. Gentleman's quotations of Chancellor Merkel, President Sarkozy and other European leaders, is it not remarkable that he is trying to quote them in evidence the week after he walked away from the European People's party and linked up with the Czech forum, which says that there is no problem with climate change, and the Polish party of law and order&mdash;<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> I have to say to the Conservatives that they are isolated from the German Christian Democrats, that they are isolated from the French Conservative party of President Sarkozy and that they are now isolated from the party of Mr. Berlusconi in Italy. The Conservatives are out of touch with the European mainstream&mdash;so much so that the President of the Commission has criticised them, as has the President of the Parliament, and the chambers of commerce have said that it is a matter of regret that they are moving to the fringes in this country.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.0/7">As for the delivery of policies, let me be absolutely clear that in every area in which we are working, we are trying to move forward, but that requires money. The only party that is refusing to support a fiscal stimulus is the Conservative party. It is the Conservatives who are out of step with Europe; it is they who are out of touch with public opinion; and it is they who are out of their depth when it comes to dealing with the economy.</p>

	<p pid="a.27.0/1">I thank the Prime Minister for his statement, in which there is much to welcome. The principle of a common European framework of regulation in financial services is a significant step forward, and one that we have been advocating for many years. There will continue to be differences in detail&mdash;he alluded to them himself&mdash;but the principle of cross-border regulation of cross-border finance will be welcomed by all but the most small-minded Eurosceptics. The eastern partnership with countries such as Georgia and Ukraine is also welcome, not least because of Russia's sometimes belligerent attitude towards its neighbours.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.0/2">I remember in years gone by that the whole of Europe would groan every time the Prime Minister made another tub-thumping speech about how superior his policies were to everybody else's, so it is good that the idea finally appears to have dawned on him that he does not have all the answers and that he might even have a thing or two to learn from our European Union neighbours. Is the problem not now that, even with a touch of new-found humility, it is hard for him to lead at the G20 summit and in the European Union, because he does not practise at home what he preaches to them abroad? Would his rhetoric about stopping protectionism not pack more of a punch if he had not indulged in populist rhetoric about &quot;British jobs for British workers&quot;? Would his words about cracking down on tax havens not be more compelling if he had not presided for 12 years over industrial scale tax avoidance by British banks and big businesses here in Britain?</p>
	<p pid="a.27.0/3">When the Prime Minister tries to act as President Obama's agent in Europe and persuade his European counterparts to issue another fiscal stimulus, would those leaders not listen to him more if he had not blown &pound;12.5 billion on his wasteful VAT cut? Would those leaders not be more likely to listen to his recommendation that economic recovery must be driven by green investment if he was actually making those investments at home, rather than talking&mdash;as he did the other week&mdash;about 400,000 fantasy green jobs, which he has no idea how to create? If he had used the VAT money, as we proposed, to invest in public transport and in a transformation of our housing stock, he could have created 100,000 new jobs starting right now.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.0/4">It is becoming increasingly clear that it will be difficult for Britain to afford a sustained, major new fiscal stimulus to boost our economy. Is it not therefore clear that we must take drastic action to ensure that we stop wasting any more money on things that do not create jobs? Will the Prime Minister commit immediately to cancelling the VAT cut and investing what money there is left in green transport, in the insulation of our homes, schools and hospitals, and in jobs? Did he not wonder, as he looked round the table at the other EU leaders at the summit, why not one of them had copied his cut in sales tax? Will he admit that they were right to choose to invest money in jobs instead?</p>

	<p pid="a.27.1/1">The right hon. Gentleman wants us to spend money on insulating homes, and we are doing that. He wants us to spend money on investing in schools, and we are investing more than in any previous year. He wants us to invest money in hospitals, and we are doing more than we have done. I thought that he would support the &pound;44 billion of public investment that is being put into the economy, instead of failing to support it today.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.1/2">As far as tax havens are concerned, in every Budget since 1997 we have tried to crack down on the use of tax havens. We have taken action that, since 2005, has secured &pound;14 billion of funds that would otherwise have been lost in tax avoidance. We know that we have to get a global agreement, however, and that is why we are pressing other countries to sign up to the international standards that are necessary. That means that Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Hong Kong and Singapore&mdash;areas that have been regarded as tax havens in the past&mdash;have got to come within the net. <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> And, yes, other parts of the world have got to come in, and I hope that the Opposition will join us in demanding that.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.1/3">As far as the low-carbon recovery is concerned, the right hon. Gentleman should know that we are investing, and ready to invest, as I announced today, in major projects of energy infrastructure&mdash;<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i></p>

	<p pid="a.28.3/1">This is a global problem that requires global solutions. I do not think that anybody in our country is in any doubt about that. There are four problems that must be solved if the global economy and our global society are to work better in the future. The first is financial instability, and that is why we are proposing the measures that we are proposing. The second is climate change and the need for energy that must be met in the future, which is why we are looking forward to a Copenhagen agreement. The third is security for people in a world of greater mobility and yet greater terrorism, and we have to deal with that as a global problem as well. The fourth is the poverty and inequality that led us to propose the millennium development goals in the first place. Everybody knows that those problems cannot be solved by Britain, America or any other country alone; they can be solved only by the world working together.</p>

It is important to get a fiscal stimulus, but it is also important that countries choose the way in which they want to do that, as he will always acknowledge. We have chosen to do certain things, as have the French and the Germans. What is common, however, is that they are in favour of a fiscal stimulus and not, like the Conservatives, in favour of public spending cuts.</p>

Is it not the case that the more we learn about the Royal Bank of Scotland, the more we realise that its shareholders and customers are entitled to become angrier and angrier? In view of the reports in certain newspapers, it is really no excuse for independent directors to say that they might have lost their jobs if they had stood up to the senior officers; surely that is the purpose of having independent directors.</p>

I think that the Walker review, which is looking at the role of directors and people who sit on the boards of financial institutions, will conclude that a change of behaviour in the boardrooms is necessary. I think the whole country is angry at the practices we have seen in the Royal Bank of Scotland, and we condemn them.</p>

	<p pid="a.29.4/1">On Second Reading of the Bank of England Bill in November 1997, the Prime Minister may remember that I strongly opposed the triangular regulation of our banks, which has proved such a disaster. In today's circumstances, facing as we are the danger of mass unemployment for years to come in this country and throughout Europe, may I repeat what I indicated before the pre-Budget report&mdash;that I am a strong believer in fiscal stimuli, well chosen in every advanced country in the world, together with quantitative easing to maintain consumer demand, if we are to avoid the terrible mistakes made in Germany 80 years ago by Chancellor Bruning, from whom the present German Chancellor has mercifully learned the right lessons?</p>

	<p pid="a.29.5/1">I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his comments. When the private sector fails, and when banks fail and falter, it is the Government's duty to step in. If we are to have the level of economic activity in the economy that we want, there needs to be monetary activism, as the hon. Gentleman proposed, and also fiscal activism. I cannot see how the Conservative party can continue to resist the idea that we should have, as we are having, a fiscal stimulus in the economy. The CBI supported our fiscal stimulus and wanted it to happen in November when we announced it. It has supported the measures we have taken.</p>

	<p pid="a.30.0/1">I welcome the fact that the European Council has adopted many of the ideas that the Prime Minister has advocated consistently now for months&mdash;a co-ordinated response on regulation and, yes, on a huge fiscal stimulus. Is it not extraordinary to get the same vacuous and juvenile posturing from the Leader of the Opposition when unemployment is 7.6 per cent. across the European Union and expected to rise to more than 10 per cent., with about 5 million jobs still to be lost across the EU? What we need in that context is huge public investment: the Tories simply will not learn the lessons of the 1930s and, yes, their own failure in the 1980s to tackle these problems through the power of Government, using a fiscal stimulus to do so.</p>

It is right at this time to use the Government's powers to help people who are unemployed, to help mortgage holders with their mortgages and to help small businesses get the funds that they need. Of all the parties I know across Europe, only this Conservative party is saying that there should be public spending cuts: the German, the French and other conservative, right-wing Governments have supported fiscal stimuli. The Tories cannot walk away from the fact that they are the only party calling for public spending cuts.</p>

	<p pid="a.31.5/1">Long after 2004, we did a number of exercises with the American authorities about what we would do in situations in which individual banks collapsed and about whether there was a systemic crisis as a result. Far from not taking action, we did take action and looked at what the global repercussions of individual bank failures would be. We talked to the United States Treasury and Federal Reserve and the regulators. The right hon. and learned Gentleman must recognise that Northern Rock, among other companies in the United Kingdom, was buying assets, from the United States of America, which were at that time labelled triple A but which turned out to be absolutely worthless. So there is also a failure in international regulation, which must be dealt with. I hope that he will agree that the measures that we are taking at the G20 are the right ones to take.</p>

	<p pid="a.33.4/1">The hon. Gentleman is right. We have a huge problem in parts of eastern and central Europe, because German banks, Austrian banks, Italian banks, Belgian banks and even British banks are having to withdraw, or are withdrawing, to their own home bases. What we therefore need is an international effort to help individual countries that do not have resources of their own with which to rebuild their banking systems. That is why the European Union has raised its balance of payments assistance to those countries, and that is why when we meet at the G20 we will want the International Monetary Fund to have the additional resources that are necessary to deal with crises. But we do not want just to deal with crises; we want to prevent crises, so we will have to look at better mechanisms by which we can help those countries of central and eastern Europe that are being let down by the current financial crisis.</p>

	<p pid="a.37.1/1">With permission, Mr. Speaker, I should like to make a statement on the Green Paper &quot;Rights and Responsibilities: developing our constitutional framework&quot;, which was laid before Parliament today. It is the next stage in what has been described as a quiet revolution in our constitutional arrangements, which, since 1997, has included: independence for the Bank of England; devolution for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland; independence for National Statistics; the Human Rights Act 1998; the Freedom of Information Act 2000 and the Data Protection Act 1998; and reforms to the House of Lords and of party funding.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.1/2">This Green Paper deals with some of the most fundamental questions we face as individuals and as a society: how we live together; what rights and freedoms we enjoy, and from whom; and what duties and obligations we owe, and to whom. Those issues are not abstractions, removed from the practical politics of jobs and housing, health care, education, crime and disorder, because these constitutional arrangements determine how power is distributed, and therefore the conditions in which every other question in our public life will be answered.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.1/3">It is because of the centrality of these issues that my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister chose to make his first major policy statement, within days of taking office, on exactly this matter of constitutional change. He told this House that it was right to involve the public</p>
	<p pid="a.37.1/4" class="indent">&quot;in a sustained debate about whether there is a case for the United Kingdom developing a full British Bill of Rights and duties&quot;.&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2007-07-03.819"><i> Official Report</i>, 3 July 2007; Vol. 462, c. 819</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.37.1/5">This was to be as a step towards a written constitution. The Green Paper presents the arguments for such a Bill. It does not reach final conclusions&mdash;that is for the end of the process of national discussion&mdash;rather, it sets the framework for this debate. Indeed, if by the end of the process the Bill is perceived to provide protection to rights and freedoms, it will become effective in defining common values so that people in Britain of different backgrounds may feel ownership of it.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.1/6">From the Magna Carta and the declaration of Arbroath, the 1689 Bill of Rights and the Scottish Claim of Rights, to the great Reform Acts of last two centuries, our history illustrates the proud traditions of liberty on which our nation is built. Though the profound changes that those great texts initiated were the subject of intense struggle at the time, the United Kingdom's experience of constitutional development has been unlike that of almost any other democracy in the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.1/7">The constitutional arrangements of most other nations have emerged from rebellion, revolution, civil war, occupation or oppression. The United States, France, India, South Africa and nations across Europe and the world, have had to set down their arrangements in a single text&mdash;a constitution, underpinned by declarations of rights. Whether legally enforceable or not, they have become abiding points of reference as to how their citizens should relate to each other and to the state, and help to define the kind of nation they wish to be. This Green Paper sets out the case for how a Bill could become a similar unifying force for the United Kingdom, not least because our own society is much more diverse, in race, religion and ethnicity than at any point in our history.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.1/8">We are, self-evidently, launching this Green Paper at a time of great uncertainty and anxiety. Tackling the global recession must be our immediate priority. But acting, at the same time, to strengthen communities' and individuals' sense of a stake in society&mdash; by better articulating the responsibilities we owe and the rights we have&mdash;is not an alternative to decisive measures on the economic front but an essential complement to them.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.1/9">One of the most significant constitutional changes in the past dozen years is the Human Rights Act 1998. I worked hard as sponsoring Minister to achieve a consensus behind it: and I commend the official Opposition for the support that they gave the Act in its final form.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.1/10">Prior to that Act, accessing convention rights via the Strasbourg court was a time-consuming, expensive and difficult process, and, as such, prohibitive for many. Now, those rights can be accessed in UK courts, with cases heard by UK judges.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.1/11">The Act better protects the family. It has benefited all sections of society; from the elderly couple wanting to live in the same care home, to the loftiest of newspaper magnates. In providing a more practical mechanism to access rights, as well as a positive obligation on the state to protect them, countless thousands of people have benefited from the law, without necessarily having to resort to the law.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.1/12">Despite that, the Act has its detractors, primarily because the atrocities of <phrase class="date" code="2001-09-11">11 September 2001</phrase> occurred less than a year after the Act came into force. Had those tragic events not occurred, I suggest that the HRA would have slipped comfortably into the fabric of our lives without controversy. As it was, those terrible events threw into acute relief the tensions between liberty and security. We recognise these tensions but the Government are proud of the Human Rights Act. We will neither resile from it, nor repeal it.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.1/13">The principles and rights set down in the European convention&mdash;now in the HRA&mdash;are timeless. They are the mark and measure of any civilised society at any time. But in the intervening 60 years since the convention was drawn up, the rights in it have been added to by a great extension of social and economic rights&mdash;of health care, dignity in old age, education, housing and social security. But as our rights have become so much wider and stronger, one question is whether their claim is balanced properly by an equally strong sense of the responsibilities we each owe. We believe that there is a case for drawing out more clearly and explicitly the responsibilities that go with rights.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.1/14">Duties and responsibilities are to be found in the convention, in statute, in common law and woven deeply into our social and moral fabric. We have a latent understanding and acceptance of our duties to one another and to the state. That said, responsibilities have been a poor cousin to rights. The Green Paper proposes that responsibilities are given greater prominence in our constitutional arrangements, better to articulate what we owe, as much as what we expect. That is how we can move away from a &quot;rights culture&quot; to a &quot;rights and responsibilities culture&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.1/15">Some responsibilities are obvious, such as obeying the law, paying taxes and undertaking jury service. Others are less obviously recalled at the moment they should be exercised, such as a responsibility towards future generations to live within environmental limits, the duty we have to protect the well-being of children in our care, a civic duty to vote, responsibilities towards our neighbours, respect for those public sector workers who care for us and a responsibility towards the taxpayer&mdash;for example, not claiming benefits if one is able to work.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.1/16">If we are to fulfil our responsibilities, we must have a clear understanding of what they are. As the Green Paper sets out, an accessible Bill of rights and responsibilities could be emblematic of the fair society in which we want to live, where awareness of our rights is matched with a greater understanding of our responsibilities to each other. Most of the social and economic rights to which I have referred are already embedded in law, but they are scattered across myriad legal texts. The Government believe that we should encapsulate those rights in a single document, bringing together the &quot;new&quot; post-war rights of social justice and the welfare state, victims' rights, rights of equality and good administration.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.1/17">A key question set out in the Green Paper is whether any Bill should have, directly or indirectly, the force of law. Bills of Rights from around the world are a combination of symbolism, aspiration and law across a spectrum of legal effect. There need not be a binary choice between the justiciable and the declaratory. As the Green Paper points out, the Government do not necessarily consider a model of directly legally enforceable rights or responsibilities to be the most appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.1/18">But even without full legal enforcement, words can have great power. The universal declaration of human rights contained no legally enforceable rights, but was rather the global expression of a shared commitment and a recognition of humanity's common dignity&mdash;what Eleanor Roosevelt described as the Magna Carta for all mankind. A Bill of rights and responsibilities for the United Kingdom could be such a declaration and could set down the values we cherish.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.1/19">I have had the rare privilege of taking through this House many of the constitutional changes of the past 12 years. Throughout that time I have looked to secure the broadest political consensus behind those changes, as reform of such importance to our democracy requires nothing less.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.1/20">Constitutional change should take place only on the basis of full and proper deliberation. The Green Paper has been through such a process within Government and now it is time to take the debate out to the people whom we all serve. The deliberation must not be rushed and so the Green Paper will not precede any legislation this side of a general election. We are dealing with the fundamental building blocks of our democracy, and as the Prime Minister made clear:</p>
	<p pid="a.37.1/21" class="indent">&quot;Constitutional change will not be the work of just one Bill or one year or one Parliament&quot;.&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2007-07-03.815"><i> Official Report</i>, 3 July 2007; Vol. 462, c. 815</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.37.1/22">A Bill of rights and responsibilities could form the next natural and necessary step in a process that began 60 years ago with the universal declaration. It is an opportunity to bring together existing rights and responsibilities in one statute and better to define the relationship between citizen and state in a new and unifying constitutional document for this century. I commend the statement to the House.</p>

	<p pid="a.40.0/1">I thank the Secretary of State for advance sight of his statement. It was not in fact needed, as it was all in <i> The Sunday Times</i>. Yet again, even on serious matters of constitutional reform, this Government demonstrate their disdain for this House by first announcing policy to the media. Am I correct in recalling that the Justice Secretary told the House last Tuesday:</p>
	<p pid="a.40.0/2" class="indent">&quot;I might be old-fashioned, but I take the view that the place to make announcements is in the House of Commons&quot;? &mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2009-03-17.762"><i> Official Report</i>, 17 March 2009; Vol. 489, c. 762</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.40.0/3">What has changed since then? Was this a decision taken by the Prime Minister?</p>
	<p pid="a.40.0/4">We have had a decade of botched constitutional reform from this Government. The Justice Secretary was there from the start, and now he has been instructed by the Prime Minister to clear up the mess. In truth, there can be only two reasons for this Green Paper, which he says sets the framework of debate. Has he come to the House because he accepts that the Human Rights Act, which has been in force for less than nine years, has proved badly flawed, and that new thought is needed? Or is the statement just the latest exercise in pure spin, designed to make absolutely no difference in practice?</p>
	<p pid="a.40.0/5">I have to correct the Justice Secretary: the Opposition voted against the Human Rights Act, and experience has proved that we were correct about many of the concerns that we expressed. The Act has singularly failed to protect our core freedoms. The heavy-handed abuse of the right to peaceful protest is documented in today's report of the Joint Committee on Human Rights. As for intrusions into personal privacy, the Joseph Rowntree Reform Trust today referred to Britain as the</p>
	<p pid="a.40.0/6" class="indent">&quot;most invasive surveillance state...of any Western democracy&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.40.0/7">and this evening, the House will again resist the Government's latest attack on juries.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.0/8">The Human Rights Act has fuelled a rights inflation; it requires UK judges to take a maximalist approach to the interpretation of convention rights that is not, in fact, required by membership of the European convention on human rights, and that has created confusion and uncertainty in practice. Does the Justice Secretary now accept that the Act has often left police and probation services unclear of where the legal boundaries are as they strive to discharge their duty to protect the public, as was shown in the tragic case of Naomi Bryant? Does he accept that the Act has saddled public-service providers with heavy liabilities and has what the Audit Commission describes as</p>
	<p pid="a.40.0/9" class="indent">&quot;a universal and costly impact on the way that public bodies operate&quot;?</p>
	<p pid="a.40.0/10">Will he take responsibility for the Act's role in undermining social responsibility, as the Government oversell human rights as all things to all people? If so, how exactly will his proposals make a difference to all that?</p>
	<p pid="a.40.0/11">On the contrary, the Green Paper is, it seems, destined to make each of those problems worse. Take legal confusion. Writing in <i> The Sunday Times</i>, the Minister of State, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1865" name="Michael Wills">the right hon. Member for North Swindon (Mr. Wills)</phrase>, explains that</p>
	<p pid="a.40.0/12" class="indent">&quot;There may well be a case for not creating new rights outside the scope of the courts&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.40.0/13">but he urges us none the less to</p>
	<p pid="a.40.0/14" class="indent">&quot;celebrate...the rights we enjoy...through...constitutional expression&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.40.0/15">because</p>
	<p pid="a.40.0/16" class="indent">&quot;Words have power in their own right.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.40.0/17">Can the Secretary of State, who is after all a lawyer, please explain what on earth his junior Minister is talking about? The question is pretty straightforward: does he favour the creation of new economic and social rights with legal force, or are we talking about an entirely cosmetic exercise? If he does want to create new economic and social rights, he needs to say so, and he needs to explain why we in this House should abdicate to unaccountable judges our responsibility, as democratic law-makers, to set the nation's economic and social priorities, and decide how finite public resources should be allocated to meet them.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.0/18">Take rights to health care. Does the Justice Secretary accept that the reality of any new human rights to health care is that they will feed the claims culture? Just this week, the NHS Litigation Authority lambasted the existing regime. Would not the new rights mean more money for lawyers and less for patients&mdash;the last thing that the taxpayer will welcome in a recession? If he does not intend to create justiciable rights, can he explain how the standing of law is not undermined by the process on which he has embarked? What are we to make of his Minister of State comparing the proposals to the Bill of Rights of 1689? Was that document merely &quot;aspirational&quot;? Given their track record, I begin to think that the Government might well wish that the Bill of Rights, too, was merely the pap that is being served up here.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.0/19">The Justice Secretary could not put off coming to the House for ever. We have waited more than 14 months for this announcement, which has been put back time and again, scuppered each time, we are told, by his colleagues. In a vain effort to say something&mdash;anything&mdash;on how to reform the Human Rights Act, he has produced a Green Paper that can only make matters worse. May I suggest to him that on the evidence of the Green Paper, he really would be well advised to heed colleagues' warnings? That would be better than trying to create more confusion, and undermining yet again the democratic prerogatives of this House and, above all, the clarity of the law. The Green Paper has just one saving grace: it will not result in any legislation this side of a general election&mdash;in other words, it is for the birds.</p>

	<p pid="a.41.0/1">I think the hon. and learned Gentleman protests too much. He makes much of his discontent with the Human Rights Act and how that has fuelled a compensation culture.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.0/2">Let me read the House a quotation:</p>
	<p pid="a.41.0/3" class="indent">&quot;The Human Rights Act has many benefits which it has conferred. The Human Rights Act is dynamic. . . I don't think the Human Rights Act has anything to do with fuelling a compensation culture at all.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.41.0/4">That was the shadow Attorney-General speaking to lawyers at the Stationers' Hall, City of London, on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-30">30 March 2005</phrase>&mdash;<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1394" name="Dominic Grieve">the hon. and learned Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve)</phrase>, the same hon. and learned Gentleman who told the House when the Human Rights Bill was going through the House,</p>
	<p pid="a.41.0/5" class="indent">&quot;As is probably well known to my colleagues and possibly to other hon. Members, I have long been a supporter of the incorporation of a human rights Bill into our law. . . I would be denying my own conscience and feelings in the matter if I did not say that I believe that incorporation is a sensible step forward.&quot; &mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/1998-02-16.831"><i> Official Report</i>, 16 February 1998; Vol. 306, c. 831-3</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.41.0/6">I remind the hon. and learned Gentleman that when the Bill was before the House, it was indeed the case that the Conservatives voted against it on Second Reading, but they did not vote against it on Third Reading, as the hon. and learned Gentleman has now had the grace to nod in agreement. Why? Because the Bill was much improved as a result of parliamentary scrutiny, not least from himself as an ardent supporter of the measure. When we came to Third Reading, the then shadow Attorney-General, now the noble and learned Lord Lyell, stood at the Opposition Dispatch Box and &quot;wished the Bill well&quot;. The Conservatives, or some tendency of the Conservative party, supports the Human Rights Act.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.0/7">We were entertained at the weekend by the shadow Business Secretary, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1794" name="Kenneth Clarke">the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke)</phrase>, putting a torpedo through the Conservatives' tax policy. He has also put a torpedo through the Conservatives' failure to come up with any significant alternative to the Human Rights Act, describing his own leaders' proposals as &quot;xenophobic and legal nonsense&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.0/8">As I read his speeches, the hon. and learned Member for Beaconsfield must agree with most of that which is in the document, and is simply posturing to who knows whom on the Opposition Benches behind him. He is in favour of the Human Rights Act. When I read his speeches I see that he is in favour of almost everything that is in the document, as I am in favour of much that he has written, particularly recently.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.0/9">To what is the hon. and learned Gentleman objecting? Is he objecting to us setting down in summary form the economic and social rights that we all enjoy? What is the problem about that? What is the problem with setting down, as we have done in slightly longer form, the rights to health care or to education? While we set down those rights, which we all enjoy and which not even the Conservative party proposes we take away&mdash;yet&mdash;is it not also sensible to set down the balancing responsibilities?</p>
	<p pid="a.41.0/10">The hon. and learned Gentleman suggests that by setting in a single declaration those rights and responsibilities, we will somehow encourage the compensation culture. He has already answered that. It is nonsense. But if in the same text, along with the right to health care, we set down the responsibilities of patients, and if in the same text, along with the right to education, we set down the responsibilities of parents in respect of the education and upbringing of their children, does our society lose from that exercise or gain? I suggest that our society can only gain from such an exercise, and I invite the Opposition to join us in a serious exercise better to set out for the society that we have today the rights and responsibilities that we owe and we should enjoy.</p>

	<p pid="a.42.0/1">I, too, thank the Secretary of State for early sight of the Green Paper and of his statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.42.0/2">With all due respect to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1394" name="Dominic Grieve">the hon. and learned Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve)</phrase>, I do not understand the position that the Conservatives are taking. They seem on some days to want the plaudits of populists for calling for the abolition of the Human Rights Act, but also to crave the respect of civil libertarians. They simply cannot have both. However, does the Secretary of State not recognise that he, too, seems to want it both ways, in how he attempts to link rights to responsibilities? He seems to want not only to satisfy those who rightly say that human rights set up a minimum standard of which no civilised Government&mdash;no matter whom they are dealing with&mdash;can fall short, but to please those who say that some people do not deserve human rights; that latter position is simply a watered down version of the position of those who want to get rid of the Human Rights Act altogether.</p>
	<p pid="a.42.0/3">More fundamentally, does the Secretary of State recognise the fundamental distinction between human rights on the one hand, and the rights and responsibilities of citizenship on the other? They are not the same. Human rights set up obligations owed to all humans, and cannot be conditional. The rights of citizens, on the other hand, are not universal, and there are far fewer problems in saying that responsibilities are attached to citizenship.</p>
	<p pid="a.42.0/4">Does the Secretary of State not also agree that there is a crisis of citizenship in the simple sense of people taking part in the government of their own communities? He is a great supporter of first past the post, but does he not at least accept that one of its effects is to narrow electoral politics to a few swing voters in a few marginal constituencies to the exclusion of everyone else? Is there not an irony in calling for greater commitment to citizenship just before a debate in which, as the hon. and learned Member for Beaconsfield said, the Government seek to restrict one of the best traditions of our citizenship&mdash;namely, the jury system?</p>
	<p pid="a.42.0/5">The statement also seemed confused and vague on the relationship between constitutional texts and a sense of national unity. Does the Secretary of State not agree that it is not a text in itself but the experience of acting together to govern one's own community that creates a sense of democratic identity? National identity itself very rarely creates democracies&mdash;in fact, things might be the other way round: too strong a sense of national identity might have been destructive of democratic ideals in the past century.</p>
	<p pid="a.42.0/6">The Government are right to be cautious on economic and social rights. It would be a mistake, I believe, to constitutionalise too many essentially political decisions about taxing and spending. At the same time, it is already a human right not to be left in destitution and it is a plausible extension of the rights of citizens that they should have an entitlement to sufficient access to health, education and welfare services for them to be able to take part in a practical way in governing their own communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.42.0/7">However, I agree with the hon. and learned Member for Beaconsfield that such rights as are included have to be properly enforceable in the courts. I am disturbed by what the Secretary of State has said about a range of rights&mdash;rights that are enforceable on the one hand, and rights that are purely declaratory or symbolic on the other. Does he agree that there is a grave danger that in creating rights that are not enforceable, he might end up diluting the whole idea of rights themselves? We have had enough of government by press release; the last thing that we need is a constitution by press release as well.</p>

	<p pid="a.44.0/1">Let me deal with the hon. Gentleman's last point. Essentially, he said that if we have a Bill, anything in it has to be justiciable; that, at least, is what I took him to say. I understand his point. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman has read the Green Paper, but I commend it to him some more. In chapter 4, we bring out the fact that if we look at equivalent documents and texts around the world, we see that not every part of a declaration, Bill of Rights or preamble to a constitution is enforceable in the same way as every other part. On page 54, we cite what is set out in article 45 of the Irish constitution. The article is declaratory, but by all accounts the Irish believe that setting out important economic and social rights in a declaratory form in their constitution meets important imperatives within their society. My view is that it is sensible for there to be rights and responsibilities across the piece in a single document. If those could be agreed between the parties in terms of education for citizenship, it would be enormously valuable, when we talk to our constituents, to be able to say, &quot;This is what has been agreed. Whatever else the British political parties and the British people disagree about, these are the sets of basic values&mdash;rights and responsibilities&mdash;that we all agree about.&quot; This is a good starting point. There are certain things that we agree about, but at the moment they are less articulated than they should be, particularly as regards responsibilities, and we should set them out. In its important report last summer, the Joint Committee on Human Rights said that it would be unwise to make economic and social rights directly justiciable because that would pre-empt the role of this Parliament. Of course, I accept that. However, there is greater value in having such a document than in not having it.</p>
	<p pid="a.44.0/2">I am always ready to rise to the bait of discussing electoral reform, but I will not on this occasion, if the hon. Gentleman will excuse me. I will just say that there is greater concern in Norway and in the Czech Republic about the state of their democracy than there is here, notwithstanding their proportional representation systems. The whole House will have noted that I did not mention, among the major constitutional changes that this House has agreed in the past 12 years, the list system for European Parliament elections. <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> It was a manifesto commitment, your honour.</p>
	<p pid="a.44.0/3">The hon. Gentleman is right to ask what the Conservatives want. I think that they want different things. In February this year, the shadow Home Secretary said that what we want is &quot;fewer rights, more wrongs&quot;. That was an extraordinary statement&mdash;so extraordinary that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1394" name="Dominic Grieve">the hon. and learned Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve)</phrase> had to say that he was not completely clear about what it meant. <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> As a matter of fact, I am completely clear about what &quot;fewer rights, more wrongs&quot; means: it means fewer rights and more wrongs. That produced complete chaos at the heart of the Tory party.</p>

It is a mark of a civilised society that we are ready to give to the least worthy in our society&mdash;the people accused of the worst kinds of crimes&mdash;rights that they would never accord to us. There is no argument about that. None the less, the way in which people behave towards others is taken into account by the courts and is part of our overall moral code, and we need to articulate that better. If <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1404" name="Alan Beith">the right hon.

	<p pid="a.46.2/1">The Justice Secretary quite rightly made reference to our constitutional heritage, such as the Magna Carta. But the Bill of Rights of 1689 was composed and arrived at within simply months, but the gestation period that the present Government have embarked upon confuses one. All the inalienable rights that we have always assumed as a free and democratic people are available in the constitutional instruments at our disposal, including the Human Rights Act. They protect the relationship of the citizen to the state and they define it. What the Justice Secretary proposes&mdash;this confusion and mishmash&mdash;is clearly just a diversionary tactic. I agree with my right hon. and hon. Friends: the proposal is going nowhere, and the Justice Secretary knows it. We are wasting time.</p>

I wish to draw attention to the fact that when I left the sitting of Parliament on Friday and passed through Parliament square and into Birdcage walk, I was detained by the police on a stop and search on the basis of the use of anti-terrorism legislation. That follows on from what happened only a few weeks ago during our campaign against the third runway.

	<p pid="a.50.2/1">I seek leave to move the Adjournment of the House to discuss a specific and important matter, which I believe should have urgent consideration, namely Parliament's response to the Healthcare Commission's report on Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.2/2">Last Wednesday, the Health Secretary made a statement to the House in response to the report and answered hon. Members' questions for an hour. That was the right thing to do. He proposed several actions, which were the appropriate responses to the report. However, two things have happened since then, which make me ask the House for an urgent debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.2/3">First, I returned to my constituency on Thursday evening, and since then further accounts have been given to me and others of poor care at the hospital. Given that the Healthcare Commission's report states that improvements have been made and that the trust is safe, it is important to do everything possible to reinforce that statement straight away. In a debate, I would call for Professor Sir George Alberti's review, which is due to start this week, to be expanded to cover all parts of the hospital, not only emergency care, and, therefore, for him to head a multidisciplinary team to support the current interim leadership, the senior managers and the hospital staff as they ensure that all the improvements for which the commission's report calls are carried out and maintained.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.2/4">Secondly, there are growing calls for a public inquiry, which I support for four reasons: to help the new regulator, who is about to replace the Healthcare Commission, to understand how one trust kept its failures from being discovered for so long; to anchor the work that has been promised concerning an independent assessment of medical records; to ascertain what lessons can be learned for the future about how the hospital conducted nurse training, patient-staff ratios, supervision and monitoring of hospital services, and to ascertain what lessons can be learned for the future about the arrangements in the past at the hospital for public and patient involvement in decision making, supervision and monitoring, and whether those lessons can apply to systems throughout the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.2/5">To me, the question of a public inquiry is big enough to merit a debate in the House, but the two issues together make the matter urgent and worthy of debate now.</p>

	<p pid="a.53.0/1">Does my hon. and learned Friend agree that many of us suspect that the insertion of the statement was done simply for the personal convenience of the Justice Secretary, so that he did not have to be in the House on two separate occasions?</p>

	<p pid="a.53.1/1">I have absolutely no idea whether that is the case, but it is a wholly improper constriction of the time of this House for the Secretary of State to make a statement today that he could have made on any day last week, any day the week before or any day in the remainder of this week. It was not time-precious&mdash;that is to say, time-urgent&mdash;for him to make the statement today.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.1/2">I would suggest that it is an entirely cynical, albeit typical, Government business manager move to compress the debates on the Bill. The Bill, which is about the size of the mid-Suffolk telephone book, is yet another plum duff of a Bill&mdash;plenty of duff and very few plums. It deals with about 15 discrete areas of law reform. We had inadequate time in Committee to debate the Bill, and we can see from today's amendment paper, which is about the size of the Rutland telephone book, that plenty needs to be discussed on Report. We can also see that there are nine groups of amendments and new clauses that have to be dealt with in today's business alone.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.1/3">It could be suggested&mdash;no doubt the Minister will confess to this in winding up the debate&mdash;that the whole purpose of the way the programme motion has been constructed and the way the Government have so organised this afternoon's business was to prevent things that need to be discussed and scrutinised from being discussed and scrutinised. We will probably see many hon. Members wishing to discuss inquests into a person's death that may be conducted without a jury, which is a highly controversial aspect of the Bill. However, there are other subjects equally worthy of discussion, such as: the death of service personnel abroad; coroner's duties and powers; inquest juries; medical examiners; the governance of the coronial system; some new material on sedition and seditious and criminal libel; the reform of the law of murder; and finally, the subject of assisting suicide.</p>

	<p pid="a.53.2/1">As ever, my hon. and learned Friend is making a powerful case. Does he agree that the subject of assisting suicide has aroused considerable interest among many of our constituents, who expect such issues to be debated in Parliament? Wherever one might come down on the subject, surely our constituents are entitled to see such subjects debated, rather than seeing them prevented from being debated, which is what the Government have in effect done.</p>

	<p pid="a.54.0/1">I entirely agree with my hon. Friend. Each of those subjects&mdash;for example, the reform of the law of homicide, the reform of the law on assisting suicide and the reform of the coronial system&mdash;should have been detailed in separate Bills. Then the House would have had proper time to deal with each Bill separately, as would the other place, but the Government are not content with that. They rush round their Departments, just tipping stuff into their shopping trolley in the hope that it can make a useful compendium Bill, but it does not: it leads to chaos, cynicism and a total lack of confidence in the Government's ability to order their affairs.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.0/2">What we are seeing from the Government is not just indifference; it is a reckless disregard for the House of Commons and the proper parliamentary scrutiny of legislation. This Government are now beyond shame. I have yet to see a Minister who can look the House in the face and say that what they are doing this afternoon would be worthy of any Government. I regret to say that this programme motion is a shameful motion. It needs to be treated with the House's utter contempt, and I hope that the House will show that contempt in a few moments' time.</p>

	<p pid="a.54.1/1">I do not think this is a shameful programme motion, but I do think there is a serious problem with it, which is why we tabled an amendment to it. The problem lies in the balance between the two days. The first day jams together amendments on juryless inquests with five other groups of amendments on coroners, including new material from the Government, on the new topics of sedition and seditious and criminal libel, as well as on the whole of the law of murder and assisted suicide.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.1/2">The problem with the programme motion is that anything on that list that we do not reach by 10 o'clock tonight will fall. We will then start again tomorrow with a reserved hour for the law on homophobic hatred, followed by a fairly leisurely stroll through the rest of this Christmas tree Bill. We have just had two statements, which have taken up 90 minutes, as well as other matters, and it will now be very difficult to reach the amendments on the law of murder today. That would be a disgrace. Murder is the most serious crime in the law, and the Government's proposals seriously distorted a Law Commission proposal. The Committee stage demonstrated that there were real difficulties with those proposals.</p>

	<p pid="a.54.2/1">Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the programme motion demonstrates a strange order of priorities by giving the law of homophobic hatred an hour, when its likely use in any given year, if implemented, will probably be tiny, while the law of murder is applied every week in our courts?</p>

	<p pid="a.54.3/1">I completely agree. I have tabled the lead new clauses in the groups on murder and on homophobic hatred. If asked which I would want to give reserved time to, I would say the murder group, not the homophobic hatred group. I put it to the Government that there should have been a two-day debate without any internal knives at all. In such circumstances, I am sure that the House would have paced itself through those two days properly. I urge the Government to withdraw the programme motion.</p>

	<p pid="a.55.0/1">Not for the first time, I rise to oppose a timetable motion. I strongly object to the timetabling of this Bill on Report. The consequences of timetabling, as my hon. and learned Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1615" name="Edward Garnier">the Member for Harborough (Mr. Garnier)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1473" name="David Howarth">the hon. Member for Cambridge (David Howarth)</phrase> have said, is that important sections of the Bill will go to the other place wholly undiscussed. What is more, a number of hon. Members, including my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1816" name="Philip Davies">the Member for Shipley (Philip Davies)</phrase>, will not have the opportunity to discuss new clause 42. Whether or not one supports the new clause, it is quite plainly a matter that ought to be discussed by this House. It is urgent and topical, and people want to discuss it, but we are simply not going to reach it. Indeed, I have a strong suspicion that we shall not go beyond the first of the nine groups of amendments.</p>

	<p pid="a.55.2/1">My hon. and learned Friend makes an important point. Consent for legislation depends on a belief that this House does its duty properly, and the truth is that we are being prevented from doing our duty by this timetable motion. Moreover, on a related point, the Report stage is the only occasion on which right hon. and hon. Members who are not on the Committee have the opportunity to discuss the detail of the Bill. This Bill contains some extraordinarily important clauses. For example, the whole of the first group of amendments and new clauses deals with jury-free inquests. The important thing to keep in mind is that these provisions represent a concession&mdash;I concede that it is a concession&mdash;announced by the Government last week, on which there has been precious little public discussion and whose details we have a right to discuss. We are not going to be able to do so in sufficient detail, however.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.2/2">On a different point, the draft changes on murder are extremely important. I agree with what has already been said about that. As the Secretary of State for Justice knows, I have often appeared in murder cases. Provocation has been an extremely difficult area of the law, and we have a right to have the opportunity properly to debate it on this occasion, but we are not going to be able to do so. The definition of an inquest in respect of which a jury should be required seems to me to be a matter of very considerable moment, but we are not going to reach that provision; it will go to the other place without our having had proper discussion. That is also true of the matter of assisted suicide, to which my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Harborough has referred.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.2/3">There is another vice about this&mdash;if the time allowed for Report is constrained, we can be quite sure that Mr. Speaker will be unable to select as many amendments as we would wish him to select. As we know from the Order Paper, I tabled scores of amendments&mdash;I make no complaint about the fact that only a few have been selected&mdash;but if debate is unnaturally and too tightly constrained, right hon. and hon. Members are shut out and a Bill is not properly discussed at all.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.2/4">I suggest that any feeling of outrage should be compounded by two further considerations. We all know that the business of the House has been extraordinarily light for the last few weeks. We need only look at the Order Paper to know that. It would have been quite easy to provide two, three or more days to allow proper debate of this Bill, but we are not permitted to do so, which is an outrage.</p>

	<p pid="a.56.0/1">In supporting the right hon. and learned Gentleman's argument, may I respectfully remind him that there is a one-liner throughout next week, so there would be plenty of time to deal with these very important issues?

	<p pid="a.56.1/1">I do not know about the nationalist Whip, but I know that other parties have an extraordinarily light Whip and we have had extraordinarily light business for weeks and weeks and weeks. We could well have given this Bill much more time than is being allowed.</p>

	<p pid="a.56.3/1">I agree and I find it impossible when I go to schools and other places to explain why it is that whole chunks of legislation are going through this place undiscussed. The Criminal Justice Bill in 2003 was the worst example that readily comes to mind, but there are countless other examples, of which this Bill is going to be another.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.3/2">Then we come to the perverse fact that we have had two statements today&mdash;a day of tight business. I understand that the Prime Minister felt obliged to make a statement and it was a remarkable performance. The poor fellow, I fear he is getting very tired, so I suppose one ought to feel sorry for him. However, there was no need for the Justice Secretary to come here today. I entirely agree with my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Harborough that, assuming it was not for the personal convenience of the Justice Secretary, it was certainly to take up time&mdash;and that stinks as a practice.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.3/3">I was not going to divide the House because I knew that the Division would take up time from our substantive debate, but now that my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Harborough proposes to divide the House, I am going to join him in the Division Lobby with enthusiasm.</p>

	<p pid="a.56.4/1">I have an obvious interest in the programme motion because I have new clauses in one of the later groups to deal with freedom of speech&mdash;a matter that should be of interest to all Members. I am also a sponsor of the new clause dealing with assisted suicide. I think it is fair to say that I raised my concerns with the Government before I saw the groupings. I put some questions to the Leader of the House just last Thursday. I said:</p>
	<p pid="a.56.4/2" class="indent">&quot;Mr. Speaker, you will be selecting the amendments&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.56.4/3">for the Coroners and Justice Bill</p>
	<p pid="a.56.4/4" class="indent">&quot;and, as there are so many parts to the Bill, they will inevitably fall into at least eight substantive groups.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.56.4/5">Well, there are 14. I continued:</p>
	<p pid="a.56.4/6" class="indent">&quot;We are grateful to the Leader of the House for providing two days' debate&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.56.4/7">which was not the case in respect of the Criminal Justice Act 2008 when, as with so many others, we had just one day&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.56.4/8" class="indent">&quot;but does she recognise that the ability of the House to scrutinise the legislation will be measured&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.56.4/9">by our constituents and the media&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.56.4/10" class="indent">&quot;in part, by whether we have time to debate all those groups?&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.56.4/11">I then asked her a simple question:</p>
	<p pid="a.56.4/12" class="indent">&quot;Will she take steps to ensure that there is adequate consultation between the parties so that those two days are used effectively to scrutinise all the parts of this important piece of legislation?&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2009-03-19.1065"><i> Official Report</i>, 19 March 2009; Vol. 489, c. 1065-66</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.56.4/13">As my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1473" name="David Howarth">the Member for Cambridge (David Howarth)</phrase> said, there is not enough time to do more than we are doing because of the mismatch between the two days. He was available all last week to debate such matters, and the same applies to those on the Conservative Front Bench.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.4/14">When the Prime Minister was first selected as the new Prime Minister, he said it was his priority to ensure that the House improved the scrutiny that it delivered. At the time, I asked him whether that would include scrutiny of all legislation&mdash;particularly criminal justice legislation&mdash;by the elected House. I asked whether he agreed that it was unacceptable for huge tranches of legislation to go through the House, and sometimes even Committee, unscrutinised. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1821" name="Douglas Hogg">the right hon. and learned Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham (Mr. Hogg)</phrase> said, this is the only chance that those of us who are not on Public Bill Committees have. Surely the Government accept that the House is not doing its job of scrutiny unless it can debate all groups of amendments.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.4/15">There is an option other than a third day: consulting on the programme motion. I have been told by those who know more about the matter that whichever Committee of the House suggested programme motions never intended them simply to be imposed and to have the consequences, by design or accident, that we see today. They were always intended to be a vehicle for the House to arrange its business so that we could debate such matters. Does the Minister recognise that it must be sensible to negotiate the programme motion so that we do not have such a half-hour debate, Divisions and unpleasantness? I am assured that there was no negotiation&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="a.57.1/1">Politics is the art of the possible, and regardless of how much trust Back Benchers have in Front Benchers, consultation is possible. We ask our Front Benchers to take into account the interests of the whole House. I would rather argue with them over their failure to negotiate a good position than have such frustration. At least my hon. Friend the Member for Cambridge tabled an amendment, which was not selected, that would have addressed the matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.1/2">It is amazing that the elected House will not get to debate murder law reform, and that we will probably not get to debate free speech, which has not been debated in this House for centuries&mdash;not since the days of the Star Chamber&mdash;in the terms on the Order Paper. It would be unacceptable if the House discussed only one group today. We must show self-restraint. No programme motion will ever deliver proper scrutiny if we spend a whole day on the first group, important though it is. With self-restraint, the House of Lords managed to get through its business. In that spirit, I will finish.</p>

	<p pid="a.58.0/1">The House knows that this is a compendium Bill and that it touches on fundamental issues that affect the nature of our society. I want to draw attention to a conclusion of the Joint Committee on Human Rights, which comprises Members of the House of Lords and Members of this House. Few people will have had the opportunity to read the Joint Committee's report. It states:</p>
	<p pid="a.58.0/2" class="indent">&quot;The breadth and size of the Bill and the legal complexity and diversity of the topics it covers have been the subject of concern during the Bill's passage through the House of Commons given the limited time provided for scrutiny. We add our voice to those concerns. Large, multi-purpose bills of this sort are almost impossible to scrutinise effectively within the limited timescale provided by the Government. Given the range and significance of the human rights issues raised in this bill, the Government should have introduced two or three separate bills, each of which would have been substantial pieces of legislation in their own right or ensured that there was sufficient time for full pre-legislative and Committee stage scrutiny in the House of Commons. We welcome the fact that two days have been given over for Report stage in the House of Commons, a step not taken in relation to previous Bills of similar size, including the Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.0/3">It does not take much wit or imagination to appreciate that a Bill that covers certified or secret inquests, data protection, consumer reforms, witness anonymity, changes in the criminal law and procedural changes deals with big, big issues which the House should take seriously. What the Government are consistently doing is denigrating this Chamber&mdash;my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1463" name="John Bercow">the Member for Buckingham (John Bercow)</phrase> raised that point during questions on the statement by the Justice Secretary earlier this afternoon&mdash;rubbishing us, in one sense, and pushing the whole duty of legislative scrutiny down to the other end.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.0/4">There are matters in this Bill that we simply cannot reach. As was pointed out by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1756" name="Evan Harris">the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris)</phrase>, we shall not be able to discuss contentions that affect every one of our citizens. What is the purpose of the House of Commons if the Government persist in introducing guillotine motions with timetabling that does not enable us to discuss the business involved? This is a denial even of the Justice Secretary's Bill of rights and responsibilities. What about the responsibilities of a Government to ensure that Parliament&mdash;the elected House of Commons&mdash;can discuss matters such as secret coroners' courts?</p>

	<p pid="a.58.1/2">This is happening far too regularly. It is not a case of the Government's having made a genuine mistake; week in week out, there is not enough time to debate Bills in Parliament. One would have thought that, given that it is happening week in week out, the Government would have done something about it if they genuinely believed that the House was supposed to debate important matters. The fact that they do not do anything about it can only lead people to the conclusion that they do not want matters to be debated in the House: that they do not like being scrutinised, and do not want a proper debate to take place. If they allowed a proper debate, they might find that there were differing views among those on their own Benches, and they do not want to tolerate such a situation, so they filibuster by tabling needless statements such as that made earlier by the Justice Secretary&mdash;which did not need to be made today&mdash;in order to restrict the time available for debate on Bills such as this.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.1/3">Numerous constituents have raised with me such issues as assisted suicide, which has attracted a great deal of interest. Constituents on both sides of the argument have urged me to support their views. They expect these matters to be debated.</p>

	<p pid="a.59.0/1">My hon. Friend is making a very good case.

	<p pid="a.59.1/1">My hon. Friend is absolutely right. It is either incompetence on the Government's part, or a deliberate attempt to prevent a debate from taking place. The Government can choose which it is. I am quite relaxed about allowing them to choose whether it is incompetence or a deliberate attempt to stifle debate, but it is one of those two things.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.1/2">What am I supposed to say to my constituents who contact me about these matters, ask that these matters be debated, and urge that their own views be heard? Am I supposed to say, &quot;I'm sorry; this is the House of Commons, this is an important issue and the Bill was meant to deal with it, but the Government have ensured that there is not enough time for it to be debated, and so the view of the House has not been tested&quot;?</p>

	<p pid="a.59.2/1">Is not a bad situation made worse by the fact that debate on the timetable motion is taken out of the time for debate on the Bill? It would have been a little better if the 45 minutes for this debate had been ring-fenced, so that after that we could get on with the Bill.</p>

	<p pid="a.60.0/1">My hon. Friend is entirely right, and he was entirely right when he said in an earlier intervention that this type of thing was bringing the House into disrepute. The standing of the House of Commons is falling as every day goes by. We should be trying to do something about that. We should be trying to arrest the slide in public support for what goes on in this place. We should not be helping it to fall into further disrepute by not debating matters that are of great importance to our constituents. We are already considered an irrelevance by many people; we are making ourselves irrelevant by not debating particular issues because it might be inconvenient for the Government to have them debated. As we have heard, the business has been fairly light in recent weeks, and it will be so next week in particular, when it seems that the Government are scrabbling around trying to find business to put on in order to allow the House to sit. That would have provided a perfect opportunity to have proper debate of these issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.0/2">My constituents have raised these important issues and they expected them to be debated. I could not allow this debate to go by without making the point that the Government have prevented their being debated through their programme motion. We have two days set aside on the Order Paper. Given the way things have been arranged, it is entirely possible that we may reach almost none of the key amendments today and finish early tomorrow because the business ends particularly early, when we could have allowed time for some more of these issues to be debated. That would have been entirely possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.0/3">This business has been organised in such a way as to prevent debate on matters that are important to Members and our constituents. The Government should be ashamed of themselves. I am delighted that my Front-Bench colleagues have said that they will oppose this programme motion, and I will support them enthusiastically.</p>

	<p pid="a.60.3/1">No, because I want us to get on to the main substance of the debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.3/2">Let me address a couple of points. First, we spent 43 hours and 32 minutes in Committee, so <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1821" name="Douglas Hogg">the right hon. and learned Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham (Mr. Hogg)</phrase>, who is very concerned about process in this House, will know that proper scrutiny took place in Committee over several days, including an extra day. We have also allowed two days on Report. I will not take any lessons from the nationalists, who did not bother turning up to the Committee stage of the Bill. However, I will say to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1473" name="David Howarth">the hon. Member for Cambridge (David Howarth)</phrase>, who was concerned about the balance between amendments to the law of homicide and to incitement, that there were more names down in support of the amendment to the incitement provisions than in support of any of the amendments to the homicide law, which might indicate that people do want to have a proper debate on the incitement provisions.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.3/3">Finally, I say to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1756" name="Evan Harris">the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris)</phrase>, who rightly tabled new clauses to the Bill, that if a disciplined approach were taken by the Opposition&mdash;which I doubt, however&mdash;we might well get on to his proposals tonight, and he might hear some positive responses from the Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.3/4">Whether we reach all the parts of the Bill that are down for debate tonight is entirely in the hands of Opposition Members.</p>

	<p pid="a.65.3/1">'(1) The Secretary of State may apply to the High Court for a certificate ordering that an inquest be held in camera.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.3/2">(2) The Secretary of State may only apply for a certificate if he is satisfied that it would be necessary to prevent material or information being disclosed whose disclosure would be seriously detrimental to national security.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.3/3">(3) The court may only grant the certificate if it is satisfied&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.65.3/4">(a) that granting the certificate is necessary to prevent material or information being disclosed whose disclosure would be seriously detrimental to national security; and</p>

	<p pid="a.65.3/12">(8) The certificate may require that part of the inquest be held in camera and part in public, and the court must only issue a certificate requiring the whole of an inquest to be held in camera if the disclosure of material or information whose disclosure would be seriously detrimental to national security cannot be prevented in any other way.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.3/13">(9) Where a certificate has been issued under this section, the coroner or judge may at any time, taking into account any other measures that the coroner or judge may have taken, including measures to protect the identity of witnesses, admit to the proceedings any interested person he may specify, provided that he is satisfied that doing so will not lead to material or information being disclosed whose disclosure would be seriously detrimental to national security.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2009-03-23a.67.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1473" speakername="David Howarth" colnum="67"  time="017:55:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090323/debtext/90323-0010.htm#09032313000131">
	<p pid="a.67.0/1">We now turn, at last, to the issue of inquests without a jury. I use that term advisedly, because the central issue is not whether proceedings on inquests should sometimes have to be held in private&mdash;in some national security cases, there are certainly times when that should happen&mdash;but whether when somebody has died at the hands of the state, a jury that has been summoned should, at the behest of the Secretary of State or through some other procedure, afterwards be dismissed and removed from the case, so that the case in the inquest continues without a jury.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.0/2">Originally in this Bill&mdash;of course, there were proposals in a previous Bill&mdash;the Government proposed a procedure whereby the Secretary of State would simply certify that the inquest would involve a risk of releasing information that might harm national security, relations with a foreign power, the prevention of crime or the protection of witnesses, or that might involve &quot;other real harm&quot; to the public interest. That certificate would mean that the coroner would be instantly removed from the case and replaced by a High Court judge, and that any jury that had been summoned would be removed, too. The case would continue without a jury and, presumably, in private, excluding everybody from the proceedings, including the family of the deceased.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.0/3">There were protests from all sides about that proposal. It was wrong, first of all, because the Secretary of State decided everything himself on the certificate. Secondly, the grounds on which the Secretary of State could issue a certificate were far too wide. The real harm clause, for example, was very broad and it was confusing, because the Bill contains the exact same phrase later on which the Government admitted meant something different. Protecting witnesses sounded plausible as a reason for excluding the public, at least, from the full inquest, until in Committee the Government admitted under pressure from amendments that proposed giving a power to coroners to give anonymity to witnesses that coroners already have extensive powers to protect the identity of witnesses by the equivalent of anonymity orders and to impose all the special measures that are open to criminal courts when it comes to protecting identity and protecting witnesses. The broad grounds therefore made no sense.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.0/4">Thirdly, the removal of the jury raises a fundamental point. Juries do not come into inquests in many cases, but when they do, it is because the case is a crucial one&mdash;when someone has died at the hands of the police or in custody, and where there are serious questions about the responsibility of the state for the death. It is unquestionably a crucial part of public confidence in the state, the police and the Prison Service that there are ordinary people in the jury to make the judgments in such cases.</p>

	<p pid="a.68.0/1">Does the hon. Gentleman not agree that a crucial part of this issue is that juries can be a flipping nuisance to the Government in such circumstances?

	<p pid="a.68.1/1">I am afraid that the conclusion that I have come to is that that is right. I will come back to that point later, when I address how the Government have changed their proposals, because the changes have not dealt with that precise point.</p>
	<p pid="a.68.1/2">The fourth reason why the Government's original proposals were objectionable was that the family were excluded. A situation in which the family hear only the bare verdict and no explanation of what has gone on, after having been removed from the proceedings, is completely unsatisfactory. The family will not feel that any explanation of what happened was available to them, and are sure to have very little confidence in what happened.</p>
	<p pid="a.68.1/3">The Government have changed their proposals to some extent. The Secretary of State will still decide on the matter of the certificate. When the certificate is issued, it will still have the effect of removing the coroner&mdash;it is interesting to ask why Governments do not trust coroners, to come back to the point made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1852" name="John Gummer">the right hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer)</phrase>&mdash;but it will replace the coroner with the supposedly more trustworthy High Court judge. The Government have made a concession, which means that at that point, instead of the jury being removed automatically, the High Court judge will consider whether to remove the jury. That is the first change.</p>
	<p pid="a.68.1/4">Secondly, the grounds on which a certificate can be issued by a Secretary of State have changed slightly. The catch-all</p>
	<p pid="a.68.1/5" class="indent">&quot;real harm to the public interest&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.68.1/6">provision has been scrapped, but the other four grounds are still there.</p>

	<p pid="a.69.5/1">I take the view, on reading the clause, that the application must be intended to be much wider than national security, because all the examples that we have just heard might conceivably be caught by national security.

Basically, in United States law, and in some other countries, it would be possible for someone to bump off a person in the United Kingdom, but those countries do not want to go there because we have reciprocal arrangements.

	<p pid="a.71.1/1">That is entirely possible. There is interesting speculation, let us say, about the origin of the sub-paragraphs of clause 11(2)(a). One explanation is that they have to do with relations with the United States and friendly fire cases. However, another historical explanation has been given, and should perhaps be put on record. It is that objections came from the Metropolitan police because of what happened in the Rodney case, in which a young man was shot by the police. The inquest was not able to continue because of the problem&mdash;it was at least seen as such at the time&mdash;of wire-tap evidence not being admissible. There might have been other problems to do with the legality of intrusive surveillance. That is another possibility for the origins of the provisions.</p>

All the bits of evidence come together to build up a picture, and if one has only part of the picture, how does one explain the difference? One can explain it only if there is some means of finding out what was in the protected material. In practice, once the family had been excluded from the protected material, I do not think that it would be possible to let them into the rest of the case. That is a serious problem.</p>

	<p pid="a.72.0/1">I take the hon. Gentleman back to the Azelle Rodney case which, as he rightly pointed out, ground to a halt because of problems over intercept evidence. He will be aware that clause 13 allows intercept material to be admissible in inquiries in certified investigations, but if it were allowed in all inquests, surely that would easily sort out the Azelle Rodney case. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that it is extraordinary that the Government originally based their entire case in support of clause 11 on two inquests? One is now back on track; the other is that of Azelle Rodney, which could easily be resolved by allowing intercept evidence.</p>

	<p pid="a.72.1/1">I believe that the hon. Gentleman is correct. The whole issue could be resolved by generalising the principle that the Government have already conceded&mdash;the principle of allowing intercept evidence into inquests. The problem from the Government's point of view is that they will concede that point only when the jury has gone. That seems quite wrong and it comes back to the central problem. For some reason, the Government have concluded that juries are dangerous outsiders, which brings us directly back to the point made by the right hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal. It is as if the world could be divided into the reliable and the unreliable, and the easiest way, according to the Government, of finding out whether somebody is reliable or unreliable is to ask whether they are a servant of the state. If they are a servant of the state they are presumed to be reliable, and if they are an ordinary member of the public, they are presumed to be unreliable. That has only to be stated to demonstrate how ridiculous the position is.</p>

	<p pid="a.72.2/1">The hon. Gentleman will recollect that the Government's current position is that they are working towards allowing intercept evidence to be available in criminal trials with juries. We may never get there, but that is the stated intention. If they ever reached that point, it would be difficult to see how the argument in relation to inquest juries could be tenable any longer.</p>

	<p pid="a.72.3/1">That is entirely correct. I do not understand why the Government see this as the thin end of the wedge, when in the end they are in favour of hammering in the wedge completely.</p>

	<p pid="a.73.0/1">The Government seem to think there is some way in which the family could understand the whole case except for the most important part. That cannot be satisfactory.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.0/2">What can be done instead is for the coroner to take measures to protect the identity of police undercover agents and informers, for example, to make sure that those people are not endangered by the information's coming out, and when that has been done, to allow the family back into the proceedings. They will then find out the nature of the events that led to the death of their relative. They do not need to know the exact identity of police informers or of undercover officers to understand that.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.0/3">The Government's attempt to change their proposals should to some extent be welcomed, because they are moving on the issue, but like many other hon. Members I do not believe that they have moved far enough, especially on the crucial question of the jury and on families. What will happen when the Secretary of State says to the court, &quot;Judge, the following information is protected. Remove the jury in this case on the basis of what we tell you.&quot; What other information, at that point, will the judge have? The judge will have only the information from the Government. Given the nature of the proceedings, they will have to be held in camera, and will be practically unchallengeable.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.0/4">Even if the Government come up with a variety of reasons why the House should not accept our new clause 14, which is our attempt to put forward an alternative to the Government's proposal, it is entirely fair to expect them to justify their new proposals. For that reason, I shall seek at the appropriate time to divide the House at least on amendment 2, which has the effect of removing clause 11.</p>

Secondly, the Secretary of State's certificate will trigger consideration by a High Court judge sitting as a coroner. Thirdly, it will then be for the judge, not the Secretary of State, to decide whether it is necessary to hold an inquest without a jury or whether special measures with a jury would be adequate to protect the sensitive information concerned (with a right of appeal to the Court of Appeal.)&quot;</p>

	<p pid="a.74.1/1">Absolutely. The whole purpose of the Bill's provisions on coroners is to strengthen and improve how the coronial system operates&mdash;not least in respect of military inquests investigating cases in which relatives have lost loved ones who were serving the country. There will be a chief coroner, who will be a High Court judge, and a deputy coroner, and there will be much greater co-ordination between coroners; we will be able to provide a better service than what has been possible until now. Furthermore, there will be proper rights of appeal when there are concerns. It will no longer be necessary judicially to review coroners' decisions, because proper rights of appeal are embedded in the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.1/2">I fully understand the important points of principle raised by the issue&mdash;which is narrow, as I shall explain&mdash;of whether there will be circumstances in which the court might decide that the only way forward would be without a jury.

	<p pid="a.74.2/1">On the question of military inquests, the curiosity of the right hon. Gentleman's proposed changes is that the vast bulk of such inquests are already heard with no jury.

	<p pid="a.74.3/1">There is not a good reason in respect of the inquests to which the hon. Gentleman has referred.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.3/2">I shall detain the House without taking interventions to go through the changes that have been made. In respect of the system being set up, it is my wish that the occasions when the court&mdash;not Ministers&mdash;comes to the view that an inquest without a jury is necessary will be very few and far between, and we do not anticipate that military service inquests will be involved.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.3/3">I want to pick up the wording of the Bar Council and go through the fundamental recasting of the proposals. First, the criteria in the amendments have been significantly tightened. I shall come to the issue of the relationship between the United Kingdom and another country, but first I ask Members to look at amendment 94. Three criteria are set out. Paragraph (d) states that the Secretary of State has to be</p>
	<p pid="a.74.3/4" class="indent">&quot;of the opinion that it is necessary for the inquest to be held without a jury in order to avoid protected matters being made public or unlawfully disclosed.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.74.3/5">Not only were the criteria wider before, but the Secretary of State had simply to be &quot;of the opinion&quot;; now he or she would have to be</p>
	<p pid="a.74.3/6" class="indent">&quot;of the opinion that it is necessary&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.3/7">We have greatly reduced and tightened the criteria; what was generally regarded, including by me, as catch-all criteria have been removed altogether.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.3/8">There does not seem to be any argument in the House about the interests of national security or the prevention or detection of crime. As far as the relationship between the United Kingdom and another country is concerned, there is no suggestion whatever that such conditions should be used to cover up embarrassment on the part of the United Kingdom; that would be not only a preposterous but a worthless exercise for any Secretary of State, as I shall explain.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.3/9">In evidence to the Joint Committee on Human Rights, the Under-Secretary of State for Justice, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1682" name="Bridget Prentice">the Member for Lewisham, East (Bridget Prentice)</phrase>, set out in detail an example in which we had co-operated with a foreign country over the detection and interception of drug dealers; for the reasons given, that would not necessarily come under national security or the detection or prevention of a crime. If the circumstances of our involvement were to be disclosed, that could not only seriously disrupt our relations with that foreign country, but lead to a lack of co-operation on central issues relating to our and that country's interests.</p>

	<p pid="a.75.2/1">Unlike my party's Front Benchers, I am prepared to accept that there are a number of cases for which jury-free inquests can properly take place. However, the bar has been set too low. We have been told that the Secretary of State would have to be &quot;of the opinion&quot;; that is a low standard. If we look at the certification process when the coroner is making the determination, we see that the High Court judge has only to be satisfied&mdash;on the balance of probabilities, I suspect. If the right hon. Gentleman increased the test so that it involved satisfaction beyond reasonable doubt, I would be with him.</p>

	<p pid="a.75.3/1">I am grateful to the right hon. and learned Gentleman for his acknowledgement that there is a problem with which we must deal. There is, and that view is widely shared. We have made a fundamental change with these proposals, and to those who say that the parliamentary process does not work, I simply say that it does. Bluntly, these proposals are a million miles from how they started out in the original Counter-Terrorism Bill. Under the original proposals, the Secretary of State was to be of the opinion that there should be no jury, and his or her decision was to have been final&mdash;subject only to the possibility of judicial review. Furthermore, he or she would then have appointed the coroner. This Bill is completely different. I am certainly open to further consideration in the other place about how we should further tighten the criteria without losing the whole purpose of the measures.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.3/2">I turn to the second, really important limb. Even under the proposals originally presented by this Bill on publication, the Secretary of State was to have triggered the decision on whether there should be no jury&mdash;although the inquest was to have been held by a High Court judge rather than by an ordinary coroner; that was an improvement. I invite the House to turn to amendment 97 to see how these proposals differ. The Secretary of State makes a certification. There have been suggestions that the certification should be made by the court. However, the courts have always been reluctant to stand in the shoes of the Executive when it comes to judgments about national security. They do not want to make those decisions, as was made clear in a series of judgments, including by Lord Hoffman in the Rehman case.</p>

	<p pid="a.76.0/1">To the extent that the right hon. Gentleman is right, that still does not explain why the other criteria are still in the Bill&mdash;the criteria about relations with a foreign state or, especially, the prevention and detection of crime and protection of witnesses. Especially on the last two, the Secretary of State has no comparative advantage over the rest of the legal system.</p>

	<p pid="a.76.1/1">I understand the point that the hon. Gentleman is making. One could argue that those decisions should be made ab initio by the court, although I do not. The court will make the decision, but someone has to trigger the process&mdash;the court cannot start it of its own volition&mdash;by saying that there is a real problem; it could be the prosecution. There comes a point where an application is made to the court for it to make a decision about whether it is really essential&mdash;necessary&mdash;to dispense with a jury or to have other measures. At that point, the process set out in amendment 97 operates. As hon. Members on both sides of the House will see, it says:</p>
	<p pid="a.76.1/2" class="indent">&quot;The judge holding an inquest as part of a certified investigation must hold it without a jury if...there is a protected matter that would need to be revealed to the jury...in order for the jury to be able properly to discharge its duty&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.76.1/3">or</p>
	<p pid="a.76.1/4" class="indent">&quot;to avoid a breach of...Convention rights&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.76.1/5">and, under limb 2,</p>
	<p pid="a.76.1/6" class="indent">&quot;the judge is satisfied that it is necessary to hold the inquest without a jury in order to avoid the matter being made public or unlawfully disclosed.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.76.1/7">It is the judge who has to be satisfied. The next limb talks about circumstances in which the judge operates with a jury. The Bill plainly anticipates that it is for the judge to determine whether this is necessary.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.1/8">There is no way that any sane Secretary of State would, for trivial reasons&mdash;or for reasons of embarrassment to the Government, to pick up on the point made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1710" name="Elfyn Llwyd">the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd)</phrase>&mdash;sign an application and make a certificate only to have his head scrubbed by the learned judge for coming forward with an application that was trivial and unfounded. Applications will be made by the Secretary of State where he or she believes that it is necessary not to have a jury but the court comes to a different decision. I very much hope that that will happen, and the Secretary of State is put to proof. The court will anxiously examine whether there are any other measures short of dispensing with a jury that could meet the requirements of the law.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.1/9">One of the options that the court could consider is the so-called gisting of secret evidence to be put before the jury. Gisting, whereby the gist of secret evidence is summarised, has been used on several occasions; I understand that it was used in the de Menezes case. Some argue that if the de Menezes case proceeded satisfactorily without dispensing with a jury, that could apply in all cases. There may be cases&mdash;we think that there is one at the moment&mdash;where it is likely to be the judgment, on application to the court by the Secretary of State, that dispensing with a jury is necessary. The de Menezes case shows that the courts have been ingenious and imaginative in setting down certain conditions by which highly sensitive information is protected and, none the less, the jury is able to get to the full facts. One of the processes for that is the gisting of such protected matters.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.1/10">Under this measure, there is no question but that a certificate would be signed and there would then be an application to the court. It is the Secretary of State who is put to proof to make his or her case. I understand all the arguments made in favour of juries being used in these cases. The judge would, quite properly, lean over backwards to see whether it is possible to meet the concerns of the Secretary of State without having to dispense with a jury. Only in very exceptional cases&mdash;they would be few and far between, but they may arise&mdash;would the judge come to the view that a jury should be dispensed with.</p>

	<p pid="a.77.0/1">I have always appreciated that this is a difficult issue for the Government. The right hon.

Does not that rather weaken the new framework that he is trying to put in place?

	<p pid="a.77.1/1">What the hon. and learned Gentleman suggests is likely to be so in the vast majority of cases. I anticipate that the phrasing of the amendment means that applications will be few and far between, still more so the granting of those applications. That is a good thing, not a bad thing. I can envisage what may happen from my own experience of being responsible first for the Security Service and then for the Secret Intelligence Service and GCHQ, when some intercept or intercept-related evidence was so sensitive that one could not risk its going beyond a High Court judge. Any Secretary of State faced with that situation may decide to resort to not proceeding with an inquest but instead going down the route of an inquiry under the Inquiries Act 2005, which would have the effect of dispensing with a jury. That would be article 2 compliant, because there is no provision for juries in the European convention on human rights. This debate may be slightly uncomfortable, but I do not want to achieve that&mdash;I want to achieve a situation whereby the Secretary of State is never faced with that decision but always has to go to the court.</p>

The reason for having an inquest&mdash;one of the main criteria, as defined in the case of Amin&mdash;is to satisfy the families, not to provide an explanation for the benefit of the state alone, yet the system that is to be set up will never satisfy families. In those circumstances, it would be better to take the inquiry route, which would of course lead to a great deal of condemnation but would at least be clear that there is no attempt to skew the coronial system in a way that was never intended. I feel strongly that what he is trying to do, doubtless for good reasons, will undermine the system, not enhance it.</p>

	<p pid="a.78.1/1">The hon. and learned Gentleman has made an interesting choice. I commend him for doing so, but it is a much less acceptable choice than the one that I have made and commend to the House. Let us be clear about this. He is saying that there could be circumstances where it would not be possible to hold an inquest with a jury, and therefore it should be for the Secretary of State to decide to hold an inquiry under the Inquiries Act, with as much accommodation for the family as possible. I am powerfully committed to the use of juries in such cases, as in others, but it does not follow that an inquiry without a jury will never satisfy the family. The decision will be made by the Secretary of State and it cannot be tested except under judicial review. In this system, however, scrutiny by the court will be much more intense than it would be under judicial review, because it will be for the judge to make the decision not to review others' decisions.</p>

	<p pid="a.78.2/1">The problem with the planned system is that once it is on the statute book, it will be used far more frequently than any resort to inquiries under section 2 of the Inquiries Act. Once the system is an established procedure, it will be quite easy for Secretaries of State to make applications and, in a sense, to exonerate themselves from the onerous aspects of the responsibility. They will say, &quot;The procedure is there. Parliament has set it up. There are instances in which coroners inquests can take place without a jury, even though they ought to be one.&quot; If I may say so, the Government have approached this process from the wrong direction. Because of that&mdash;although I have some sympathy with the Government's position&mdash;we will support amendment 2 to delete clause 11. The Government have not made the case that the proposals are the right way forward. Other means already available, which do not require quite so much soul-searching on our part, may be used, but only in the most extreme circumstances. However, I fear that the provisions in the Bill will be used more often.</p>

	<p pid="a.78.5/1">With great respect, I have not even finished my sentence. Their position is very different from that taken by most of those who signed the amendment to delete the existing clause 11. The hon. and learned Gentleman accepts that there can be non-jury inquests, but he also says that their use should be determined by a Secretary of State under the Inquiries Act 2005 procedure, and not by an independent judge. His substantive argument is that the measures in the Bill would encourage applications, and that there would be more of them, but I do not accept that. I would be perfectly happy to have a small wager on it with the hon. and learned Gentleman. If he follows the approach of the courts, common law principles about open justice and the quite proper attitude taken by the High Court and the Court of Appeal&mdash;and ultimately by the Law Lords&mdash;he will understand that the idea that they will act as a patsy, or putty in the hands of a Secretary of State who thinks, &quot;Oh, there is a tiny embarrassment here. Let's go for a non-jury inquest&quot;, is frankly nonsense.</p>

	<p pid="a.79.0/1">I wonder whether the Lord Chancellor overstates a judge's latitude for determination in this matter. From my reading of amendment 97, the judge does not have the capacity to determine more than whether a protected matter would need to be revealed in order for the inquest to take place, and that it would therefore be necessary to hold an inquest without a jury in order to prevent it from being revealed. The judge does not appear to enjoy the clear latitude to determine whether the certification process that the Secretary of State undertook is, of necessity, correct. Perhaps I am misreading the amendment.</p>

	<p pid="a.79.1/1">I think that the hon. Gentleman is misreading it. The judge has to decide that it is necessary to hold an inquest without a jury to avoid the given matter being made public or being unlawfully disclosed. As the de Menezes case made clear, plenty of other measures can be used, including gisting, which is an important consideration, to ensure that those disclosure criteria are met.</p>

	<p pid="a.79.2/1">The concerns that we have all expressed about there being an open door on this matter are similar to those we expressed about surveillance issues. In that context, the Government assured us that such surveillance would be conducted only in narrow circumstances, but the door was then opened to a far greater use of surveillance. My right hon. Friend is dwelling upon a contradiction. He has argued that the court is loth to interfere and judge on matters of national security, but decisions in such matters will be dependent on the Government's interpretation of national security. Several of us are anxious that the jury system will be lost in such cases purely on the basis that the High Court will always allow the Government's argument in such instances.</p>

	<p pid="a.79.3/1">I understand my hon. Friend's point, but I would just say this: it will be for the Secretary of State to make a judgment on national security grounds, or the other grounds set out, but doing so does not determine whether a jury is dispensed with. The Secretary of State will have to go to the court, and it is for the court to say, &quot;We do not necessarily disagree with your judgment on national security&quot;&mdash;it may do, because it may think that it is unreasonable&mdash;&quot;but we disagree with your view. It is up to us to make the judgment, which is clearly spelt out in amendment 97, about whether or not a jury should be dispensed with.&quot; That is the difference. A crucial distinction is being made between the Secretary of State essentially initiating the application and the learned judge dispensing with it.</p>

	<p pid="a.80.0/1">The Secretary of State's defence would be easier to follow if he had not turned through 180 degrees. At the moment, he is telling us that the terms are all right because they are terribly narrow, but he has just told us that the amendment is light years away from what he wanted in the first place. He must accept that most of us approach his present explanation with a certain amount of suspicion. He started off wanting a huge opportunity to do what he wished; now he says that the remit will be very narrow. I put it to him again: would it not be better to have a system where, in such important circumstances, one would have to go down the potentially embarrassing route of having an inquiry? No Home Secretary would do that without considerable thought. That must be true, and the Secretary of State has made it true by starting off by asking for powers that were manifestly unacceptable.</p>

	<p pid="a.80.2/1">My right hon. Friend is right when he says that article 2 does not require a jury, but it is fair to say that the jury trial is one of the principal features of common law. He is also right to say that the Government have made a lot of progress, but that raises the question whether the changes were needed in the first place. The key point about article 2 is the need to involve families throughout. My right hon. Friend referred to gisting, and I put to him what happened in the Rodney case in which gisting featured and which the coroner ruled was inadequate. When I read the coroner's judgment, I questioned whether he took the right approach to that issue. If we analyse the Rodney case properly, rather than just looking at it as a piece of hard law, we may find that there may have been a different conclusion if the matter had been tested in the courts. Has my right hon. Friend looked at the judgment of Mr. Justice Weatherup in the Northern Ireland case of McCaughey, which sets out simply and straightforwardly the public interest immunity process, and which would solve my right hon.

However, is it not the case that despite the amendments that he has tabled, families, particularly of armed service personnel who have been killed, will still not be able to know in what circumstances their son or daughter was killed?

	<p pid="a.81.6/1">I do not accept that. We are talking about exceptional and difficult cases in which there is material that everybody agrees has to be protected. The family will not be excluded from an inquest save when the protected material is being dealt with. One can anticipate circumstances such as in the de Menezes case, when PII applications were accepted and some evidence was gisted, so neither the family nor the jury heard the full evidence. I am clear that in those circumstances, whether or not a jury is present, the coroner will lean over backwards to ensure that the family and jury are given the maximum information. There will also be special counsel in those circumstances to act on behalf of the family, although I know that that is not an adequate alternative. There is no requirement in convention rights for there to be a jury.</p>
	<p pid="a.81.6/2">I do not criticise people who make the judgment that there should be an inquiry under the Inquiries Act, but I believe that it is the wrong judgment. Exactly the same issues would arise, such as what evidence the family could hear. Deleting clause 11 would not deal with the problem that occasionally, inquests will be held without a jury and information will have to be gisted or summarised to the family. The difference is that the decision will be made by a judge under the Bill and would be made by the Secretary of State under the Opposition's proposals.</p>

	<p pid="a.82.4/3" class="indent">&quot;the relationship between the United Kingdom and another country&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.82.4/4">which causes me serious problems, I accept that they have tried to move yet further on the matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.4/5">The problem for the Opposition is that the Government have produced a beguiling proposal and said, &quot;We have moved as far as we can, and we think that this is the fairest system we can devise&quot;, and are asking for our support. However, another voice makes itself felt within me, saying that there is absolutely no point in setting up a process to bypass the ordinary principle of the coroner system&mdash;that there will be a jury, particularly in cases of death at the hands of the state&mdash;if the result is that it will not command public confidence and support. It seems to me that nothing in the proposals that the Secretary of State has brought forward solves that problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.4/6">If families are deprived of juries in coroners' inquests, those inquests will be devalued to the point that they effectively cease to be of any real use. I remind myself of what Lord Bingham said about the criteria by which coroners' inquests should normally take place, which bears repeating. He described those criteria as being</p>
	<p pid="a.82.4/7" class="indent">&quot;to ensure so far as possible that the full facts are brought to light; that culpable and discreditable conduct is exposed and brought to public notice; that suspicion of deliberate wrongdoing (if unjustified) is allayed; that dangerous practices and procedures are rectified; and that those who have lost their relative may at least have the satisfaction of knowing that lessons learnt from his death may save the lives of others.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.82.4/8">The principle is well established that &quot;brought to light&quot; means that the facts require public scrutiny.</p>

	<p pid="a.83.0/1">I am sorry to disagree with my hon. and learned Friend, but High Court judges often have to rule on matters between the state and the individual&mdash;for example, in fatal accident cases and public inquiries.

	<p pid="a.83.1/1">I take my right hon. and learned Friend's point. Speaking as a lawyer and a barrister practising in the courts, I have rarely had difficulty accepting High Court judges' verdicts and judgments. However, the sort of inquest that we are considering will be highly emotive, give rise to serious public concern and be surrounded by a great deal of polemic, and the moderating influence of a jury, which I have extolled in other contexts in the criminal justice system&mdash;it also applies to libel cases&mdash;seems to be highly effective in reassuring the public that what is happening is not a procedure that is merely for the convenience of state authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.1/2">I say to my right hon. and learned Friend that the Hutton inquiry into the death of Dr. David Kelly is a classic example of an inquiry that may have been impeccably conducted, but I know from my mailbag that it has never succeeded in answering or resolving some of the basic questions that arose from the case.</p>

	<p pid="a.84.0/1">I am doing my best to follow the hon. and learned Gentleman, but he has got himself into a cul-de-sac. His argument would be pukka, acceptable and internally consistent if he maintained that there were no circumstances in which it was acceptable to hold an inquest without a jury. However, that is not his position. His comments about Lord Hutton and an inquiry makes my point, not his, because exactly the sort of non-jury inquest that he supports is a one-off inquiry by a High Court judge, without all the procedural protections for which the Bill provides.</p>

	<p pid="a.84.1/1">I fear that the Secretary of State is not listening to me develop my argument. From the moment I mentioned &quot;inquiry&quot;, he seized on the word and played around with it rather despairingly to try to persuade me and the House that there is a serious flaw in my argument. I do not believe that there is.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.1/2">The inquiry route currently exists, but has hardly been used. When we considered 42-day pre-charge detention, we pointed out that the Civil Contingencies Act 2004 provided a mechanism in extremis for resolving an issue and extending detention, and that that was a better route than extension to 42 days. Although I have no desire for an inquiry to substitute for an inquest, if the problem is reduced, in the final analysis, to the one or two cases over a long period that the Government say they cannot take before a jury in an inquest&mdash;I still hope that ways to enable that to happen could be found, especially if we ever reach the point when intercept is admissible for all juries, and having vetted juries, if necessary&mdash;let the Government at that point come to the House, make a statement, after which there would doubtless be questions from hon. Members of all parties and polemic, and end up with the second best option. Although an inquiry may answer the Government's questions, I doubt whether it answers those of the public.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.1/3">The Secretary of State's model is unsatisfactory because the way such things work suggests that every time an inquest presents a difficulty, instead of trying to find every means of resolving it in the existing system&mdash;the onus and pressure being on the Government to act in that way&mdash;there will be a temptation to say, &quot;Well, we have a procedure voted on by Parliament, and we should go and see the judge, who'll make decisions and we may end up with an inquest without a jury.&quot; In my view, that is no better&mdash;and cannot be any better&mdash;than an inquiry, which will involve the polemic of the Secretary of State's coming here.</p>

Does he accept that that, in those circumstances, as with the Legionnaire's inquiry for which I called in 1984 in different circumstances, an inquiry can provide a suitable method of getting at the truth?

The Justice Secretary complains that the House cannot have it both ways, but we are not trying to: we are pleased that the Government have narrowed their case. However, the Justice Secretary cannot say that we should not be suspicious, given his starting point. Is not my hon. and learned Friend's solution therefore much safer?</p>

	<p pid="a.85.2/1">I agree entirely with my right hon. Friend. We cannot escape the starting point and we should not try to escape from the wording of clause 11(2) and the remaining wide criteria for making applications.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.2/2">I was struck by the comments and questions of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1875" name="Andrew MacKinlay">the hon. Member for Thurrock (Andrew Mackinlay)</phrase> because anxiety has been expressed about how the provisions would apply in a Northern Ireland context. When the Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office was taxed with the matter on <phrase class="date" code="2009-01-27">27 January</phrase> on BBC Radio Ulster, he said:</p>
	<p pid="a.85.2/3" class="indent">&quot;The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland has indicated that he does not wish to use these provisions in respect of historic Northern Ireland cases. The MoJ and the NIO will work together to sort out the practical arrangements required to sort out this approach.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.85.2/4">The impression conveyed at an earlier stage was that the Government would use the provisions in Northern Ireland because it suited their interests. However, I believe the Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office. The nature of such inquests in Northern Ireland is sensitive for a series of political reasons, and I have no doubt that the procedure that we are considering will never be used there because it is not deemed politically expedient that that should happen. However, that raises in my mind precisely the question why, if that can be done in Northern Ireland, where I have no doubt that public interest immunity matters will play a difficult part, we are apparently still being asked to enact the power in the wider context here. I am afraid that, for me, the matter comes back to the words in the wretched clause 11(2)(a)(ii) about</p>
	<p pid="a.85.2/5" class="indent">&quot;the relationship between the United Kingdom and another country,&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.85.2/6">which probably played a major role in the decision to introduce the provision in the first place.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.2/7">I may not have been in government over the past 12 years, but my experience of such legislation while I have been in opposition is that civil servants get very excited when it comes in, because they see it as a way of resolving all sorts of problems and getting them off hooks that they previously found difficult. They come along and put in a cornucopia of proposals, which then get transformed into something that completely overturns established principle and then, bit by bit, this House starts to ratchet them back.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.2/8">I am grateful to the Secretary of State for entering into the spirit of this evening's debate, which has proved to be very useful. My conclusion, which I invite my hon. Friends to consider, is that the provision simply is not necessary. Although there may be inconvenience, although problems will remain and although Secretaries of State may not enjoy coming to the House and, in extremis, having to announce that they are going down the inquiry route, the truth is that if the provision is not necessary, there are ways through the problem that do not do what I consider to be the genuine mischief, which is to undermine confidence in the coroner's court system.</p>

	<p pid="a.86.1/1">The hon. Gentleman makes some important points about other provisions in the Bill, which I was not going to look at. Nor can I give him a categorical assurance&mdash;I am not in a position to do so&mdash;about what might or might not happen, but I found the words of the Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office very interesting, because I am sure that he made them advisedly. He made them in the knowledge that although the power would be going to his right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, there would clearly be a political imperative for him that they not be used, even if it might be convenient for them to be used, because, I suspect, of the disastrous political consequences of that happening.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.1/2">I simply use that as an illustration of how there are other ways forward through the problem.

	<p pid="a.86.2/1">It is fair to say that the Government have been listening. The concessions that they have made are welcome, even if they have come somewhat late in the day and are not accompanied by explanatory notes or a human rights memorandum, which we would have liked. If it were necessary to have a special sort of secret inquest, the process advanced this evening would go a long way towards developing a model. It is not perfect, as has been said, but it could be improved. However, that prompts the question whether the provision is necessary in the first place. The Bar Council has fallen into error on that, because it has looked at the process, but not at whether the provision is necessary in the first place.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.2/2">So far we have heard about only one case, the Azelle Rodney case, which, coincidentally and unhappily for the Government, occurred in my constituency and in which I have therefore taken a particular interest. Mr. Rodney was shot by the police in Hale lane, outside a pub where a lot of bemused clientele watched a hail of gunfire, and a few rounds going astray. It was rather surprising that the police were quite happy to talk to the local press about what had been happening&mdash;it was all in the <i> Hendon Times</i> and the <i> Edgware and Mill Hill Times</i>&mdash;but now things have clammed up for inquest purposes. My constituents are, not unnaturally, interested to find out what is going on given that somebody was shot on our doorstep.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.2/3">As I said in an intervention, however, the real question is whether what is proposed meets the requirements of article 2. The jury is important for common-law reasons&mdash;not for article 2 reasons&mdash;but the most fundamental issue is the right of the family to be involved and to know what is happening. That is potentially lacking from the process. The Royal British Legion put the matter quite clearly in evidence to the Joint Committee on Human Rights, by saying, on the point about foreign Governments:</p>
	<p pid="a.86.2/4" class="indent">&quot;The objection of another country and/or diplomatic relations will be placed above the need for a grieving family to find the truth.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.86.2/5">That is basically the problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.2/6">We are also getting bogged down with the need for certainty in the way in which the issue is approached. An inquest does not proceed on the basis of something being beyond all reasonable doubt; it is not a criminal trial. The reason for holding an inquest is to find out what happened, what the circumstances were and what lessons can be learned, as has been said. An inquest is not a criminal process. Indeed, the Bill makes it clear that any inquest should not make judgments on criminal or civil liability. That is not what it is about.</p>

	<p pid="a.87.1/1">My hon. Friend makes an important point. In fact, I have tabled some amendments to clause 5, so perhaps he might want to wait to hear those arguments later. Otherwise, I might set off on a train of thought that would not be relevant to the point under discussion.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.1/2">The test for certification is still too broad. We are talking about not just intercept evidence but a wide range of intelligence material&mdash;and, indeed, other material altogether. There is the question of wider national security, but the real question is about relations with another country. The Azelle Rodney case, which is the only one that has been prayed in aid, did not concern relations with another country. The relations involved were those among the individual who was shot, his family, my constituents and Scotland Yard&mdash;pure and simple. We are told that the provision is about the protection of witnesses, yet the Bill includes a process for protecting witnesses in criminal trials that, if necessary, could easily be translated into a process for inquests. We are told also that the provision is about the prevention of crime, but again, similar processes in the Bill, in relation to the evidential basis for investigation, could have been transferred.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.1/3">The question we need to ask is this: if the scheme had been in operation five or 10 years ago, would any of the controversial inquests that have taken place in the past five or 10 years not have been allowed to proceed, even though they were able to proceed under the existing regime perfectly satisfactorily, to produce a verdict one way or another and to give the families closure? My concern is that if the process had been in place in, for example, the de Menezes case or the Corporal Matty Hull case, it would have been all too easy for the Secretary of State to make a declaration or a certification and then we would have been none the wiser about what happened in either case.</p>

Given the experience of the de Menezes case, it seems to me that no judge faced with a similar set of circumstances will agree to dispensing with a jury, because plainly a satisfactory inquest was conducted with a jury in the de Menezes case. I would ask my hon. Friend to take account of what is now proposed, not what was in the Bill.</p>

	<p pid="a.88.1/1">My right hon. Friend is right about that, but there is still the question of how the judge may decide the case. We did not have that problem in the de Menezes case to start with. The problem is that certification can be challenged only by way of judicial review of whether the Secretary of State was right in his decision to certify something as being against relations with another country. The judicial review test is, of course, an awful lot higher than a simple appeal, which would have been an option. <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> The burden is more difficult for the people making a challenge. One option might be to say that the High Court judge could look at the certification under the normal appeal process and decide whether it was justified, without its having to satisfy the judicial review test, which would require a much higher standard.</p>

	<p pid="a.88.2/1">My hon. Friend is arguing, in a slightly convoluted way, against going down the inquiry route proposed by the Opposition. The Bill, as amended by the amendments before the House, would provide for the court to make such decisions without a judicial review, which would certainly present a higher bar for the families. The Bill will enable the families to go before a High Court judge who is considering whether to grant a non-jury inquest on the basis of the trigger of the certificate. Because it will be for the judge, not the Secretary of State, to decide, it will be an issue not of judicial review principles but of the merits of the case. The bar would therefore be set much lower for the family than it would be under what my hon. Friend seems to be arguing for, or under what the Opposition are arguing for.</p>

	<p pid="a.89.0/1">I am not arguing for the Opposition's case; I am arguing for my own case. I think that my right hon. Friend has misunderstood my point. The decision that is challengeable only by judicial review is the decision to put the case into the special process in the first place. Once it is in the special process, other appeal arrangements might well apply. However, the decision to certify it as being required to follow this process&mdash;and therefore to run the risk of all the other consequences for the families&mdash;is subject to the judicial review test. If my right hon. Friend were to say that the threshold that the families had to meet if they wanted to challenge the decision to certify in the first place involved the normal appeal route, that would be different. However, that is not what is proposed in the amendments tabled by my right hon. Friend. That is a key issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.0/2">We can look at this question from a slightly different angle&mdash;in the context of the Binyam Mohamed case. The judges in that case would not go behind the Foreign Secretary's certificate over the material that came from the United States, even though they were clearly not happy with what they were being asked to do, because of the security considerations as certified.</p>

	<p pid="a.89.2/1">I am sorry&mdash;I do not want to get into a legal argument with my right hon. Friend. I am happy to engage with him, but it might be a sterile debate, because I think that he is looking at this through the wrong end of the telescope. I fully accept that, once a case is in the special process, there are other options for the family to challenge various decisions that the High Court judge might make, through the normal appeal process&mdash;the Court of Appeal and so on. However, that raises the question of why the case is in the special process in the first place. The family cannot go behind the decision to certify it on grounds of national security or relations with a foreign country except by judicial review. The problem lies in the original decision to put the case into the process. If the family wants an ordinary, bog-standard inquest, the only way they can challenge that decision is through the judicial review process. That illustrates the difference between my right hon. Friend and me on this issue.</p>

	<p pid="a.89.3/1">The term &quot;judicial review&quot; is being tossed around the Chamber here, there and everywhere. Does my hon. Friend agree that, for some families, there will be cost implications involved? It is all very well for the Government to say, &quot;You can have a judicial review&quot; or &quot;You can challenge this in court&quot;, but there will be cost implications for the families. It could be very expensive for them.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2009-03-23a.90.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1628" speakername="Andrew Dismore" colnum="90"  time="019:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090323/debtext/90323-0014.htm#09032338000169">
	<p pid="a.90.0/1">My hon. Friend is right. There is a little twist to the cost issue, and that is the availability of legal aid for representation at the inquest, although that subject has not been selected for debate. If someone wanted to apply for legal aid for a judicial review case, they might well have to go to the Legal Services Commission and ask for special permission. Such a request would ultimately come back to the Ministry of Justice to decide whether legal aid should be granted for such a special kind of case. So, in the end, the Secretary of State or one of his Ministers would make the decision about whether legal aid should be granted to challenge a decision by the Secretary of State in the courts, by way of a judicial review, on the original certification. That seems a little unfair.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.0/2">Moving on to the new process, the real issue is the involvement of the bereaved families. If we accept the proposed process, one issue that arises is the representation of those families if they are to be excluded from hearing part of the evidence. Would the judge coroner&mdash;for want of a better term&mdash;be able to appoint a special advocate to represent them? We know that the judge or coroner can appoint counsel to the inquest; that has always been the case. However, the purpose of that advocate will be to serve the inquest, rather than an individual party. In a complicated case, there could be half a dozen different parties, all fully represented by lawyers, yet the family might not be represented. One solution could be to have a special advocate process, but such a process would go beyond what is presently permitted by the system of appointing a counsel to the inquest. There should be a special advocate process in the Bill, to ensure that the article 2 requirement properly to involve the families is met.</p>

	<p pid="a.90.1/1">There is considerable merit in what the hon. Gentleman is saying, but what it amounts to is that, if the process were sufficiently safeguarded, he would accept that there were circumstances in which there could be a jury-free inquest.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2009-03-23a.90.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1628" speakername="Andrew Dismore" colnum="90"  time="019:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090323/debtext/90323-0014.htm#09032338000171">
	<p pid="a.90.2/1">As I have said, article 2 does not require a jury. The only basis on which one could argue that a jury is required is through the long traditions of the common law as it relates to the coronial process. We should not get too hung up on the jury issue. We should be much more worried by the fact that the key requirement of article 2 is the involvement of the family. I think that families would be a lot happier if there were juries in these cases, and the new process provides for a jury.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.2/2">However, my main argument with the Government is the potential for the exclusion of the family from hearing certain aspects of the evidence. The existing system provides ways round that problem. My right hon. Friend has already mentioned gisting, and we know that the coroner in the Azelle Rodney case looked at the possibility of using that process. We are all getting hung up on that one case, but there is an old saying that hard cases make bad law. The Rodney case is a very hard case, and I think that it could result in our making very bad law indeed. That case did not go to appeal; all we had was the judgment of the coroner&mdash;in fact, I think it was the deputy coroner&mdash;of Hornsey, Coroner Walker, who was given the gist of certain redacted material but not given the rest. There was no question of his challenging that decision.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.2/3">In the Northern Ireland case of McCaughey and Grew to which I referred, Mr. Justice Weatherup had to decide on that exact point. He stated very simply that the coroner was entitled to see the redacted material, and to decide whether it was of relevance to the inquest and whether it should be put before the inquest. That decision is then subject to judicial review by either side. The Government can challenge the coroner, but so can the family, depending on the ruling. That is not the only option. There is also the public interest immunity certificate process, which worked perfectly adequately in the de Menezes case, and countless others in Northern Ireland and elsewhere.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.2/4">The eighth report of the Joint Committee on Human Rights deals with the Bill. Paragraph 1.38 sets out a whole series of options available to the coroner. It states that the law</p>
	<p pid="a.90.2/5" class="indent">&quot;allows the Coroner to sit <i> in camera</i> on the grounds of national security (a very rare occurrence...), to rule on a claim of Public Interest Immunity...(a more frequent occurrence), to seek... undertakings of confidentiality from interested persons, to order reporting restrictions, and to order special measures for witnesses (including anonymity and provision to give evidence by video link)&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.2/6">There is a whole series of possibilities, and they have been used in many highly difficult, contentious, sensitive inquests, including the de Menezes case, the friendly fire cases and the inquests into the Nimrod deaths. It has been possible to deal with all those under the existing system.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.2/7">My main concern is that we are constructing a huge sledgehammer to crack a very small nut: one case&mdash;the Azelle Rodney case&mdash;which was probably wrongly decided by the coroner in the first place and not subject to testing through the appeal courts. If it had been tested in that way, the appeal courts might well have come up with a different ruling on how it should be processed, as we saw in the Northern Ireland case.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.2/8">Gisting might well be the answer to the problem. If the gist of the material were made available to a coroner's court, whether there was a jury or not, no state secrets would be given away about how the material had been collected. As we do not need to have a decision beyond all reasonable doubt, that might well be satisfactory for the purposes of article 2.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.2/9">Let me summarise my main argument. I am grateful to the Secretary of State for what he has done. He has moved a mountain in changing his proposals, but that still raises the question why we have to go through the process in the first place.</p>

	<p pid="a.91.0/1">It is not my primary intention to address the main question that has occupied the House so far in the course of this debate. That is not because I do not sympathise with the arguments put forward by my Front-Bench colleagues&mdash;I do, but they are able to deploy them effectively, as my hon. and learned Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1394" name="Dominic Grieve">the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve)</phrase> has demonstrated, and I feel no need to add to them.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.0/2">I would make two exceptions to that self-denying ordinance, Mr. Deputy Speaker. The first arises out of an answer that the Lord Chancellor gave&mdash;I was very surprised to hear it&mdash;to my right hon. and learned Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1821" name="Douglas Hogg">the Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham (Mr. Hogg)</phrase>, when they were engaged in debating the meaning of the phrase, &quot;the court is satisfied&quot;. My right hon. and learned Friend sought to place directly into the Bill the burden of proof required for the court to be satisfied, and the Lord Chancellor, to my very considerable surprise, said that it should be a &quot;matter for the court&quot;. Surely that should be a matter for Parliament; it is for Parliament to lay down the burden of proof, particularly on an issue as important as this one. It would then be for the court to decide whether that burden of proof has been satisfied. This point was reinforced by an answer the Lord Chancellor gave to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1628" name="Andrew Dismore">the hon. Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore)</phrase>. The main thrust of the Lord Chancellor's answer in that argument was that he was &quot;lowering the bar&quot; for the families, but how can we know whether the bar is being lowered if we do not know what burden of proof has to be met? There seemed to be a complete lack of consistency or, if I may say so, even logic, in that part of the Lord Chancellor's argument.</p>

	<p pid="a.93.1/1">I am grateful to my hon. and learned Friend.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/2">I am afraid that much of the rest of what I have to say this evening will be a repeat of what I said on Second Reading of the Counter-Terrorism Bill on <phrase class="date" code="2009-06-10">10 June</phrase> last year, as that Bill contained similar provisions to those I now wish to address, particularly those dealing with the proposed admissibility of intercept evidence at coroners' inquests from which the jury has been excluded.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/3">Now I have for quite a long time been in favour in principle of the proposition that intercept evidence should be admissible in proceedings before our courts, particularly our criminal courts. I set out my reasons in the debate on the Gracious Address in November 2007. I was delighted when, after the deliberations of the Chilcot committee, the Government finally accepted in principle that the case for admitting such evidence had been made.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/4">However, the Chilcot committee proposed a very rigorous series of safeguards, which it said had to be put in place before intercept evidence could be admitted in such proceedings without giving rise to significant risks to national security&mdash;and the Government accepted that when they accepted the Chilcot committee's recommendations. I recognise the need for those safeguards&mdash;a recognition reinforced by my role as a member of the advisory group of Privy Councillors appointed by the Home Secretary to monitor the implementation of the Government's decision and the Chilcot committee's recommendations on this subject.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/5">Of course, what I say today, as with what I said on the last occasion I addressed this issue, represents my views and mine alone&mdash;and I do not purport to speak on behalf of the committee. It is fair to say, however, that the painstaking work of the officials charged with implementing those recommendations&mdash;I come here to praise officials rather than to criticise them&mdash;has not been at all easy. There are a number of issues, the resolution of which is essential if the work is to proceed to a successful conclusion, but they have not yet been resolved. They must be resolved, but the Bill's provisions will make intercept evidence admissible in some inquests without showing any recognition whatever of the need for rigorous safeguards or of the need to deal with those issues. As far as the Bill is concerned, those issues might just as well not exist, but I cannot believe that that is either right or what the Government really intend.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/6">I thus pose this question, and I hope that either the Lord Chancellor or the Under-Secretary will deal with it in the course of their replies. Would it not be far better and far more sensible to postpone this particular provision until the officials working on the Chilcot committee's recommendations have completed their work, the Government have decided whether intercept evidence can be admitted in criminal trials and, if so, under what conditions, and a regime can be established and incorporated into our law to deal with the admissibility of intercept evidence as a whole rather than in the piecemeal fashion that this Bill provides for? I hope that I will receive an answer to that question.</p>

	<p pid="a.94.0/1">Ever since the underground fire in King's Cross station in my constituency in the 1980s, I have been pressing&mdash;first as an Opposition Member, then as a member of the Government and now as a Government Back Bencher&mdash;for reform of the coroners' system. Generally speaking, it is unsatisfactory, so I welcome most of the provisions in the Bill. It seems to me, however, that the coroner provisions are ruined by the proposition to hold what will effectively be secret inquests.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.0/2">I do not believe that my right hon. and hon. Friends on the Front Bench are wicked or sinister, and I recognise that they have to balance security and individual liberty, but I think that they are getting the balance wrong. I say that particularly at this time when they have quite rightly talked about rebalancing the criminal justice system in favour of victims and relatives. The secret inquests proposal is a rebalancing in the wrong direction, because inquests are all about victims and their relatives&mdash;they are the reason for the inquest system. If someone has been done to death, the truth needs to be brought out, victims' relatives and friends are entitled to know what happened, the public are entitled to have confidence in our system, and lessons are supposed to be learned. The proposition is that a Minister would certify that a normal inquest could be prejudicial to national security, to relations with another state&mdash;that is the bizarre one&mdash;to the prevention and detection of crime, and to the prevention of threats to jurors or witnesses. However, even under the amended system&mdash;I welcome the changes, compared with the original proposal&mdash;the Minister will go to a judge, and I do not know whether a single case can be quoted in which a judge has not accepted the Executive's statement that national security was at risk.</p>

	<p pid="a.95.2/2">Under the proposal, therefore, the state, in its manifestation as a Minister, could, in effect, order a secret inquest into a case in which agents of the state have killed someone or been in some way involved in the killing of a British citizen, or in which agents of another state have had similar involvement. That is not a sound position in which to place this country, especially as, to say the least, fresh in our minds is the acceptance by the previous Labour Prime Minister that Guantanamo Bay was apparently quite a decent place, or the involvement&mdash;to what extent we will never know&mdash;in extraordinary rendition, possibly involving the use of British soil, British citizens or people resident here. Let us suppose that someone had died while being tortured, or while being transferred following torture. I am not saying that that is what my good friend the Secretary of State intends, but it might happen, not necessarily under him but possibly under a successor.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.2/3">I accept the need to protect witnesses, and possibly to protect sources, but that can be done already. When the secret inquests proposition was first put forward, a then Minister said to me, &quot;There will be no chance of a de Menezes inquest unless we get this through.&quot; Then, lo and behold, the proposition is dropped, and there is a de Menezes inquest. Evidence on counter-terrorism arrangements was put to that inquest, which was relatively open, and some of the material was read to the family. I understand that the fact that that evidence was presented was welcomed by the police officers who shot Mr. de Menezes, because they felt that they had the opportunity to put their side of what happened and the circumstance in which they found themselves. Therefore, the victims were not the only ones who got some satisfaction from that arrangement. Such matters might be embarrassing, but they are not likely to reveal genuine secrets that would be a threat to national security.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.2/4">A secret inquest is no good for the relatives, no good for public confidence in the system at the moment, and would not be any good for learning lessons. What lesson could be learned, privately and secretly, from the secret aspect of an inquest involving extraordinary rendition? It might be, &quot;Don't creep to the United States.&quot; Inquests are an essential part of our open society.</p>

	<p pid="a.96.2/1">I shall be brief.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.2/2">First, I recognise that the Secretary of State has come a long way from his position last year. I served on the Committee that considered the Counter-Terrorism Bill, and strongly opposed the powers that it gave to the Secretary of State of an exclusive jurisdiction as to when a jury-free inquest should be held. That was wholly objectionable, for the reasons that right hon. and hon. Members have expressed during the debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.2/3">However, we must all ask ourselves one question: are there no circumstances in which one would hold that the presence of a jury was inimical to a full inquiry? I found that a difficult question, because I have always been, and I always am on the libertarian side of the argument. I hope that the House will allow me that. However, I served in the Foreign Office and the Home Office for seven years, and I am conscious from my time in government that there are matters&mdash;very few&mdash;that are not in the interests of the nation to be widely known. One needs to define those categories very strictly, and one needs to set them about with real constraints. I do not think that the Justice Secretary has gone far enough, but I believe that the process that he is putting in place is the right one, because he is allowing the judge&mdash;the coroner&mdash;to make the decision.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.2/4">I do not accept that a High Court judge would simply rubber-stamp the original certificate. We might be able to improve the process&mdash;<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1628" name="Andrew Dismore">the hon. Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore)</phrase> made a valuable point about the special counsel assisting the court on that specific inquiry. It is a process that we shall consider tomorrow in the context of the anonymity of witnesses. I have tabled amendments.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.2/5">We could raise the evidential bar so that a judge would have to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt. That is the burden and standard of proof referred to by my right hon. and learned Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1587" name="Michael Howard">the Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Mr. Howard)</phrase>. We could say that the Secretary of State should not issue the certificate unless he is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt. There are a number of things that we could do. The central question to which we must return, however, is whether there are some cases, albeit very few, in which it is not right for material to be made available to a jury.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.2/6">Let me say this to my hon. and learned Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1394" name="Dominic Grieve">the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve)</phrase>. If material is made available to a jury, even if it is provided in camera, the possibility must be contemplated that it will not be not confined to the jury, but will become public. At the end of the 1980s, I was an Under-Secretary of State at the Home Office. At that time, we had counter-terrorism legislation relating particularly to Northern Ireland. No doubt my hon. and learned Friend will remember the amendments that were tabled with the aim of preventing discovery of documents being made available to defence counsel and other lawyers.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.2/7">I had charge of that Bill, and we were faced with the considerable difficulty of determining whether there were classes of document that should not be disclosed to defence counsel. We decided that there were such classes of document, and it got me into terrible trouble. What I said in Committee&mdash;it was true&mdash;was that at that stage there were lawyers who were too close to terrorist organisations. Shortly thereafter, a man was murdered, the solicitor Mr. Finucane, and I was blamed for it. It has always been a great source of distress to me that people thought that I was associated with his death, but that was said of me. The truth is, however, that we reached the conclusion&mdash;I still believe it could be the case&mdash;that there are classes of document that must be held very close, and what we are discussing is that sort of case.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.2/8">I shall not vote against the Justice Secretary's proposals, because I think that they are moving in the right direction. I think that they can be improved, and I hope that they will be improved in the other place, but I hope it will be recognised by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1473" name="David Howarth">the hon. Member for Cambridge (David Howarth)</phrase> and my hon. and learned Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1615" name="Edward Garnier">the Member for Harborough (Mr. Garnier)</phrase> that although I am always on the libertarian side of an argument, on this issue I shall not be with them.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.2/9">Let me make one further apology, which I have mentioned to you, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I am afraid that I may not be present for the winding-up speeches. However, I shall be here to abstain in person.</p>

	<p pid="a.97.0/1">I thank the right hon. and learned Gentleman for at least being here now. The problem with his argument is clear when we examine amendment 97, especially what it asks judges to do. My experience of High Court judges is that they apply the words of the statute as given to them. If they apply the words of what would become clause 11(6)(b)&mdash;thinking in the way in which the right hon. and learned Gentleman thinks&mdash;they will always conclude that it is necessary to hold the inquest without a jury. What the judge is asked to do is satisfy himself, or herself, that</p>
	<p pid="a.97.0/2" class="indent">&quot;it is necessary to hold the inquest without a jury in order to avoid in order to avoid the matter being made public&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.0/3">If it is the case that juries are leaky in the way that the right hon. and learned Gentleman contemplates, surely that will always be the case.</p>

	<p pid="a.97.1/1">That is a fair point. My amendment 51&mdash;this makes me very reluctant to vote against the Secretary of State's amendment&mdash;is designed to secure a certification process which would enable the coroner to make the final decision.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.1/2">I am prepared to accept that the hon. Gentleman has made a good drafting point, but, while I recognise that drafting is the business of Parliament, let us stand back from the drafting for a moment, and ask where we stand on principle. All I am saying is that I believe that there is a small category of cases that are properly addressed by the kind of mechanism that the Secretary of State is introducing. I think that it can be improved in the way that I have suggested, and perhaps it will be improved in the other place, but because that category exists, I shall not vote against what the Secretary of State has in mind.</p>

	<p pid="a.97.2/1">I rise primarily with the aim of interesting the House in my amendment. It would strike out schedule 9, which effectively extends clause 7 to Northern Ireland. I also want to express some dismay, however. Clause 11, which is preoccupying the House this evening, is based on exceptional circumstances relating to national security, but seems&mdash;I am open to correction on this&mdash;not to extend to the kingdom of Scotland. It is as if, somehow, national security considerations such as the disclosure of documents and the involvement of relatives simply will not arise in Arbroath or Dunfermline.</p>

	<p pid="a.98.0/1">Scots law has always been different. It was different before devolution, and it is different now. They do not have inquests in Scotland, so the point is nugatory. In any event, if the people of Scotland want to change the law it is a matter for their Scottish Parliament, under the Scotland Act.</p>

	<p pid="a.98.1/1">I did not need the Lord Chancellor to explain the constitutional arrangements to me. I fully understand that which is devolved to the Parliament in Scotland; indeed, I support it. I am merely pointing out how ludicrous it is that such massive considerations should apply in England and Wales&mdash;I shall come to Northern Ireland in a moment&mdash;while there is no comparable anxiety in relation to Scotland. Of course I understand that the whole regime is different there, but this Parliament is not saying &quot;We need to ensure that there is protection of information in relation to what might be a heavily disputed death in Scotland&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.1/2">We acknowledge that, under the devolution legislation, matters of this kind are a competence for the Parliament in Scotland, and I have made clear that I support that, but why, in that case, are we legislating in relation to Northern Ireland? Schedule 9 amends an old Stormont Act, passed by the Northern Ireland House of Commons. That Act needs to be updated, but not in this sloppy way.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.1/3">Earlier, from a sedentary position, the Lord Chancellor told me another thing that I already knew: that there were special arrangements for Northern Ireland, and that we must do things differently. We do not have to do things in a sloppy fashion, however, which is what will happen if we incorporate schedule 9 in this legislation. There needs to be a root-and-branch review, and a bringing up to date, of the coroners legislation in Northern Ireland, and I think that the primary vehicle for that should be the Northern Ireland Assembly. However, if there are overriding considerations that should be ring-fenced or a matter for the United Kingdom Parliament for reasons of national security, there should be a separate instrument, or Bill, for that purpose.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.1/4">I hope that I made clear to the House earlier my charge that this is a sloppy way of legislating. In support of my case, I cite clause 5(2), which states that in order to avoid any doubt, an inquest must ascertain the full circumstances of a death. That provision is intended to prevent the Government from getting into trouble in connection with their commitments under the European convention. However, it does not extend to Northern Ireland, which, in my view, demonstrates that we are making flawed legislation which was ill thought out and not properly examined. That is why I want to interest the House in supporting my amendment, or comparable amendments, proposing the deletion of schedule 9.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.1/5">This is not just my brainwave. I rely on the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission, a statutory body set up by the House of Commons whose functions include a duty to review</p>
	<p pid="a.98.1/6" class="indent">&quot;the adequacy and effectiveness of Northern Ireland law and practice relating to the protection of human rights, advising on legislative and other measures which ought to be taken to protect human rights, advising on whether a Bill is compatible with human rights&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.1/7">The NIHRC has made it clear that article 2 is hit by the effect of this Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.1/8">I am not suggesting that the statutory NIHRC should tell us how we should legislate. It has not got a right of veto, and it is not a legislative body, but it has a duty to advise and a right to be heard. What is most serious is that it alleges that it has not been consulted about the Bill. It states:</p>
	<p pid="a.98.1/9" class="indent">&quot;As regards Northern Ireland, the inquest provisions of the Bill present a case of the worst of both worlds. Clause 38 extends the &quot;secret inquests&quot; provisions of Clause 11 without the extension of a number of the positive provisions of the Bill&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.98.1/10">that extend to England and Wales.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.1/11" class="indent">&quot;The explanatory notes which accompany the Bill state that:</p>
	<p pid="a.98.1/12" class="indent">'The legislative changes proposed in the Bill are part of an overall package of reform aimed at addressing the weaknesses in the present coroner and death certifications systems.'</p>
	<p pid="a.98.1/13" class="indent">Unfortunately this is not the case for Northern Ireland where the negative proposals in relation to inquests are not set out within a package of general coroner reform. While there has been administrative reform of the coronial system in Northern Ireland in recent years the governing legislation remains the Coroners Act (Northern Ireland) 1959.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.1/14" class="indent">The two most glaring omissions&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.98.1/15">one of which I have referred to already, are&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.98.1/16" class="indent">&quot;the failure to extend to Northern Ireland a broader definition of the purpose of an inquest&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.98.1/17">which is in clause 5, and</p>
	<p pid="a.98.1/18" class="indent">&quot;the failure to extend rights of appeal&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.98.1/19">to Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.1/20">I have twice urged the Government to reflect again. For one such intervention, the Under-Secretary of State for Justice, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1682" name="Bridget Prentice">the hon. Member for Lewisham, East (Bridget Prentice)</phrase> and the Lord Chancellor were present, and there was some confusion between them as to the extent of the legislation in respect of Northern Ireland. They are the architects of it so they should have been on the ball, but they were not certain&mdash;I do not want to rub it in, but they were demonstrably not fully apprised of the impact of their legislation. The Lord Chancellor kindly wrote to me afterwards reaffirming the line, which he has referred to earlier, that the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and his Minister of State say they will not apply this legislation to what they call the legacy cases&mdash;which, as we know, involve a sensitive issue that affects families, loved ones and the supporters of various traditions. As they said they would not use the powers, that begs this question: why not put it in the Bill that they will not exercise those powers? This raises another issue, too. If they will not apply the legislation to those legacy cases, why is Northern Ireland not left out? The matter could be left to be treated as a normal domestic legislative issue by the Northern Ireland Assembly. That principle applies for Scotland. The only case for extending the legislation to Northern Ireland is so that it can be exploited in order to deal with national security issues, and the Government should say so.</p>

That Justice Minister and devolved Assembly will then say, &quot;This has absolutely nothing to do with us. We are just the devolved authority and Minister.&quot; Does that not test the credibility of devolution in a most sensitive manner?</p>

	<p pid="a.100.1/1">Of course, I wholeheartedly agree. In terms of the legislation that was so recently passed in this place, I remember expressing concern to a rather empty House about what we were doing. I said it was ill thought out and it had not been adequately dealt with. We had even less time to deal with that Bill than we have had this evening, but we passed it. It seems to me that Members on the Treasury Bench do not understand what they are doing in relation to the constitution. If we devolve, it means that we have devolved and we should not be trying to claw back power.</p>
	<p pid="a.100.1/2">In any event, we have had no explanation from the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. Everything has been second hand, by way of a letter from the Lord Chancellor and gossip between Ministers sitting on the Front Bench when they have been challenged. This is not the way to make legislation and I urge hon. Members to join me, or others who succeed in calling a Division, in striking out the provisions that apply to Northern Ireland so that we can make better law instead. If necessary, we could pass precision law, which is targeted on national security issues, if they exist, but which leaves the good people and Assembly Members of Northern Ireland with the responsibility to deal with their coroners courts as they think fit.</p>

	<p pid="a.100.2/1">I rise to make a brief contribution, particularly on the issue of military inquests, in which I have a particular interest. I am a Wiltshire Member and it is the Wiltshire coroner who currently carries out the vast bulk of military inquests&mdash;although previously it was the Oxford coroner&mdash;because of the geographical peculiarity that our casualties from Afghanistan and Iraq are repatriated through RAF Lyneham in my constituency.</p>
	<p pid="a.100.2/2">I raised the matter of military inquests in Committee. The Under-Secretary immediately responded to my concerns about whether they would be subject to the Bill's provisions by saying that most military inquests already have no jury. She is to a certain degree correct, but she is also incorrect in that the Coroners Act 1988 stipulates that the coroner may ask for a jury in military inquests, although they only occasionally do so&mdash;I believe a case is at present being considered in the Court of Appeal. Therefore, she was not quite right that all military inquests have no jury, although many of them do not.</p>
	<p pid="a.100.2/3">What we are considering today is a special case. I welcome the fact that the Secretary of State has altered the provisions considerably since their introduction. I understand his point that incredibly few cases would fall under the provisions of clause 11&mdash;he anticipates one or two cases going through the designated procedures and going to the High Court. However, he is asking us to put on the statute book laws that a Secretary of State&mdash;not him, but someone at some stage in the dim and distant future&mdash;may use not for the laudable aims he has described, but for the much less honourable purpose of avoiding Government embarrassment and the like.</p>
	<p pid="a.100.2/4">In order to illustrate my point, it might be helpful if I focus on one recent inquest carried out by the excellent Wiltshire coroner David Masters. Although he has retired as a coroner, I am very glad he agreed to carry on as a particular specialist in military inquests. He will continue to hear some of those inquests as a deputy coroner.</p>
	<p pid="a.100.2/5">The inquest I have in mind is that into the tragic loss of Hercules XV179, which was on its way from Baghdad into northern Iraq, flying at an extraordinarily low level. It went down with 10 soldiers and airmen on board, all of whom were lost. Many of them were my constituents, or were at least based in my constituency. There are all sorts of peculiarities about XV179. The plane was flying at remarkably low level and it was on special forces duties. That has been made plain but a number of things about the special forces duties in the evidence given to David Masters were redacted, and perfectly happily so. Indeed, there were all sorts of secret things we never got to know about because they were secret and that is fine.</p>
	<p pid="a.100.2/6">Other peculiarities of the case included the fact that David Masters discovered that the Americans knew there was enemy activity in the area where XV179 was on that day, but they failed to pass that on to the British, so the pilot did not know that. Curiously, the Americans refused to come to the Wiltshire inquest and to give evidence to it, because they felt it might be embarrassing to them as they had failed to pass that intelligence on. It is clear that there had been a breakdown in intelligence between the two countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.100.2/7">As I said, there were a variety of very peculiar things with regard to Hercules XV179, so David Masters looked into them and he came to a perfectly satisfactory conclusion. He said that it was shot down by enemy fire&mdash;probably small arms fire; possibly a rocket-propelled grenade&mdash;and this was a tragic loss. The case had one other element and he looked into that too, concluding that had the plane been fitted with suppressant foam in the wing tanks, as all the Australian and American Hercules planes are, there is a chance that the tragedy&mdash;it is no certainty&mdash;might not have occurred. He was rather critical of the fact that the Government had not fitted the foam in the wing tanks, and he gave the Government quite a hard time over it. Of course, the Oxford coroner had recorded something similar with regard to the Nimrod case and two or three other military inquests of that kind.</p>
	<p pid="a.100.2/8">Although the Government say that the Bill's provisions are not designed in any shape, size or form to interfere with the coronial process, which worked extraordinarily well in the case of flight XV179, the circumstances of that case fit, without question, into the definitions as laid down in the Bill. It is perfectly possible that some Secretary of State in the future, seeking to avoid embarrassment for the Government over suppressant foam, to avoid upsetting the Americans over the failure of intelligence or to keep secret&mdash;perfectly properly&mdash;the fact that it was a special forces flight, might use any of those excuses to say to the High Court, &quot;These are important matters and it is important that we should not hear this inquest in public, because it is against the national interest.&quot;</p>

	<p pid="a.102.0/1">I understand the importance of the military inquests, particularly the case to which the hon. Gentleman refers&mdash;I happen to know one of the crew who was on that ill-fated flight. I can honestly say to him that I can provide him with almost complete reassurance because, as he will know, there has never been a jury involved in a military inquest. There have been more than 200 military inquests and the issue of juries has never arisen. It is hard to see in what circumstances it would arise.</p>

	<p pid="a.102.7/1">I am surrounded by Queen's counsel and learned&mdash;I am probably the only non-learned gentleman in the House this afternoon. <i> [Interruption.] </i><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1639" name="Frank Dobson">The right hon.

	<p pid="a.102.7/2">Am I not right in thinking that the Coroners Act 1988 itself stipulates that the coroner in military inquests may ask for a jury? That tends not to be the case but it is perfectly possible that some military inquests would have juries and therefore would become subject to the terms of this legislation. I am ready to be corrected by the very learned Lord Chancellor if my understanding is wrong&mdash;it is certainly also the understanding of INQUEST, which has raised the point with me. It says that it is perfectly possible to imagine that military inquests would be caught up by these provisions and that therefore at some future point embarrassing military inquests of the kind that I have described would be subject to secret hearings. I would be happy to accept the Lord Chancellor's assurances, but perhaps he could get some advice from those in the box on this. It might be that I am barking up the wrong tree and I would be happy to accept that I am. All of our advisers, including plenty of QCs in INQUEST and in the other organisations briefing us, advise us that there is at least a risk that that might be the case. For that reason alone, I shall join my hon. Friends in supporting amendment 2, which seeks to strike clause 11 out entirely.</p>

	<p pid="a.103.0/1">A number of hon. Members wish to speak and there is a lot of business to be got through, so I shall attempt my own exercise in gisting.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.0/2">The key issue involved here is that of public confidence, as other hon. Members have said. I was involved in the Ricky Reel case, which some may recall&mdash;my right hon. Friend the Lord Chancellor certainly will, because he was exceptionally helpful. A constituent of mine went missing following a racial attack and was subsequently found dead. It was a most distressing case in which the most critical issue for us was to ensure that the interests of the family were protected, that they gained as much information as possible and in the end at least felt that they had had a fair hearing. I also met the de Menezes family and their lawyers, and discussed some of the issues that arose out of that case.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.0/3">The concern that a number of us have is that although the Bill contains elements relating to coroners that we wholeheartedly support, because they are a significant move forward, on this clause 11 issue we share the view of the Royal British Legion. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1628" name="Andrew Dismore">the Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore)</phrase> read a quote from it, but he failed to include the first sentence. The Royal British Legion stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.103.0/4" class="indent">&quot;As long as Clause 11 remains in the Bill, we regret it may not be possible to dislodge the perception that crucial evidence will be heard behind closed doors.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.103.0/5">That is the key issue, because the provision is a step too far in terms of public confidence. It is regrettable because the system has evolved in a way that has adapted to the needs of national security and other issues&mdash;the de Menezes case certainly exemplifies that&mdash;without undermining overall public confidence. This measure would be a step too far and it would undermine public confidence.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.0/6">As my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1639" name="Frank Dobson">the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Frank Dobson)</phrase> has said, the whole panoply of methods was used in the de Menezes case. The High Court judge who was appointed to undertake the case was able to judge on public interest immunity applications, and he did so. However, he did so in such as way as to enable the process of evolution throughout that hearing, so that where he ruled in respect of PII that certain information was not to be provided, he also ruled that some information could be provided to the legal teams on the strict understanding of confidentiality and security. In that way, at least some element of confidence was maintained that the family was having access to that information. My key point is that their own lawyers, whom they had appointed, were able to see that information.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.0/7">I can understand why people are arguing for the introduction of special advocates, but they have not had the public confidence that is instilled when one appoints one's own lawyer. I was involved in the early Special Immigration Appeals Commission cases when the Sikh gentlemen were arrested, and the key issue was that the special advocate was not able to communicate the full range of information to the person they were meant to be representing. At least in the de Menezes case there was a line of communication and where there was a common agreement that only certain information was provided, the idea of gisting was brought forward and summaries were provided to the family, and in that case confidence was maintained.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.0/8">I am concerned that the processes that the Secretary of State has brought forward to improve on the original proposals certainly do not go far enough and do not tip the balance in maintaining public confidence. In parliamentary procedural terms there is a phenomenon called Strawism, whereby one produces a Bill that throws in the entire kitchen sink and is so outrageous that the House recoils from it, and one then introduces a series of amendments and Members skip through the Lobby happily, thinking that they have obtained major victories and amendments. This is not an example of Strawism in extremis, but it is close to it. I do not think that the Bill has gone far enough in protecting the interests of the families&mdash;those who have lost loved ones&mdash;and in maintaining public confidence. On that basis, clause 11 needs to be withdrawn, and that is why I shall support amendment 2.</p>

	<p pid="a.104.0/1">We have heard something very important from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1624" name="John McDonnell">the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell)</phrase>. As usual, he made his case strongly, but he also introduced a new term. We have heard of Thatcherism and Blairism: we now have Strawism. No doubt we will look back with fondness on this occasion on which it was first used.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.0/2">I am probably the only hon. Member here who has acted as a coroner. In my early days I was an assistant coroner. I was taught always to empanel a jury if the case was complicated or there was any possible involvement of the state or a public body, whether by negligence or act of omission or commission. My senior partner then&mdash;he is now the main coroner for the district&mdash;always believed that we had to shed the maximum amount of light on the evidence.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.0/3">The whole purpose of the coronial system is to discover what happened in relation to the death. Specifically, if there is the possibility of an act of omission or commission by an authority&mdash;be it the police or anyone else&mdash;it is vital that that happen. Over the years I have also acted as an advocate at inquests many times. After hearing all the evidence, the family leave the court able to reach the conclusion of the grieving process. In many cases, the grieving process remains open until the coroner's verdict or the jury's verdict has been delivered and the family knows, having heard all the evidence, what happened. To those of us who have not lost close family or other loved ones and who have not been through the process, it may sound difficult to believe, but I can assure the House that hearing all the evidence does very much assist in the grieving process.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.0/4"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1639" name="Frank Dobson">The right hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Frank Dobson)</phrase> mentioned the issue of confidence, and that is the main building block of the coronial system. There are some good ideas in the Bill. Indeed, there are good and bad coroners, as there are good and bad in every walk of life. We must weed out the bad ones.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.0/5">The right hon. Gentleman said that PII certificates might not work because the judge might not grant them. That decision would be appealable, so it is unlikely that anyone would withdraw from the proceedings simply on that basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.0/6">Some 10 or 12 years ago, there was an arson campaign in Wales. Some of the individuals were caught and charged, and appeared before Caernarvon Crown court in north-west Wales. It was a unique case in that MI5 was heavily involved in tracking those guys down. MI5's evidence was redacted, gisted and subject to PII certificates, but the jury followed it adequately. Nobody&mdash;prosecutor or defence counsel&mdash;complained about the fairness of the proceedings. I suggest that that is one reason why we could look at the panoply of existing ways we could achieve justice. At that time, there was a fragile peace in Northern Ireland, and the identity of the MI5 agents had to be protected at all costs, because not to do so might have had fatal results. It worked, and nobody has ever complained about how that trial was conducted. Justice was achieved in that case.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.0/7">I am very concerned about clause 11(2), which refers to the relationship between the United Kingdom and another country. I mentioned in interventions that the deputy coroner for Oxfordshire has made many loud complaints about the inability of the US air force to deliver the videos of the fighter pilots unfortunately mistaking UK troops and dispatching them. The coroner was brave in raising those concerns in public, but I suspect that he did so because he was unable to get anywhere in private with the US authorities. His only avenue then was to make the issue public. I guess that his actions would be caught by this provision, and it would be enough for any Secretary of State to apply to minimise any embarrassment for the US.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.0/8">I am not casting aspersions on Ministers&mdash;it is not part of my function to do that&mdash;but clause 11(2) covers the &quot;relationship&quot; between the UK and another country. Embarrassing that other country would undermine the relationship, so that would be the effect of the wording, unless Ministers can tell me otherwise.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.0/9">Along with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1821" name="Douglas Hogg">the right hon. and learned Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham (Mr. Hogg)</phrase>, I am a member of the Criminal Bar Association, and it was refreshing to hear the Secretary of State praying in aid that organisation. Far be it from me to suggest that he was desperate for support, but he certainly cited its opinions a lot, and fair play to him. We are fortunate to have an independent judiciary, and we are extremely fortunate that members of the High Court bench are prepared to tell the Government when they go wrong. That is refreshing, and it is how a democracy should work, with the separation of powers.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.0/10">If I have understood the process correctly, the Secretary of State will issue a certificate and the High Court judge will decide whether it should proceed. I suggest once again to the Secretary of State that the PII certificates work day in and day out in our courts&mdash;I mentioned the case at the Crown court in Caernarvon. Alongside that we have that other process we have heard about today of gisting&mdash;a wonderful word. It has been in the public domain before, but it has been very much in evidence today. Why not use that process too? The Jean Charles de Menezes inquest employed all those techniques, and it seemed to work all right. Have we not learned anything from that experience that can inform our approach? If we employ all the safeguards&mdash;the judge will undoubtedly have in mind the need to ensure a fair trial, that there is equality of arms and that both sides of any dispute are heard fully and properly&mdash;that inquest proves that we do not need this legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.0/11">My greatest fear&mdash;I do not know whether it will apply to military inquests&mdash;is that there is no doubt that families will feel short-changed if they do not have the right, and I use that word advisedly, to have a jury trial in the coroner's court when there are these complicating features. Yes, that trial should apply all the safeguards because, as was said earlier, of course juries can leak.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.0/12">I would not want anybody's life to be imperilled by national security leaks&mdash;of course I would not&mdash;but as a lawyer I do not see the need for this provision, given that we have the existing provisions and just need somebody to pull them together. It is not beyond the wit of a High Court judge to do that easily and comfortably and to ensure fairness. A High Court judge has been appointed because he or she is probably at the top of the legal tree anyway&mdash;they are not there for any other reason&mdash;and they are there because they have very special qualities. Given that they have very special qualities, surely they could ensure that we could avoid using this particular provision.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.0/13">My biggest problem is that people will feel short-changed, hard done by or whatever phrase we want to use. Families will not feel that the matter has been heard properly, and I think that that is the worst possible thing that could happen. Given the reason why coroners' courts are convened and given the fact that families deserve to be told the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, I believe that it is those families' common law right, as mentioned by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1628" name="Andrew Dismore">the hon. Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore)</phrase>, to be entitled to have a jury hear their case.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.0/14">The hon. Member for Hendon, who is Chair of the Joint Committee on Human Rights, referred to several things that the Committee had suggested in its concluding paragraphs&mdash;no fewer than nine, or maybe 11, suggestions that would add to the panoply of provisions that we already have. I think that this part of the Bill is flawed. I said that on Second Reading. I am as concerned now as I was then, and although I acknowledge, with great respect, that the Secretary of State and his team have moved in a certain direction, I think that the other place will make them move even further.</p>

	<p pid="a.106.0/1">I shall be brief, because I want just to raise a few issues about clause 11. There has already been a great deal of debate on that clause. At the outset, I should say that I recognise that the Secretary of State has moved a very long way from where he was on Second Reading. He has introduced significant changes. The Bill contains a great deal of good in the part that deals with coroners, but I still have a problem with clause 11. It is pretty obvious that the provisions of clause 11 will come into play only in some contentious&mdash;and then inevitably high-profile&mdash;cases. That is inevitable. It is more critical than ever in such cases that we ensure that the families of those people for whom the inquests are held are satisfied with the way in which they are held.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.0/2">I am still not clear about how we can be sure that the families will be properly represented. I hope that I will hear an answer later in this debate. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1628" name="Andrew Dismore">the Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore)</phrase> raised the question of special counsel&mdash;whether there will be a special advocate. The Secretary of State referred to a special advocate for the inquest but did not mention anything similar for the families. It is even more important that the families' legal representatives are able to take part fully in the process and that, if necessary, legal aid is made available.</p>

	<p pid="a.107.0/1">The hon. Gentleman will know that new clause 31, which I tabled but which has not been selected for debate, proposed precisely that&mdash;legal aid for those whom the coroner chose to designate as deserving of it. I hope that that new clause will be taken up in the other place.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2009-03-23a.107.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1902" speakername="Neil Gerrard" colnum="107"  time="020:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090323/debtext/90323-0017.htm#09032338000212">
	<p pid="a.107.1/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for that point. It is critical that we do not reach a situation where a family cannot be properly represented, and represented in two ways. First, how are they represented at the point of certification and how is it possible for them to be involved in challenging the process of certification? Secondly, if certification goes ahead and an inquest is held at least partly in private, how in the families' absence will their legal representatives be involved in hearing that evidence?</p>
	<p pid="a.107.1/2">I am also still far from clear on what ills the change is supposed to cure. Two cases have been referred to&mdash;one in which an inquest was held up, and another in which the inquest is now going ahead. That is all. It is suggested that they were the trigger for the powers. I have not heard a long litany of cases in which there have been problems. Indeed, some very difficult cases have gone ahead, with safeguards in place to make sure that some evidence was not made public. I need to be convinced that the measures are the only way of dealing with the one or two problem cases.</p>
	<p pid="a.107.1/3">The Secretary of State says that only one or two cases will be dealt with in such a way, but in clause 11&mdash;even the revised version, once his amendments are made to it&mdash;there are quite broadly drawn criteria that could be used if an inquest without a jury is sought. The criteria include protecting national security or a relationship with another country, and preventing or detecting crime. It seems that to some extent we are dealing not with problems that have occurred but with hypothetical problems that may occur in future, and that always makes me nervous in legislation. It always makes me nervous when we are sold legislation on the basis that something may happen in future to make it necessary; we should rather be able to point to a real problem that has happened and needs to be corrected.</p>
	<p pid="a.107.1/4">The Secretary of State says that uses of the power will be few and far between, and that the judges will decide, but I am not sure that I can read the minds of High Court judges and say what they would do in future, when faced with representations from a Secretary of State that an inquest should take place without a jury. I am not sure, either, what counterweight there would be to the Secretary of State's propositions when the judge comes to make the decision if, as I suspect, the family will not easily be able to make counter-representations. I need to be convinced that the current inquest procedures to protect sensitive material cannot continue to be used.</p>
	<p pid="a.107.1/5">Finally, I want to reinforce the point made by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1624" name="John McDonnell">the Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell)</phrase> about public confidence. One of the most sure and certain ways of destroying public confidence in a process is for the public to believe that things are being hidden from them. A few years ago, I recall dealing with the case of Zahid Mubarak, although not in the context of an inquest. He was a constituent of mine who was murdered by a racist cellmate while in Feltham young offenders institution. One of the worst aspects of the case was the continued resistance of the Home Office to holding a public inquiry. It was only after the matter had gone to the House of Lords that the family were able to get a decision made to hold a public inquiry. That poisoned the case&mdash;the belief that what was happening was an attempt to keep secret what was going on.</p>
	<p pid="a.107.1/6">That, I suspect, will be the consequence of inquests that the public perceive to be happening behind closed doors. It will be much harder for the state&mdash;the Government&mdash;to persuade people that there has been a fair process, and that there is not something going on that people want to hide. That is an important consideration in trying to maintain the integrity of the coroner system; people must feel that it is working and that its findings can be trusted.</p>

	<p pid="a.108.0/1">I want to follow on from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1902" name="Neil Gerrard">the hon. Member for Walthamstow (Mr. Gerrard)</phrase>, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1639" name="Frank Dobson">the right hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Frank Dobson)</phrase>, and the hon. Members for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd), and for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell); the latter introduced the concept of Strawism, and made an important point. I have been in the House for a very long time now&mdash;30 years, I think. During that time, an Official Secrets Act was brought forward. I remember that the first intimation, or leaks&mdash;that is frequently how Governments are run&mdash;were that Lord Hurd, as he now is, was about to introduce into the House a truly draconian measure. When the Bill was published there was such relief that the full weight of all that had been leaked was not to come about that the House almost passed it with a sigh that this was a major improvement. It is true that sometimes our fears are too great, so any concession inclines us to be more respectful of the measure before us.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.0/2">I have difficulties with the Bill and they centre on clause 11. The right hon. and hon. Members whom I mentioned spoke about a profound principle in our system of law and liberty. The circumstances into which a coroner may inquire are the most obvious ones. We would want to know the circumstances leading to someone's death in the protection or custody of the state, and whether the death was murder, whether it occurred in suspicious circumstances, and so on.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.0/3">There is a wider public interest in that matter, not just the family, although one understands and reaches out because the death of a member of the family is of crucial importance to the family and to neighbours and friends. It is also of crucial importance to us as a society. Why bother to have coroners' courts if we are not interested in the circumstances of an unexpected or unexplained death that happens in our midst?</p>
	<p pid="a.108.0/4">Clause 11 has been said to deal with secret inquests. Indeed, it does invoke secrecy,</p>
	<p pid="a.108.0/5" class="indent">&quot;in order to protect the interests of national security&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.0/6">Who are we to argue what national security constitutes? That, essentially, has been the argument of the Executive through the ages. We must determine that because we cannot know what it is that we must secure in the national interest.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.0/7">We have moved on from that. I give the example of the injunction that the Nixon Administration tried to secure against <i> The New York Times</i> in the case of the Pentagon papers. The American authorities insisted that there could be no revelation of the papers, which went to the security and heart of the American state. They dealt with the Vietnam war. A judge decided the matter and the papers were published in <i> The New York Times.</i> No state fell. America progressed and retreated from Vietnam.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.0/8">What was in the public interest? Was the secrecy in the public interest? &quot;National security&quot; was the cry. Absolute national security was what the Nixon Administration demanded. They were denied it by the independence of a judicial process. Looking back 40 years later, did the world end? No. But the result was greater public knowledge and a wider public perception of national public policy. It could therefore be challenged, debated and understood.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.0/9">The second reason given for an inquest to be held without a jury is the relationship between the United Kingdom and another country. From memory, this and the preceding reason appear in our Official Secrets Act. I remember from the debates that the relationship between the United Kingdom and another country was a contested matter. These matters are vital to everyone's interest&mdash;every citizen of this country and everyone who is concerned about public policy. These are considered greater interests than the ascertaining of the death of a person by the judgment of two people. The Secretary of State, or the Justice Minister, or the lord high panjandrum&mdash;he has so many responsibilities&mdash;puts the notion before a judge. The judge will determine what the public interest is, but many of us feel that it is for Parliament to decide what the public interest is in matters of this nature. The rule of law must be open and above board, preventing or detecting crime to protect the safety of a witness or another person, or preventing real harm to the public interest. This, however, is a whole bag that catches everything that is inconvenient&mdash;perhaps only that&mdash;to those who administer the state.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.0/10">As I said, I have been here a long time. There was a time when the attestation of a public interest immunity certificate, for instance, was almost an absolute assertion. One learned from the unravelling of the Scott inquiry that judges did not necessarily look behind the public interest immunity certificate; in fact, they quickly back-tracked. We are told that now judges take a determined interest in a public interest immunity certificate. However, there were all the arguments leading up to the Scott inquiry, which was about the standing of Britain&mdash;whether we had exported arms and whether the process had been correct. Scott's judgment was that two Cabinet Ministers had failed in their constitutional duty to keep the House informed.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.0/11">It may seem that I have wandered widely from what happens in a coroner's court. But a coroner's court is no less a part&mdash;and a very important part&mdash;of our freedom. It is a safeguard that ensures that the state cannot just override the inconvenience of someone's death or something that has happened to someone. It tells us the actual nature of what our real public policy is. That, I think, is why the provisions that I have been discussing are in the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.0/12">The Secretary of State's argument is that the interests of our country may not always coincide with the rule of law. We are talking about Executive, Crown appointees who use prerogative as the foundation&mdash;although much circumscribed by the House over time&mdash;through which there can be protection in respect of the inconvenience of the public, united, disagreeing with their judgment on what public policy should be. That is the tension that lies in secrecy about great matters. We are talking about the death of a citizen, and the reasons set out in the Bill are important. We should not take clause 11 or the processes that get us there lightly. Is it not better to know that when such a certificate is brought into place, it is open to real challenge?</p>
	<p pid="a.108.0/13">I have learned a new word: &quot;gisting&quot;. I thought that &quot;gist&quot;&mdash;the &quot;gist&quot; of something&mdash;was only a noun. Just think about it: the &quot;gist&quot;. That is not the facts.</p>

	<p pid="a.110.1/1">The hon. Gentleman says that it is &quot;spin, spin&quot;. I do not accept that it is necessarily intended to be that, although we are well accustomed to spin. But each one of us does a pr&eacute;cis of things. I remember it from school; we were marked on the quality of our pr&eacute;cis, and we did not always do a good one of the central facts. I do not doubt that clever judges and those educated and powerful in the law, which I certainly am not, can make a better fist of things than I did as a schoolboy.

	<p pid="a.110.2/2">I said in Committee, and say tonight, that we must approach two principles in this debate. First, is it within Parliament's contemplation that in an investigation into a death where there would be an inquest with a jury, there might be protected matters of such sensitivity that the inquest could not proceed with the jury? It is reasonable for some parliamentarians to conclude that there are no circumstances in which we should allow the inquest to proceed without a jury, and hon. Members who have come to that conclusion should clearly oppose these provisions. I come to the other conclusion.</p>

	<p pid="a.111.0/1">When this matter was discussed in Committee, what defence was given for the idea that we should have secret inquests where they involve matters of relations with other countries that may have legal systems that are nowhere near the standard that we would wish or expect?</p>

	<p pid="a.111.1/1">I am not the Minister defending such proceedings. However, national security involves relations with other nations, and the argument is that the Bill's definition of national security alone might not protect some of the exchanges of intelligence with other states' Governments that would involve matters of shared national security&mdash;theirs and this country's. That was the Government's reason for extending the provisions beyond the phrase &quot;national security&quot;, but it is not my explanation.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.1/2">The first principle concerns whether there might be circumstances where there are protected matters that mean that a jury could not be empanelled in order for the inquest to proceed. I am fortified in coming to my conclusion rather than that of those who disagree with this by the fact that there are apparently, even today, inquests that are stalled because of such a situation. As we have heard, there have been two such instances in the past. It is true that in one of those cases the impasse has recently been resolved and the inquest is going to proceed, but the other one is still stalled. If there is already a case before we pass this law, it is within our contemplation that there could be cases in future.</p>

	<p pid="a.111.2/1">The case that has been stalled has no international dimension whatsoever&mdash;it is about a straightforward police shooting.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.2/2">May I put a hypothetical case to my hon. Friend? Let us suppose that somebody is in detention in Pakistan and is tortured, and there is an allegation that the British secret services were complicit; that that individual is then rendered by, say, the United States to Morocco, where they are tortured again and there is a suggestion that the British secret service supplied questions; and that he then ends up in Guantanamo Bay, where he dies of his injuries. That is the case of Binyam Mohamed; he survived, but let us suppose that he died. Is that the sort of case that my hon. Friend thinks might be caught by these provisions?</p>

	<p pid="a.111.3/1">I agree that these are serious issues. However, even the new clause recognises that there might be matters of national security that form the basis for saying that protected matters can arise. I do not think that it is helpful to get involved in an individual case.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.3/2">The second principle is that it is surely the Executive's responsibility to identify protected matters, subject to an unreasonable decision being capable of challenge in the courts through judicial review, but it is the judiciary's responsibility to determine how to conduct judicial proceedings. The Government try to make that distinction in the new proposals. A judge making a determination on how to conduct an inquiry in the knowledge that protected matters have been identified by the Executive will have before him or her what has been called the panoply of powers short of not having a jury at all, and the Bill may add new powers to that panoply. The judge could consider the measures that have been discussed tonight and determine whether some of them would be sufficiently effective to safeguard the protected matters so that the inquest could continue with a jury.</p>

	<p pid="a.112.2/1">The point that the hon. Gentleman made in Committee applied to national security, and I could follow that.

	<p pid="a.112.3/1">That brings us back to judicial review, I am afraid. That would be the answer to someone saying, &quot;This measure does not prevent crime or protect the life of a witness&mdash;the Executive are being unreasonable in saying such a thing.&quot; That would be a matter of challenge through judicial review.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.3/2">When people say that the measure is still not right, and that work needs to be done in the other place, what comes to my mind are the remarks of the Secretary of State, when he said that a judge would bend over backwards to use other powers so as not to exclude a jury from an inquest. The amendment does not use words &quot;bend over backwards&quot;, but equally it does not use a qualification that would be recognised in legal terms to ensure that a jury would not be empanelled only in an in extremis case. In that sense, a bit of work might still need to be done on the measure.</p>

	<p pid="a.112.4/1">May I take the hon. Gentleman back to the point he made about judicial review? In the light of his answers to the Liberals' questions, does he accept that a judge would not be in a position to judge the merits of the Government's decision?

	<p pid="a.113.0/1">With the leave of the House, I should like briefly to respond to the points raised in the debate before <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1473" name="David Howarth">the hon. Member for Cambridge (David Howarth)</phrase> concludes it.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.0/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1587" name="Michael Howard">The right hon. and learned Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Mr. Howard)</phrase> mentioned intercept evidence and asked why we were not waiting for the Chilcot review before accepting intercept evidence in special inquests in the circumstances described in clause 13. I am in exactly the same position as he is, because I want to be very cautious about allowing intercept evidence to be made available in criminal trials.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.0/3">As I think the right hon. and learned Gentleman will recall, there is already provision in the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 for limited exceptions to the prohibition of the evidential use of intercept, which is set out in section 17 of that Act. Those exceptions are enclosed proceedings before the Special Immigration Appeals Commission or the Proscribed Organisations Appeal Commission and the making of control orders under the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005. Of course, inquests are civil, not criminal proceedings, and Chilcot was directly related to concerns about criminal proceedings. I suggest that what we are doing is consistent with the precedent that has been set in the cases of SIAC and POAC.</p>

	<p pid="a.113.1/1">But surely the Secretary of State would accept that the provisions in RIPA predate the Chilcot committee, all the work that is currently being carried out and the importance attached to those safeguards. Now that we know that the Chilcot committee has reported and that officials are working through its recommendations with conscientiousness and care, the situation is different from that which pertained when RIPA was enacted. Given what is happening now, we ought to wait for the result of those investigations before legislating in this way.</p>

	<p pid="a.113.2/1">The right hon. and learned Gentleman's point would be a good one if inquests were criminal proceedings, but they are not. They are civil proceedings, and there is a much stronger parallel with POAC and SIAC&mdash;I believe that he established the latter process. Precisely because RIPA preceded Chilcot, we have those precedents in section 18 of that Act.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.2/2">I wish to provide <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1926" name="James Gray">the hon. Member for North Wiltshire (Mr. Gray)</phrase> with reassurance about whether non-jury inquests could apply in the case of military inquests. If he looks at clause 7(2), he will see the circumstances in which a jury must sit in an inquest. They are essentially cases in which there has been a death in state custody or resulting from an act or omission of a police officer or member of a service police force, or a death</p>
	<p pid="a.113.2/3" class="indent">&quot;caused by a notifiable accident, poisoning or disease.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.113.2/4">A senior coroner has the discretion to have a jury, but those criteria apply to state custody deaths or similar circumstances. They are simply irrelevant to military deaths, which arise in quite different circumstances. That being the case, the trigger in amendment 94 could not be fulfilled. That amendment sets out that the Secretary of State may certify an investigation under various criteria, including, as stated in proposed paragraph (b), if</p>
	<p pid="a.113.2/5" class="indent">&quot;the inquest will (if the investigation is not certified) be held by a senior coroner with a jury&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.2/6">I can therefore provide the hon. Gentleman with the absolute assurance that he seeks.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.2/7">On the central issue, I say to my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1639" name="Frank Dobson">the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Frank Dobson)</phrase> and other hon. Members that I understand their use of the term &quot;secret inquests&quot;, and we are certainly talking about inquests that will receive secret evidence, parts of which will be held in camera. However, it is common ground among all parties that there would have to be parts of inquests held in camera even if they were before a jury. The only part of such inquests that will be held in private, without the family being present, will be when there is protected evidence. When that takes place, counsel would be appointed to the inquest and directed by the coroner to take the responsibility of representing the family's interests and to test the evidence that could not be disclosed. I appreciate that that is second best, but the process has been used in plenty of other circumstances relatively satisfactorily.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.2/8">Under the set of procedures that we have discussed, the Secretary of State certifies, and the matter then goes before a judge to determine&mdash;I stress to hon. Members that it will be for judges to decide; amendment 97 plainly anticipates the judge's holding an inquest without a jury on the established criteria and if he is satisfied that it is necessary to do that to avoid the matter's being made public or unlawfully disclosed, and the next limb anticipates an inquest with a jury. I emphasise to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1833" name="David Kidney">the Member for Stafford (Mr. Kidney)</phrase> that the central issue will not be the certificate but its effect. The certificate simply triggers the application, so it is hardly necessary to go behind it, although the learned judge will want to know the reasons for it because they will be germane to the evidence to be protected. The question then is whether there are ways in which to protect the material other than being without a jury.</p>

	<p pid="a.114.1/1">Because the Secretary of State may be concerned about the need to protect the information. However, we do not believe that the Secretary of State should be the determining individual, who decides whether to dispense with a jury. I know that my right hon. Friend is sceptical about the independence of the judiciary, but, as someone who has been rolled over in judicial review after judicial review almost weekly since I became a Secretary of State 12 years ago, I believe that the courts are very independent, and on precisely the sort of issue that we considering. I remind my right hon. Friend of the excoriating judgments by the Law Lords about control orders. If the courts were a patsy, they would have said, &quot;Fine, we'll simply accept them.&quot;</p>

That is the only reason for my saying that the existing system is better than what the Secretary of State has devised.</p>

	<p pid="a.115.1/1"><i> Hansard </i>will show something different.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.1/2">The hon. and learned Gentleman also said that, when necessary, he preferred the Inquiries Act route, whereby the Secretary of State determines whether to dispense with a jury, to the Bill. I believe that the proposal whereby any decision by a Secretary of State has to be tested before and by a judge is much less likely than his to end in juries being dispensed with. I am glad to say that on that, if on few other issues, I have the full backing of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1821" name="Douglas Hogg">the right hon. and learned Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham (Mr. Hogg)</phrase>, who made it clear that the process that we are putting in place is correct.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2009-03-23a.115.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1473" speakername="David Howarth" colnum="115"  time="021:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090323/debtext/90323-0018.htm#09032343000649">
	<p pid="a.115.2/1">The whole debate has been dominated by two things. One is public confidence in the verdicts of inquests, which is related to the issue of the jury. Without a jury, how can we have confidence that verdicts in such cases will not be a stitch-up, especially given the circumstances in which juries are called into being in inquests in the first place? That was the point made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1624" name="John McDonnell">the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell)</phrase>, among others.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.2/2">The second issue is about whether families are excluded from the process. Throughout his remarks, the Secretary of State never satisfied me or anyone else in the Chamber on that point. He had several goes at it, but in the end it came down to this: somebody else might, in certain circumstances, represent the family. That issue, which was raised by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1639" name="Frank Dobson">the right hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Frank Dobson)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1902" name="Neil Gerrard">the hon. Member for Walthamstow (Mr. Gerrard)</phrase> among others, goes to the heart of whether what has been proposed really protects victims and their families. I am certain after hearing the debate that it does not.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.2/3"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1710" name="Elfyn Llwyd">The hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd)</phrase> made several important points, especially about cases in his experience where the security services have been involved. He also pointed out the simple fact that the cases that we are talking about are those that involve deaths at the hands of the state. That is why we need the widest possible use of juries in such cases. That is the counterweight to what <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1833" name="David Kidney">the hon. Member for Stafford (Mr. Kidney)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1821" name="Douglas Hogg">the right hon. and learned Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham (Mr. Hogg)</phrase> said about cases in which there might be some nervousness about using a jury. We need to think about what those cases are. They are cases of deaths at the hands of the state in the first place.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.2/4">Whenever someone says that there are cases where the jury has to be excluded, they never come up with a convincing example. The one example of a case where the process is frozen, which the hon. Member for Stafford mentioned, is one that has nothing to do with national security. However, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1628" name="Andrew Dismore">the hon. Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore)</phrase> mentioned, in that case things seem to have gone very badly wrong legally.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.2/5">The other remark from the right hon. and learned Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham that made me nervous was his assumption, which I think the Government share, that juries are inevitably leaky. If one follows the wording of what is proposed, it would mean that a judge, even bending over backwards, would be unable to allow the jury to continue in the case, because he or she would have to conclude that the protected matters would end up being made public.</p>

	<p pid="a.116.0/1">The hon. Gentleman may have shared my experience, but I was trying to rack my brains to think of instances in the past where vetted juries doing espionage cases were alleged to have spilt the beans in the public domain afterwards, and I simply cannot think of any such example.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2009-03-23a.116.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1473" speakername="David Howarth" colnum="116"  time="021:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090323/debtext/90323-0018.htm#09032343000651">
	<p pid="a.116.1/1">I could not think of one either. We briefly discussed vetting juries in Committee, but the Government's only reply was that the standard for vetting juries for espionage trials and terrorist cases would be too low for such inquests. I find that just incomprehensible.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.1/2">In the end, the debate comes down to the point that the hon. Member for Hendon made. The crucial question is this: if the process now proposed by the Government had been in place in the past 10 years, would it have affected important inquests such as the de Menezes inquest? Would the Government have asked for the jury to be removed? I have no doubt that they would have asked for that and that they would have put in place that certification. The Government's only defence is that perhaps the Secretary of State would have been found to be mistaken by the judge and perhaps the judge would have applied the words of the statute in a way that would not be justified and overturned the Secretary of State's judgment. That seems highly unlikely, given what is being proposed this evening and&mdash;this is the point that the hon. Member for Walthamstow made&mdash;given that the only arguments and evidence before the judge at that point would be those of the Government. We are talking not just about national security, but about that broad range of items, which are not those about which the Executive would have better knowledge than anybody else.</p>

	<p pid="a.116.2/1">On the question of relations with other countries, what does the hon. Gentleman think would be the definition of a good relationship? Would it be a question of whether the country was a dictatorship or a democracy, or whether it fulfilled all international requirements? Or would it simply come down to issues such as arms sales and the murder of British people in those countries?</p>

	<p pid="a.117.0/1">All experience shows that it is the latter. It would be up to the Secretary of State to decide that on the certificate, and there is no way of getting behind that certificate in court.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.0/2">There is broad scope for the abuse of these powers. The question that the hon. Member for Hendon asked needs to be answered in the affirmative: yes, it would have made a difference if these powers had existed sooner; and, yes, it would have resulted in more inquests being held without juries. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1370" name="Richard Shepherd">the hon. Member for Aldridge-Brownhills (Mr. Shepherd)</phrase> said, the only conclusion that one can draw is that we must excise clause 11 from the Bill. There might be better ways forward, and there might be other ways of doing this. We do not know what the Government might propose if we were to excise the clause, but excise it we must, in order to allow further and better debate on this subject in another place. I therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw the new clause, although I wish to press amendment 2 to a vote.</p>

	<p pid="a.125.2/1">The new clauses respond to the calls from service families in Scotland, as well as Members of the House&mdash;particularly my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1976" name="Adam Ingram">the Member for East Kilbride, Strathaven and Lesmahagow (Mr. Ingram)</phrase>, who has pressed us in this regard&mdash;for action to enable fatal accident inquiries into the deaths of service personnel killed abroad to be held in Scotland when their families are based there. The new clauses will do that by amending the Fatal Accidents and Sudden Deaths Inquiry (Scotland) Act 1976 to allow fatal accident inquiries to be held in Scotland for those who are killed abroad while on active service, or while supporting, or involved in the training of, those on active service. This means that in most cases their families will not need to travel to England to attend an inquest.</p>
	<p pid="a.125.2/2">We have been examining this issue for some time with colleagues in the Ministry of Defence and the Scotland Office and with the Scottish Executive. These discussions were still ongoing at the time of the Bill's introduction, which is why these provisions were not included earlier. I am very grateful for the support of my ministerial colleagues and others, and for the co-operative and constructive way in which this matter has been dealt with.</p>
	<p pid="a.125.2/3">There is currently no legislative basis under Scottish law for the Lord Advocate to investigate any death abroad. Current arrangements enable investigations to be held in England and Wales into deaths of all service personnel killed on operations, because fatalities from Iraq and Afghanistan are repatriated via either RAF Brize Norton or RAF Lyneham. Therefore, the inquests have been carried out by the local coroners in either Oxfordshire or Wiltshire. Families based in Scotland, however, have had to travel to England for inquests, which has caused them extra difficulties when they already have to cope with the burden of bereavement and concern about the circumstances of their loved ones' deaths. These new clauses will rectify that problem, and put Scottish families in the same position as other families in England and Wales, where, when it is appropriate, the investigation is transferred to the coroner closest to the family's home.</p>

	<p pid="a.126.0/1">Is there any reason why Scottish families cannot secure a fatal accident inquiry in Scotland for Army deaths that occurred in England? This is a main recommendation of Nicholas Blake in his Deepcut review; it is suggested that there should be easy access for Scottish families in this respect, too. Is there any reason whatever why this cannot happen for Army deaths that occur south of the border?</p>

	<p pid="a.126.1/1">The hon. Gentleman makes an important point.

	<p pid="a.126.2/1">I thank my hon. Friend for her kind reference to me and the effort I have put into this matter. When we deploy forces, they are now deployed on the basis of a comprehensive approach, so there could be personnel from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office or the Department for International Development, or civilian police or prison officers, alongside armed forces personnel. Will the proposed change to the law include such other personnel, because it seems to me there should be no differentiation? I appreciate that my hon. Friend may not be able to answer that question now, but if she were to give some thought to it and provide a response later, I would appreciate that.</p>

	<p pid="a.126.3/1">Again, my right hon. Friend makes an important point, and he has been campaigning on this issue for some time. My understanding is that the Bill is drafted in such a way that a person in that situation would be subject to this change in the law if they were a civilian subject to service discipline. If there are issues beyond that, I will write to my right hon. Friend about those outwith that range.</p>

	<p pid="a.126.4/1">I am very grateful to the Minister for her succinct and clear explanation of the new clause. As she points out, we discussed this in Committee, and she mentioned at the time that there is still work to be done on it and that she would come back to the House on Report.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.4/2">I want to clarify a couple of points. If the body of a deceased serviceman or woman from Scotland is repatriated to the UK, that would probably be through RAF Brize Norton or RAF Lyneham and, as the hon. Lady pointed out, it makes a great deal of sense for the body then to be moved to Scotland to be repatriated to the family. Presumably there would then be a fatal accident inquiry in Scotland&mdash;that is what the Bill allows for. One also presumes that increasingly in such tragic circumstances the body would be flown straight to Scotland. Will there be reciprocity under the new clauses? For example, if the body of an English serviceman or woman is repatriated to Scotland, would, as I presume, the arrangements work in reverse? I believe that that is covered by new clause 34, but perhaps the Minister could clarify that particular point. Presumably new clause 35 is consequential, because most of it appears to flow from the earlier new clauses and most of it is of a technical nature.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.4/3">On that basis, Conservative Members support what the Minister is doing, because it makes a great deal of sense, the Ministry of Defence has been pushing for it for some time and it fits in with what we discussed in Committee. We decided in Committee that it was far better that inquests of servicemen and women who have served this country with such courage and loyalty should take place, where possible, in the home towns or cities of the bereaved families. It is only right that those inquests should take place nearest to where the families live, and that includes servicemen and women from Scotland.</p>

	<p pid="a.127.0/1">I welcome these important new clauses, and I congratulate the Minister on achieving agreement with the Scottish Executive&mdash;I know that that was not particularly easy. My interest stems from the experience of a family in my constituency who lost their son, Lance Corporal Allan Douglas of The Highlanders, in Iraq. Following his death, the family received excellent support from the Ministry of Defence and Army personnel to help them through their difficult time. They were told that there would have to be a coroner's inquiry, that it had to be held in Oxford&mdash;almost 450 miles from Aberdeen&mdash;and that it might not happen for another two years. The stress that that put on the family was considerable&mdash;I saw it at first hand. We managed to get the inquiry accelerated, but it still caused immense stress.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.0/2">I wish to ask the Minister a couple of questions. In that particular case, the family took the view that they did not want an inquest, because they already knew everything that there was to know about their son's death, and it was being dealt with as a single inquest. In Scotland, it is part of the process that the procurator fiscal take into account the views of the family when consideration is given to a fatal accident inquiry&mdash;that is a matter of process, rather than being statutory, but I know from my own experience as a practising solicitor how valuable that is. It does not mean that the family has a right of veto, but their views are taken into account, and that is extremely important, psychologically, in the difficult circumstances. I know that the arrangement is not written into this Bill either, but it would be helpful if the Minister could give some consideration to that.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.0/3">The proposed new section 1A(7) set out in new clause 35 makes it clear that there can be circumstances when deaths will not be referred to Scotland, and it would be helpful if the Minister would outline what they might be. I am interested in new clause 33, which sets out the circumstances whereby the Lord Advocate may be notified, either by the chief coroner or the Secretary of State, that an inquiry should be held in Scotland. What happens if it is the other way round? Is there a process whereby the Lord Advocate notifies the chief coroner or whoever?</p>

	<p pid="a.127.1/1">I should like to put on record the fact that the Liberal Democrats welcome these changes, given that they will clearly make life much easier for the families involved. As has been mentioned by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1737" name="Henry Bellingham">the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk (Mr. Bellingham)</phrase>, we discussed this at length, on occasion, in Committee. Will the Minister confirm that the provisions in the new clauses will be taken alongside those elsewhere in the Bill that allow cases to be transferred from coroner's area to coroner's area depending on which is the most convenient for the family involved?</p>
	<p pid="a.127.1/2">Given that the rest of the Bill applies to England and Wales specifically, and this provision now includes Scotland, will the Minister confirm that cases would be able to be transferred between Scotland, England and Wales, depending on the preference of the family involved? Given the difficulties experienced by families, I am glad to see that the new provisions have now been agreed.</p>

It was a very moving ceremony for the families, all those who attended and everybody who worked at or had a connection with the station. Ten of the 14 personnel lived in Scotland, and most of them lived in Moray. However, not long after their return to RAF Kinloss, the bodies were flown back to RAF Brize Norton for the subsequent coroner's inquest in Oxford.</p>
	<p pid="a.128.0/3">The new clauses will rectify shortcomings that were vividly displayed by the experiences of families who lost loved ones aboard Nimrod XV230. Since 1968, the MOD has repatriated service personnel who died abroad, but in those 41 years no one has sought to rectify, or has succeeded in rectifying, the anomaly that sees the legal system of England and Wales play its part in explaining overseas military death while the Scots legal system does not. The consequence is that families already traumatised by the loss of a loved one have to travel hundreds of miles to attend coroner's inquest proceedings in Oxfordshire, Wiltshire or elsewhere, and suffer substantial delays caused by the backlog of cases.</p>

	<p pid="a.128.2/1">My hon. Friend has been a doughty campaigner in support of the Collinson family. The Bill not only addresses the issue of fatal accident inquiries in Scotland, but recognises the wish in England to see proceedings take place as close as possible to people's homes. I hope that the Minister is alive to the possibility of that happening after fatal accident inquiries are up and running in the case of military deaths outside Scotland.</p>

	<p pid="a.129.1/1">The right hon. Gentleman had the chance to make a speech, but he decided not to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.1/2">In Scotland in particular, I pay tribute to Justice Secretary Kenny MacAskill and Lord Advocate Elish Angiolini, who have worked hard to make this day possible, at the same time as undertaking a wholesale review of the fatal inquiry system. At Westminster, I had much contact with the previous Defence Secretary, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1996" name="Des Browne">the right hon. Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun (Des Browne)</phrase>, and more recently with the Minister for the Armed Forces and the Under-Secretary of State for Justice, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1682" name="Bridget Prentice">the hon. Member for Lewisham, East (Bridget Prentice)</phrase>, as part of formal and informal efforts to secure a change to current practice. All who have been involved in getting to this stage tonight have made a huge step forward in righting a wrong. Service families will finally be put first. These improvements to the inquest and inquiry systems are clearly too late for the families of Nimrod XV230, but their support and perseverance in the campaign to make these common-sense changes happen is a tribute to them, and it will be a stark improvement in the experience of the inquest system for families in the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.1/3">Shona Beattie, whose husband Flight Sergeant Stephen Beattie died aboard Nimrod XV230, said in advance of today's proceedings:</p>
	<p pid="a.129.1/4" class="indent">&quot;It is really good news that the Scottish Government has made substantial progress with the UK Ministry of Defence and these changes will become law.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.129.1/5">She also said:</p>
	<p pid="a.129.1/6" class="indent">&quot;For decades, service families in Scotland have been overlooked, but this is changing. It is now time for the Scots legal system to play its role investigating overseas military deaths&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.129.1/7">and that</p>
	<p pid="a.129.1/8" class="indent">&quot;I'm also pleased that other families will benefit from this. It's one positive issue that has come out of a tragic event.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.129.1/9">For that reason alone, it would be fitting for the amendments to be agreed without Division tonight.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.1/10">The amendments are the only part of the Bill to have effect in Scotland. All the other provisions relate to England and Wales, and in part to Northern Ireland, and to the legal systems there. It is no surprise that I did not take part in the Public Bill Committee, which debated only those provisions of the Bill that affect England, Wales and Northern Ireland&mdash;<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i></p>

	<p pid="a.129.3/1">It is very unfortunate that on a day of good news, Labour Members from Scotland heckle on such an important subject but did not seek to speak this evening as we debate the changes.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.3/2">Although the Scottish National party appreciates that there are issues of concern in the wider Bill for some English, Welsh and Northern Irish colleagues, we will support the amendments that relate to Scotland and the Bill. There is much to learn about the operation of its provisions and we will be watching closely in the years ahead. We hope, of course, that they will not be needed and that no service family will need to sit through a fatal accident inquiry, but as our armed forces are on high-tempo operations, such an occurrence, unfortunately, is likely.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.3/3">It is always possible to revisit the mechanics of how the Bill will operate, but the principle is that this decision has been made tonight after 41 years of lack of delivery, within a few short years of an SNP Government in Scotland, by some Ministers who realised that the time had come to change the situation. That change is happening tonight and I welcome it wholeheartedly.</p>

	<p pid="a.130.0/1">May I say how warmly I welcome the arrangement that has been made by the Government and their accommodation with the Administration in Edinburgh? My recollection of history is not entirely in line with what <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2002" name="Angus Robertson">the hon. Member for Moray (Angus Robertson)</phrase> has just said. I pay tribute to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1976" name="Adam Ingram">the right hon. Member for East Kilbride, Strathaven and Lesmahagow (Mr. Ingram)</phrase>. When he was Minister, he and I had correspondence over many years about the matter. We both knew that the system had to change.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.0/2">Her Majesty's coroner for Wiltshire is based in Salisbury, in my constituency, and I pay tribute to him. David Masters has had a remarkable career looking after military inquests in Wiltshire and he retires at the end of this month. A lot of the spade work has been done by him. I also pay tribute to the coroner's officers who have looked carefully after the families of the deceased servicemen who have been flown back to Wiltshire and to Oxfordshire. They have been at the front line, coping with the needs of families from all over the UK. It has been very difficult for them, of course, to make a civilised contribution to the needs of families from as far away as Scotland. I warmly welcome the provision. I hope that it is something that we can all agree on, in spite of our historical differences over who did what. What matters is that it is a matter of common courtesy and common decency that Scottish families should have such an arrangement. I fully respect the fact that Scottish law has been different from English law, but on this occasion at least we should all come together to say that this has been a job well done.</p>

	<p pid="a.130.1/1">I shall take the views of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1803" name="Robert Key">the hon. Member for Salisbury (Robert Key)</phrase> to heart, and shall not make any party political points about members of the SNP who did not turn up to Committee where they could have raised this issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.1/2">The hon. Member for Salisbury is quite right that this point is something that everyone, on both sides of the House, agrees on. Colleagues in government in the Scotland Office and the Ministry of Defence have been working very hard on it, including both present colleagues and those who were previously in some of those posts. I welcome the fact that the Lord Advocate and the Justice Minister in Scotland have worked with us to achieve a process of decency, as the hon. Gentleman said, for the families of British armed forces personnel who happen to live in Scotland, to enable them to deal with the death of their loved ones closer to home than is currently the case.</p>

	<p pid="a.130.3/1">I was going to come to that in my response to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1955" name="Frank Doran">the Member for Aberdeen, North (Mr. Doran)</phrase>. In the case of a single incident in which there are multiple deaths, the repatriation would be to England. However, if the majority of the deaths happened to be of Scottish personnel, the chief coroner would have a discussion with the Lord Advocate on whether it would be more appropriate to transfer all the bodies to Scotland, my point being that the deaths would be considered in a single inquest. However, the wishes of the family would also be taken into account, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1480" name="Jennifer Willott">the hon. Member for Cardiff, Central (Jenny Willott)</phrase>, and my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, North, requested. A discussion would take place at the time.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.3/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1737" name="Henry Bellingham">The hon. Member for North-West Norfolk (Mr. Bellingham)</phrase> asked whether the provisions would operate in reverse, if a body were repatriated to Scotland. The answer is yes, they would. Of course, the whole point of the amendments is to benefit service families who happen to be based in Scotland. If the body were still outside the United Kingdom, the Secretary of State for Defence would seek the agreement of the Lord Advocate to hold a fatal accident inquiry into the death, following consultation with the next of kin&mdash;something for which my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, North, asked. If the Lord Advocate agreed to that, the body would be repatriated directly to Scotland. If the body were repatriated to England or Wales, the chief coroner would take on that role and would hold those discussions with the Lord Advocate.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.3/3">I hope that that answers the detailed points that right hon. and hon. Members have raised. I am pleased that there is consensus across the House that we should give bereaved families, wherever they are in the United Kingdom, the comfort of knowing that their loved ones will be repatriated as close to home as possible. They can then hear of the exact circumstances surrounding the death, and can grieve properly.</p>

A number of Members of Parliament have been involved in inquests such as that for Stephen Lawrence, who was one of my constituents, or the inquest that might have been held for Jay Abatan, another of my constituents, in my constituency. I had been hoping to raise these matters under new clause 36. The selection of amendments is unexceptionable, but I hope it will be taken on record that when scheduling the business of the House, Ministers should allow MPs to speak on subjects on which they have personal experience and to put forward the views and experiences of their constituents.</p>

	<p pid="a.139.4/1">On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. Tonight we have conducted inadequate scrutiny of the Bill. There are tens of Government amendments and new clauses that have not been scrutinised in most of the groups that you selected. I speak on behalf of those in all parts of the House who are keen to scrutinise legislation. Given that the Leader of the House said in business questions under your chairmanship that she took seriously the issue of how we scrutinise Bills on Report and said that in respect of the Coroners and Justice Bill she would seek to ensure with the Secretary of State that the two days are used in the best possible way for these important measures, can you advise whether there is any way that we can ask the Leader of the House to come back to explain why we end up yet again with inadequate scrutiny by the elected House of very important matters, including the revision of the law on murder, of all things?</p>

	<p pid="a.142.2/1">I am pleased to have secured this Adjournment debate on blacklisting, because the practice impacts on the health of the construction industry and is accordingly a matter of public concern. The Government are the sector's largest client, so they have some responsibility to ensure that the working practices of the 1930s have no place in our modern construction industry. I hope that the Minister will take action to encourage the industry to change.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.2/2">I want to make four brief points. The first is about the impact on the health and safety culture of the industry, and the second is about the climate of fear that discrimination creates. My third point is about the fact that many of the companies using the list kept by the Consulting Association were major companies working on publicly procured projects. Finally, I want to suggest to the Minister that, along with other measures, section 3 of the Employment Relations Act 1999 should now be implemented.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.2/3">The construction industry is important. Before the recession, it provided employment for more than 2.8 million people. It contributed 8.7 per cent. of the UK economy's gross value added in 2006; to put that into perspective, I should say that that is twice that produced by the energy, automotive and aerospace industries combined. Construction has a huge impact on the UK economy. It is vital, and that is why we need a world-class construction sector that uses the best employment practices.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.2/4">The health and safety record of the industry is worrying. Construction, for example, accounts for almost one third of workplace fatalities in the UK. The year 2006-07 saw an increase in the number of fatalities from 60 to 77, and in 2007-08 there were 72 fatal injuries. More than half those deaths resulted from a fall or from a worker's being struck by a falling object.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.2/5">Workplace safety representatives are an essential tool in helping to improve the health and safety culture on site, but the blacklisting of people who take on the job militates against that. The Government have an important role to play in the issue, and workplace safety representatives will need to be reassured that they will not be blacklisted if they do their job properly. I shall return to that issue later.</p>

	<p pid="a.142.3/1">Does my hon. Friend agree that health and safety should be part of the criteria when construction companies bid for Government contracts? The Government should look at the companies' track records on health and safety to flush out those that do not regard the issue as important.</p>

	<p pid="a.142.4/1">I thank my hon. Friend for that comment, which I agree with. The Construction (Design and Management) Regulations 2007 place an onus on the client to include health and safety in its criteria, and given that the Government are the biggest client in the public sector, they have a responsibility to take on and ensure health and safety.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.4/2">Between 2004 and 2007, a health and safety advisory scheme operated in the construction industry, run jointly by the Union of Construction, Allied Trades and Technicians and employers. That scheme, which included the Health and Safety Executive, was considered a success, but it has run into the sand because no more funding is available. Clearly, getting it up and running again is important for safety in construction. Bearing in mind that the 2007 regulations place a responsibility on Government, it is definitely something that they should pick up and put in place.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.4/3">I recently spoke with a construction worker whose name is on the blacklist; I do not want to use his name for obvious reasons. He told me that he believed that the blacklisting was much more insidious than merely a list being kept by the Consulting Association. He had worked all his life in the industry and had been blacklisted for 35 years, basically for standing up for trade union rights, particularly in health and safety. In his view, what happens in the industry is that lists are exchanged from company to company. He came to that conclusion having been moved from one job to another. When he had been on site for only two or three days, he would be visited by the site agent and told that there was no work there for him. That caused him and his family enormous hardship, because he was continually moving from job to job and never having long-stay employment. He told me that the first time that he ever had any security was when he moved into the mining industry to work with construction companies such as Thyssen and Cementation that he had been working with on sites, because in mining they came under the framework of the Mines and Quarries Act 1954 and had to adhere to that. That gave him much more of a feeling of certainty than he had ever had on sites. The fact that he had to move from site to site, taking all his family, shows the kind of hardship that is imposed on a person in the position of being blacklisted by companies involved in construction.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.4/4">An article in <i> The Times </i>on <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-07">7 March 2009</phrase> indicates the kinds of companies&mdash;household names&mdash;that are involved in blacklisting. It says:</p>
	<p pid="a.142.4/5" class="indent">&quot;Sir Robert McAlpine is one of more than 40 companies accused by Richard Thomas, the Information Commissioner, of breaching data protection laws after an investigation by his office sparked fears that many workers were being unfairly 'blacklisted'.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.4/6" class="indent">The commissioner alleges that Ian Kerr, of Droitwich, Worcestershire, charged companies &pound;3,000 a year to consult his database of 3,213 workers, whose names were accompanied by notes such as 'poor timekeeper, will cause trouble' and 'Irish ex-army bad egg'.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.142.4/7">It goes on to say that from invoices that have been obtained,</p>
	<p pid="a.142.4/8" class="indent">&quot;'It would appear that Sir Robert McAlpine and other companies made thousands of requests a year', a spokesman for the Information Commissioner said. He said that each request for information on a specific employee cost about &pound;2.20 on top of the yearly subscription. That suggests that Sir Robert McAlpine made more than 10,000 requests&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.142.4/9">for information on individuals in the past year.</p>

	<p pid="a.144.0/1">I understand that sentiment, and we need to ensure that companies engaged in publicly procured projects adhere to the law, which means that we need the regulations set out in the 1999 Act, the safety advisory schemes and the 2007 regulations.</p>

	<p pid="a.144.1/1">When the 1999 legislation was introduced and debated in this House, we were ecstatic that the provisions in question were included. When I raised the matter in 2004 or 2005, and asked why that element of the legislation had not been implemented, the argument was that there was insufficient evidence to justify implementation&mdash;there was no evidence of blacklisting. The published evidence referred to by my hon. Friend clearly blows that argument out of the water. We now need swift implementation of that legislation.</p>

	<p pid="a.144.2/1">I agree totally with my hon. Friend's comments.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.2/2">The fact that many of the companies making use of the Consulting Association are some of the country's largest construction companies is a worry. The fact that the public sector was the client in just over 31 per cent. of construction output in 2006, making it the industry's largest customer, suggests that the Government, as a major client, have some responsibility to use the powerful lever that exists to ensure that companies who use blacklists are not engaged on projects, which brings us to the point made by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2020" name="Jim Devine">the Member for Livingston (Mr. Devine)</phrase>. Still more could be done to change the behaviour of construction companies working on publicly procured projects by strict use of the 2007 regulations and the use of workers health and safety advisers, which together could start to change the culture.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.2/3">The Minister may have seen my early-day motion 1020, which does not demand new primary legislation. There is no need for such legislation because the power is already in the statute book and available to the Secretary of State&mdash;it just needs to be enabled. Section 3 of the 1999 Act provides that the Secretary of State may make regulations prohibiting the compilation of lists that contain details of members' trade unions or persons who have taken part in the activities of trade unions, and lists which are compiled with a view to being used by employers or employment agencies for the purpose of discrimination in relation to recruitment or to the treatment of workers. The Minister will know that in 2003, the Government consulted on the regulations. A number of trade unions and trade union law firms responded to say that rather than wait for evidence of blacklisting, the Government should enact the regulations immediately. They did not. But now that evidence has emerged that blacklisting is taking place, it is time to bring them into effect.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.2/4">If the Information Commissioner is to prosecute the Consulting Association and is considering what action to take against the construction companies to whom information has been supplied, the Government must use their powers under the regulations to ensure that structures are in place to prevent it from reoccurring. That is an important point that must be emphasised. We need to ensure sustainability for those working in the industry.</p>

	<p pid="a.144.3/1">Obviously, the Government have to take action on this matter, but in the absence of immediate action, would my hon.

	<p pid="a.145.0/1">I hear what my hon. Friend says, and his point is well made. The Minister will have heard it, and no doubt other Members will be thinking of tackling the issue in that way.</p>
	<p pid="a.145.0/2">There was a consultation in 2003, and as far as I am aware, only two bodies&mdash;the CBI and the Engineering Employers Federation&mdash;said that they hoped that the regulations would not need to be introduced. Given that we have shown that there clearly is evidence that they need to be introduced, I would think that those two bodies would accept the points that were made at the time of the consultation and agree that the regulations should be brought into force.</p>

	<p pid="a.145.1/1">Does my hon. Friend agree that those two bodies epitomise what is wrong with this country? There is absolutely no level playing field. If this had been the other way round, and trade unions were restricting their trade, they would have been up before a High Court judge.</p>

	<p pid="a.145.2/1">I could not agree more with my hon. Friend's point.</p>
	<p pid="a.145.2/2">I welcome the Department's statement of intention to review whether to use its powers if there were compelling evidence that blacklisting were being used. What could be more compelling than the evidence produced by the Information Commissioner? It has shown clearly that bodies such as the Consulting Association are involved in blacklisting. Some time ago, we thought that the Economic League and the Freedom Association had disappeared and that this kind of thing no longer happened, but the evidence clearly shows that it is happening.</p>

	<p pid="a.145.3/1">Is it not clear to my hon. Friend and all those who have worked in the industry that blacklisting went on all the time? Anyone with any experience of the industry knew that scores and scores of people were driven not just out of work but out of the industry. They effectively had their trade stolen and were sent to work in other places. That has been common practice for very many years.</p>

	<p pid="a.145.4/1">I agree that anybody who has worked around the construction industry, and talked to people such as those I have talked to in preparing for the debate, gets the feeling that blacklisting has been around for many years, and that it is not just the large organisations that we have mentioned that organise it but the construction companies themselves. They prepare blacklists and exchange them among themselves.</p>
	<p pid="a.145.4/2">As the Minister will be aware, the Information Commissioner is considering regulatory action against the firms involved. That is welcome, but the Government must move positively to bring into force section 3 of the 1999 Act to stop this outdated practice that has blighted many lives. I hope that he will say this evening that he is willing to act.</p>

	<p pid="a.146.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1386" name="Michael Clapham">the Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone (Mr. Clapham)</phrase> on securing the debate. I begin with something of an apology to you, Mr. Speaker, and to him for the slightly weak nature of my voice tonight. I hope that I manage to get through my response.</p>
	<p pid="a.146.0/2">This subject is important and topical. The Government believe that people have a right to join a trade union if they so wish. That is a free choice and should not result in their being denied employment, so I share my hon. Friend's concerns about the recent revelations in the construction industry. He is right that that industry is of particular concern, because the safety of workers can be at stake as well as their employment.</p>
	<p pid="a.146.0/3">The freedom to belong to a trade union is a key human right set out in many international treaties, including the European convention on human rights. Trade union representatives and activists&mdash;we should not forget that they are mostly unpaid volunteers&mdash;perform an important and valuable role in the workplace. For the most part they work in partnership with employers, but of course sometimes they challenge them. That can be when tensions arise, but it is important that trade union representatives are not subject to victimisation.</p>
	<p pid="a.146.0/4">The practice of blacklisting should be anathema in today's Britain. It is a relic of the past, and if what has occurred recently in the construction industry is blacklisting rearing its head again, of course we will take that seriously. I shall come to what we are doing to address that, but first I shall briefly set out some of the protections that currently exist.</p>
	<p pid="a.146.0/5">Sections 137, 146 and 152 of the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 make it unlawful for an employer to refuse employment, cause someone to lose out at work or dismiss someone on the ground of trade union membership or activities. Those rights have been in place for decades, although we made some modifications in, for example, the Employment Relations Acts 1999 and 2004, providing more protection against victimising workers for using a union's services.</p>
	<p pid="a.146.0/6">My hon. Friend the Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone also referred to the Data Protection Act 1998. To run any system, an organisation needs to manage a large amount of data, and organisations or persons managing such data are classed under the Act as data controllers. That means that they must register with the Information Commissioner&mdash;failure to do that is a criminal offence. In accordance with the Act's data protection principles, data controllers must make proportionate and fair use of data.</p>
	<p pid="a.146.0/7">Trade union membership is classified as &quot;sensitive personal data&quot;. According to the Act, it is unlawful, save for a few exceptions, to process such data without the subject's explicit consent. Since blacklisting is, by its nature, a covert activity, it is impossible to operate a blacklist successfully and stay within the provisions of the Act. The Information Commissioner has strong powers to investigate cases in which he thinks the Act is being breached. He used them extensively during his investigation into the affairs of the Consulting Association, which I will call TCA. He secured two search warrants and confiscated a large amount of material. One prosecution has begun. He can also issue enforcement notices, which require persons to act in accordance with the 1998 Act by taking, or refraining from taking steps. One enforcement notice has so far been issued.</p>
	<p pid="a.146.0/8">My hon. Friend mentioned section 3 of the Employment Relations Act 1999, which provides a power for making regulations to outlaw blacklisting. As he said, we have produced draft regulations, on which we consulted in 2003. They would allow individuals to obtain compensation for being refused employment or for suffering discrimination by their employer because of their inclusion on a trade union blacklist. Those complaints would be determined by the employment tribunal.</p>
	<p pid="a.146.0/9">In addition, people, including trade unions, could claim damages from the compilers, disseminators and users of the blacklists for financial loss.</p>

	<p pid="a.147.1/1">I have already received a letter from one of the companies that have been mentioned, dissociating itself from the activity and claiming that it did not realise that it was buying into it. I will revert to that.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.1/2">We reiterated our position that we would not consider implementing the regulations until clear evidence arose. That was the position in 2003. The investigation began in the middle of last year, when my Department learned that the Information Commissioner was investigating allegations of blacklisting. My officials were involved at an early stage and worked with the Information Commissioner's office. I pay tribute to those in that office for their diligence in pursuing a complex investigation.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.1/3">As my hon. Friend the Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone described, significant abuse of the data protection principles and data protection law was uncovered. TCA has secretly listed more than 3,300 individuals and kept more detailed information on 1,600 of them.</p>

	<p pid="a.147.3/1">The compilers of the list can be prosecuted under the Data Protection Act and one such prosecution is pending. I believe that a fine can be imposed in a lower court, or a higher fine can be imposed in a higher court.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.3/2">The critical question that my hon. Friend the Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone asked is what our response is. Around 25 construction companies appear to have been subscribers to the services of TCA and about 18 of them appear to have used the system recently. The information relates to the employment histories of individuals and in some cases it refers to their involvement in trade unions or their participation in industrial action.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.3/3">The Government need to decide whether those activities fall within the definition of blacklisting found in section 3 of the 1999 Act. Earlier this month my officials spent two days at the offices of the Information Commissioner and they have examined much of the material that he has taken from TCA. My noble Friend the Secretary of State and I will closely examine their findings on the material and decide what action to take.</p>

	<p pid="a.147.4/1">Briefly, it is 10 years since we put the legislation through and we now have evidence of blacklisting, which the Government were unsure of before. We urgently require the implementation of the regulations, but we need to make them retrospective, so that those people who have suffered, particularly over the past 10 years, can gain proper compensation.</p>

	<p pid="a.148.0/1">I will come to how we are dealing with the problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.148.0/2">Procurement has been mentioned. Any company, whether it works on public contracts or not, should comply with the law of the land. We expect companies not to break either data protection law or trade union law when planning or undertaking work for the public sector. Of course we recognise that construction companies need to ensure that they recruit the right calibre of person for the job, but there is no need to undertake covert and unfair vetting of the kind that TCA appears to have performed.</p>
	<p pid="a.148.0/3">The Information Commissioner is following up his investigation in various ways. First, TCA is to be prosecuted, as I have said. I understand that the case will be heard towards the end of April. I also understand that the Information Commissioner is making further inquiries with the subscriber companies to determine the extent of their involvement with TCA. Those inquiries could lead to further action by the Information Commissioner. My Department will stay in close touch with the Information Commissioner and, as I have said, BERR officials have already inspected many of the records held by the Information Commissioner.</p>
