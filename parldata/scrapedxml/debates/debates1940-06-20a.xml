<p>All cases of men who express a preference for the Navy or Air Force are considered by officers of those Services in order to decide which of the men can be accepted. The number expressing preferences for the Navy and the Air Force is always greater than the num-

<p>asked the Home Secretary the approximate number of refugees from Nazi persecution in Great Britain who have been classed in category C, and why some of the refugees in this category have been interned; what are the reasons for interning some of these category C refugees and not others; and whether such interned refugees will be entitled to have their cases re-examined?</p>

<p>Approximately 52,000 Germans and Austrians were classified as refugees and placed in Category C. On 11th May I ordered the internment, as a measure of military precaution, of all male Germans and Austrians in a coastal zone on the east and south-east coasts and Category C males in that zone were interned in pursuance of this general direction. In addition, I have authorised chief constables to arrest for internment any German or Austrian in Category C about whose reliability the chief constable feels doubt from the point of view of national security. As my hon. Friend will appreciate, in present circumstances any general review is out of the question, but this point will be kept in mind for consideration when circumstances permit.</p>

<p>That is perfectly true, and when it is represented to me that as a matter of military necessity action should be taken, my desire must be in the present circumstances to take that action unless there are overwhelming arguments to the contrary.

<p>If the advice of the Department is followed, part-time volunteers who are in employment will be called up only in conformity with arrangements agreed upon in advance between their employers and the local authority. In a high proportion of cases it may be hoped that no loss of wages will be involved, but where there is such loss the authority has power to make it good up to a maximum of 10s. a day for a man and 7s. for a woman. Local authorities fully realise the importance of arranging that volunteers should report for duty at points as near as possible to their normal residence or place of work.</p>

<p>Is my hon. Friend aware that that stereotyped answer will not do? It is quite impossible to distinguish places unless some distinctive number is given.

<p>Will the Lord Privy Seal bear in mind, with reference to Thursday's business, concerning the Ministry of Supply, that after the Minister has made his statement in public a number of Members will probably wish to raise points which could not suitably be raised in public, and that at that stage there may be a desire that the House should resolve itself into Secret Session?</p>

<p>There have since been discussions as to the procedure that might be followed, quite apart from the present occupancy of this Bench. I submit, Mr. Speaker, that the usual channels, as commonly understood, must function as they normally function. Surely there must be accorded, in some appropriate way, a means of ascertaining what may be the desire of Members of all political parties. I asked my question deliberately. I am not seeking any special privilege for myself. Despite efforts made by others to deprive Members of Parliament of their rights in this matter, I am speaking, I know, on behalf of a very large number of Members who wish to have it clearly established that there should be some procedure, giving to what represents,


after all, not a minority of this House, but a majority, the opportunity of exercising this privilege.</p>

<p>I would like to say a word on this matter. I would like to know whether, in choosing these Supply days, there is complete harmony in the Whips' room about it. It seems to me that there is surely something wrong in the Government Whips' department, if there is agreement in the Whips' room, and then, locally expressed disagreement in the House. Is it now the settled view of this House, as expressed by the hon. Member for South-West Bethnal Green (Sir P. Harris), that Supply days are chosen by the Government? An essential part of the Constitution has been that Supply days were chosen by others than the Government. I would ask the Lord Privy Seal, further, whether the Prime Minister did not promise the House of Commons that, having regard to the new situation, and the impossibility of getting an official Opposition in the ordinary and accepted sense of the term, a new procedure would be developed by which the wishes of back benchers who were not in the Government&#x2014;</p>

<p>A point of Order was put to me by the hon. Member for South Croydon (Sir H. Williams), and my reply to him is that, at this time of acute crisis through which the country is passing, an attempt is being made to have a united House of Commons. It is difficult, in a House of 615 Members, to have complete agreement, as there are sure to be some Members who are dissatisfied. I am afraid that will always be so. But, as far as possible, we must try to avoid party differences. As regards the subjects to be discussed in Supply, every effort

will be made to ascertain the wishes of the House, as a whole, and not of parties in particular.</p>
