<p>asked the Minister of Supply whether he is aware that at the recent sale of surplus Government vehicles at Ruddington, Nottinghamshire, 25 amphibious ducks were taken out of the public auction and sold privately for about 5 per cent, of their original cost; and on whose authority and on what grounds was this action taken.</p>

<p>The output of hand tools is greater than before the war but the

In fact, out of approximately 140 members of the former Shanghai Municipal Police Force, about 50 have now obtained posts, and vacancies for a similar number have been brought to the notice of those concerned.

<p>The Japanese authorities bore the cost of maintenance for the internees, although, I am sorry to say, at a pitiful level. To supplement this low standard, His Majesty's Government arranged for the supply of extra comforts by the International Red Cross Society, for the payment of pocket money, and the provision of medical treatment and the like by the Protecting Power. For all of this His Majesty's Government have claimed repayment from each of the internees at the rate of only &#x00A3;2 a month, a small fraction of the cost. Even these claims for repayment are not pressed if hardship would result, but it must be borne in mind that many of the internees were employees of substantial British firms and continued to draw salaries throughout their internment. Such persons are usually only too glad to pay.</p>

We shall be able to authorise my right hon. Friend the Minister of Food to purchase foodstuffs which, if they can be obtained, will provide us with a more varied diet. We shall also be able to carry out our intention to arrange for more plentiful supplies of raw materials, and a limited increase in imports of manu-

factured goods and, we hope, of newsprint. My right hon. Friend the Minister of Fuel and Power will make a statement on petrol in the course of a few days. We must keep a balance between the various demands upon us, since we cannot yet afford to buy all that we would like. To use a famous phrase, the Loan must be, for us, not a sofa but a springboard. We cannot relax our efforts in production, especially in the export trades. As soon as we can we must balance our overseas account. The value of the Loan is that it gives us a breathing space and new reserves of strength to accomplish this task. For this we sincerely thank the United States, believing that they and we have a common interest in reviving trade throughout the world, and providing good standards of living for men and women everywhere.</p>

<p>I think that everyone in the House, whether they were in favour of or opposed to this Loan, must be glad that the long drawn out debate; have come to an end. On behalf of those who, like myself, believe that but for the loan this country might well have faced economic chaos, may I say how glad we are that it has come, and how glad we are to hear the right hon. Gentleman repeat the phrase of my right hon. Friend the Member for Woodford (Mr. Churchill) about its being a sofa and not a springboard. [<i>Laughter.</i>] I have got it the wrong way round. Watching right hon. Gentlemen reclining on the Front Bench certainly put me more in mind of a sofa than of a springboard. May I ask the right hon. Gentleman two questions arising out of this: first, does he now propose to undertake, with the various countries, negotiations with regard to the sterling balances, and second, what is the position now with regard to the international negotiations on commercial agreements which were proposed?</p>

Paper 6708&#x2014;we have agreed that we will now undertake discussions with the holders of sterling balances, and that of course we shall do. With regard to the international arrangements, my right hon. Friend the President


of the Board of Trade has explained to the House on previous occasions that it will be a natural consequence of the Loan Agreement that conferences will be held on the conditions which have often been explained. The full conference will be preceded by a meeting of the so-called nuclear. Powers, which include not only ourselves but the other members of the Commonwealth.

In view of the lush hopes he has held out for more clothes, more food, and more petrol, will he say whether this money is to be spent primarily on consumer goods, or the capital rehabilitation of this country?

<p>If my answer is carefully read, it will be seen that, among the objects on which I have just announced a certain easement in the import programme, one of the classes is certainly machinery.

<p>The Government have given careful consideration to representations which have been made to us in regard to the scales of bread rationing, particularly in regard to the housewife. There is no doubt that the housewife with a family of children has a special need for assistance. The supply position, after careful review, permits us to make a small concession, and we have come to the conclusion that the best way of helping the most hard pressed housewives is to give the extra bread, not directly to them, but to their children. I


want to help the housewife who has the care of a family on her shoulders, and the bigger the family, the more she needs help.<br/>
We are, therefore, increasing the scale of allowances to all children from birth to the age of 18 by one ounce a day. We are also reducing the age at which the children's ration will rise from five ounces to nine ounces from 5 to 4 years. We are also, partly for simplicity, abolishing the category of children of under one year, so that the ration from birth to four years will now be five ounces, instead of two ounces for children under one year. These increases for children will reduce the estimated saving of the rationing scheme from 10 per cent. to seven per cent. In order to give effect to them, the value of Coupon F will be increased from 1 to 2 bread units, and Coupon J from 5 to 6 units.</p>

<p>Can the Minister of Food tell us what will be the effect of the very welcome relief he has just announced, coupled with the other reliefs that have been announced to the Press, on the total original saving which, we were told, is desirable, and is estimated to be between five per cent, and 10 per cent.? [<i>Interruption.</i>] The right hon. Gentleman announced the effect of the increased rations for children.

<p>The former announcements which, I think, the hon. Member has in mind, were all in the original scheme.

<p>Speaking from memory, my recollection is that the saving suggested, originally, was of the order of between five per cent. and 10 per cent. I understand, if my arithmetic is correct, that this present concession which, I am sure, is widely welcomed, will reduce the saving by three per cent,, that is, from 10 per cent. to seven per cent. In other words, if the original statement is correct, the present saving is between two per cent. and seven per cent., and not between five per cent. and 10 per cent. May I ask when the Order will be issued?</p>

<p>On the first point, no one can, of course, give an exact estimate to within one per cent. of the saving; but I think we have been extremely conservative in our estimate of the saving that would be effected. I should very much doubt whether this, in fact, will reduce the real saving by as much as three per cent., because I think that the families to whom we are giving the increase by this concession would be the very ones who, otherwise, would have sacrificed points for bread units, and would have got extra bread in that way, by sacrificing points. Therefore, I doubt very much whether the loss in broad will be as much as three per cent. On the second point, the Order is being printed, and I trust and believe it will be laid this afternoon.</p>

Members, and possibly you, Mr. Speaker, have received similar letters, from an organisation which I must admit I had never heard of, called Service Equity. It is a printed document, and it is not signed, although the name of the secretary is shown at the bottom as F. R. Muddle&#x2014;there is nothing to show whether it is a Mr., Mrs., or Miss. The letter, with which I need not trouble you, Mr. Speaker, deals with some service organisation. It is the last sentence which, in this connection, is of importance, and I will read it to the House:

<q> In the event of no reply, we shall be forced to assume that the Member of Parliament concerned is against us.</q>
I do not know what would be the effect of the assumption that a Member of Parliament was or was not against this organisation, but it does seem to me to imply some sort of threat in the case of no reply being given. I do not think that any Member, except as a matter of courtesy, is under any obligation to answer any letter unless he or she so desires. I wonder, therefore, Mr. Speaker, if you would be good enough to give us a Ruling on a matter of this kind in protection of hon. Members of this honourable House?</p>

<p>Like the right hon. and gallant Gentleman the Member for Gainsborough (Captain Crookshank) I would not dogmatise on whether any point of Privilege arises, but I do sympathise, and I am sure my hon. Friends sympathise, with what he has said. If Members of Parliament get communications from organisations of any character, it seems to me that they are free to agree or disagree with the organisation, or send a reply which is not clearly "Yes" or "No"&#x2014;from time to time it is quite right that they should send no reply at all. The implied threat in this letter, of a sort of blackballing arrangement if a Member does not reply, does seem to me to be an effort to coerce the free judgment of Members of this House. Therefore, although I am not sure that any question of Privilege arises, I sympathise with what the right hon. and gallant Gentleman has said and would affirm that so far as the Government are concerned, Members of this House must be absolutely free to answer communications as they like, or not to answer them at all.</p>

<p>I will read out one line from Erskine May:
<q>To attempt to influence Members in free debate by threats is also a breach of Privilege.</q>


I think that is perfectly clear. I cannot say that this letter appears to contain a <i>prima facie</i> breach of Privilege. It is quite true that it is worded in such a way as to insinuate what I might call a veiled threat. In tone it is disrespectful to Parliament. I think that a repetition of such a letter might justifiably incur the serious displeasure of the House. As it contains no very definite threat, I suggest that we had better treat it as undeserving of consideration.</p>

<p>I beg to move, "That the Clause be read a Second time."<br/>
We are now entering on the Report stage of the Finance Bill, and there are several new Clauses calling for the attention of the House. I venture to express the hope, that in order that we may get a reasonable amount of sleep this week, we might, where there is really nothing much to debate in a Clause, allow it to pass fairly quickly. Many of these new Clauses, of which this is an example, have been put down by me following discussions in Committee, and in response to representations made from Members in different parts of the House. If we are to keep our attention in the time at our disposal focused on the things that matter, I suggest, with great respect, that we might pass rather quickly over such new Clauses as this one which has been put down in respect of the very clear speech made in Committee by the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Orr-Ewing). This carries out, I think, the undertaking for which he asked. The purpose of the Clause is to substitute for the present Duty, in respect of oils used in refineries to produce gases for heat, light and power outside the refineries, a flat rate of 1d. per gallon whether the oils used are heavy oils or light oils. I hope that he will agree that this gives what he wanted.</p>

<p>While thanking the Chancellor of the Exchequer for introducing this new Clause, which, as he states, carries out the intentions which were put forward by us during


the Committee stage, I should like to ask whether the words here used do carry out exactly what the right hon. Gentleman has just stated.

This new Clause is also a concession, following upon discussions in Committee, with regard to rayon. The purpose of this Clause is to give assistance to the rayon industry particularly in regard to artificial silk used in the manufacture of tyres. The new Clause, as I have put it down, goes a little further than I indicated at the earlier stage. The new Clause gives a rebate on the Excise Duty of 6d. per pound on artificial silk which is to be used not only in motor tyres but tyres of all kinds. This leaves it open for some rebate to be given in connection with tyres for aeroplanes or tyres for bicycles. I gather that there is a possibility of such a development, and we are anxious to assist. I hope that the House will agree that this is a reasonable degree of help to be given, at this stage, to the rayon industry.</p>

<p>I beg to move, "That the Clause be read a Second time."<br/>
This also represents a concession to arguments adduced in Committee by hon. Members opposite, in particular by the hon. Member for Twickenham (Mr. Keeling). Under the Finance Act, 1926, Section 31 (<i>b</i>), where a trade is discontinued, it is taxed in relation to the penultimate year, either upon the takings of the previous year or of that year, whichever is the higher. In a case where an undertaking is nationalised, it was represented by the hon. Member for Twickenham that it would not be fair to impose that upon an undertaking, which, after all, is not nationalised by its own will. In those circumstances, in the case of undertakings which are nationlised compulsorily, the provisions of the Finance Act, 1926, Section 31 (<i>b</i>), are by this new Clause excluded. That means, that supposing an undertaking is discontinued in year three, apart from this Clause, even if it were discontinued owing to nationalisation, in year two, it would be assessed to Schedule D either on the takings of year one or on the takings of year two, whichever is the higher. The effect of this Clause is that where an undertaking is nationalised, it will now


not be assessed under Schedule D in respect of year two on the takings of year two, but always on the takings of the preceding year, even though the takings of year two may be higher than the takings of the preceding year. It represents a concession to assist industry to get on its feet again. It is a concession which was asked for, and it meets an undertaking given by the Chancellor of the Exchequer on the Committee stage. I ask the House to say that this is a concession of which they approve.</p>

<p>May I ask the learned Solicitor-General two questions which are, in fact, explained by the Amendment to the proposed new Clause in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Stockport (Sir A. Gridley)&#x2014;in line 8, after "discontinued," insert:
<q>or is deemed to be discontinued in whole or in part</q>
&#x2014;which. I understand, will not be called? When the mining industry, for example, is nationalised, the business carried on by a colliery company will probably not be discontinued, but will be continued under the new owners of the colliery. Will it be deemed to be discontinued within the meaning of the rules contained in Schedule D of the Income Tax Acts, 1918? The second question is this: The colliery company, or any company which is nationalised, may be carrying on more than one activity, and, under nationalisation, it may lose only part of its business. What would be the position then? Will it be covered by the new Clause?</p>

<p>The answer to the first question is that the effect of the Finance Act, 1926, Section 32, is that, in the circumstances indicated, the undertaking would be deemed to have come to an end. The answer to the second question is that, where two undertakings were carried on, one being a colliery undertaking and the other being a different undertaking which did not fall within the scope of the nationalisation scheme, the owners would be assessed separately in relation to each of the undertakings, that is to say, under the terms of this Clause, in respect of the colliery undertaking, and in respect of the other undertaking under the terms of the Finance Act, 1926, Section 31 (<i>b</i>), as it at present stands. It raises a question of fact, in each case, as to whether there are two undertakings or

whether they are in substance the same undertaking. Where there are two undertakings, that would apply, and an assurance has already been given by the Board of Inland Revenue that that rule would be strictly observed.</p>

<p>I beg to move, "That the Clause be read a Second time."<br/>
This Clause is one on which my right hon. Friend the Member for the Scottish Universities (Sir J. Anderson), my predecessor in Office, made representations to me. At present there is a restriction imposed by the Income Tax Act of 1945 upon the so called balancing allowances that may be given in cases where industrial buildings are scrapped. At present, so the argument runs&#x2014;and I have accepted the argument because it is conclusive&#x2014;the balancing allowances under these restrictions&#x2014;I hope I shall be able to make this clear because it is complicated&#x2014;fall short of the aggregate amount of the allowances which a trader would receive in respect of his building if he retained it. Consequently, the restrictions act as a deterrent to scrapping old buildings and replacing them with new. This was the point brought to my attention with great clarity by my predecessor. In view of this, and since it is far from being our wish, that we should encourage the patching up of old buildings, It has been decided to add this New Clause, which lays down that the industrialist who scraps


an old building and replaces it by a new one will receive by way of a balancing allowance, an amount equal to the amount he would have received if he had kept it, <i>minus</i> any money he receives for the amount of the scrapping. This is a complicated story but we are seeking by this provision to remove the discrimination, which I think does exist under the present law referring to balancing allowances, and which does discourage the replacement of old buildings by new. We hope if this Clause is accepted that it will be a stimulus to the modernisation of industrial buildings.</p>

<p>There is one point on which we are still a little doubtful. It has been raised by the pottery industry working party. Apparently this Clause does not go to the full extent to which that working party asked that it should. As I understand, in their report the working party asked that there should be no writing down at 2 per cent. on old buildings for the year when, in fact, the two per cent. was not an effective allowance. In the new Clause the Chancellor does not meet that point.</p>

<p>The Clause as drafted, quite frankly, does not go to the full extent of the request which was made by the pottery working party. That request would, in point of fact, extend to a length to which the Chancellor of the Exchequer feels he cannot go. It would mean that the balancing allowance would be calculated by reference to the whole life of the building concerned which fell before the appointed day and after the appointed day. That is a concession which, in the view of my right hon. Friend would be quite unjustifiable, and, therefore, he feels he is not in a position to accept it.</p>

<p>I beg to move, "That the Clause be read a Second time."<br/>
This Clause, too, is one of some complexity. It also represents a concession by the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arguments which were adduced from the opposite side in Committee, particularly


in the form of an Amendment put down by the hon. Member for Stockport (Sir A. Gridley). Briefly, what he proposed was that, in the case of deferment of repairs, if it were more expedient on the whole, instead of carrying our repairs, to scrap the building, machinery or plant which required repair, the person who was the owner of the building, machinery or plant in question could scrap the building, machinery or plant an claim as an allowance the amount to which he would have been entitled by way of deferment repairs had he carried them out. That is what was proposed in the Amendment. I opposed that Amendment and gave various reasons for that attitude. The main reason was that already, by virtue of the provisions of paragraph 3 of the Seventh Schedule of the Financial (No. 2) Act. 1939 and certain other provisions, virtually the same concession was already granted by the law as it stood. I did, however, point out that neither that Schedule nor any other provision of Income Tax legislation applied to buildings as distinct from plant and machinery which were acquired before 1937. Paragraph 3 of the Seventh Schedule of the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1939, applied to plant, buildings and machinery acquired after 1937. Similarly, Rules 6 and 7 of Cases 1 and 2, Schedule D of the Income Tax Act of 1918 applied only to plant and machinery and not to buildings whether acquired before or after 1937. The result was there was a gap in existing legislation in so far as buildings acquired before 1937 were concerned.<br/>
This Clause is designed to fill that gap in the sense in which it was sought to be dealt with by the Amendment to which I have referred. It does, in other words, provide in respect of buildings acquired before 1937, that if the owner of the buildings, instead of carrying out deferred repairs, scraps the buildings on the ground that that is more economical to do so, he shall be entitled to claim, as an allowance, the amounts which he would have been entitled to claim as deferred repairs allowance, proportionate to the expenditure which he incurred in replacing the building. For example, supposing a man scraps a building and replaces it with a new building at a cost of &#x00A3;100,000. If instead of scrapping that building he had repaired it and was entitled to an allowance of &#x00A3;70,000 he would

still be entitled to that allowance in respect of the expenditure of &#x00A3;100,000. In making this concession my right hon. Friend feels he is giving an added stimulus to industry. He is encouraging industry to scrap obsolete buildings, and he is going a long way to meet the point embodied in the Amendment put down by the hon. Member for Stockport.</p>

<p>I beg to move, "That the Clause be read a Second time."<br/>
This Clause, and the following Clause, are in the same form as those which were put down on the Committee stage. They were then debated together, and were then refused on the ground that to put their provisions into effect would be too costly. Rehabilitation costs are allowed by the Bill for Excess Profits Tax, and only some part of these costs will be of a capital nature. The Solicitor-General, in commenting upon these Clauses when they were brought up in Committee, said that the capital cost of alterations to buildings would be written off in 45 years by


the operation of the Income Tax Act, 1945, and that, as regards plant and machinery, the period would be much shorter. I suggest that that argument is correct only so far as Income Tax is concerned, and that it hardly applies with regard to the Excess Profits Tax. That being so, the taxpayer will have to bear the whole cost of capital expenses of rehabilitation without relief from the Excess Profits Tax. Why should this be an expensive concession to make? If it is only part of the rehabilitation costs which is in question, that part which is revenue will, automatically, be allowed for Income Tax, and also for Excess Profits Tax. As the cost of making these special wartime arrangements is allowed for E.P.T. and Income Tax&#x2014;the latter by way of special depreciation&#x2014;the cost of undoing this special expenditure should equally be allowed for E.P.T. and Income Tax. I agree that by operation of the Income Tax Act, 1945, the cast of any special building, or alterations thereto, would be written off over 45 years, and in a shorter period in connection with plant, but 45 years is a long time to wait for relief of expenditure which is certainly attributable to the war.<br/>
The difference between the expenditure for which the Income Tax Act, 1945, gives an allowance, and the expenditure incurred on rehabilitation costs, is that the former creates an asset which is in use over the period for which the allowances are to be given. The rehabilitation costs are merely the costs of getting rid of an impediment to production, and converting wartime buildings to a peacetime layout. The money is lost as soon as it is spent; there is nothing else that could be depreciated over a period. That is an additional argument which the Solicitor-General did not meet, and I think it is right that we should now come back to further consideration of this matter.</p>

<p>I beg to second the Motion.<br/>
I hope my hon. and learned Friend the Solicitor-General will accept this Clause, because there is a considerable amount of equity in it. The firm which has rehabilitation expenses will have to bear practically the whole of the capital account itself unless it happens to pay E.P.T., in which case it can set 6 per cent. of its expenses against E.P.T., under Clause 33. The only argument which my hon. and learned Friend used when this matter was previ-

ously discussed, was that this would mean a very costly concession. In saying that, I think that he rather exaggerated. All revenue expenses are already capable of being set against profits, under the ordinary Income Tax law. All firms that pay E.P.T. will be able to set off their capital expenses for E.P.T. to the extent of 66 per cent. That leaves those firms which are not paying E.P.T. to bear the whole of the cost. There is also the additional burden which will fall on the revenue. When you come to add up the additional expenditure it will be 6 per cent. in the case of buildings or 10 per cent. in the case of machinery, in addition to the revenue allowance, the E.P.T. allowance and the initial allowance under the 1945 Act. Taking all these various deductions from the actual cost, it seems to me that the Solicitor-General was exaggerating when he said that a heavy expenditure would be involved. Much of this expenditure was incurred, if not directly under order from the Government&#x2014;and some of it was, by the concentration of industry&#x2014;in the national interest. There is, therefore, a strong case for seeing that those firms which do not pay E.P.T. should be put on the same footing as those which do.</p>

<p>The Solicitor-General, when this matter was debated on the Committee stage, referred to its being expensive. It seems to me that justice ought not to be measured in that way. I do not think it is right for the Solicitor-General to say, "You have made a very good case, but it cannot be afforded." This is not an ordinary matter of taxation, but one of justice. Secondly, the Solicitor-General said that it is not as unfair as one might think at first sight. My hon. Friend the Member for Stockport (Sir A. Gridley) has already observed that it is hardly sufficient to tell a man that everything will be all right and that things will straighten themselves out in 45 years. I feel that the Solicitor-General did not do himself justice in the arguments he used on that occasion. He promised that, having heard our statements, he would consult with the Chancellor and see whether something better could be done. As I said on the Committee stage, having been a temporary civil servant who persuaded people to do all sorts of things and assured them that they would be dealt


with fairly, I find it very hard that such people should now be able to say, "Had I been a slacker and done nothing, I should have been very much better off than I am now after having obliged you." I feel that we ought to help these people and to see that they are not worse off than those who refused to help us, who got ready for the end of the war, and did nothing else. I hope the Solicitor-General will give further consideration to this matter.</p>

<p>May I refer to the remarks of the hon. Member for Stockport (Sir A. Gridley) about what said during the Committee stage? I would not like to think that I had misled hon. Members, and I did not do so intentionally. If the hon. Member will refer to my speech on that occasion, he will find that I did not say that the Income Tax Act, 1945, applied to the Profits Tax. I referred to the provisions of the Income Tax Acts; I did not intend to include that particular Act, there being a large number of others. The ordinary provisions as to wear and tear and as to revenue deduction do apply. I quite agree with the hon. Member that the Income Tax Act, 1945, does not apply to the Profits Tax.<br/>
This point was discussed in Committee and both these new Clauses were on the Order Paper in the same form as they are today, and I hope that the House, and in particular the hon. Member for Stockport, will be satisfied if, on the authority of my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer, I give the following assurance. My right hon. Friend authorises me to say that, without commitment, he will undertake to consider the matter more fully before next year's Finance Bill. I hope the hon. Gentleman will be satisfied with that assurance. The problem is not a simple one. It is a difficult problem, and there is a great deal to be said on both sides of it. After all, it is not easy to justify, from one point of view, singling out rehabilitation expenses, and allowing them for purposes of Income Tax in one lump, when the same is not done with numerous other reconstruction expenses which an undertaking must of necessity incur in order to get back on to its feet. There is a whole range of expenses which are absolutely necessary and which any enterprise that

needs to restart after the war must, of necessity, incur. The new Clause would not cover such expenses, but would single out rehabilitation expenses. I do not disagree with the view that there is possibly a stronger case with regard to rehabilitation expenses than with regard to a great many other expenses, but the matter does require careful consideration. We have had some time for consideration, but we want more time, for the matter requires careful working out. I hope the House will not think that we are considering the matter in an offhand way, or are not taking the suggestion seriously, but we will give it the thought which it deserves, and will go into it much more fully before next year. Of course, I cannot at this stage give any undertaking of any commitment, because I have no authority to do so. With the assurance I have given, I hope that the hon. Member for Stockport will think it right not to press the new Clause.</p>

<p>Will the Solicitor-General give an estimate of the cost? It is very important, if this matter is to be thought out, that we should have some idea of what it would cost. If it is only a comparatively small sum, I do not think we ought to be satisfied with being put off. I entirely agree with the Solicitor-General that there is a case for saying that rehabilitation expenses, most of which are incurred under directions from the Government, are in a special position. I know there are many other expenses which firms have, such as building up their market research and so on, but rehabilitation expenditure is of a special sort, and after all, firms will be incurring it during the next year, and it would not be very satisfactory if they had to wait for another year. Could the hon. and learned Gentleman tell us something about the cost?</p>

<p>I would like to thank the Solicitor-General. I quite see the wisdom of deferring this matter until next year and giving the proposal real and proper consideration in that time. It is clearly a most difficult matter, particularly with regard to the line of differentiation between what is really a revenue expense and what is a continuing asset to the company concerned.<br/>
There is one argument which I think has not been put, and I think the Solicitor-General would wish to take it


into account in the intervening period. It is the desirability for our companies in this country to have a strong balance sheet and to write off in their accounts anything which does not have a long continuing asset value. We must face the fact that the influence of the Treasury in company finance is very great. It is true that one can quite properly keep, although it may appear paradoxical, two sets of books, one for the benefit of the Inland Revenue and the other, the more conservative one, for one's shareholders; but by and large, the general effect is that if the Inland Revenue say that one must not write off this against profits, the firms do not in fact write it off, and thereby they water or inflate their capital to the extent that the regulations passed by the House make it, in effect, justifiable for them to do so. I hope that, in considering this point, the Solicitor-General will bear in mind the desirability of companies in this country, in competing with firms overseas, being in a strong balance-sheet position and not having inflated assets.</p>

<p>I think we have had a most unsatisfactory reply from the Government on this new Clause. What is the position? It is that rehabilitation costs, which are defined by Clause 33 (5) of the Bill, are properly allowed against an assessment to Excess Profits Tax. These rehabilitation costs consist of three things. First, expenditure on the removal of works designed to afford protection from hostile attack, that is to say, works carried out under duress in the early years of the war in order to protect workers in factories from enemy bombing; second, the removal of a works from one place in the country to another; and, third, the adaptation of works for a different purpose during the war. All the costs properly incurred in carrying out these wartime works are to be allowed against liability to Excess Profits Tax, and all that we on this side have asked is that, that being so and these works having been undertaken under compulsion, the cost of restoring the former position should also be allowed for Income Tax purposes and for the purposes of what was formerly called national defence contribution but is now called the profits tax.<br/>
In equity I think the case is clearly made out; in fact I think this was admitted on the Committee stage by the Solicitor-General when he adduced as his

primary argument against accepting the proposal the fact that it would be too expensive for the Government to adopt. We have not heard that argument repeated today, and in point of fact those who know something about this matter realise that from the point of view of cost there will be very little money in this new Clause. What happened on the Committee stage? The Chancellor of the Exchequer was not in the Committee when the proposal was under discussion, but left it to the learned and, I may say, very courteous Solicitor-General to handle this matter. The Chancellor came in after the matter had been pressed for some time and invited us to withdraw the proposal on his undertaking that the matter would be further looked into before the Report stage. I will not bother the House with the exact words that he used but in fact the proposal was, I think, withdrawn upon the Chancellor assuring the Committee that the matter would have further attention. Something like three or four weeks have elapsed since this matter was discussed in the Committee stage. The same proposals are put down again, they are moved from these benches, they are supported in what I thought was a most reasonable and cogent speech by an hon. Member on the Government side, the hon. Member for Chesterfield (Mr. Benson), who knows a great deal about these financial questions, and what is the Government's reply?<br/>
No doubt for some good reason the Chancellor again absents himself during the discussion of this important subject. The right hon. Gentleman went out as soon as this new Clause was moved, and what is it that the House is offered by way of consolation from the hon. and learned Solicitor-General? The House is not offered this time the argument that the proposal would be too expensive; that argument has been abandoned. We are not offered arguments against this new Clause on its merits; we are simply told that the Chancellor has authorised the Solicitor-General to give an undertaking to the House to consider this matter more fully before next year's Finance Bill. I say that this is a very unsatisfactory position. The case has been made out in equity and I think the House was convinced of the fairness of these proposals nearly a month ago. There have been three or four weeks at least for this matter to be further con


sidered but all we are told is that the whole thing will remain in the air for another 12 months. In the meantime these rehabilitation costs have to be incurred by many people engaged in industry. Air raid barriers and buffers of all kinds have to be taken down, works have to be moved back from one part of the country to another, wartime adaptations of plants and factories have to be undone&#x2014;all this work is proceeding yet no one carrying it out will have any certainty at all that at any time will he be allowed to count for the purposes of Income Tax the costs of this work done under duress during the war. I really think that the position is most unsatisfactory and in the circumstances we on this side shall have to press the matter to a Division.</p>

<p>I am really amazed at a great many things in connection with this new Clause. The first is that the Chancellor of the Exchequer should seek to absent himself during the discussion of a matter of such great importance as the rehabilitation of the trade and industry of the country. As I understand the position, it is that firms who have had to move during the war from one place to another, or to erect various things for the protection of their plant and machinery for purely war purposes, are encouraged to take down those impediments to their businesses but are not encouraged in any way by means of taxation under this Clause to put the thing right and to place their factory in a position to carry on their businesses.<br/>
Imagine what is going to be the effect of this kind of dual purpose project. The various things that hinder business are to be taken away, but nothing is to be done to help firms to get started again. The right hon. Gentleman the Leader of the House goes to a place like Birmingham and tells the business people to get on with it; why does he not come down and help the Chancellor of the Exchequer to encourage them by giving them the relief which is so urgently necessary on this occasion? I think this is the strangest of those many strange examples which we are seeing at the present time. At one minute we have the Solicitor-General&#x2014;although I do not pretend that he is doing it with any bad intent; he just does not know&#x2014;discouraging business, while at

another other hon. Members opposite say the reverse. It is a very unfortunate position, and what strikes me also is the very interesting speech which has just been made by the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. I. J. Pitman). He pointed out very clearly, on a subject of which he has very great knowledge indeed, that if, in this matter of accounting, we have a form of taxation of this kind hanging over us at the present time a firm is tempted to do this, that or the other thing. The hon. Member also pointed out that it is a great hindrance to the development of a company to have those burdens hanging over them. I will take it one step further; if the hindrances are being piled up on to the companies in this way, as was put very fairly just now, surely it would be in the interests of the Chancellor to cut his losses at the present time and to know where he is, encouraging these business people to go on, instead of saying, as he has, through the Solicitor-General, that he will think it over during the next year. What would happen if every business in the country behaved like that and said they would think things over and perhaps rebuild or do something of the kind in a year? But of course private enterprise is not so dull and would not do such a thing.<br/>
Let me come now to the Solicitor-General's quite interesting speech. I will not say "remarkable" speech because we have heard so many like it recently. In the first place the hon. and learned Gentleman said he could not accept the present proposal because of the cost; now he says he does not know what the costs are. If this House is always to be treated in this way how are we to understand whether this is a big thing or not? We do not know the cost and we have no means of ascertaining it. How can hon. Gentlemen on the other side of the House, in their desire to support the Government on this occasion, argue against trade and business and the employment of labour when they have not the haziest idea of what the cost is&#x2014;unless they have some secret information which is not available either to the House or the learned Solicitor-General? The Government must have some sort of idea of the cost&#x2014;I do not ask for anything very definite but they ought to try to meet the point of view of big business.<br/>
The hon. and learned Gentleman has told us to wait till next year. The Chancellor has had four or five weeks in which to think over the matter. This is a matter of considerable importance. It must have occurred to the Chancellor over and over again. I cannot imagine the ex-Chancellor of the Exchequer, whom I see on our Front Bench, taking all this time to deal with the matter. Probably he would have done in 24 hours what the Government want one year, one month, and a few odd weeks, to do. This is another illustration of the refusal of the Government to put first things, first. The Government have so messed up their position that they do not know where they are. It is no good telling us to wait until next year, or saying that they do not know the cost. That is not treating the House or the country properly. I believe that the Solicitor-General will be very sorry that he did not do a little more work on this matter and try to find a solution. It is a pity, also, that the Chancellor could not have handled this matter himself and got it settled as he might very well have done.</p>

<p>We are not without hope that the arrival of a representative of the usual channels upon the Front Bench opposite may be an omen of some importance, as he has been oscillating between the Front Bench and some of the distinguished representatives under the Gallery. I rise for the purpose of expressing the hope that the Solicitor-General may not have closed his mind finally on this matter. I urge upon him that another 12 months is a very long period indeed to keep this matter in suspense. In April, 1947, we shall be approximately 18 months after VJ-Day.<br/>
Reference has been made from this Front Bench to the temporary absence of the Chancellor of the Exchequer. I hope that does not mean that the Solicitor-General has instructions to remain entirely uninfluenced by the Debate upon the proposed new Clause. If there is no Minister who can yield to the opinions expressed on both sides of the House, and if the Solicitor-General is there merely for the purpose of ringing a bell in the Smoke Room and the Terrace Bar, it is a pity. This is the Finance Bill, which cannot be amended in another place. The Solicitor-General therefore is the arbiter of fate, on these proposals. Upon his shoulders will

rest the responsibility. He has to take the decision here and now. He is evidently a man after the very heart of the Minister of Fuel and Power, who has been dealing with some of these matters during the weekend.<br/>
No speech has come from behind the Solicitor-General supporting his attitude, whilst we have had the advantage of support of an extremely well informed kind from the Government side. I hope that the Solicitor-General, conciliatory as he usually is, will not take up a harsh and unyielding attitude on this matter. The Financial Secretary to the Treasury is with him and we are at a stage of the day when all that hon. Gentleman's faculties are fully awake. It is very early in the Sitting. I am sure the hon. Gentleman has followed the Debate with very great care, and I therefore appeal to him and to the Solicitor-General to make a further statement.</p>

<p>I hope we are to have a further reply. I have been looking patiently round the corner for the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrive. For some reason, as on the previous occasion, he is absent. I would like to remind hon. Gentlemen of what passed before. This matter was debated on 25th June, and not in the middle of the night, either. It was about six o'clock in the evening. Fortunately the time is shown in the columns of HANSARD. We were then discussing the Profits Tax, and after the appeals and strong arguments which were made on tins new Clause, the Chancellor said that he was caught at a certain disadvantage. He said:
<q>Although I have my own view on these matters, I have not had the benefit of hearing what has been said from the other side of the Committee.</q>
He did not tell us what his views were, but he assured us that he had them. He went on:
<q>Therefore, I do not think it would be right for me to say more now than that I will study the arguments, as this is a matter to which the Opposition attach considerable importance, and if they will not press the Clause now, I will look at the Debate in HANSARD and consider between now and the Report stage, according to such judgment as I can form about it"&#x2014;</q>
bearing in mind that he had already said he had certain views on the matter.&#x2014;
<q>if there is anything that can be done to meet the case which they have put. I do not think that it would be honest or sensible


for me to do more than that; but that much I undertake to do."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 25th June, 1946; Vol. 424, c. 1123.]</q>
Since then, he has done nothing at all, except absent himself once again. On that statement, my right hon. Friend the Member for West Bristol (Mr. Stanley) advised his hon. Friends not to take the matter further on that day. In consequence, the Motion and Clause were withdrawn. Since then the Chancellor has had the opportunity, which he said he was going to take, of reading the Debate and of considering what he should do. What has happened? He does not come here, and he gives the Solicitor-General some little statement, which the hon. and learned Gentleman read out with great care and accuracy, to the effect that without making any commitment the Chancellor would look at the matter more fully before the next Finance Bill. Really, what has he been doing since 25th June? He told us then he would look at the matter very carefully and consider it, according to such judgment as he could form. He is doing exactly and precisely nothing. We can therefore do nothing but divide the House on the matter, to show our disapproval of his handling of the affair.<br/>
5.0 p.m.<br/>
I would ask the Solicitor-General whether he proposes to address the House again on this matter, and to explain why he has not given us any amplification of the statement that he made on 25th June on this new Clause. He then said:
<q>It will be an expensive concession&#x2014;it is one which cannot be afforded."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 25th June, 1946; Vol. 424, C. 1112.]</q>
I do not understand that statement, because no one has given us figures to show that this matter is so expensive as is suggested. On the previous occasion the Solicitor-General took the argument that so far as these expenditures were of a revenue nature they would be allowed as deductions from profits under the ordinary provisions of the Income Tax Acts. When it came to expenditure of a capital nature, he said quite a lot explaining that rehabilitation expenditure which is of a capital nature is not useless, from his point of view, to business, and indeed that it will serve as a lasting asset, and therefore the proposals which we are protesting against are not quite as harsh

as hon. Gentlemen on this side of the House might think at first blush, because the asset continues after the rehabilitation has taken place. After having given that previously as a general background to the argument, the Solicitor-General goes on today to say that it will not be easy to single out rehabilitation costs in a way that we are not doing for any other expenses of reconstruction. I do not understand why that should be so. There is a definition of rehabilitation expenditure, and there is nothing to prevent that being singled out. If it turns out that there art other reconstruction expenses of somewhat like nature, perhaps they can be dealt with on a subsequent occasion. This Amendment was supported by an hon. Member behind the Solicitor-General, one who is as expert on these very technical matters as the hon. and learned Gentleman himself &#x2014;</p>

<p>Yes, but he went after having made a valuable contribution. The Chancellor has made no contribution whatsoever, except a little slip of paper which he handed to the Solicitor-General. The hon. Member for Chesterfield (Mr. Benson) is one of the experts, and recognises the validity of the claim we are making. It would be a very great mistake for this Bill to leave us without having this Amendment in it. If it is proved to be inadequate later on, it can be added to, but it is quite certain that no one will want to take this provision out because, even if we accepted the undertaking to give further consideration during the next twelve months, the Chancellor would be bound to come down on our aide of the argument at the finish. He ought to accept the Amendment now, and remove the anxiety which exists in many quarters. It has been pointed out that by the time we get the next Finance Bill two years and more will have elapsed since the end of the war. Surely this is the time to tidy up these post-war complications.<br/>
I hope the Solicitor-General will have been moved by what has been said, though I am afraid that he is bound by the little sentence written on the piece of paper. If that is so, it would be quite possible for him to adjourn further consideration of this Clause and consult the Chancellor,


if he can find him. There are still no signs of the Chancellor&#x2014;.[An HON. MEMBER: "He is not far away."]. If he is not far away, it is an absolute outrage. If he is hiding behind the Chair and is visible to hon. Gentlemen opposite but not to me, it is treating the House with absolute contempt, and on these grounds alone we would be justified in taking a Division. However, it is not on those</p>

<p>I beg to move, "That the Clause be read a Second time."<br/>
On the Committee stage of this Bill the Solicitor-General undertook to look into the point which I then raised. I therefore put this Clause down in the hope that the House might receive a considered reply from him. He said at the time that my purpose seemed to him then to be not far away from the present state of the law. If that proves to be the case, I hope that the Government will consent to accept this Clause. It leads one to reflect how difficult it is for hon. Members on either side of this House to move a Clause which affects the law in any degree at all, but, on the other hand, how extraordinarily easy for hon. and right hon. Gentlemen on the Front Bench opposite to initiate whole Acts of Parliament, which carry out revolutionary and overwhelming changes in our society.<br/>
I would like to remind the House what this Clause does. It applies the procedure of the maintenance claim to the last remaining class of property which is not covered by it. I am sure that the House is already familiar with the procedure of the maintenance claim under the successive Income Tax Acts, particularly under Schedule A, and I will not go into that. I think it is sufficient to say that all

owner-occupiers, whether rural or urban, are already covered by the principle of the maintenance claim, likewise, all tenants whose repairs are undertaken by the landlord, and that applies, of course, equally to agricultural estates and urban properties. Again, all tenants are covered by this principle of the maintenance claim who retain a financial interest in the property, that is to say, where the Schedule A assessment is in excess of the rent. Perhaps I ought to say, not wholly covered but partially covered. They may claim back from the Revenue tax on the cost of repairs up to the limit of the difference between the rent and the Schedule A assessment.<br/>
The law has hitherto generally held&#x2014;I say "generally held" because two inroads, to which I will refer in a moment, have been made into it in recent years&#x2014;that the Income Tax Acts only grant maintenance relief against tax levied in respect of the property, and also, and this is what is important, where it is borne by the person who maintains the property. I suggest that in these days that is becoming a bad principle, because it takes account of the status of the person who pays the tax and not the status of the property. The true object of the State should be to stimulate repairs of property, and it ought not to matter who pays the tax.<br/>
I suggest to the House that Parliament has already recognised that this is a bad principle in two respects, by two separate pieces of legislation. They constitute my precedents in moving this Clause. First of all, the Finance Act, 1940, provided that tenants with a lease of over 50 years were to be treated as if they were owners, and, apart altogether from what was the class of property or what was the relation between the rent and Schedule A, these tenants were enabled to put in a full maintenance claim on the ordinary statutory repairs, in exactly the same way as owners. Secondly, the Income Tax Act, 1945, Section 32, which provided that the relief which the owner of agricultural property can obtain is not to be restricted to the Schedule A Tax, but can be allowed


against other sources of income. That piece of legislation vitiates the principle that a tenant cannot get relief because he does not bear tax in respect of the property.<br/>
I would like the House to consider the kind of property I have in mind. It may be a row of fairly old valuable houses, which belong, shall we say, to the Crown Lands Commission or to the Ecclesiastical Commission. They are let to tenants, each of whom has a lease of under 50 years. Every one of these tenants, as the law now stands, can only repair that property out of his net income. None can get any relief by way of maintenance claim. Taxation being what it is, such properties will tend to deteriorate more rapidly than properties in other classes. That cannot be of advantage to tenants, to owners or to the State. I suggest that by a simple enactment it will be possible to raise this class of property, as regards maintenance, to the ordinary level of other property. Very often these tenants have to undertake enforced expenditure; local authority by-laws or the terms of the lease require them to paint the property at certain definite times, and keep it up to a certain standard. That now falls on them for payment, and they can claim nothing back from the Revenue.<br/>
In this time of shortage of houses, there should be no discrimination against particular classes of property. Every house capable of repair should be repaired, and all should receive the equivalent financial assistance from the revenue. I do not know whether the Solicitor-General is going to accept this Clause; he has a rather stern expression on his face, and it may be that he is going to refuse this. I hope that in that event serious consideration will be given by the Treasury to the rather anomalous state of the law in respect of this class of property, and that satisfactory changes will be made during the course of the next year.</p>

<p>I beg to second the Motion.<br/>
I am not a lawyer, and, therefore, I do not know precisely how tenants are placed in all circumstances in regard to repairing allowances. I wish to support the Clause in respect of agricultural property. I know instances of smallholders in par-

ticular who have very considerable capital expenses placed upon them as tenants. I wish to know whether the tenant in that case does, or does not, get the benefits of the 1945 Act. If not, would it not he possible for the tenant to have those benefits if the Clause becomes law? As an example, there are smallholders, tenants of Wiltshire County Council, who have very heavy expenses in keeping up a road which goes to a dozen or more of their smallholdings. If the expenses of maintaining that properly fell on the landlord, he would get the allowance. But I understand that the smallholders do not get it, because they are tenants. Yet, under their leases, they have to spend that money. There are other agricultural tenants on Salisbury Plain, for instance, who take blocks of land from the War Office, who are the owners of the land for training purposes. In their leases they undertake to spend money on the capital equipment of the land. Although they are tenants, do they rank for allowances under the 1945 Act? I think not. It would be a very good thing, in regard to their cottages, which they have to keep up, if the Clause were put on the Statute Book.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1946-07-15a.918.0" speakerid="unknown" speakername="Mr. McKie" colnum="918" time="">
<p>I wish to support the new Clause. The noble Lord the Member for South Dorset (Viscount Hinchingbrooke) instanced a class of people who would be unable to do anything towards keeping property, which they hold on lease, in proper repair. He also instanced people holding property under the Crown Lands Commissioners and the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. They were tenants of those two bodies and, as the Income Tax Acts at present stand, they would be precluded, because they have no maintenance claim for carrying out very necessary repairs to the property. I have great sympathy with that class of people, because they are people of small means, on whom the burden of taxation rests very heavily indeed. Here we are deliberately precluding them&#x2014;that is if the Solicitor-General turns a deaf ear to us, and I hope he wilt not&#x2014;from carrying out necessary repairs to property. It is necessary that any Government should have proper repair and maintenance of property very much in their minds and at heart.<br/>
The class of persons of whom the noble Lord spoke, are not bloated capitalists whom the Chancellor always seems to


suggest he wishes to do down at every turn. I hope that he or the Solicitor-General will indicate that they are either prepared to accept the Clause, or that at the next opportunity during the passage of the Finance Bill next year, they will do something about the matter. There are other people affected besides those mentioned by the noble Lord, and by my hon. Friend the Member for Chippenham (Mr. Eccles). I suppose I shall not meet with much response from the Chancellor on this point. There are many large properties in the country, where there may be dwelling houses or farms let on repairing leases. It may be that the landlord is unable to carry out the necessary repairs. The property may be in the hands of trustees, and let on repairing leases. What incentive is there to the persons occupying those premises, or agricultural lands, to carry out the necessary repairs to keep the property in proper order? We on this side of the House are not asking for any doles for landlords. I hope we shall not have any hon. or right hon. Member resisting the new Clause on that assumption.</p>

<p>If the hon. Member had studied the matter a little more carefully, and if he will study it in the future, he will see that the point he has sought to make is not a point at all. There is not a landlord desirous of shelving his liabilities on to the shoulders of the tenant. When the hon. Member interrupted with that quite irrelevant question, I was hoping that the Chancellor would have something to say in the way of accepting this new Clause, or, at all events, that he would tell us that proper care of property is a matter which concerns the Government very much. I and my hon. Friends have no desire whatever unduly to benefit either the landlord or the tenant, but we simply wish that property should be kept in order.</p>

<p>In looking at a matter of this kind I have often asked myself what is the really guiding word and the objective of the Clause. The guiding word of this Clause is undoubtedly "maintenance." I think we should examine the object of the Treasury in

granting maintenance to the landowner. It is not that the Treasury is benevolent, kindly, or even hard-hearted. It is purely that the Treasury looks at the matter from the point of view that, if property is not maintained, the Treasury will cease to get income. That is the only reason why the landowner is enabled to get maintenance for the repair of his property. I know of no other reason. The Treasury catches it both way&#x2014;if the property goes out of repair and the owner dies, he does not pay much in Death Duties, and if it goes out of repair and he does not die, he does not pay Income Tax on it. To take the matter a step further, we come to the question of why there has been this vital difference between the tenant who does repairs and the landowner who does repairs.<br/>
We have had previous Chancellors of the Exchequer who did not change it. I think it was in 1940 that we had a Chancellor of very great skill who introduced a system whereby tenants who had a lease of over 50 years were allowed a maintenance claim. I believe that was one of the first innovations in this connection. We have arrived at the position when it is no good the Chancellor saying,
"This is against precedent and against our habits and customs," because the innovation has begun.<br/>
Let us consider why it is better to give maintenance to a landowner than to a tenant. I can conceive lots of reasons, and I have no doubt that hon. Gentlemen opposite can see good reasons, but I do not think, from any fundamental sense of fairness, we can possibly justify a tenant, who has to put on, say, a new roof, getting no relief for the maintenance of the house which he maintains in order that the Chancellor of the Exchequer may get Income Tax out of it. I see no reason why he should have to do it out of his net income without any relief while the landowner gets relief. I happen to be a landowner and hon. Gentlemen opposite, therefore, cannot say that in this matter I am seeking to protect my own interests. If this suggestion is accepted, it will help a considerable number of agricultural properties and a very large number of smaller properties. It will also help considerably in future development I urge the Chancellor, if he wants to keep up his revenue and if he wants to keep factories, works, and houses in a high state of repair, to


apply the law with the same kindliness and fairness to the tenants as he does to the landlords in this respect. It is only fair that he should benefit both. That is the main argument in favour. I notice that hon. Gentlemen opposite, who are not so virulent or in such force as they are at times, do not seem very well disposed towards this new Clause. I am puzzled at that. I should have thought that they would have supported it. This is the kind of Clause which I should have expected not from a noble Lord and a Tory, but from some one who believes in helping tenants rather than owners. We have the rather curious anomaly of the Tory Party supporting the tenants of the property&#x2014;of course, most of us have a a very large number of tenants who vote for us, and we are getting more and more supporters every day&#x2014;and the Socialist Party remaining completely and utterly dumb, unable to say any word on behalf of the tenants. I am not surprised. I know, "Orders is orders," so to speak. I could never do a thing like that myself.<br/>
In view of the fact that we know the policy of the Government with regard to the renting of houses, might we not expect the Chancellor of the Exchequer to accept our point of view and to put it into effect? The Chancellor often tells us that he is not a short-sighted person. Many of us would be quite willing to take his word if only he would give us a little illustration. He should remember that over the years to come revenue would swell enormously if this was brought in because it would encourage the development of property very considerably. He should not take the short view that he may lose a few hundreds or thousands of pounds in the next year. For those reasons I support the Motion. I do not know whether I shall get any support from hon. Gentlemen opposite or from any other hon. Gentlemen on this side of the House. The good work, begun so well in 1940, which had to be stopped because it was difficult to do anything of the sort during the war, should be continued. I should have thought that this work in favour of the tenant who tries to develop his house and property was the kind of work which the Government, with their urge to progress and advancement, would seize upon and that they would exempt one and all.</p>

<p>The Chancellor of the Exchequer has been kind enough already today to give effect to a suggestion of mine on Income Tax law. As I was not in my place when he moved the Clause in question, I should like at once to acknowledge his kindness in that respect, and to build on that kindness the hope that he will at least listen to what I should like to submit to the House on the proposal which we are now discussing. I ought to say at once that I am a tenant of a leasehold property. I am not interested in this particular proposal because the lease of my house runs for more than 50 years.. Being in that position, however, I know something of the facts of the case, and I should like to make quite clear just what is the issue that arises in this connection and just why there is, as a matter of historical fact, this rather curious difference in treatment between the landlord and the tenant&#x2014;a difference in favour of the landlord.<br/>
Take the case of two houses which are, in all respects, exactly similar, assessed at the same amount&#x2014;old houses upon which the burden of repair is very great. In one case, the landlord is responsible for the repairs, and in the other case the tenant is responsible, because of an arrangement between landlord and tenant. When the landlord executes the repairs, he gets relief; when the tenant executes the repairs, he does not get relief. Why does that arise? It arises because when the landlord incurs the expense of repair, that expense reduces his income and he pays on a reduced amount; but when the tenant executes the repairs the cost of executing the repairs is a charge which the tenant has to meet out of income, the income itself remaining unaffected. Therefore, in accordance with the well established principles of Income Tax law, the landlord gets relief, and the tenant does not.<br/>
That did not matter very much&#x2014;no doubt the point was not regarded as of any material importance&#x2014;when the rate of tax was low. But when the rate of tax is high, it is of very real importance. I imagine it was for that reason that in 1940 a change was made in favour of the tenant, notwithstanding that it involved a breach of the commonly accepted principle of Income Tax law that one looks at the amount of income, and takes


account of anything which is a deduction from the income, but takes no account of the charges which have to be met by the possessor of the income. The principle in fact admits of exceptions. The whole system of allowances in respect of family obligations represents a breach in the first principle by which income is determined for the purpose of levying Income Tax.<br/>
It seems to me that here, when we are doing it with our eyes open, we might well recognise that there is not, in fact, any justice in treating a landlord in this matter more favourably than a tenant, simply because he is a landlord and because a certain amount of money in his hands is income, and, in regard to the tenant, it is not, technically, income. I hope, therefore, that the Chancellor will give consideration to this matter, and, even if he is not now prepared, so far as he has been able to consider the matter, to agree to the suggestion, he will go into it and will store it up as one of the various acts of benevolence to which he hopes to be able to treat the community later on. I think, although I made it perfectly clear that the differentiation between landlord and tenant in this matter is something which can be justified in argument by reference to the principles on which the Income Tax structure was erected, we should, at the same time, recognise that, with tax at the level at which it now stands, there must, inevitably, if hardship is not to be inflicted upon taxpayers, be some well-considered exceptions or departures from the logical principle, as it might be automatically applied, and I suggest, for the Chancellor's consideration, that there is here a case for favourable treatment.</p>

<p>I am quite prepared to answer that question, though it is not particularly relevant to the case I have put. I had a great many suggestions to consider. I agreed, in certain cases, to make very important departures from what had been regarded as almost sacred principles of Income Tax law.

<p>I will say why my right hon. Friend feels that he cannot do it now, and why we feel that we can only store it up and consider it, which we shall readily undertake to do. I was surprised to hear the right hon. Gentleman, as I was surprised to hear the noble Lord, say that, in circumstances such as they outlined, tenants would not be able to claim relief in respect of repairs under Rule 8 of No. 5 of Schedule A. I am not speaking of tenants with leases of over 50 years but of tenants with leases under 50 years. The tenant who occupies land at a rent which is less than the rack rent, has a beneficial interest, and, for the purpose of Rule 8 of No. 5 of Schedule A, he is treated as the owner, and is entitled to claim the allowance which Rule 8 provides in respect of maintenance and repairs.</p>

<p>I am reluctant to interrupt the learned Solicitor-General on a legal question, but is not the extent of the relief which the tenant, in those circumstances, can claim, limited to the difference between the rent which the tenant in fact pays, and the full Schedule A value?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1946-07-15a.924.4" hansard_membership_id="12665" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/20823" speakername="The Solicitor-General" colnum="924" time="">
<p>That is so. He cannot get relief beyond the amount of his Schedule A tax. That I quite accept, and it is perfectly reasonable. That represents the extent of his interest, and it is what we expect the Act to provide. That is the position of the landlord, so that, in that respect, the tenant and landlord, if the tenant is a beneficial owner, are on precisely the same footing. If bon. Members will look at the new Clause, they will see that its proposals, in respect of the relief afforded by Rule 8, place the tenant on the same footing as the landlord. If and in so far as the tenant is a beneficial owner, he is already in the position of the landlord, and can claim precisely the same relief in respect of his repairs.<br/>
The noble Lord instanced the case of old houses owned by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners and let on leases of under 50 years. If, as presumably would be the case in a tenancy of that kind, the tenant has a beneficial interest, in that he occupies the property at less than the rack rent, he can claim the allowance under Rule 8. If he has not got a beneficial interest, he cannot claim the allowance, and there is not the smallest reason in the world why he should. A tenant who occupies on terms under which he has not got a beneficial interest, in that he does not get it at less than the rack rent, will, presumably, have had his rent adjusted according to whether he bears the burden of repairs or not. If he is under an obligation to pay for the repairs, clearly his rent will be proportionately lower. Conversely, if he does not have to pay for the repairs, he has to pay more in rent, and that is perfectly fair and reasonable, so that the thing is adjusted and balances itself. It is only in the case where the tenant has a beneficial interest that the question of claiming a right to an allowance under Rule 8 arises, and he has that right. Except in the case of the tenant who has no beneficial interest, the proposed new Clause does not alter the situation in the least, and does not give the tenant any right which he has not got already. In the case of the tenant not having that beneficial interest, the rent is adjusted according to whether the burden of repairs falls on him or on the landlord. Although we will certainly ponder over and consider with the greatest care the arguments that have been advanced, we feel certain, so far as our considerations have taken us hitherto, that there is no ground for accepting the new Clause.</p>

<p>May I point out to the learned Solicitor-General a personal experience that recently occurred to me? About three and a half years ago I had to take a couple of empty agricultural cottages in order to house two workmen. I had to pay a high rent for these cottages, and had to take them on a lease. Both cottages badly needed repairs, but I could not get the landlord to do anything at all or to make any concession to me in the way of allowance for repairs. Consequently, I repaired them myself. I could, had I so chosen, have allowed my workpeople to live in the cottages as they were, but I do not happen to be that kind of a man, and I

spent a considerable sum of money&#x2014;I think, the &#x00A3;100 which was then allowed &#x2014;on each of these cottages for repairs. I obtained no relief from Income Tax in respect of the repair of these cottages; and this proposed new Clause, had it been in existence then, would have rightly benefited me and would have encouraged me to do what, in fact, I did do, and such a Clause might well encourage other people, less interested in the conditions under which their workpeople are housed, to do the same. That is a real point, especially in rural districts, which the Chancellor of the Exchequer might well ponder.</p>

<p>In some ways, I regret that I did not catch your eye sooner, Mr. Deputy-Speaker, because I think I could have cleared up what was, I submit, a misunderstanding by the learned Solicitor-General of what my right hon. Friend the Member for the Scottish Universities (Sir J. Anderson) was saying. My right hon. Friend was trying to make a point which, as I say, was clear, but was misunderstood. I started my sentence by saying that I thought the learned Solicitor-General had misunderstood what was said. My right hon. Friend propounded the story of two adjoining houses. The whole point at issue is that the difference between the gross assessment and the net assessment, which is the notional figure allowed for repairs to the householder who is a tenant doing repairs, is very often totally insufficient, and then a situation arises which is very unfair on the tenant. In a similar situation, if the landlord is doing the repairs, or if the tenant has been a tenant for more than 50 years, the benefit, for Income Tax purposes, of the cost of repairs, due to some piece of bad luck, would not fall on the short lease-holding tenant as the law is at present. This Amendment is an endeavour to right that obvious wrong.<br/>
I speak from experience. Drains can be a most expensive form of repair. It is extraordinarily bad luck, but if a tenant paying a fair rent for a house, having regard to the fact that he has to do repairs, the allowance in respect of repairs allowed to him is, in effect, the difference between the gross and the net assessments. There can be cases in which the actual repairs come to many hundred of pounds more than the notional amount allowed, and that is the issue we are considering,


not the one put by the learned Solicitor-General. I want hon. Members opposite to appreciate that this is in the interest of the tenant and not of the landlord.<br/>
In the case of many small cottages, particularly if they are in quantity, the landlord has to do repairs because they will not otherwise get done. In this case, the landlord is getting the benefit of maintenance. I want hon. Members opposite to believe me when I say that there are cases of small men who let a cottage to other small men with the repairs falling on the tenant. It is very unfair that, where the repairs are considerable, the difference between the notional and the actual repairs should fall on the tenant without any Income Tax benefit, whereas, if they were falling on the landlord, he would get the Income Tax benefit. That is the purpose of this Amendment.</p>

<p>In a very few words, I wish to express my regret that the hon. and learned Solicitor-General has not, on behalf of the Government, found it possible to grant the relief we are suggesting. I understand that the matter will he considered, but I should like to have heard now that the consideration was going to be a favourable one. In Cornwall, we have a number of leases based on third parties. It is a peculiar system and one which very often involves a considerable hardship for the tenant, who is quite uncertain for how long the lease is going on because it terminates when the life of some third party comes to an end. For this special reason, as well as for those already stated, I should like to have seen this relief given to the tenant.</p>

<p>I am very glad that my hon. Friend the Member for Bath (Mr. Pitman) has been able to clear up the misunderstanding which the learned Solicitor-General threw about the House. I rather suspected that there must be some misunderstanding to be cleared up, as we have not heard from the hon. Member for South Cardiff (Mr. Callaghan) on the subject. Not having been in his place a little earlier, he was not in time to hear the speech of the learned Solicitor-General. I cannot accept the argument as to the effect of the incidence of Schedule A upon the beneficial owner. But even if one were able to accept it, surely there could he no objection to the acceptance of the

provisions of this Amendment because they would not adversely affect the receipts of the Treasury? If the Treasury is not going to suffer, surely it cannot object to extending the relief in order to right a wrong which has been pointed out?<br/>
Personally, I should like to go further, and abolish Schedule A altogether. But this is a step in the right direction because the incidence of this tax does not really fall where Income Tax was originally intended to fall. As I understand it, the origin of Income Tax, including Schedule A, or particularly with regard to Schedule A. was a tax upon income or upon the notional income that the value of a house represented. In this particular case, where the value of the living accommodation is reduced to the tenant by the fact of his having to bear the cost of repairs, it is only fair that, as in the case of the landlord, he should be entitled to benefit by setting off the expense of repairs up to the limit of the tax which the house represents, or the notional income which the house should produce represents.<br/>
There is one argument which has not so far been advanced, and one which I think should appeal to the Government. The majority of cases with which this particular Amendment deals concern the larger type of house. It is not so much the cottage upon which the tenant has to bear the cost of repair; it is generally the house with the longer lease, which is larger than the cottage. In those cases, the present occupants are having very great difficulties indeed. In practically all those cases the incomes of the tenants have been reduced, but in this case where they are also liable for the cost of the repairs, the cost of the repairs has gone up, and in addition to that, the tax has increased as well. Therefore, they are hit in all directions. It is no longer profitable, and in many cases it is no longer convenient, for them to be able to occupy the whole of a house, but owing to the reduction in their income, caused partly by the increase in taxation, they are unable to incur the expense which would be involved in dividing the house into two or more habitations which would result in the increase of accommodation and would also enable them to live more within their income. If, in making such alterations to the house, it were possible for the cost of the necessary repairs to be counted as a deduction against their income tax, the


money would not have to be found out of their net income, and it would be a substantial encouragement to people to increase the amount of accommodation which at present is available in the houses which are nowadays too large for one family to live in alone, but which are unable to be converted.</p>

<p>My noble Friend the Member for Southern Dorset (Viscount Hinchingbrooke) has done the House a good service in moving this Clause, because it has given an opportunity for discussing a subject which, although bristling with technical difficulties, demands serious consideration by the Government. The learned Solicitor-General put his case quite clearly, but I do not think he yet appreciates the full force of the case which we have put from this side of the House. I do not feel that I can make this very technical subject crystal clear. My right hon. Friend the Member for the Scottish Universities (Sir J. Anderson) did make his point crystal clear, and I would like to ask the Solicitor-General, in connection with the case which my right hon. Friend put, for example, in the case of a medium term lease entered into between parties some years ago, when the cost of repairs was much lower and when the rate of Income Tax was much lower, whether there is not a case there which needs further examination and a more detailed reply than the hon. and learned Gentleman gave us.<br/>
I think it is not fully appreciated that where, in the case of the landlord, the whole of his income is eaten up by repairs, no tax is payable, but the tenant does not find himself in quite the same position. I think one good thing will -come of this Debate, if it is possible for the Press to find room for it tomorrow, and that is that tenants may learn what their rights are under Rule 8, No. V, Schedule A. I only learned what my rights were in this matter by chance. It so happens that, as an owner, I knew something about maintenance claims:in agricultural property, and when I became a leasehold tenant when I came to London some years afterwards, I asked myself how it was that something of this sort did not apply in the case of tenants with repairing leases. I inquired and found that it did apply, but few of my neighbours were aware of the fact. Therefore, I hope that whatever else may come of this Debate, many people who have not heard of this particular form of relief will acquaint themselves with it and will take advantage of it. The Solicitor-General did not give us much encouragement about next year. He has rejected this new Clause, and we on this side of the House do plead, after the cogent case put forward, that rather more serious consideration will be given to the case before next year. I hope the Chancellor will undertake to give that consideration.</p>

<p>I know, but my right hon. Friend has given the pious promise of further consideration, which makes it incumbent upon me to advance one other argument. The noble Lord the Member for Southern Dorset (Viscount Hinchingbrooke) made out a modest and proper case for this Clause, but the arguments which he put forward were exploded by the hon. Member for Torquay (Mr. C. Williams). I always listen to the hon. Member with fascination, if not with exhilaration. So far as I was able to trace his argument, it was reminiscent of the lady who wrote to Sir Robert Ball and said, "I am sorry, I cannot attend your lecture on sun spots. The fact is, I am liable to freckle so easily." I have been a practising solicitor for 20 odd years, and I have drawn leases and tenancy agreements in four counties, but I have never drawn one which would come within the terms of this Clause. When the noble Lord was submitting his case it occurred to me that there might be a special practice in Dorset. There are various leasehold practices in different counties. For instance, Kent has a special practice. It occurred to me that a special case might be put forward for a particular locality, but when the hon. Member for Torquay said that the acceptance of this Clause would affect many cases and it would be of tremendous importance to tenants up and down the country, he exploded the noble Lord's argument and showed that would, in fact, happen.</p>

<p>That may be, but if it is going to affect a large number of different cases, it will be for the reason put forward by one of my hon. Friends who spoke a little earlier. The landlord will dictate as a term of the lease that there shall be a complete obligation on the tenant to take over the whole cost of repairs. At the moment, in the ordinary lease of an ordinary house, the tenant does indoor repairs and the landlord does external repairs. There are special clauses. I contend that this would mean that the tenant would be forced to accept an additional obligation, in circumstances when the housing position means that he cannot bargain too closely about the rent. For

that reason, I ask the Chancellor to consider this matter carefully before he makes any concession.</p>

We are now dealing with that part of the Finance Bill which concerns the import of coffee essences. As the House will remember, under the Bill the statutory prohibitions on the import of coffee essences will come to an end, and in their place we are to have duties, with Imperial Preference. The Chancellor took credit for this, and said that he had always supported Imperial Preference, and had even, on one occasion at least, given a rebellious vote for it. As the overwhelming bulk of imports from the Dominions and Colonies are foodstuffs, and always have been, and as Imperial Preference demands a tax on foodstuffs which can be partially lifted in favour of the Colonies or Dominions, we on these benches are a little puzzled to reconcile this longterm loyalty on the part of the Chancellor with the frequent jibes that the bulk of the Government have made at the Opposition, of being food taxers. Perhaps the knowledge that his own Government would not only reduce the size of the loaf, but would also ration it, may have had something to do with persuading the Chancellor 20 years ago to adopt a more generous attitude in our approach to Imperial Preference. I and my colleagues are glad to welcome one right hon. Gentleman opposite to the support of Imperial Preference. We hope he will show to the United States the same resolution and toughness as he says he showed to his own party Whip, and to the late Lord Snowden in regard to Imperial Preference.<br/>
We are very anxious that the Imperial Preference conceded by this proposal, which we welcome, should be a reality


and not a sham. I believe the Chancellor&#x2014;his words certainly justify this belief&#x2014;is himself anxious that this preference should be a reality. Some hon. Members may know that at the present moment we have, under a previous Finance Act, two forms of duty on coffee imports. There is the duty on roasted coffee, and the ordinary duty on raw coffee. In regard to the duty on roasted coffee, we have an Imperial Preference of one-sixth. As to the duty on raw coffee, we have an Empire Preference of two-thirds.</p>

<p>By "roasted coffee," I mean coffee that has been treated in any way at all. By "raw coffee" I mean ordinary coffee, untreated. The duty on roasted coffee, or coffee treated in any other way, gives a preference of one-sixth, and the duty on raw coffee gives a preference of two-thirds. The Government having solved a technical problem which has puzzled the experts of the Treasury for the last 70 years&#x2014;our own explanation is slightly more cynical than that&#x2014;we are now concerned, for the first time in our history, in applying a duty on coffee essences. On the duty of the Chancellor, this preference on coffee essences is to be at the lower level; that is, at the roasted coffee level of one-sixth. The effect of our Amendment would be to raise that duty from one-sixth to two-thirds; that is to say, to raise it from the preference on roasted coffee to the preference on raw coffee. This matter has been twice discussed in the House already. In the Debate on 17th April, the Chancellor used these words:
<q>We are applying the preferential rebate of one-sixth on Empire products&#x2026;which is the same as the rebate now applied on coffee itself. [OFFICIAL REPORT, 17th April, [946; Vol. 421, C. 2742.]</q>
No doubt quite unintentionally, that did, in part, mislead some hon. Members, including myself, because I do not think most hon. Members realised that we have two rates of Imperial Preference, one applying on raw coffee and one on roasted coffee. For the preference that the Chancellor has granted, the one-sixth preference is a preference on roasted coffee but not on raw coffee. Later on, in the second Debate which we had, on 19th June, the

Chancellor, after listening to the arguments that had been advanced in favour of widening the Imperial Preference margin, said he would look into the matter and see if, in the light of our treatment of comparable products, any further preference could be granted.<br/>
Personally&#x2014;and I would be interested to know the answer&#x2014;I do not see why the preference on roasted coffee should be very considerably less than the preference on raw coffee. At first sight, it would appear that the method we have now adopted puts a premium on foreign imports, and puts Empire imports which have been processed at a certain disadvantage. It has not mattered very much in the past, because the imports of roasted coffee have been negligible; but it does matter now that we are applying this scale of duty and preference to imports of coffee essence. I hope the Chancellor will be able to meet this very modest but, I think, justifiable claim now, and not add it to the list of those other claims which he will consider in the course of the next 12 months. After all, I believe this represents the first case of Imperial Preference granted by a Socialist Government with full power. If the Chancellor is, as he claims to be, the real friend of Imperial Preference, and has been for many years, this is a very signal opportunity for him to make that preference a reality.<br/>
In the earlier Debates, grave doubts were expressed on this side of the House, as we were lifting the ban on coffee essences and allowing imports limited only by duty. It was freely suggested that it was due to pressure from outside. I do not think many hon. Members doubted but that the United States Government had represented to our Government that a complete prohibition of coffee essence imports was contrary to the new spirit of international trade. If, in fact, this change in our general import practice has been brought about by American pressure, I very much hope that giving the lower rate of preference for coffee essence imports to the Dominions and the Colonies has not also been brought about by American pressure. It would, I think, be a very improper thing if the Government did not settle this question on its merits, but allowed any regard for foreign nations, however anxious they may be to hold their goodwill in the international field, to interfere with what


they believe to be right, judged by our own Imperial responsibility. I hope the right hon. Gentleman will be able to clear my mind of that doubt, and will be able to concede this point and give the higher rate of preference to essences imported from the Dominions and the Colonies.</p>

<p>The Amendment is to leave out "7&#x00BD;d" and to insert "3d." During the course of the hon. Member's speech he has not given us a single iota of evidence why it should be 3d. Could the hon. Gentleman give us some supporting arguments why it should be 3d? Why should not it be 2d?</p>

<p>If the hon. Gentleman would spend as much time b listening to speeches made in this House as he does to preparing his interruptions, I think he would have followed my argument. The point of leaving out "7&#x00BD;." and substituting "3d." was to bring it into line with the two-thirds preference now given to raw coffee, as opposed to the one-sixth preference. The bulk of my speech was devoted to making that clear.</p>

<p>Perhaps the hon. Member will go away to the Library and work out that 3d. on a duty of 9d. represents a preference of two-thirds, whilst 7&#x00BD;d. represents a preference of one-sixth.</p>

<p>I beg to second the Amendment.<br/>
I am afraid I cannot oblige hon. Gentlemen opposite by going into the whole question of taxation. No very fundamental issue arises on this very small Amendment, and I do not want to detain the House long, but there are one or two points I should like to raise. This Clause

now appears to be becoming rather more actual; as the House will remember, we were told before, that, in fact, no import licences would be granted, but it may be, now we have the American Loan, that import licences will be granted and chicory essences may be among the articles we are now promised. I therefore ask the Chancellor to think the matter over more seriously than he did before. I cannot see that it is at all unreasonable that the preference on coffee and chicory essences should be the same as it is on imported raw coffee. Rather, one could give very good reasons why it should be higher, but I cannot see why it should not be given at least the same preference. Not to put on a reasonable preference when we are about to enter upon international negotiations would be very foolish. Perhaps we shall be faced with a country which, in the course of these negotiations, will say "We are protected by a six-barred gate and we are prepared to take off the top bar," while we shall be in the position of saying "We are protected only by a very low hedge, and we are not really on equal terms." I, therefore, think that it is extremely foolish at this particular moment to put on a lower duty than would otherwise be reasonable, when we are going into negotiations with countries whose tariffs are immensely higher than our own.</p>

<p>I asked the hon. Gentleman why, in his Amendment, he had left it at 3d. and my reason for doing so was this. If I were putting the case for 3d. instead of 7&#x00BD;d., I would do it for the purpose of showing that, in some way, those who go in for the manufacture of coffee essences in this country would be placed at an advantage, or were now placed at a disadvantage, and I would produce some figures to show that. Obviously you cannot treat this in the same fashion as you would treat the raw material. It so happens that I have some knowledge of the making of coffee essences, and obviously you do not want to put the same figure on the raw material as on the finished article coming in. If there is any advantage in this kind of tax at all, it is that it enables manufacturers in this country to compete on favourable terms against those who send imports into this country.</p>

<p>Is the hon. Gentleman not aware that that is precisely what


the Government are doing? They are, in fact, imposing the same rate of preference on the finished article as on one form of the raw material, which happens to be roast coffee, and not on the other form. We are anxious to discover why they have not done it, on the more generous level.</p>

<p>Is it not perfectly obvious? One level is imposed on the raw material, and the other on the finished article.</p>

<p>No, they are not. That is the trouble; hon. Members get up and talk on a subject about which they are not informed. They are not the same. Coffee comes into this country, as raw material, in the shape of coffee beans. When the beans are split and ground, you have something in the nature of the finished article. But making coffee essence is an entirely different process. Therefore, before making proposals of this character, I should want to know exactly what the process would be and what benefits would be obtained. The whole burden of the hon. Gentleman's argument has been that he wants the change to be made because the rate he proposes already applies to something else. That is no justification for it at ail, and I think the hon. Member might at least treat the House with some respect, by studying the subject before getting up to speak upon it.</p>

<p>It is always very valuable when we get practicable knowledge applied to these arithmetical questions. I am much obliged to my hon. Friend for the observations he has made. I have no wish other than to ask the House to settle this question on its merits, and I hope that by giving a few facts from the past development of this matter, I shall be able to show that one-sixth is the right proportion, and that this Amendment should therefore not be accepted.<br/>
I think it was the hon. Member for Hertford (Mr. Walker-Smith)&#x2014;who is not here at the moment&#x2014;who raised the matter in an earlier Debate. He suggested that if the various products, chicory and so on in various stages of completeness were compared, it would be found that one-sixth was too low and that two-thirds would be about right. The history of the matter is that in the Finance Act of 1919 one-sixth was adopted as<br/>
being the preferential margin for practically the whole range of foodstuffs then affected. There have been various changes since 1919 in the preferential margins and in the range of goods admitted to preference, but at the present time the position is that the proportion of one-sixth applies to cocoa&#x2014;I am only taking it as a similar or kindred article&#x2014;it applies to coffee which is kiln dried, roasted or ground; it applies to coffee and chicory roasted and ground, mixed; it applies to chicory raw or kiln dried, and it applies to chicory roasted or ground. The one case which stands at two-thirds is raw coffee.<br/>
I think, therefore, there is reason to say, when we are introducing this new item into the preference list, that after all these essences are very nearly finished products&#x2014;they only need, I suppose, the addition of hot water or whatever is required to make it the finished product&#x2014;and that, if import licences are to be granted, the product belongs more to the range of finished products than to the raw coffee category. I can assure the House, however, that it is not at present intended to grant import licences. Moreover, it was in 1932, when the Ottawa discussions took place, that raw coffee was singled out from the rest of this list and the preference was raised from one-sixth to two-thirds. Up to that time it had been one-sixth for all categories. Since 1932 it has been one-sixth for all except raw coffee, and I hope the House will accept that it is not unreasonable to give the higher preference to the material more nearly in the raw state.<br/>
I would, therefore, suggest that, having regard to what has been done in other cases, one-sixth is the proper figure. Although this matter was ventilated at an earlier stage by the hon. Member for Hertford, I would add that no representations have been made to the Treasury from any interested parties. No one has represented to us that their interests are being adversely affected as a result of the lower preference being given. Indeed, it might be argued&#x2014;though I do not stress this, I hope I have made the case already &#x2014;that if the preference were raised as suggested it might conceivably adversely affect home manufactures. I hope it would not, but it might be argued that it would. The short argument is that, having regard to the preference on these other articles of a kindred character, and having


regard to the history of the matter, I have satisfied myself by a study of the facts, as I promised to do, that one-sixth is the proper figure.</p>

<p>The short Debate we have had on this subject has been notable for one thing, at any rate. We have now found what we on this side of the House have long been searching for, namely, what is the special subject of the hon. Gentleman the Member for West Renfrew (Mr. Scollan). We have heard him speak on many subjects on which he has, obviously, not been an expert. Now we know that on the question of the manufacture of chicory essence we shall find him able and willing to advise the House. But I confess I was not very much impressed by the argument of the right hon. Gentleman the Chancellor of the Exchequer. I could have understood it, in fact, had it been left at the case made by the hon. Member for West Renfrew&#x2014;that there was a logical pattern which ran through these duties, and that one-sixth was the appropriate preference in respect of prepared articles, and that two-thirds was appropriate in respect of wholly raw material. But as soon as the Chancellor of the Exchequer began to give us the list, we found, of course, that that logical pattern did not exist, because, in fact, the only thing that gets two-thirds is raw coffee, whereas raw chicory&#x2014;the subject of the hon. Member for West Renfrew&#x2014;only gets one-sixth. Raw cocoa, I understand, gets only the same. We, therefore, cannot decide this thing on any logical conclusion at all, because there is no logic in the present system of duties. We, therefore, do say that, starting from that basis, the right hon. Gentleman had much better abandon logic, and substitute generosity; and that, at this present moment, when coming events have cast an ominous shadow over certain of our inter-Imperial economic relationships, generosity of this kind by the Chancellor of the Exchequer might do good far beyond the comparatively minor significance of the actual Amendment we are moving.</p>

<p>On the point of the differentiation between the finished article after manufacture in this country, and the raw material, I should have thought that would have been obvious to the right hon. Gentleman that its substitution for

tea, which carries very heavy taxation, would have been an additional reason. Additional taxation on the finished article was proposed to give a chance for creating a new industry in this country.</p>

<p>I was most impressed when the hon. Gentleman made that speech the first time. But his whole case was then destroyed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and it is for that reason that, I think, we had much better abandon logic, which, I agree, is with the hon. Gentleman, and appeal to the Chancellor of the Exchequer for generosity.</p>

<p>There has been a tendency during this Debate to assume that everybody in this House is prepared to accept the whole process of Imperial Preference as the right sort of thing to apply in taxation of this sort before us. I should like to remind right hon. and hon. Gentlemen, who take that attitude, that I, for one, some years ago, when this question of Imperial Preference was discussed, was opposed to it utterly in principle. I remain utterly opposed. I think, after what the right hon. Gentleman the Member for West Bristol (Mr. Stanley) has just said, that if the only way to get a concession with regard to this matter is on the basis of generosity, there is&#x2014;</p>

<p>I do not want to be misunderstood. The right hon. Gentleman and I are wholly at one with regard to the merits of Imperial Preference. The only dispute between us is just the small thing: what is the amount that is to be charged? I am not saying that the only argument for Imperial Preference is, that there is no logic in the Chancellor's case.</p>

<p>It is precisely when we get into this sort of difficulty in deciding the amount of taxation in order to give Imperial Preference, that one is driven, as the right hon. Member for West Bristol has been driven, to base his case merely on generosity. There is no logic in the matter. This is a process of logrolling in the matter of taxation, to which we used to take the strongest objection in the years gone by when hon. and right hon. Gentlemen on that side were pushing forward these principles of Imperial Preference. I shall not now go into the whole issue of Imperial Preference, because this is not the time for it. I feel, however, that this little interlude by the right hon. Member for West Bristol may, perhaps,


lead some hon. Members on this side of the House to reconsider the whole of this issue. A great mistake has been made in connection with this matter since the days of Ottawa. I hope that, because something was done at Ottawa, and that in those days some support was given to Ottawa by hon. Members on this side, we are not assumed to be satisfied that these taxes should remain. I am very glad the concession has been made by the</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1946-07-15a.943.2" hansard_membership_id="3152" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/13933" speakername="Mr. Dalton" colnum="943" time="">
<p>I beg to move, in page 4, line 3, after "vehicles," to insert "motor."<br/>
The purpose of this Amendment might not be obvious from the words employed, except to the hon. Member for Bodmin (Mr. D. Marshall), who is so expert on these matters, and who initiated the line of thought which has now run on to the Order Paper. The purpose is to extend to

sailing vessels the benefit of the reduced rate of entertainments duty; that is the purpose of this Amendment, and the subsequent Amendment which is consequential to it. A good case was made out during the Committee stage for bringing sailing vessels and entertainment provided by races between sailing vessels on to the lower level. I hope that it will not be necessary to debate the matter at great length, because I have done here what I undertook to do at an earlier stage. I was asked whether the provision could be


extended also to racing by motor boats, but I am unable to do that at this moment. There seems to me to be a special case for favourable treatment for sailing vessels and regattas involving races between sailing vessels, having regard to national necessity for a seafaring population. The manipulation of motors, whether on sea or on land, is a different question, and I do not think that this falls into the same category of urgency. I hope that the House will think it is right to discriminate in regard to sailing vessels, and that they should benefit from the reduced rates.</p>

<p>During the Committee stage I asked the Chancellor whether he would consider removing the word "vessels" in Clause 6. Quite naturally I had hoped that he would remove the word "vessels," as this then would have given the benefit to all vessels. But in moving my Amendment I stressed sailing vessels, and it was sailing vessels with which I was particularly concerned and, therefore, I am extremely glad that the Chancellor has included the word "motor", which will give sailing vessels the full benefit. There is one point I should like to make. At the end of my speech I referred to large vessels which had been launched going down the Clyde, the Mersey, or the Tyne on trial, but not necessarily on speed trial. I would like the Chancellor to give an assurance that he would not consider this, in any way, a speed trial, and that if occasion should arise, whereby people should be witnessing that spectacle under conditions of payment, they would not suffer from taxation in that direction. I think it would be possible for him to give that assurance, and I hope that he will.</p>

<p>The Clause extends the benefit of the lower rate of Entertainments Duty to all games or sport, with certain exceptions, which are mentioned in the Clause. The exceptions are:
<q>other than the racing or trial of speed of animals, vehicles, vessels or aircraft.</q>
The right hon. Gentleman proposes to insert the word "motor" in front of the word "vessels", and that means that the racing or trial of speed of sailing vessels will only suffer the lower rate of Entertainments Duty. The point, therefore, to which, I think, we should have a clear reply, because the Clause as it now reads is not quite clear, is whether the

word "motor," which he intends to insert in the Clause, applies to the word "aircraft" as well as to the word "vessels". The Clause will now read:
<q>Trial of speed of animals, vehicles, motor vessels or aircraft.</q>
There are two kinds of aircraft, the aircraft propelled by a motor, and the glider not propelled by the motor. It is extremely likely that in future, when gliding becomes more popular&#x2014;and it is already popular in this country&#x2014;there will be trials of speed by aircraft not propelled by motors, and I hope that it will be made quite clear that the insertion of the word "motor" in the Clause applies to aircraft as well as to vessels I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will get that point cleared up, because, otherwise, I am quite sure there will be confusion.</p>

<p>I would like to express my great appreciation of the interest taken by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in sailing. There is no doubt that it is in these vessels that seamanship is learned, and the interest which the Chancellor has shown will be a great source of encouragement to the Sea Scouts and Sea Cadets. These movements are beginning to flourish again in the parts of the country which I know well. I refer, particularly, to the Sea Scouts, because the Sea Cadets were, of course, at work during the war. We have, I think, four or five regattas, which will be taking place in the near future in Cornwall. I shall, in any case, watch them with joy, which will now be increased by the action which the Chancellor of the Exchequer has taken.</p>

<p>I do not wish to quarrel with the hon. Member for St. Ives (Mr. Beechman), but I think that I should point out to the Chancellor of the Exchequer that he did not take the initiative in this matter, which was left to members for South-East Cornwall and the Tory Party. Having spent some time during the proceedings on the Bill in being critical, I now congratulate the Chancellor of the Exchequer without any qualification whatever. I appreciate tremendously the fact that he has, in this Amendment, followed up our Amendment dealing with sailing vessels, because, after all, they provide one of the cleanest of all sports. I happen to represent in Torbay, Dartmouth and Brixham, places which have


the best sailing regattas in the whole world. They are, of course, acknowledged as far superior to the Isle of Wight and other minor yachting centres, such as the Clyde. I hope that when the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in a comparatively short time, gives up his office, as he certainly will, he will go to Torbay and enjoy himself there for the rest of a long life.</p>

<p>I am sure that the matter of the launching of vessels, which was referred to by an hon. Member, would not be regarded as a speed trial. As regards gliders, that is frankly a point which had not occurred to me. We have not as yet done very much in the way of competitive sailing in the air by gliders, but I will look into the matter, although I think that a motor is required in the beginning. It seems to me that the glider is not quite on all fours with a sailing vessel in this respect. There are possibilities of lenient administration which might be called in, and if it should turn out that there was an inclination to treat gliding competitions more severely in terms of taxation than sailing boats, I would be prepared to take steps to correct it.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 4, line 44, at the end, to insert:
<q>(3) In subsection (3) of section one of the Finance Act, 1935, after the words "a performance of music (whether vocal or instrumental)" there shall be inserted the words "an Eisteddfod.</q>
This is designed to meet a very powerful plea, which was put up by the hon. Member for Westhoughton (Mr. Rhys Davies), far the inclusion, specifically and in terms, of "Eisteddfod." As I assured him when we were discussing this matter in Committtee, I am convinced that the insertion of these words is from the legal point of view unnecessary, but, nonetheless, particularly in view of the agreeable incident which came to me last weekend, it would be most inappropriate if I did not stretch a point in favour of the cultural glories of Wales. Therefore, I move this Amendment with great pleasure, and I am sure that it will place beyond the faintest flicker of 'doubt that an Eisteddfod is not to be treated as though it were same cruder form of entertainment, liable to tax at the very properly heavy rate. I was asked, on the last occasion, whether the "Mod" a Scottish ceremony, and the "Gorsedd," a Cornish ceremony&#x2014;whether those two forms of musical festival are also safe. These are exempt from duty altogether. There is no question of the higher or the lower rate. The hon. Member for Torquay will hear me out when I say that there is no case in the past in which there has been an attempt to enforce Entertainment Duty on these cultural occasions. I think without putting any further words in the Clause, we can be assured that there will be no tax in the future.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1946-07-15a.948.2" speakerid="unknown" speakername="Mr. McKie" colnum="948" time="">
<p>I am grateful to the Chancellor for what he said about the Scottish musical festival. I feel sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Torquay (Mr. C. Williams)&#x2014;although he no longer represents a Cornish constituency, he is none the less always anxious to safeguard Cornish interests&#x2014;will be glad to hear the Chancellor say that it is unnecessary to use the name of the Scottish and Cornish festivals in this Clause, and to hear the assurance that no inconvenience or hardship will result. However, I should like to ask the right hon. Gentleman&#x2014;and I


do not ask him in any spirit of being unfair to the Welsh festival&#x2014;why he has singled out the Welsh festival for mention as distinct from the Scottish or Cornish festivals. I think both my hon. Friend who comes from Cornwall and I would like a little more assurance on this, because it is a point which may well rouse feelings of resentment both in Scotland and in Cornwall, unless the Chancellor gives a more lucid and thorough explanation. There is one other point to which I wish to refer. The Chancellor said he had been assured by the legal experts that the inclusion of this word "Eisteddfod" was unnecessary. Might I ask him whether it is strictly legal to use words of a foreign language, in a Statute of this House? I always thought if an hon. Member ventured to address you, Mr. Speaker, in either of the tongues which are used in common parlance in Scotland or Wales, you would immediately rule him out of Order. I, therefore, ask the Chancellor whether he has assured himself that, so far from safeguarding the Welsh national musical festival, he has not rather reached the point of being out of Order by introducing a foreign Word into this Measure.</p>

<p>The reason for making provision for the Eisteddfod and not for the other two musical festivals was that initiative was shown in regard to the Eisteddfod and an Amendment was nut down by a Welshman. The Cornish and Scottish festivals were only brought in at a later stage in the course of oral exchanges during the Debate. I have satisfied myself that, as far as exemption is concerned, the three are all right. With regard to the use of foreign words, many words which originated in the Celtic fringe have passed into the common language of these islands. There are Scottish words, some of them very un-Parliamentary, which have passed into our common tongue, and in regard to singing there are after all such words as "psalms" and "canticles" which are not Norman-French, Anglo-Saxon or Welsh.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1946-07-15a.949.1" hansard_membership_id="8284" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/28888" speakername="Mr. C. Williams" colnum="949" time="">
<p>I was hoping that all I would have to do would be to say a few words of thanks to the Chancellor. But the right hon. Gentleman in what he said just now was inaccurate. He said that there was a lack of initiative in this matter in regard to the raising of the question of

the Cornish Gorsedd. It was nothing of the sort. The right hon. Gentleman should not contradict himself so often. When I saw the Amendment on this matter in the Committee stage I said to myself, "Perhaps I had better be certain of this; possibly the Chancellor knows something more about it than I do." I got an assurance from the Chancellor and I thought that was good enough. It seems to me yet to be quite good enough, and it was not until later that I noticed this Amendment down in the Chancellor's name. I tried to get an Amendment down, but I was too late. I always believed that the position operating hitherto was right, and the Chancellor said just now that we had been completely covered all the time and there had been no duty to pay on these festivals. In other words, it is almost useless to have this Amendment and I am not quite sure whether I ought not to speak and vote against it as a superfluity of little help to the Welsh people. However, instead I will pass to another argument, and that is that the Welsh Eisteddfod as compared with the Scottish Mod or the Cornish Gorsedd is neither as musical nor as educational nor as dramatic. For that reason it is unnecessary to define these two, because they come within the category of being artistic and musical. Unless the Welsh Eisteddfod was defined by an Act of Parliament, Heaven knows whether anyone would know whether it was artistic or anything else. I should of course realise its value but to the ordinary Saxon or Scotsman it would not appear to be either musical or artistic, and so this Amendment was necessary. I thank the Chancellor very much for enabling the House to know the real reason why he put down this Amendment.</p>

This Clause deals with the granting of licenses to passenger aircraft, and the


Attorney-General of Northern Ireland, who looked at the Bill, has come to the conclusion that aerial navigation is reserved under the Government of Ireland Act. That being so, and since this Clause purports to grant licences in respect of aerial aircraft, he would not be prepared to certify a corresponding Clause unless supported by the appropriate enablement. This Amendment, together with one which the House will be asked to accept later on to Clause 62, will permit Northern Ireland to do that. It is felt by the Government, that this is really a domestic matter, and, although technically it comes within the terms of the Government of Ireland Act, it was not the sort of thing that the Government of the time did want to reserve.</p>

<p>We are asking Northern Ireland to do something which, in the opinion of many of us, is a very bad practice indeed. In my opinion we are not making ourselves an influential body of people in the eyes of the world in asking another Parliament, a member of the United Kingdom, to emulate our vices, rather than our virtues. The Clause allows drink to be sold to passengers on board an aircraft. I should imagine that a journey from one end of the United Kingdom to the other cannot possibly be more than two hours or so&#x2014;</p>

<p>I know that this is a topic on which a man like myself quickly

gets on to dangerous ground, Sir, so I will confine myself to saying that I am very sorry that a Labour Government, in which I am tremendously interested, should for one moment allow themselves to ask another Parliament to follow provisions such as are provided in this Clause. The Government are asking them to continue the vicious circle, instead of asking them to follow the great virtues for which we stand. I greatly deplore this Amendment.</p>

<p>You have ruled very rightly on the matter before us, Mr. Speaker, so I must confine myself to a series of questions. Why should Northern Ireland have the right to send aeroplanes abroad with the assistance of "booze"? Why should there be the special advantage for Northern Ireland of allowing them to have liquor and tobacco licences for aeroplanes? I have just come back from a conducted tour of Austria, with other Members of Parliament. We were carefully informed before we went not to smoke. We have just published a very special warning about the dangers of drink in small quantities when driving motor vehicles. Why should we now ask Northern Ireland to go as wrong in this matter as we have gone wrong? We do foolish things in this House, but at least we can try to see that Northern Ireland does not do the same. I have great faith in Northern Ireland.<br/>
There is nobody from Northern Ireland here at the moment, but I would like to tell the House that Northern Ireland is exemplary in this matter of drink. [HON. MEMBERS: "Oh."] We must not blame every part of Ireland for the sins of the South, where, perhaps, drink has a special part to play. In Northern Ireland they drink, per head of the population, about three-fifths of what is drunk in this country. If I can safeguard Northern Ireland by any means, if I can protect them from the folly of the Chancellor, I will do so. I have had many good things to say about my right hon. Friend&#x2014;he is a first-class man, he has done many excellent things, and I expect him to do many more&#x2014;but in this matter, by granting facilities to Northern Ireland to send up aeroplanes on which there can be drinking, I think he is taking a retrograde step. I hope the public opinion in Northern Ireland will protect itself against the foolishness of the proposals in


this Amendment. I commend to the attention of my fellow citizens in Northern Ireland the necessity for keeping out of aeroplanes the drink which people have been warned not to take when driving motor vehicles, drink which may mean the difference between life and death. I wish this step had not been taken.</p>

<p>I am sure that if some of my hon. Friends representing Ulster constituencies had realised that we were to have two such interesting speeches as we have just had on this Amendment, they would have been here. In their absence, may I say how much I am indebted to the hon. Member for Rossendale (Mr. Walker) and to the hon. Member for West Ealing (Mr. J. Hudson) for demonstrating on the Floor of this House what many have known for so long &#x2014;that teetotallers are notoriously "slower in the uptake" than any other section of the community? After all, what does the Chancellor's Amendment seek to do? To give power to the Government of Northern Ireland to refuse these licences if they think proper. The hon. Member for Rossendale said that the Government of Northern Ireland were being asked to provide liquor licences on board aircraft. All that is being done is to put the Government of Northern Ireland in precisely the same position as that of His Majesty's Government. This is really a drafting Amendment to make that possible, if the Government of Northern Ireland think it proper. So, let the two hon. Members opposite be comforted. The Government of Northern Ireland have power to refuse the licence. The hon. Member opposite rather suggested that we were asking Northern Ireland to grant licences. If he will read HANSARD tomorrow, he will find that that is what he said. I am rather surprised at him. The hon. Member for West Ealing took a rather more emphatic view. He is afraid of small quantities of alcohol being consumed. His speech reminded me of the story of two bluejackets walking past a Methodist chapel, outside of which was displayed the slogan:
<q>There is more nutrition in one half-pint of milk than in 12 half-pints of beer.</q>
One bluejacket said to his friend, "There is only one thing for it, we shall have to go and have 12 half-pints." I welcome this opportunity of defending the rights of the Parliament and Government of Northern Ireland to do as they think proper, either

to grant or to withhold the licences. It is an unusual experience for me to support the Chancellor. This is, however, merely a drafting Amendment. I think the discussion has been worth while if only because we have on record from two hon. Members opposite two particularly fatuous speeches such as we expect from temperance fanatics.</p>

<p>I would not like the House to think that the attitude of my hon. Friend the Member for Rossendale (Mr. Walker) and my hon. Friend the Member for West Ealing (Mr. J.

I have no particular reason for being a political friend of Northern Ireland; I think their representation in the House leaves very much to be desired. But my hon. Friend the Member for West Ealing is entirely wrong on this matter. Nobody proposes that alcoholic or any other drinks should play a part in running air services anywhere, even to Northern Ireland. It is only suggested that the Northern Irish people, if they like, shall give aeroplane passengers an opportunity, if they want, to drink alcohol. Nobody proposes that the passengers shall have gin poured down their throats, and nobody would force gin down my throat, even if I were coming away from Belfast. I hope the House will support the Amendment. I am sorry the representatives of Northern Ireland are not here, I deplore their politics, but I am willing to be charitable and decent towards them, and I support the Amendment.</p>

I think it would be convenient, Mr. Speaker, if I dealt with this Amendment and the next two Amendments together. The first two are drafting Amendments, and the third one is necessary to provide that the alterations in tax made by the Amendments to the Third Schedule, which are to be moved later on, shall operate as from 22nd July next. The reason for choosing 22nd July as the operative date is that it is the first convenient date after the House has given some sort of approval to the changes which my right hon. Friend has agreed to in the various items coming under the Purchase Tax Schedule. Clearly, it would have been undesirable to have fixed a date before there was any Parliamentary sanction for the changes that are to be made, and if the date were made retrospective it would have led to difficulties, and there would have been claims for repayment. We hope the House will accept this compromise date, which is, on the whole, the best in the circumstances.</p>

<p>On a point of Order, Mr. Speaker. May I submit to you, with all humility, that the purpose of this Amendment was to deal with what the Chancellor said in Committee, when we discussed some proposals which we put forward to deal with what was to happen when the Purchase Tax was reduced and goods were still left in the hands of the retailers? Perhaps I may quote what the Chancellor said:
<q>As the hon. Gentleman the Member for St. Marylebone (Sir W. Wakefield) has reminded me, I did say that we would see whether the position could be improved. We have gone into it with great care, and we have not been able to find any practical way in which this particular grievance can be removed. Certainly, the pursuit of this rather elusive goal can be continued. At present we have not found the answer nor has the hon. Gentleman who moved the Amendment"&#x2014; [OFFICIAL REPORT, 20th June, 1946; Vol. 424, C. 424&#x2013;5.]</q>
That was the position with regard to this proposal, and as a result, the Committee took a decision. This Amendment is now brought forward with an entirely new way, in the view of my hon. Friend the Member for Stockport (Sir A. Gridley), of getting over the difficulty. For that reason, I respectfully ask whether you would reconsider your decision and allow us to discuss the plan.</p>

<p>Further to that point of Order, Mr. Speaker, without wishing either to challenge or to seek to lend support to any decision you may make, I would point out that, although the right hon. and gallant Member for Gains-borough (Captain Crookshank) accurately quoted what I said, I did indicate that I was anxious to be conciliatory in order to ascertain the position, but I did not hold out a hope that we could in the near future find a solution for this, and in fact, we have not found it. It is one of those things which have to be pursued over a length of time, but we are no further now than we were in Committee towards finding any point of agreement between those who moved the Amendment and the Government.</p>

<p>I am afraid that this Amendment, or a similar Amendment,

was discussed for some time in Committee, and negatived.

This is an Amendment which is designed to meet the argument advanced, in particular, by the right hon. Gentleman the Member for the Scottish Universities (Sir J. Anderson). As the House will recollect, terminal expenses qualify under Clause 33 of the Bill if they are incurred in 1947 and subject to notice being given in 1948. It was strongly represented during the discussion on the Committee stage that that was too short a period to enable terminal expenses to be met. My right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer undertook to reconsider the period and as the result of that reconsideration this Amendment appears on the Order Paper. It is designed, in effect, to extend the period to such later date as the Commissioners think appropriate in a particular case to allow, such later date, however, not to be later than the end of 1949. That gives the Commissioners a discretion in respect of one additional year, and I hope that the House will think that a reasonable way of meeting the argument and one which represents a fair concession to the point of view which was advanced, particularly by the right hon. Gentleman and also by other hon. Members on the other side of the House.</p>

<p>As the hon. and learned Gentleman has said, this Clause deals with a matter on which I addressed the Committee during the Committee stage. I am bound to say that the Amendment on the Order Paper does not go quite so far as I had hoped. I made it clear in the arguments that I advanced that I fully sympathised with the desire of the Chancellor and the Revenue authorities to wind up these matters at the earliest convenient date. I should like the Financial Secretary to the Treasury to take note that I still do not feel that one

can be confident that all the work which has to be done will, in tact, be completed even by the extended date now specified in this Amendment. There are difficult questions involved; the effect of the previous proposal, as explained by the Chancellor, of encouraging the speediest possible completion of the deferred maintenance was, as I pointed out, one which, in my view, certainly ought to be avoided rather than encouraged, because there is little doubt that in many cases the repair of war damage should come ahead of deferred maintenance.<br/>
I take it that the Chancellor, in putting this Amendment on the Order Paper, has recognised the force of the argument I put forward. On that assumption I would certainly advise my hon. Friends to accept the Amendment on the understanding, of course, that if experience over the next 18 months or so should prove that, unfortunately, it is not going to be possible to dispose of this matter altogether within the extended time now allowed, proper and sympathetic consideration will be given on a later occasion to the question of a further extension. For the present, holding, as I do, that it is important that these matters should be wound up as soon as is reasonably practicable, I would, for my own part accept this Amendment, thank the Chancellor of the Exchequer for the concession he has made, and trust that the House will agree with me generally in that view.</p>

<p>These Amendments were put down on the Committee stage but I thought it proper to put them down again, because they are directed to a common purpose to which I attach considerable importance as, I think, the House should also. It is that an assurance given by a former Chancellor of the Exchequer, the late Sir Kingsley Wood, in 1943, should be fulfilled. The assurance was that all the expenses of a revenue nature which were incurred in earning one's excess profits would be allowed as a deduction when the time came for clearing up the outstanding questions.<br/>
The Bill makes arrangements in respect of terminal losses, in order to fulfil the promise made by the Chancellor. If a company joins a group of companies, neither the group nor any of the companies will get an allowance for expenses. I do not think the fact can be disputed that E.P.T. charged on businesses has been increased because of war circumstances and of expenditure incurred on deferred repairs and rehabilitation. It therefore is no kind of excuse to refuse to refund the overcharged expense merely because the shareholders of a company changed, when it joined or left a group of companies. If the company is not at any time a member of the group, its shares can go on changing hands indefinitely without affecting its right to claim allowances. Why should there be discrimination against groups of companies? Allowances for terminal expenses in all other cases have remained dependent upon expenditure being incurred. The Amendment which was moved during the Committee stage was criticised on the ground of its vagueness. Other Amendments, not selected, sought to give the E.P.T. allowance to the persons who paid the extra tax. The Amendment I now move differs slightly from the earlier Amendment. The main purpose is to see that one or other of the persons concerned receives the allowance. I emphasise that it is an important principle that technicalities should not be allowed to stand in the way of the fulfilment of assurances given in Parliament.<br/>
The Amendment avoids the technical objection which was raised in Committee, by giving the allowance to the person Who actually laid out the money, except in the case of deferred repairs, in which case another Clause says that the cost of the repairs can be related to any

period. I have given this explanation in justification for the Amendment and the other two Amendments in my name which are being discussed at the same time. I hope that I have given the Solicitor-General an argument for reconsideration of the views which he expressed when dealing with this matter on the previous occasion.</p>

<p>I beg to second the Amendment.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Stockport (Sir A. Gridley) has explained how it has been possible to clarify the position and to make plain exactly what we claim. The only point I wish to emphasise is that if a company is not in a group of companies, its shares can change hands on the open market and no one takes any notice. Because it is in a group, there seems to be suspicion that something is going on that ought not to go on, and that therefore the companies have to be specially controlled. I can never understand why there should be any attempt to penalise groups. Groups arise because of necessity. Many of us have an objection to attempts being made to freeze industry into its present mould and to say, "That is how you shall go on. You shall not change." Changes are made because of necessity. People do not form groups of companies for amusement or to provide lawyers with fees. There is usually some change in circumstances, necessitating a change from one group to another. I support my hon. Friend in urging that nothing should be done to prevent the normal development of business along lines which are most helpful. We shall be fighting for our lives in the commercial world against other countries in the days to come, and we want nothing to be done to prevent our taking advantage of every opportunity. Here is a case, in which we feel that an unnecessary curb is being placed upon industry.</p>

<p>This topic was canvassed very fully when the Finance Bill was in Committee, and both hon. Gentlemen who have put their names to the Amendment then put their names to an Amendment which purported to deal with the problem on rather different lines. We feel that the Amendment now put down in no sense solves the problem better than the previous Amendment, and that neither of them can be accepted<br/>
In answering the case that was made in support of the previous Amendment I said that Excess Profits Tax legislation treated groups of companies as units and that it was highly undesirable that, if a company ceased to be a member of a unit, the right to deferred repair allowance in respect of that company should depend upon whether the future owner carried them out or not. Exactly the same objection exists in regard to this Amendment. I want to examine this matter in a little more detail, but before I do so I would remind the House, as I did the Committee, that Clause 35 (4) lays down that where there is real injustice, in the sense that the change of ownership is only a partial change and there is some community between the old and the new owner, discretion is vested in the Commissioners to do what is right, so as not to prejudice that common ownership. There is, therefore, as it were, a safety valve and a buffer. I called the attention of Members to that before, and I do so again. There is no reason why, where there is only a partial change of ownership, a perfectly fair order should not be made which would preserve to the continuing owner such right as he had in the company before it ceased to be a member of the group which it has left. There will be no injustice at all where there is anything that can be said to be a semblance of common ownership. Where there is no continuity, and the company has come completely under new ownership, it is entirely wrong that there should be any right to deferred repairs allowance which should depend upon the action of somebody who is no longer the owner of the company and no longer the person entitled to those deferred repairs. It is only necessary to state that, to indicate its undesirability.<br/>
8.0 p.m.<br/>
Supposing I am the owner of a company and I sell it to somebody else, it is entirely improper and undesirable from a commercial point of view that my right to a deferred repairs allowance should depend on the action of the new owner which I cannot influence one way or the other, and who has his own perfectly good reasons for deciding whether or not he will carry out these repairs. That is one reason why the Excess Profits Tax legislation regards these groups of companies as units. That objection has not

been met by the Amendment, and I will tell the House why. I will analyse what would happen in the case of each of the Amendments in the name of the hon. Member for Stockport (Sir A. Gridley). I will use letters as symbols and I hope it will be clear. "A" is a member of group "X." In the final Excess Profits Tax chargeable accounting period for 1946, for example, we have company "A and group" In 1947 the whole of the shares of "A" are bought by another group, "Y." If the first of the proposed Amendments was accepted, the result would be that while "A" was a member of group "Y," "X" would or would not get the deferred repairs allowance according to whether "Y" decided to carry out the repairs or not. In other words, company "A" passes from "X" to
"Y." "X" is the group which it is suggested should retain and enjoy the deferred repairs allowance. "Y," the present owner of the company, may or may not decide to carry out those repairs, and according to whether it does decide to carry them out or not, "X" will enjoy the deferred repairs allowance. That cannot be right. It is not commercial commonsense. It would lead to various abuses, and there is no logic or sense about it. That is why the Clause is drawn as it is, so as to exclude "X" having the right to a deferred repairs allowance in that set of circumstances.<br/>
The second and third Amendments do exactly the same thing. They provide again that one group shall benefit or shall not benefit in respect of a deferred repairs allowance dependent upon whether the subsequent group which acquires the company does the repairs or not. That cannot be right. If the House will analyse the effect of the Amendments, they will find they bring about a position similar to that I have described in respect of the first one. I ask the House to say that these are adequate reasons why this particular set of Amendments should not be adopted. The Excess Profits Tax legislation treats these groups of companies as one unit, and that is fundamental and basic to it. Deficiencies are not carried on from one group to another, as I am sure the hon. Members who moved and seconded the Amendment know only too well. The reason is exactly the same. The Excess Profits Tax code regards these groups of com-


panies as a single unit in the same way as a partnership&#x2014;</p>

<p>So long as the partnership remains a partnership. There is a buffer Clause in respect of a partnership. The net result is that each of these Amendments would lead to most undesirable results on the lines I have indicated. Where, however, there is not a complete change of ownership, so that the same person or group of persons are the continuing owners to a greater or lesser extent, the Commissioners are given discretion to make such orders they think proper in the circumstances to prevent any injustice, but when one seeks to go beyond that and to transfer the right to an allowance from a former to a later owner, entirely different in identity, one is going beyond the principles upon which the Excess Profits Tax legislation is based.<br/>
I ask the House to say that, for these reasons, these Amendments ought not to be accepted. I quite see the point behind them, but the hon. Member for Stockport cannot have considered exactly what they would lead to. I hope that hon. Gentlemen opposite will see their way to withdraw the proposal on the ground that it is objectionable in exactly the same way that the previous proposal which they moved was objectionable. It is fundamental in this case that the right to deferred repairs allowance must depend on their being carried out by the owner for the time being who is entitled to enjoy the allowance which is given in respect of deferred repairs actually carried out. I ask the House to reject these Amendments.</p>

<p>This is frightfully technical, and I cannot persuade myself that I have understood the whole of it. I take it that what the Solicitor-General is relying on is not in this Clause but is in Clause 35 (4)</p>

<p>I am sorry if I have not made it clear. What I said is that when one has a complete change of ownership, these particular Amendments would lead to undesirable results if they were accepted. Where one has a partial change of ownership, Clause 35 (4) prevents any injustice being done</p>

<p>That crystallises the point. The Solicitor-General was referring to what the Commissioners might do if they thought fit, but that is not in the Clause. In the case of a partial change, the Solicitor-General relies on Clause 35 (4) which says:
<q>&#x2026;the Commissioners may, if they think lit, allow the relief or additional relief or such part thereof as they think just, having regard to the extent to which the persons directly or Indirectly interested in the trade or business&#x2026;</q>
and so on. The Solicitor-General relies on that. It was put in later in the Committee stage.</p>

<p>Was that not the case? In any case, where there is a partial change, the Solicitor-General relies on the discretion of the Commissioners. The case of my hon. Friends is that it should be made quite clear that the expenses should be allowed to the person who actually incurs the expense. There is some doubt whether there is a break up in a group. I am not yet quite clear whether that principle is adopted throughout&#x2014;that if expenses are incurred, it is the people who incur the expenses to whom the allowances eventually go.</p>

<p>I am putting my point in the form of a question, Mr. Deputy-Speaker, and of course I understand that I can only speak a second time with the leave of the House. The question is this: Suppose I represent a company in a group of five or six companies all hitherto welded together. My undertaking is sold to another body altogether and I have a claim for compensation for deferred repairs which I have not been able to carry out. Is it the view of the Government that because I am sold from the body with which I have been connected to another, I must give up my claim to this compensation allowance for deferred repairs merely-because I have broken away from the


body with which I have been associated so long and have attached myself to another?</p>

<p>I am assuming a complete change of ownership. In that case it is the State that benefits, and there is no encouragement to the undertaking to carry out its deferred repairs. If it does not carry them out, presumably the price paid to the seller will be so much less and no sum will be provided to enable the repairs to be carried out. In that case the State benefits merely because an undertaking is sold from one group to another.</p>

<p>In this particular case it seems to me that the hon. and learned Solicitor-General is making a change from the accepted and universal practice of regarding as a legal entity any body which is incorporated. It seems to me that it is the incorporated body, rather than the ultimate owners of the undertaking, who hold the shares in their corporate entity; it is the corporate entity which has paid the outgoings in Excess Profits Tax, which is the one entitled to receive the benefit in due time. Is the Solicitor-General not making a fundamental change in the legal conception in this respect? Is not this in some sense a pure debt? Take Company A which is owed &#x00A3;100,000 by somebody who might pay it. The shareholders of Company A in the course of time between the contracting of that debt and the liquidating of it are changed on the nominal register of shareholders, but it does not seem to me that that is any reason for saying, "That debt just does not count; the company will not get it, and the debtor will be let off." That seems to me to be largely the point being put by my hon. Friend who moved the Amendment. I would like to know where I have gone wrong, if, indeed, I am wrong.</p>

<p>No doubt the hon. and learned Solicitor-General would like to reply to these points together. I followed him with great attention and, as my right hon. and gallant Friend said, we are in very deep legal and technical waters. The only thing which was really clear was that the absence of the Chancellor means that we are to get no concession. The hon. and learned Gentleman is always left to hand

out rebuffs whereas the Chancellor of the Exchequer hands out benefits. The hon. and learned Gentleman always deals with these difficult matters most agreeably. However, I would put this to him: that the present industrial phase through which we are passing is unique in one sense. The hon. and learned Gentleman may recall that during the Committee stage an Amendment was moved, which 1 supported, dealing with concentrated industries in another connection. During the war it was necessary to carry out over a very wide field the concentration of industries inaugurated by the present Chancellor at the Board of Trade. At the time everybody realised it was necessary for war production. Some of those industries have found concentration beneficial and are now seeking to amalgamate. Others, on the other hand, are seeking to return to their former status. I am not clear from the speech of the hon. and learned Gentleman whether industries thus concentrated during the war by the Government of the day thereby become members of groups. Certainly they have had to operate as such. The whole of the machinery of administration and organisation has had to be so operated. The hon. and learned Gentleman may tell us that the financial arrangements were never so concentrated. Of course the financial arrangements were very considerably affected.<br/>
With regard to his illustration of Company A in Group X, Company A might have been concentrated within the ambit of Group X during the war, making, let us say, radar equipment. Well the war is now over and Company A wishes to return to the form of manufacture in which it was engaged in 1937 or 1938, and for that reason its continued existence within Group X is no longer desirable. It is therefore the desire of the directors of Company A now to detach themselves from Group X, and Group Y may be a convenient organisation for them. That cannot be an exceptional instance; there must be many others all over the country in similar industries. I was not clear from the speech of the hon. and learned Gentleman whether this payment, which will disappear if this Amendment is rejected, covers the case of the industry which has been forced to concentrate. If it does, I think a hardship is being created. If it does not, the hon. and learned Gentleman will perhaps


get up and say so, and by doing so will place on our records words of great importance to a number of people who must be wondering what will be the outcome of this discussion.</p>

<p>If I may have the permission of the House to speak again, I would like to deal with the points made. With regard to the questions asked by the hon. and gallant Gentleman the Member for Holderness (Lieut.-Commander Braithwaite), the answer to the question depends whether within the definitions in the Acts there is a group. A group consists, in terms of the Acts, of a principal and subsidiaries, and a subsidiary company is one which is owned as to more than nine-tenths of its shares by a principal company. It depends upon what form the concentration has taken. I should think that normally et would not take that form of concentration, but it is, of course, a question of the facts in every particular case.<br/>
In answer to the hon. Gentleman the Member for Bath (Mr. Pitman), with great respect to him and to the House, I feel that he is under a misconception as to the nature of these deferred repairs allowances. They are not debt dues from anybody to anybody; they are debts conditional upon certain repairs being carried out. If repairs are actually carried out and expenditure is incurred, an allowance is due. But there is no debt which subsists apart from the actual carrying out of the repairs. It is true that in one of the concessions the Government have made, in respect of buildings acquired before 1937, in one of the new Clauses I moved today, there is some-</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1946-07-15a.970.0" colnum="970" time="">
<p>thing which goes a little nearer to creating something which might be called a debt. But there is expense incurred in the erecting of a new building in place of the pre-1937 building. It is a wholly misconceived view to think that there is any debt in the case of the body corporate which is cancelled as a result of this cancellation of the right to deferred purchase allowance. There is nothing of the sort. It is a right to an allowance conditional upon certain repairs being carried out.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1946-07-15a.970.1" colnum="970" time="">
<p>The Excess Profits Tax code regards these groups as a single entity. That is made clear by the fact that the Excess Profits Tax is collected from the principal of the group. The group is to all intents and purposes treated as one and when a company leaves a group all that happens is that the right to earn that allowance by the carrying out of those repairs, ceases, because that group has not carried out the repairs. It is all conditional on the repairs being carried out. That leads to the proposition I advanced earlier, that it would be entirely undesirable if one group could have the right to enjoy the allowance or not have the right according to whether or not a subsequent owner of the company which was a member of that group decided on his own volition, and for reasons which he thought good, to carry out repairs or not. For these reasons, in addition to those which I gave earlier, I ask the House to reject the Amendment.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 29, line 22, at the end, to insert:
<q>(12) Where, in pursuance of any enactment for the compulsory acquisition of a business or part of a business any assets are transferred to the Crown or to a corporate body created under that enactment or to a local authority designated under that enactment and at the date of the transfer the owner of the business produces to the Commissioners particulars of deferred repairs as defined by Subsection (4) of this Section required to be done to those assets and satisfies them that it was not possible for that work to be done by the date of transfer, the owner shall be deemed to have incurred the estimated cost of executing such deferred repairs in like manner as though he had executed them immediately prior to the date of transfer.</q>
This is another question of deferred repairs, but regarded from a totally different angle. Of course, it is admitted that, shall I say, unnatural profits have been made due to the fact that people were unable to charge repairs during the war years. Therefore, the profits on which they paid Excess Profits Tax were swollen to an unreal extent. That is what is being dealt with in Clause 33. The Amendment provides for the deferred repairs which are carried out after the end of the Excess Profits Tax period when repairs are possible; they should be deferred back to the time when they ought to have been undertaken. This will not meet the case of businesses which, in the interim, have been nationalised. Those particular business men who have paid their taxes but will not, through any fault of their own, be continuing their businesses will not have the opportunity, which the Chancellor insists is the duty of the owner, to do the repairs; they will not be allowed.<br/>
The Chancellor realised there was a difference between firms of this description and ordinary firms, because he himself said that the nationalisation of industries is a procedure which evidently needs to be treated in an exceptional fashion from the Revenue point of view. Although the Government are clear that it is in the national interest to extend the field of nationalised industries, we do not wish, as a mere by-product of this process, to do injustice to those for whom the

right hon. Gentleman has spoken. Taking the Chancellor at his word, we are putting this forward. The business man who has paid his taxes and had his business nationalised, has paid Excess Profits Tax on profits which have been unduly increased by reason of the fact that during the war years he has been unable to carry out the repairs. The Amendment seeks to recognise that position and allow him to charge those wartime repairs, when he would normally have undertaken them. I will say no more now, because I am certain the Chancellor understands the point.</p>

<p>I beg to second the Amendment.<br/>
The first two lines of the Amendment show the narrow issue we seek to cover:
<q>Where, in pursuance of any enactment for the compulsory acquisition of a business or part of a business any assets are transferred to the Crown or to a corporate body created under that enactment &#x2026;.</q>
Therefore, this Amendment is confined to those undertakings which are transferred from the present owners to the State, or any body, such as the Coal Board, which may acquire those assets. It hardly seems fair that where one has been prevented from carrying out very necessary repairs during the war years, and certain reserves have been made with the assent of the Commissioners of Inland Revenue for that purpose, that one should be in a position not to be credited with the allowances which have been made merely because the undertaking is transferred from a private owner to a public board or to the State. The Amendment speaks for itself and I do not need to go into it any further.</p>

<p>This Amendment involves much the same issues as the last one, and I pointed out in dealing with the last Amendment that this deferred repairs allowance really is a conditional right&#x2014;conditional upon the repairs being carried out. In exactly the same way, this Clause, if the owner of the undertaking which is nationalised does not carry out the repairs, naturally provides, as a result,


that the right to earn the allowance lapses. This is, in other words, an Amendment which stands or falls by the Amendments which the House has just discussed. The considerations are very much the same. I would, however, add this, because I think that this is a circumstance of which hon. Gentlemen opposite may have lost sight: if the owner of an undertaking does have it nationalised, in point of fact he does not do so badly. It is not as if he altogether loses any allowance, because I am certain that the hon. Gentleman who moved the Amendment must remember the provisions of paragraph (3) of the Seventh Schedule to the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1939. The hon. Gentleman shakes his head, but we have referred to it before in the course of the Debate. I should like also to refer to paragraph (3) of the Eighth Schedule to the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1945, which supplements it. To put the thing in a nutshell, that provides for what is known as an exceptional depreciation allowance&#x2014;which we have frequently referred to in the course of this Debate. The exceptional depreciation allowance, owing to circumstances connected with the war, is a right which the owner of the enterprise which is nationalised will enjoy. When the enterprise is taken over, that will constitute an event within the meaning of the Seventh Schedule to the 1939 Act which will crystallise his right to exceptional depreciation. If he gets that, at least it will go a good way to indemnifying him. Not only that, but because of the provision in the 1945 Act to which I have just referred, paragraph (3) of the Eighth Schedule to the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1945, the exceptional depreciation allowance will include the cost of repairs which have not been done, subject to a certain time limit, into which I need not go. Ordinarily, therefore, when the owner of an enterprise has it nationalised, although it is true that he will not have a deferred repairs allowance, he will have the exceptional depreciation allowance, which will include the great bulk of the repairs which have not been carried out.<br/>
Hon. Gentlemen will have noticed, when reading through these various Finance Acts, that a great many Sections in them prevent the relief granted by way of exceptional depreciation and by way of allowance for deferred repairs from overlapping. They will have noticed, over and

over again, that when the Acts refer to one they say that it shall be instead of the other. The two do overlap, and although they lose the deferred repairs allowance they will, as I say, have something which will come very near to compensating them for that loss. They really will not be very hardly treated. It would be impossible, and quite contrary to the spirit of the E.P.T. legislation to allow them, instead of the exceptional depreciation allowance, a deferred repairs allowance. It would mean the owner of the business would be getting an allowance, or not getting an allowance, according to whether the State, or the corporation which took over the nationalised enterprise, were carrying out the repairs or not The owner's right would vary, therefore, according to the action or to the will of his successor, which is entirely undesirable from the commercial point of view. His right depends on his carrying out repairs. If he carries out repairs, he carries out the condition which converts his potential right to allowance to an actual right. Therefore, if these repairs are not carried out by the time the enterprise is nationalised, he is to have an exceptional depreciation allowance extended to cover the repairs he has not carried out, in the way I have indicated. For these reasons, in addition to those I gave when arguing against the last Amendment, I would ask the House, as a logical consequence, to negative this Amendment.</p>

<p>This is, obviously, a highly complicated matter, and it seems to me that the best way of handling it is to try to deal with concrete cases. As a concrete case, may I suggest a small transport man with his own small fleet of lorries? As I understand the situation, he has been showing but not really earning a greater profit during the war years, by reason of the fact that he has been using up the capital of his lorries by wearing and tearing them, through his inability to get the repairs done and he ends up the war with a potential claim to a refund of E.P.T. if and when he carries out these repairs, which are clearly overdue on these lorries. He then, before he can do so, is, under our hypothesis, taken over as a going concern. It should be noted that it is not through any fault of his that he has not done and cannot do his repairs; it is because of the state of the repairing market, and he just


cannot get the job done. Moreover, that being so, I do not see how this exceptional depreciation allowance comes into the picture at all. I do not see that exceptional depreciation in a past year, which is over and gone, comes in, unless depreciation means, in this context, something quite different from the normal meaning attached to "depreciation." Depreciation is something by which one's profits of a past year have, in fact, been reduced, and it does not seem to me that this can be at all a benefit to anybody when he is nationalised. It seems to me that the case against this Amendment has not been adequately put forward. If the hon. and learned Solicitor-General had said that he wished to alter this Amendment, so that it was a case of satisfying somebody that the repairs would have been done if the man could only have done them, then that would have been another story; but he is giving us here a flat negative, on what seems to me to be a great hardship to a small transport operator.</p>

<p>This is an astonishing Amendment. I should have thought there was no justification at all for this type of allowance. It means, if we take the illustration of the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Pitman), that the proprietor of the lorries hands them over to the State in a condition in which they are largely worn out. That is not much of a bargain for the State, but assuming the State takes them over, the hon. Member goes on to say that not only should the State be responsible for replacing those lorries at its own expense, but that the owner of the lorries should be recompensed for having not replaced them. In other words, we are being asked that the State should give the proprietor an allowance in respect of repairs which he has not done, and that the State should then do them for him, There is, of course, the question of loss of capital and other matters of that sort, but if we reduce this highly technical point to a simple statement, that, in fact, is the position. How can we ask that the State should pay a man an allowance in respect of repairs which he has not carried out, and that the State should then carry out those repairs? I submit that no one would really suggest this is a proper thing to do, despite the loss of capital involved, and for that reason, and for the valid arguments advanced by the Solicitor-

General, I see no justification for the Amendment.</p>

<p>Surely a man selling a motor vehicle would expect a bigger price if he had spent money on it, than if he sold it worn out? What has happened is that the State has taken away the money which he was going to spend on it and has left him with a derelict vehicle.</p>

<p>I have not perhaps got so much to call upon. My hon. Friend the' Member for Bath (Mr. Pitman) put a concrete case to which, with all respect, the. hon. Member for South Cardiff (Mr. Callaghan) has not given an answer. It seems to me that there may be, and the. Chancellor of the Exchequer has recognised this in a previous speech, a hardship as between the individual whose business is nationalised, and his next-door neighbour whose business is not nationalised. We had the case put to us of a small transport owner whose business is nationalised, his lorries having been allowed to run down because of lack of repairs during the war. His business is, taken over by the State, and presumably it is taken over at a fair value, which is a much deflated value. Alongside, we have a man who makes wireless sets, and he is in the same position. He cannot get repairs done, but he is to carry on with his business, and when the repairs situation becomes easier he is able to do them at the expense of the State, because he claims against his 100 per cent. E.P.T. His capital assets are therefore fully restored to their maximum value at the expense of the State. The lorry owner has had his capital assets taken over by the State at a very much deflated value, and never, therefore, can have the value restored.<br/>
It seems that between those two cases there is a great hardship upon the individual whose business is to be nationalised. Apart from that, one can see hardship in another way, if one takes the question of the data on which this hypothetical nationalisation is to take place. If it takes place a year or two ahead&#x2014;if it is an industry well behind in the queue &#x2014;by that time the repair situation has got easier, and the individual has managed to get his repairs done, then he will have had them done against E.P.T. rebate. His capital assets will be restored to their value, and, presumably, if the State takes them over thy will do so at full value. If he is unlucky, and further ahead in the queue, or if he is unlucky and the repair situation to meet his particular requirements is rather more behind hand, then, if he has not got the repairs done, he gets his capital assets taken over by the State at the deflated value. It seems to me that there are obvious chances that there will be hardship as between one individual and another; as between the individual who is nationalised and the individual who is not. I hope the Chancellor of the Exchequer has recognised the fact that nationalisation must not be allowed to impose unfairness upon the individual whose business is taken over in the supposed interest of the State, and that, having recognised that, he will see that this is a case where allowance should he made.</p>

<p>It would seem to me that none of the hon. Members who have spoken on this matter have carried their arguments to their logical conclusion. The only payment made by the State may not be the actual cost of the lorry at the time it is taken over; in fact it may be the earning capacity of the business which will be reflected in the figure of E.P.T. If he gets it in one way, he cannot possibly get it in the other, if the argument is continued to that point, it will be seen that if he has not paid out money in repairs, he has shown it as additional earning capacity, and if he has paid out money in repairs it cannot be shown as earning capacity.</p>

<p>Do I understand from that, that the valuation of assets to be taken over by the Government in such a situation will take account of provision for deferred repairs, and that matters of

that kind can be added back to the profit for the purpose of valuation?</p>

<p>I said that he would be quoting what his earning capacity is and what his profits are, and if he has not paid out in repairs that will b' shown in another way.</p>

<p>In this interesting discussion of the example given by the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Pitman) and carried on by the right hon. Member for West Bristol (Mr. Stanley), I would suggest to the Chancellor of the Exchequer and his friends that it is not only the road haulage business that we have in mind but many other industries. Have right hon. Gentlemen opposite considered what is going to happen to municipal gasworks which may be taken over by His Majesty's Government? I know a good deal about municipal gasworks. [<i>Laughter.</i>] I thought that feeble joke had tong since died. The gas industry, like all other industries, has had a difficult task. It has not been able to carry out improvements and necessary repairs in its plant because of the national economy It has not had the labour, materials or the desire to do so and the plant today is six years' depreciated. The maintenance of pressure plant is an expensive and costly matter and there have been six years of what one might term neglect. Many such plants would be totally unworkable except for the very good repairs done to them after six years of comparative neglect.<br/>
What is the Chancellor's position? He is going to allow nothing. This is not a little road haulage business which one could stamp beneath one's feet as a man does a beetle. It is a municipal undertaking we are talking about. The municipalities of this country will not like this story that they are not to be allowed full value for their depreciation and for their other assets. Is it recognised that the greater part of the industry of this country has been run down to an unparalleled extent, and what would have been a prosperous business if maintenance and repairs and development had been carried out, is, we fear, merely the bones of the enterprise. I think that if the Government look at it from that point of view and not from the point of view of the nationalisation of some private enterprise, they will see that they are going


to be faced with political and economic difficulties, and I say, with a knowledge of municipal history, that when the Government take over the trams, buses, gas, electricity and water, that will be plain. In that industry, too, they will find keen and competent accountants whose wits are as sharp as those supporting the road haulage or any private enterprise.<br/>
There is another aspect of the matter. The valuation of an enterprise to be taken over will be made at the date on which it is formally annexed. Whatever will be the best calculation is unimportant for my argument, but the payments made will be made in a currency which is much depreciated. An asset worth X in 1939 would not in 1946 be worth merely X minus six years' depreciation, because the money</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1946-07-15a.990.0" colnum="990" time="">
<p>from which the remuneration to the owners of the undertaking will be taken will be very changed in character and standard. That consideration may be ignored in dealing with private enterprises like road haulage, but it will not be ignored in dealing with the tough-minded local authorities, who are getting alarmed at the incursions which are being made into their system all over the country. I beg the Government to look at this matter again and to think seriously about it before seeking trouble with the local authorities. As a friend of the Government, though an outspoken friend, I ask them to think again.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 32, line 35, to leave out "terminating," and to insert:
<q>termination, whether by agreement or otherwise.''</q>
This Amendment is designed to meet a point which was made by the hon. and learned Member for Daventry (Mr. Manningham-Buller). The Clause deals with cancellation costs, and as it reads at the moment, it includes only such costs as are incurred by way of compensation paid for the purpose of determining a contract. The point made by the hon. and learned Member for Daventry was that the ambit of the Clause should be somewhat extended to include damages which had to be paid necessarily as the result of terminating a contract. If the claimant in respect of cancellation costs found himself in the position in which he could not determine the contract by paying compensation or by negotiation, and determined it without having agreed upon terms as to determination, and in consequence was held liable in damages to the other party, the hon. and learned Member for Daventry made the point that he should be entitled to claim as cancellation costs the amount of those damages.<br/>
The Amendment which I have moved would extend the definition of the costs in such a way as to include an amount of damages awarded by a court. That is a concession to the point of view adduced from the other side of the Committee by the hon. and learned Gentleman the Member for Daventry (Mr. Manningham-Buller). I ask the House to say that it is fair and right and to approve this Amendment.</p>

<p>I have on occasions been rather unkind to the hon. and learned Gentleman but I should like now to say quite shortly that I appreciate the fact that he has accepted the point of view of my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Daventry (Mr. ManninghamBuller). I feel sure that this will be a general improvement, and I regret that my hon. and learned Friend was not present to thank the hon. and learned Gentleman personally.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 32, line 39, to leave out from

<q>surrendered," to the end of the Subsection, and to insert:</q>
<q>in connection with any event forming the ground for a claim for rehabilitation costs as defined by subsection (5) of section thirty-three of this Act.''</q>
We are still on the question of cancellation costs and the present Amendment puts this position forward. In introducing this Clause the Chancellor has recognised that contracts which are alleged terminal expenses should be set against excess profits but as the Clause is drafted it is very narrow because it applies only to leases or such contracts as arc surrendered as a consequence of determination of a contract for the provision of goods or services which were used during the war years. That narrows the relief because many contractors have taken dispersal premises arid will in many, perhaps the majority, of cases not have cancelled the leases arising out of these immediately on the cancellation of the war contras:. The supposition that directly a war contract is over the contractor will be able to cancel all his leases, vacate his dispersed premises and close down is quite erroneous. He will have to make many arrangements and very often the dispersed premises will be on his hands for other purposes such as peacetime production. These arrangements are made by war contractors and traders whose business has been dislocated by the war and for that reason they will carry on. I know of many businesses where the original works have been completely upset; the companies have been instructed by the Government to take over dispersed premises, which they would like to close down because they are expensive to run but they cannot do so because they have not yet been able to get their main factories back to proper working conditions.<br/>
In these circumstances we feel that an Amendment which was refused in Committee because it opened the door too wide has a great deal to be said for it. Accordingly we have redrafted it and suggest the present Amendment, the effect of which would be that parallel to the claim of any person for rehabilitation costs the costs of cancellation of contracts should also be the subject of relief. We feel that this would allow the kind of case to which I have referred, and which was put forward on the Committee stage, to benefit without in any way making the position so wide that others would benefit who ought not to benefit.</p>

<p>I beg to second the Amendment.</p>

<p>I am sorry, but we feel that we cannot possibly accept the Amendment. It is very difficult to understand exactly what it means or how far it would go. I should have thought it was extremely doubtful whether it would confer the measure of relief which the Clause as it stands confers. Clause 37 has a very specific and clearly definable object. If the claimant himself was supplying war goods under contract, and has lost that contract because the war has come to an end, he can claim, as cancellation costs, those costs which he has incurred in terminating contracts which he had for the supply of goods to him. That is perfectly intelligible, and is what the Clause as at present drafted provides. One must have clearly defined circumstances in which the rights of cancellation costs will arise. As the Clause stands at present that right to qualify is clearly intelligible. The Clause provides a clearly defined field.<br/>
What the Amendment does I really do not know. What the words
<q>in connection with any event forming the ground for a claim for rehabilitation costs</q>
extend to, it is impossible to say. They are hopelessly vague. They might mean anything or nothing. They might extend to almost anything or they might include practically nothing. This is not a good bit of drafting, and certainly does not improve upon the Clause as at present worded. I therefore ask the House to say that the Amendment does not carry matters any further, and must be rejected.</p>

<q>or, if the circumstances so require, until such later date as the Commissioners may allow, being a date not later than the end of the year nineteen hundred and forty-nine.</q>
This is another concession to the point of view advanced by the right hon. Member for the Scottish Universities (Sir J.

Anderson). Hon. Members will remember that, in respect of terminal expenses, the Government have moved and the House has approved an Amendment extending the qualifying period from the end of 1948 to such period as the Commissioners think proper, not being later than the end of 1949. That was in relation to terminal expenses under Clause 33. The Amendment I move is precisely analogous, doing the same thing in relation to cancellation costs. Having approved the one the House is asked to say that it is only right and proper, as a necessary corollary, to approve the other.</p>

<p>I would like to take the opportunity of thanking the Chancellor of the Exchequer, through the Solicitor-General, for this Amendment. I take it that the Amendment largely meets the purpose of an Amendment which was proposed just now relating to any firm which had dispersed its factories as a result of Government orders and has to continue in those dispersed premises until 1949. I hope that the Chancellor will not bar the door too quickly at a later stage, against a further extension beyond 1949 if there are still cases in which hardship is being done. This is allowing the principle that it will take quite a time to clear up the mess of the war, and if there should be, as two hon. Members have said there might be, instances where hardship would be done through the too rigid application of a time limit, I hope it will be open to make a further Amendment later. Meanwhile I thank the Chancellor for this.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 36, line 8, to leave out "and two years."<br/>
This and the succeeding Amendments deal with a point made by the hon. Member for Twickenham (Mr. Keeling) which the Chancellor of the Exchequer accepted in principle during the Committee stage. Clause 42 is the Clause which deals with gifts <i>inter vivos</i> and extends the period from three years to five years in the case of ordinary gifts


and one year to two years in the case of charitable gifts. The argument addressed to the Committee by the hon. Member for Twickenham was that the period should not be extended in the case of charitable gifts. My right hon. Friend, after having heard the arguments, thought that a case was made out for that, and undertook, if the hon. Member for Twickenham would withdraw his Amendment, to put down an Amendment suitably worded on the Report stage. This is the first part of that Amendment, and I ask the House to approve it. What it does is to remove charitable gifts from the scope of Clause 42.</p>

<p>As regards charities, and as regards the other cases in which the five or three years have run out. But what is interesting to those who have studied these things is the fact that in Committee the Amendment of the hon. Member for Twickenham (Mr. Keeling) was to leave out "and two years," and here the Amendment of the Chancellor of the Exchequer is to leave out "and two years."&#x2014;[An HON. MEMBER: "There are other Amendments."] I am speaking about the one on this Clause. I want to call attention to the fact that when the Solicitor-General then said that they felt in a position to accept the principle of the Amendment, he went on to say:
<q>We are satisfied that it would be right to continue with the period of one year, in the case of charities. I ask the hon. Gentleman opposite to withdraw the Amendment to give us an opportunity to make quite sure that we get the correct wording for the Report stage and to ' vet ' the wording he has used in his Amendment."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 24th June, 1946; Vol. 424, c. 810.]</q>
The words in the Amendment were "and two years," and the result of the further consideration and the vetting is to prove that he was right in the beginning.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 36, line 22, at the end, to insert:
<q>(2) Where by virtue of this Section and of the enactments mentioned in the Tenth Schedule to this Act as amended by such Schedule any property taken under a gift <i>inter vivos</i> or such other transaction as is referred to in the foregoing Subsection is included as property passing on the death of a deceased person the amount of the estate duty (if any) payable in respect of the value of such properly shall be reduced by the amount of the stamp duty paid upon the conveyance or other disposition by which the gift of or other transaction relating to such property was effected.</q>
This is a small point but I think quite an important one, and the matter is not very controversial. The alterations which have been made to the law in Clause 42, dealing with gifts <i>inter vivos</i>, have resulted in the chance of there being some hardship in the case of those who have made gifts <i>inter vivos</i> which have not been completed before the end of the three years. To take an example, suppose some four years ago a man made a gift <i>inter vivos</i> and at that time the property was transferred and a duty of one per cent. was paid on the transfer. Supposing that particular man dies during the course of this year, and duty has to be paid on the estate, the one per cent. Transfer Duty would have been payable in relation to that particular transaction as well as the Estate Duty on the whole amount, and this Amendment merely proposes that in such circumstances the ore per cent. which has already been paid should be accounted, as it were, as a contribution towards the total Estate and Legacy Duties which are due. In view of the changes made under this Bill, and the fact that those who have made gifts of that kind could not possibly have known of them, it is only reasonable that the right hon. Gentleman should accept this Amendment.</p>

<p>We feel on this side of the House that there is no ground at all for this Amendment. Supposing, instead of transferring the gift as a gift <i>inter vivos,</i> the donor had retained it as part of his estate until he died and had willed it by his will, the position would be that Stamp Duty would have to be paid on the transfer to a beneficiary. Estate Duty, of course, would have to be paid in either case. Also the beneficiary would


have to pay Legacy Duty. There is no possible reason why, in the event of a gift not being invalidated, there should be any exemption in the case of Stamp Duty. Stamp Duty is payable in either event, and it does not make the least difference as a matter of commonsense whether the gift is transferred while the donor is living, or whether he leaves it as part of his estate. There is no reason why in either case it should be forgone by the Revenue.</p>

<p>Before the hon. and learned Gentleman sits down, is it not the case that the one per cent. Legacy Duty or Succession Duty would be payable as well as the Estate Duty in the event of the testator dying? That seems to me to invalidate the argument which he has put forward.</p>

<p>Before the hon. and learned Gentleman does so, may I ask him this question? The giver having died before the expiration of the free period for gifts <i>inter vivos</i>, the gift falls to be considered as part of his estate, but supposing it is to be given to the same person as received the gift <i>inter vivos</i>, there is no question of Stamp Duty being paid the second time, is there? That is what is not quite clear in what the learned Solicitor-General said, and it was to safeguard that position that I think my right hon. Friend rose. Does it have to be paid a second time?</p>

<p>I want to ask this question: If somebody made a trust for his children during 1945, the law was that he only had to live three years to avoid paying Estate Duty and Succession Duty. Since, however, this Finance Bill enacts that he has to live five years, this is really retrospective legislation. Will he, therefore, have to live five years in order to avoid paying full Stamp Duty and Succession Duty?</p>

<p>I cannot really see what the question put by the hon. and gallant Member for Finchley (Captain

Crowder) has to do with Stamp Duty. In the case of a gift, whether it is made before the five year period, or during the five year period, or as part of a testamentary disposition, Stamp Duty has to be paid on the transfer. Therefore, it does not make the slightest difference whether or not the gift forms part of the donor's estate for the purposes of Stamp Duty. No argument which I have heard, either by the mover of the Amendment or by any other hon. Member, has disclosed any case for the Amendment. Therefore, I ask the House to reject it.</p>

This Amendment, and the next two Amendments, are designed to improve the definition in Clause 56. When this Clause was discussed, the question was raised as to whether the definition was aptly worded to include the Metropolitan Water Board. The Metropolitan Water Board is curiously constituted. Its constituent bodies are some 69 local authorities and two other bodies which, are not local authorities&#x2014;the Thames Conservancy Board and the Lea Conservancy Board. But its precepting powers are confined to certain of the local authorities. That being the structure of the Metropolitan Water Board, it would be questionable whether it fell plumb within the definition of a joint authority which is at present contained in Clause 56. That definition has been reconsidered since the Committee stage. I ask the House to approve this Amendment, with the consequential Amendments following, which are designed to include to Metropolitan Water Board, in addition to those bodies already included in the Clause as it stands.</p>

<p>I do not think we Should pass this Order, at any rate without some words of explanation from some representative of the Treasury. This seems to me to offer a splendid opportunity for the Financial Secretary to use his great powers of exposition in the House. I do not suppose many hon. Members have a copy of this Order in their hands. It brings about the exemption from Purchase Tax of a. considerable class of what is known as utility furniture. There are two ways of making amendments in the incidence of Purchase Tax. The normal way is to do it through the Finance Bill, and many of our Debates on the Finance Bill have been concerned with alterations and reductions in the rates of Purchase Tax. There is an alternative method provided for by the Finance Act,' 1940; that is, to carry out the same process by means of a statutory Order. The business before the House now is of considerable moment, because it involves the abolition of the Purchase Tax over a wide range furniture.<br/>
If hon. Members will look at the Order they will see that furniture specified by


certain words set out in the Schedule to the Order are to be a new class of exempted furniture. The Schedule reads as follows:
<q>Furniture and component parts of furniture, being goods to which the mark shown, in the Second Schedule to the Furniture (Control of Manufacture and Supply) (Consolidation) Order, 1946, is applied.&#x2026;</q>
We then turn to the Furniture (Control of Manufacture and Supply) (Consolidation) Order, 1946, in order to discover what this furniture is, and to which this utility mark is attached, If hon. Members were to go to the Vote Office and ask for Statutory Rule and Order 225 of this year, they would find, on page 6, a Schedule and a mark&#x2014;a very singular mark, consisting of two apparently more or less black circles with an incision into one side. That is the utility mark applied to this utility furniture, and the classes of furniture covered are set out in the earlier part of the Schedule. They are:
<q>1. Any furniture of a kind commonly used for domestic purposes, including curbs and firescreens containing not more than 10 per cent. of metal calculated by weight, and wire and spring mattresses;</q>
<q>2. Bedsteads (not being aseptic hospital bed steads) made wholly or mainly of metal.</q>
<q>3. Office and other furniture made wholly or mainly of metal, including garden furniture and industrial storage racks and bins.</q>
During the Budget Debate, the Chancellor, with a great deal of reluctance, made a concession in relation to the Purchase Tax covering what he estimates to be &#x00A3;2 million of lost revenue in the course of a year. I really do not think that the House ought to pass this Order without having been given some idea, first of all, what is the quantity and volume of furniture affected by the Order. Is it going to be &#x00A3;2 million worth of furniture a year, &#x00A3;10 million worth or &#x00A3;20 million worth? I think we ought to be told approximately how much revenue the Chancellor is sacrificing, not only in the current financial year but in a full financial year, by the remission of Purchase Tax over this wide range of furniture.<br/>
Of course, there is a great deal to be said for the abolition of Purchase Tax upon this class of goods. Furniture has hitherto been in short supply. Many citizens, restored to their homes, are endeavouring to re-equip them, and, so far as we, on this side of the House are con-

cerned, we shall not, I think, object to the contents of the Order, but we think that the House should be informed of the extent of the Order, the amount of revenue involved in it and the amount of furniture which is expected to be produced during the year of the classes mentioned in the First Schedule to the Order. We must not lose sight of the fact that an exemption from Purchase Tax of this character, as the Chancellor has reminded us many times during the Budget Debate, operates as a subsidy. It means that this sort of furniture is cheaper than it would be if the Purchase Tax was imposed. It is an encouragement to mass-produced furniture, and it is, in that way, a little unfair to the craftsmen who make more specialised furniture. We are living in a world of shortage, however, and, at the present time, we cannot take exception to the Order on those grounds.<br/>
Therefore, I am asking that we shall be given some explanation of this matter, which seems to us to be of much greater substance than many of the Amendments we discussed at considerable length during the Budget Debate, and, in particular, we should like to know why this method of Statutory Rule and Order has been followed rather than this matter being brought up by way of an addition to the Schedule in the Finance Bill.</p>

<p>I am sure the right hon. Gentleman appreciates that in respect of all utility goods Purchase Tax has never been applied. Certainly that is the case with furniture. When we first conceived the utility furniture scheme, when my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer was President of the Board of Trade, we conceived it in terms of furniture made of wood, and the furniture made of wood under the utility scheme was exempt from Purchase Tax. Now we have a shortage of timber and all we are doing is to extend to furniture made from different materials, the exemption from Purchase Tax which applied in the original case to furniture made from wood I am rather surprised that there should be any doubt at all about the wisdom of exempting something from a tax, particularly Purchase Tax, which I have always understood was regarded as undesirable and unpopular on all sides of the House.<br/>
We are trying to protect those people who are endeavouring for the first time &#x2014;or for the second time having lost their original home&#x2014;to build up a home for themselves. We are trying to give them goods of a Government specified quality at the cheapest possible price. Therefore, the goods are excluded from Purchase Tax. The question was asked as to the amount of revenue involved. I am afraid it is impossible for anybody to say. Nobody could forecast with any degree of accuracy&#x2014;not to satisfy this House, at any rate&#x2014;how much will be produced or how much will be purchased. If one could do that, one could say precisely how much revenue was involved. In fact, we shall produce as much as we can and we shall sell, as hon. and right hon. Gentlemen know, all that we can produce, but what that quantity is I would not like to guess. It will be as great as we can possibly make it and I hope it will be very large indeed. With regard to the question as to why we are bringing it in in this fashion, it is because it is the simplest way to get this furniture on to the market in the shortest possible time and to make provision for the exemption of these articles from Purchase Tax. Hon. Members have had an opportunity, which they have taken this evening, of asking questions about the effect of this particular proposal. I really do not see that there can be any objection to this manner of doing it as there is opportunity for Debate. No other way of bringing this particular proposal before the House would afford any better opportunity of giving the same relief to the people who want to purchase this furniture. I sincerely hope that there will not be any trouble about this. We are not endeavouring to impose something upon people. We are endeavouring to make it possible for the people who need furniture quickly and cheaply to get that furniture.</p>

<p>As far as I am concerned, there is not going to be any trouble about this. I do not think there has been much trouble taken about the reply which has been given. It certainly might have been concerted a little more closely with the view of the Chancellor of the Exchequer. When the Chancellor of the Exchequer sees on record in HANSARD tomorrow the view of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Trade about Purchase Tax he will see that it is

very different from his. Hon. Members will remember that the Chancellor of the Exchequer told us that the Purchase Tax is a valuable and almost permanent feature&#x2014;if not a wholly permanent feature &#x2014;of our fiscal policy. The Parliamentary Secretary has come along and said it is a bad tax which everybody wanted to get rid of&#x2014;</p>

<p>I thought I had made it plain, even to the Opposition, that it was the Chancellor of the Exchequer who exempted utility goods&#x2014;and we are dealing particularly with utility furniture&#x2014;from Purchase Tax. I fail to see any difference between the point of view which I expressed and the point of view which has been expressed in a most practical fashion by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.</p>

<p>I think with tomorrow's breakfast, where he will for almost the last time be able to enjoy a couple of pieces of bread, the Parliamentary Secretary must look at what he said in HANSARD. He will see that although we are all certain that the action he is now proposing has the approval of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, it is very doubtful indeed whether the remarks that he made at large&#x2014;I take it he was not following his brief&#x2014;on Purchase Tax will have that approval. But there is a further extraordinary part of his speech. It seems incredible to us, who have had lengthy Debates on the Budget dealing with innumerable subjects and who have become accustomed, especially on the Purchase Tax, to the Chancellor of the Exchequer being able to give us an estimate, which we know by the experience of many years is a pretty accurate one when given by the Treasury, of what any particular concession is going to cost, that, in this case, the Board of Trade is unable to furnish us with any figures whatsoever.<br/>
When, on Wednesday, we come to deal with the Purchase Tax and the exemptions from that tax in, if I may say so, the normal way through the Budget procedure, and we ask the Chancellor any questions on the long list of exemptions which he is going to make, whether it is wigs, mousetraps, vermin destructors, or anything else, he will be able to say that the Treasury estimates that it is going to cost so much. The Chancellor is not making wigs, or mousetraps, but the Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Trade is


making this utility furniture. If the Chancellor can give an accurate estimate of the wigs that somebody else is making, surely the hon. Gentleman can give an estimate of the aseptic bedsteads which he himself controls?</p>

<p>May I point out to the right hon.

Both are made by private enterprise under licence and under specification from the Board of Trade.</p>

<p>This is very curious because, usually, when I hear the manufacture of utility articles of any kind being discussed, I hear the Government Front Bench taking credit for it. It is their scheme, they give the licence, they arrange the labour, the priority and the raw materials, and they take all the credit.</p>

<p>But when it comes to asking something about it they have nothing to do with it at all. There is nothing more between the hon. Gentleman and an aseptic bed than there is between the right hon.

All that we have heard tonight confirms us in our regret that it was not possible to do this by the simple procedure of including it in the Finance Bill, or in one of the numerous Amendments which the right hon. Gentleman is making to the Third Schedule in response to discussions in all parts of the House. If it had been, I feel certain that we should have been saved the extremely unorthodox statement of the Parliamentary Secretary on the question of Purchase Tax as a whole, and that we should have got a definite and accurate answer as to what this was going to cost. Although we shall not oppose it tonight, we hope that, in future, it will be possible to follow the more normal practice and give us the particulars which the House expects.</p>

<p>The subject I am raising tonight is that of the Government's vocational training scheme as it applies to ex-Service men and women. At the outset, I wish to point out that it is not working at all satisfactorily. Not only hon. Members in this House, but outside bodies, representative of Service interests, have complained at the lack of scope of the scheme, and also at the inability of the scheme to absorb the number of entrants for whom training has to be provided.<br/>
My hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Macclesfield (Air-Commodore Harvey) initiated a Debate some weeks ago on the subject of unemployment. Several hon. Members who took part in that Debate raised this question of the ex-Serviceman who wanted to undertake a vocational training course and all expressed dissatisfaction with the present working of the scheme. A short time ago, the British Legion at their annual meeting expressed themselves in similar terms. They moved a resolution calling upon the Government to expand the scheme so as to include more trades, and also make it possible to absorb beater numbers of ex-Servicemen for training. When the Chairman of the Employment Committee of the British Legion moved this resolution, he said that they were profoundly dissatisfied with the slow progress of the various Government training schemes, particularly having regard to the promises made during Service and in the little blue book, "Release and Resettlement," a copy of which all hon. Members will have had. He went on to say that they had made representations to the Minister, and the Minister had told them that his difficulties were lack of premises, equipment and instructors, but that he was doing all that he possibly could.<br/>
When I first read that blue book, I thought what an excellent scheme it was. The booklet was issued long before Germany was defeated, and I naturally


thought that the Government would have made all their plans so that when demobilisation took place there would be no delay and a man would be able to undertake a course within a few days of having made application. What is the present position? The latest figures for 1st July show that 5,499 have completed a course, 17,660 are undergoing a course, but more than 26,000 have been approved and are still waiting&#x2014;some of them have waited over six months&#x2014;to undergo one of these vocational training courses. I have no doubt that most hon. Members will have had complaints. I have had many of them.<br/>
I would like to read two extracts from letters which I have received, to give some general idea of the type of complaint that we are receiving. The first one is from an airman. He was demobilised in October, 1945, after 12 years' service, and he registered in November for a clerical course. He was told that he would not be required for from two to three weeks. He made further inquiries early in the new year, and he was then told that it would he from eight to 12 weeks before he was called. His leave expired in February, and he was getting a bit worried by then, so he put a further inquiry through to the British Legion and the same answer came back, namely, that he would have to wait from eight to 12 weeks. What he writes is this:
<q>Is this to go on indefinitely? I might add that to seek temporary work as a non-tradesman is a most difficult proposition. In consequence, I am registered for unemployment for the first time m my life, and I feel a great loss of pride and self-respect over it. However, I am not really airing my own grievances but I should like to sec something done about the matter so that future Servicemen on demobilisation are not faced with the same troubles; at least, they could be warned.</q>
The last sentence of his letter&#x2014;" at least, they could be warned" &#x2014;hits the nail on the head, because there is no mention at all in this book of any possible delay that might take place. One of the first things I ask the hon. Gentleman the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Labour to do is to see that a paragraph is inserted in any future edition of this book, warning ex-Servicemen and women that there may be considerable delay before they are able to undertake one of these courses.<br/>
I turn to the second case. This was a flight-sergeant who was demobilised in

November, 1945. He applied for training on 13th December, and on 2nd January he attended the Government training school at Leicester for an interview and suitability test. He passed that satisfactorily, and he was told to expect to report for training in five to six weeks. On 28th February, that being the last day of his leave, he went to Leicester to find out what the position was. He was then told he would have to wait a further five to six weeks, and was advised to take temporary work. On 13th March he received a letter from the Newark Labour Exchange telling him that the waiting period had been extended to from eight to ten weeks. On 28th March, four months after he had initiated the first step, he was called to the Newark Employment Exchange and a letter from the regional training officer was read to him by the training officer telling him that the course was reserved for disabled ex-Servicemen, and that he would not be eligible, but they would put him in for another course if he wished. There that man was, chivvied about from 13th December until the end of March, and he was no better off at the end than when he started. I ask the hon. Gentleman who is to reply: Can he wonder that these ex-Servicemen are dissatisfied if this is the sort of thing that is general throughout the country?<br/>
I pass from criticism to offer one or two helpful suggestions. In the first place the Minister says the main difficulties are lack of premises, lack of equipment and lack of instructors. Why does not the Minister approach the employers in private firms? Out of all these thousands of men who are undergoing training only 423 are being trained in employers' establishments. It does seem to me that that would be a very easy method of getting over some of the difficulties. Take the clerical course. The first man I quoted applied for a clerical course. There are over 900 men waiting to undergo a clerical course. With regard to that course the Minister of Labour says his difficulty is that training is undertaken in conjunction with the Minister of Education and the course is undertaken in technical colleges, and the difficulty is lack of teachers, Throughout the length and breadth of this country, in every centre of population there is a business college of some sort or another, and very good ones, too. Surely, he could make use of those, which would get over that little


difficulty? I do not think the Minister himself is very happy about the whole situation. I think he will have to adopt more unorthodox methods if he is to make a success of the vocational training scheme.<br/>
During the war we trained millions of men, and there was never any question then of shortage of premises; there was never any question of shortages of equipment or of instructors. Yet here we have a mere 20,000 to 30,000 men who want equipping for civilian life, and we say we cannot train them because we have not got the premises, equipment or instructors. If the right hon. Gentleman wants premises, why does not he go to the President of the Board of Trade, who has still over 70 million square feet of industrial floor space under requisition? Could not the President of the Board of Trade let him have a little of that? If he wants equipment, surely he has an overriding priority over home production? If he wants instructors, let him appeal to the trades concerned, and I am sure they will be forthcoming. I want the Minister to treat this problem as one of urgency. In my opinion, it is nothing short of a national scandal that we can fall down on the training of so small a number of men compared with the huge number we trained during the war. I do not want to make political capital out of the misfortunes of ex-Servicemen, but I do remind the Minister of that Labour classic, "Let us Face the Future," and what is said there about the ex-Servicemen. I think it is worth repeating to hon. Members opposite:
<q>The gallant men and women in the Fighting Services&#x2026;deserve and must be assured a happier future than faced many of them after the last war. Labour regards their welfare as a sacred trust.</q></p>

<p>I think the sympathetic and reasonable approach of the hon. Member for Newark (Mr. Sidney Shephard) commands our support, because this is not really a party issue. The trouble, as it appeared to us in the Services, was that both the blue book and the official Ministry of Labour lecturers came before the scheme was ready. They were pushed out into the Forces in order to keep up morale, and in the spring of 1945, when nobody anticipated that the Japanese war would come

to an end so quickly, I remember the official lecturers coming to Trincomalee and painting this scheme in glowing colours&#x2014;as late as May, 1945. From the point of view of the scheme, it was in fact unfortunate that the Japanese war came to an end so soon afterwards. No doubt, when my right hon. Friend the Minister of Labour took office he was faced with the position&#x2014;through the fault of no one in particular, and I am condemning no one&#x2014;of having to start from scratch and get the scheme working. That does not excuse delays now, and I heartily reinforce the plea of the hon. Member for Newark that this should be regarded as a matter of extreme urgency. Nothing is more dispiriting than for a man to come out of the Services, having read these official publications and having heard the lecturers but not knowing the reasons why the scheme has not got going, and then to find himself in some blind alley employment, or in a job which he does not want to retain.<br/>
With all respect to my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary who is to reply, I do not think sufficient urgency has yet been imparted into this scheme. Since this matter was raised on a Supply Day one Friday&#x2014;I think on 3rd May&#x2014;there has, undoubtedly, been an improvement and the two-shift system has been introduced in certain of these training establishments so that, no doubt, the scheme is going ahead much faster. If the Parliamentary Secretary intends to tell us that he will not be able to absorb all the waiting list before December, as we were told on 3rd May by the Minister, this is not satisfactory and I think we ought to go ahead faster in absorbing all these people. As a practical point may I say that No. 5 formation college at Luton, which was set up by the Army last September and on which thousands of pounds of public money has been spent, in order to do what is largely a pre-demobilisation job, is doing exactly this sort of work. For reasons best known to themselves, the War Office are closing down that college. Will my hon. Friend investigate the possibility of taking over that very fine building, which has workshops already built, and turning it into a Government training centre? I do not expect an answer "yea" or
"nay" tonight, but I hope he will investigate the possibility. This is a matter of urgency and the cases which have been brought


to our attention are disturbing to those of us who are&#x2014;as we all are&#x2014;interested in the welfare of the ex-Serviceman. I hope we shall press on with the scheme as fast as we can.</p>

<p>I am very sorry that there is so little time available in which to discuss this very important question. No one can have any objection to the tone of the speeches or the way in which it has been raised. It is an extremely urgent matter and one of great concern to a large number of men. Having said that I should like to point out that, in the first place, the leaflet that was issued to the Forces, was distributed before this Government came into office. Although I am not complaining about this, promises were made before this Government took office, and subsequently a further leaflet was issued called "Government Vocational Training Schemes." This leaflet&#x2014;and I think this meets the point of the hon. Member for Newark (Mr. S. Shephard)&#x2014;has been widely circulated in the Forces and does warn members of the Forces of the delay that may arise with regard to vocational training. In that sense, the point which the hon. Member made was anticipated some three months ago, by the issue of this leaflet.</p>

<p>My information is that it is issued to every man, but I would like to check that, in order not to mislead the House. When we went into the Ministry the first thing we looked at was this question of training. We saw that there were available, in August of last year, places for 3,716 persons. That was

the total number of places available in the training centres after the end of the European war. Our great task was to increase, as rapidly as we could, the number of places for training, particularly for ex-Service men. I want to give the House some indication of the way in which the programme has been not only triplicated, but built up to its present scale. In July, 1945, the total number of training places was 3,616. This was at the time when that leaflet was being issued to the Forces, the time when Ministry of Labour lecturers were going around and telling men in the Forces about this vocational training scheme and about all the places that were available. In August, when we took office, the number was immediately increased by 100.</p>

<p>Places. By December, the number had been increased to 5,300. On 8th April, it was 10,000. In June, it was 14,000, and now it is going up at the rate of 2,000 per month. It is planned that by December there will be places for 28,500.</p>

<p>No; places without the two-shift system. It is now proposed that in some of these training centres, where it is possible&#x2014;and travelling has something to do with this, as will be appreciated&#x2014;the double shift should be installed. It started in the North-East region, and is now being extended to other centres. We hope, by this means, to increase the number of places available for applicants. In the building trades, instead of giving six months at a centre we are giving four months, and two months on the job. But here is our difficulty: we cannot cut down the training time to such an extent as to flood the building industry with more apprentices than it can take. That is one of our difficulties now. To the extent that the industry develops, it will be able to take more and more. To the extent that we get skilled men back into building, we shall be able to add to the dilutee labour, and we are waiting for the extension in the number of skilled personnel in the building industry so that we can pump more and more trainees into the industry to finish their training.</p>

<p>No, it is not refusing. In fact, I must say of both sides in the building trade generally, that they are being extremely cooperative, but I am sure the hon. and gallant Member will realise that we cannot put more trainees into the building industry than the industry can supervise in their training. To get too great a density of trainees in the industry would be to decrease efficiency in the industry and to leave men without adequate skilled supervision, which is highly desirable in the last few months of training. As far as the building industry is concerned, it is being extremely helpful in this matter. Another point that was raised concerned technical schools. I feel sure that the hon. Member for Newark will be pleased to have the information that in July, 1945, there were 330 in technical colleges, and now there are 2,026, and we shall take every place that any technical college in this country can give us for training.</p>

<p>I am taking, first, the technical colleges, and I say that, with regard to them, we shall take every place they can give us. We are pushing them for all we are worth, so as to provide opportunities for these men to get their training as quickly as possible. I come now to the question of private colleges, to which reference has been made. Not all private colleges are suitable. Some of them, which have very high reputations, we are using. We have to exercise some discretion in this matter, and I cannot make the same open declaration about all the private colleges as I can make about the technical colleges, but in so far as private colleges of repute can offer us opportunities of places for training, we shall take them. We are using a considerable number of private colleges for this purpose.</p>

<p>Correspondence colleges are not regarded quite as full-

time vocational training. We do not want to give training on the cheap. We want to give efficient and fulltime training in the best possible circumstances, so that these men can get the maximum benefit. The hon. Member for South Edinburgh (Sir W. Darling) may disagree with me on this point, but we ought not to be open to criticism on the ground that we are providing inadequate training for the trainees under our vocational training system. Once we became subject to criticism of that sort, it might damn the whole scheme, and do irreparable damage to the men going through the training centres. A number of other points were put to me with regard to our getting on faster. I want to assure hon. Members that we are going as fast as we possibly can, having regard to the absorption of those men on the completion of their training. We have had the position that we have turned out painters on the North-East Coast who have had to remain idle because painting work has not been available.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman says the Ministry are going as fast as they can, but I would point out that only 423 of these men are being trained in employers' works. Will he explain that matter?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1946-07-15a.1016.1" hansard_membership_id="3933" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/30550" speakername="Mr. Ness Edwards" colnum="1016" time="">
<p>I am much obliged to the hon. Gentleman for raising that point again. We are providing for training on the employer's premises. We are subsidising the training of men on the employer's premises, but the great difficulty we are up against is this. Take, for instance, the furniture trade. There is a tremendous demand for cabinet making but the difficulty in that industry is that it has not sufficient raw material for its own employees. Therefore, the more trainees we push out, the smaller the quantity of timber in comparison with the number of men available to use it. That applies not only to that trade but to other trades as well. In the hairdressing industry, we have a similar problem. I was not thinking of the sight that meets me in the mirror every morning. I refer to the problem of equipment after we have trained the men. The absorption of the men we have trained is the difficulty with which we have to contend. The question of the establishment at Luton has been raised. I have been interested in that and with-


out going too far I want to assure my hon. Friend that the greatest pressure is being brought to bear upon the Departments concerned, with that establishment, to make it available for a training centre for the men who are waiting.<br/>
The picture is not one that gives reasons for self-satisfaction. I admit that we have to apply all the energy we can to get these men trained as quickly as possible, and then have to put up with the consequences in industry afterwards. We are training for 40 trades and as regards each trade there has been an agreement with both sides of the industry as to the volume of trainees. Here is one difficulty with which we are faced in the building industry. In the building trade, we want more bricklayers. But everyone wants to

be a carpenter or a plumber. We cannot have carpenters or plumbers in excess of the work provided initially by the bricklayers. We have to try to get that balance, and in that connection, we are advised by both sides of the industry, in regard to the various trades. I assure the House that this is a matter of grave concern to our Department and that we are putting behind it all the energy we can, to give these men all the training that is required, at the earliest possible moment.</p>
