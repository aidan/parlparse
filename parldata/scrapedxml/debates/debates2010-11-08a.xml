	Speaker's Statement
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2010-11-08a.1.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40131" speakername="Mr Speaker" colnum="1"  time="14:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm101108/debtext/101108-0001.htm#10110810001070">
	<p pid="a.1.1/1">I have a statement to make to the House. I have to inform the House that, as required by section 144 of the Representation of the People Act 1983, I have received the certificate from the judges appointed to try the election petition relating to the Oldham East and Saddleworth constituency election on <phrase class="date" code="2010-05-06">6 May 2010</phrase>. The judges have determined that the election was void pursuant to section 159 of the Act because the candidate, Philip James Woolas, was personally guilty of an illegal practice. I shall lay the report and certificate on the Table, together with the full judgment and the shorthand writer's notes, and will cause the full text of the report and certificate to be entered in the <i> Journal</i>. Members wishing to read the report and certificate for themselves will find it set out in the <i> Votes and Proceedings</i> for today, which will be circulated with the Order Paper in tomorrow's Vote Bundle, available online and from the Vote Office. The full text of the judgment has been published by the court on the judicial communications website. I shall place a copy in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.1/2">In accordance with section 160(4) of the Act, Mr Phil Woolas has been reported personally guilty of an illegal practice and must vacate his seat from the date of the report, <phrase class="date" code="2010-11-05">5 November 2010</phrase>. I am advised that a renewed application for judicial review has today been made to the administrative court. The administrative court judge has ordered an expedited hearing of the renewed application as he considers it essential that the electorate of Oldham East and Saddleworth should know who is their Member of Parliament as soon as possible. My ruling is that this engages the House's sub judice resolution, and that therefore the judgment of the election court cannot be debated in the House until court proceedings are concluded. I will not take points of order on this matter now; the opportunity for points of order will come after the 3.30 pm statement.</p>

	<p pid="a.1.8/1">As Member of Parliament for a town that has very much led the way in support for veterans and service personnel, and as chair of the all-party group on veterans, I, too, warmly welcome the report by the hon. Member for South West Wiltshire and the Government's endorsement of it. One of its recommendations is for the setting up of a veterans' information service, which is a positive and constructive proposal, but does the Secretary of State share my concern that membership of it will cost &#163;70 a year? Is there not a danger that that might deter some of the most vulnerable service personnel-for example, those struggling to find work or those on low incomes-from signing up?</p>

	<p pid="a.3.0/1">The issue of access is important. I hear the point that the hon. Gentleman makes and I shall ensure that securing access for all who may be eligible, including the most vulnerable, is at the forefront of our discussions about the implementation of this report.</p>

	<p pid="a.3.1/1">I am extremely grateful to my right hon. Friend for his welcome for my report and for the help that he has given in its preparation. He shares my concern for people with mild traumatic brain injury and knows that a British combat soldier is likely to face exposure to between six and nine improvised explosive device explosions in the course of his career, with the consequent risk of mild traumatic brain injury. Does he agree that more needs to be done to determine the prevalence of mild traumatic brain injury in the British military and to prevent and mitigate its effects?</p>

	<p pid="a.3.2/1">Indeed. There is a great deal of interest in this particular element of scientific research on both sides of the Atlantic. I recently visited the veterans agency in the United States to ascertain what the updated information was. We will certainly want to consider all the evidence as it comes forward. It is an emerging science and we will get different types of information as we go through, but the art will be to try to ensure that we best titrate the treatments available to the information given to us scientifically at any one time so that we operate on the basis of evidence, not supposition.</p>

	<p pid="a.3.5/1">Ministers routinely have discussions with senior military officers on a wide range of issues, including vehicle protection. The advantages in blast protection that can be provided by a V-shaped hull are well understood and Mastiff, Ridgback and the new Wolfhound vehicle all incorporate this into their design. The vehicle selected for the new light protected patrol vehicle will also have a V-shaped hull. It would, however, be an oversimplification to suggest that vehicle protection is driven solely by hull design. The type of protection used on any given vehicle is very much driven by the capability the vehicle is designed to meet and the threat it is expected to face.</p>

	<p pid="a.3.6/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that answer, but as he will know that has not always been the case. There was originally some resistance from the Army to introducing the V-shaped hull vehicles and if it had not been for the work of people such as Ann Winterton in this Chamber, as I am sure he recognises, they might never have been introduced. Given that, will the Minister assure us that when the troops finally withdraw from Afghanistan, the Government will not dispose of these vehicles in favour of the prehistoric design of the future rapid effect system's vehicles?</p>

	<p pid="a.4.0/1">It is a great pleasure to join my hon. Friend in paying tribute to Ann Winterton, whose sterling work on this issue and many others in this House has made a contribution to the happier place that we are in than might otherwise have been the case. Commanders probably now have the range of vehicles they need to cope with the different threats they face in theatre. My hon. Friend is absolutely right to emphasise the importance of ensuring that once the Afghan war is over we learn the lessons and have the appropriate range of vehicles in place to ensure that we can deal with future threats, too.</p>

	<p pid="a.4.1/1">Given that the question of deployment depends very much on availability and reliability-not only of our vehicles and equipment but of those of our allies-and given that aircraft carriers are V-shaped vehicles-<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> They are undoubtedly V-shaped vehicles; there is no doubt about that at all. What views does the Minister have on the fact that the French aircraft carrier, Charles de Gaulle, has broken down yet again and is not available?</p>

	<p pid="a.4.3/1">Mr Speaker, your characteristic generosity has allowed the hon. Gentleman to proceed with his question. I am not sure that a carrier is a vehicle, but never mind-we will let that go. I hear what the hon. Gentleman says and, like him, I wish we could buy three of our own aircraft carriers; he challenged me on this on Monday. We cannot do that, I am afraid, and I think we have adequate arrangements in place to sustain carrier strike in the future.</p>

The likely expenditure is dependent on the decision on initial gate, which is yet to be taken.

We expect those to be around &#163;1.2 billion to &#163;1.4 billion extra to maintain those submarines for longer. However, his analysis would be far more correct if the ultimate decision to delay the in-service date increased the cost of the successor programme.

	<p pid="a.6.1/1">Indeed, my hon. Friend makes an important point. A range of different groups suffer from mental health problems, both inside and outside the armed forces. There are those who come into the armed forces with a problem-either a mental health problem or a substance-abuse problem-those who develop one during their time in the armed forces and those who subsequently develop one. In a civilised society, it is very important that we ensure that all three groups are properly looked after. I would go so far as to say that it is the measure of how civilised a society we are that we look after the most vulnerable, and those with mental health problems must be in that group.</p>

	<p pid="a.6.2/1">Will the Secretary of State take this opportunity to pay tribute to service charities such as Combat Stress? It can take quite some time before mental health problems become apparent. It is important to support our veterans in the long term and not just in the short term or in the immediate aftermath of their retirement from the service.</p>

	<p pid="a.6.3/1">My hon. Friend makes an excellent point. Recent evidence suggests that post-traumatic stress disorder is likely to present at a peak at about three years, but may take as long as 14 years to present. It is therefore important that we recognise and see through our through-life responsibility to our armed forces. It cannot be right that our duty of care ends at the point of discharge from the armed forces themselves.</p>

	<p pid="a.6.6/1">The Government are reviewing tour lengths and the interval between tours. At the same time, they intend significantly to reduce the size of the deployable force.

	<p pid="a.6.7/1">Leaving aside the assumptions in the hon. Lady's question, which are an argument in themselves, her key point is whether the incidence of post-traumatic stress disorder is related to tour length or tour frequency, or a combination of the two. Evidence increasingly tends to suggest that the key element is the length of the tour rather than the frequency, and that, of course, will instruct the Government's thinking.</p>

	<p pid="a.7.1/1">That is true for not only the armed forces but society in general. Only when we, as a society, remove some of the taboo of mental illness will we properly unlock the ability to deal with it successfully. My right hon. and learned Friend is correct that we need to look at people's willingness to self refer, and that process is made easier if they can contact a helpline run by members or ex-members of the armed forces, in whom they are likely to be able to place greater faith.</p>

	<p pid="a.7.2/1">The King's college review of mental health services for the military says that one way in which the mental health of those serving in theatre can be impacted is if they feel that their families are not being supported.

	<p pid="a.7.3/1">The hon. Lady is absolutely correct. One thing that I learned during the five years I worked alongside the armed forces and their families as a doctor was that if one wants to create unhappy service personnel, the surest route is to create unhappy service families. We must examine the situation as a whole, and we need to look at all elements of the military covenant-not just the financial elements that she mentions, but service education, access to health care for service families and other welfare issues, including accommodation.</p>

	<p pid="a.13.7/1">It is certainly the case that ensuring sovereignty in the use of our armed forces often requires specific industrial capabilities to be maintained in the UK. That often involves research and development. However, I must emphasise that competition in the global market remains our preferred means of acquiring equipment at the best value for money, which means buying off the shelf where possible. I freely acknowledge that the issue is complex, which is exactly why we will consult formally on it in the Green Paper to which I referred.</p>

	<p pid="a.14.3/1">I could not agree more strongly with my right hon. Friend. The last Government's massive slash-and-burn approach to the science budget was a major scandal and makes our task a great deal more difficult. The SDSR document makes it clear that we are maintaining our essential science and technology investment, and I can tell him that at present, we expect that budget to rise slightly in cash terms over the CSR period. That is not the ideal outcome, but it is a good one and I hope he will welcome it.</p>

	<p pid="a.17.9/1">I must honestly say to the House that this was one of the most difficult decisions we were forced to take as a result of the mess in the national finances and the grossly overheated MOD budget that we inherited. Since the withdrawal of the Nimrod MR2 in March, the Ministry of Defence has mitigated the gap in capability through the use of other military assets, including Type 23 frigates, Merlin anti-submarine warfare helicopters and Hercules C-130 aircraft, and by relying, where appropriate, on assistance from allies and partners. That was originally assumed to be a short-term measure. We are now developing a longer-term plan to mitigate the impact of cancellation on our continuing military tasks and capabilities.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2010-11-08a.25.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40648" speakername="Oliver Letwin" speakeroffice="The Minister of State, Cabinet Office"  colnum="25"  time="015:35:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm101108/debtext/101108-0001.htm#10110810001226">
	<p pid="a.25.1/1">With permission, Mr Speaker, I wish to make a statement on today's publication of departmental business plans. When we formed the coalition in May, we committed to a programme of fundamental structural reform that would change the nature of government. Of course, I recognise that it was the aim of the Labour Government to improve public services, to get value for money and to deliver their stated aims. The problem lay in the fact that, to achieve those laudable aims, they set up a system of bureaucratic accountability in which almost everything was judged against a set of centrally mandated, politically determined performance targets. They then used a succession of short-lived bureaucratic interventions to try to make people fulfil the targets.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.1/2">Alas, the evidence of the past 13 years shows that targets and short-term bureaucratic interventions simply do not work. Despite all the new learning strategies in schools, the gap in educational achievement between the richest and the poorest widened; despite all the NHS targets, cancer survival rates in Britain were among the lowest in Europe; despite all the police form-filling and bureaucracy, there were more than 100,000 incidents of antisocial behaviour every day; and, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40083" name="Liam Byrne">the right hon. Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr Byrne)</phrase> has famously remarked, the money ran out.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.1/3">So, we have argued for a power shift that will take power away from Whitehall and put it into the hands of people and communities, rebalancing the relationship between the citizen and the state. We recognise that Britain can make progress only if the Government establish frameworks that help people to come together to make life better. We have also argued for an horizon shift-[Hon. Members: &quot;Hooray!&quot;] Opposition Members will hear a lot of that term over the next four years, so they should get used to it. We have argued for an horizon shift, moving away from short-term bureaucratic interventions towards governing for the long term, establishing the right frameworks of incentives in the public services, sorting out the public finances and investing where it counts to create sustainable economic growth.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.1/4">The publication of our departmental business plans is a significant part of achieving both that power shift and that horizon shift. In June, the Prime Minister launched a series of draft structural reform plans, in which Whitehall Departments publicly set out their reform priorities and the actions that they will take to achieve them, with a specified timetable. In July, August, September and October, we issued monthly reports on the draft plans, setting out the actions that had been completed or started, and giving explanations of any missed deadlines. Today, taking into account the results of the spending review, we are publishing the final departmental plans, setting out the vision, priorities and structural reforms of each Department.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.1/5">These plans are a key part of our transparency agenda. They do not set out hopes for what we might achieve by micro-managing all the public services. They set out what we need to do, to manage the Government properly. That is, after all, our business, and we expect to be judged on whether we do it properly. The publication of the plans will bring about a fundamental change in how Departments are held to account for implementing policy commitments, replacing the old top-down systems of targets and central micro-management with democratic accountability. Every month, Departments will publish a simple report on their progress towards meeting their commitments-<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i></p>

	<p pid="a.26.0/1">Order. In a way, it is a good thing that the House is in a jocular mood. I realise that the right hon. Gentleman is no longer a philosophy tutor, but I feel sure that he is accustomed to a slightly more cerebral response and deferential hearing than he is getting.</p>

	<p pid="a.26.1/1">I am grateful, Mr Speaker, for that help, but I have to say that I had not anticipated anything better than I received, because Labour Members presided over a Government who acted like a magazine and we intend to preside over a Government who act like a Government. That is a profound difference and I recognise that it is very uncomfortable for Opposition Members.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.1/2">Before I go on, I should correct myself as I believe I slipped into referring to 100,000 incidents of antisocial behaviour when I meant 10,000. I apologise to the House. That is an example of transparency and straightforwardness, which I hope will be replicated as we move forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.1/3">In addition, the second part of each business plan explains how Government will give people unprecedented access to the data they need-in a simple, easily accessible form-to scrutinise how we are using taxpayers' money and what progress we are making in improving society through our reforms. These transparency sections of the plans are being published in draft to allow Parliament and the wider public to say whether each Department is publishing the most useful and robust information to help people hold each Department to account.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.1/4">Select Committees will, of course, play a vital role in the task of holding the Government to account. My Cabinet colleagues are therefore contacting Select Committee Chairmen to inform them of the new processes and to invite them to discuss the business plans in more detail in their Committees.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.1/5">Once the reforms described in these business plans are fully implemented and the transparency reports are fully in place, we will have a real people power revolution- where people themselves are equipped with the power and information necessary to improve our country and our public services, through the mechanisms of democratic accountability, competition, choice and social action. I commend this statement to the House.</p>

	<p pid="a.26.2/1">I start by welcoming the new Minister for milestones to the House. I could tell that he was the right Minister for this job when I received his statement three hours before he stood up. I thank him for that and urge the same habit on his hon. and right hon. Friends.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.2/2">I also welcome the thrust of the Minister's statement. When Labour came to power in 1997, we discovered that the Conservatives had run public services into the ground. Now, thanks to Labour's investment-and, yes, Labour's management-crime is now down 43%, hospitals have the shortest waiting lists on record and our schools and teachers are delivering record results for our children aged 11, 16 and 18, with 70,000 a year achieving good results.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.2/3">The question was always going to be: what was the way forward after Labour's job of repair? I am glad that the Government have seized on some of the principles set out in our White Paper, &quot;Smarter Government&quot;, published last year. It was described at the time as</p>
	<p pid="a.26.2/4" class="indent">&quot;a radical dispersal of power to patients, parents and citizens&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.2/5">Today, however, the Minister tells us that his first step is to make departmental plans transparent. May I tell him that the only revolution he has delivered this afternoon is to make bad plans transparently bad plans? There will be no power shift if he is going to destroy the power of NHS patients to be treated within 18 weeks; the power of parents to get one-to-one tuition for their children if they are falling behind at school; the power of citizens to summon police officers to talk about issues of local concern.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.2/6">I have only one question: if the Minister is serious about improving government-and I believe he is-will he review the ending of basic rights to high-quality public services across this Government? When it comes to public services, the public want guarantees, but all he has offered them this afternoon is an online gamble.</p>

	<p pid="a.27.4/1">Mr Speaker, perhaps you will forgive me if, to avoid further confusion in the hon. Gentleman's mind, I explain the difference between a target and a milestone. A target is an effort by a Government, of which there were many under the previous Government, to determine what the whole of the public service would achieve through micro-management. Such targets were often not met. What we are talking about are actions that lie under the direct control of Government and which it is absolutely right that we should manage ourselves.</p>

	<p pid="a.28.1/1">Yes, summoning police officers to talk about that. We propose something very different, which goes beyond that.

	<p pid="a.28.2/1">May I make a suggestion? My right hon. Friend says in his statement that every month Departments will publish a simple report on the progress they have made towards meeting their commitments. On the day each month when ministerial colleagues from different Departments come to the House to answer oral questions, might they not also make a written statement that all of us can see? I confess that I find it difficult to keep my own website up to date, so watching the websites of 22 Government Departments will be quite challenging. However, we are all focused once a month on each Department's oral questions, and a written statement coinciding with that would be very helpful.</p>

	<p pid="a.29.0/1">I very much agree with my hon. Friend that it is only by making the kinds of changes that he describes that we can really improve public services. That is why I have the good news for him that under the programme laid out in the Department for Education business plan my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Education will do exactly what my hon. Friend requests. That is why we have a programme of academies and free schools which gives those kinds of powers locally to the professionals on the ground. By doing that we enable parents and pupils, by choosing the schools of their own desire, to create real competitive pressure for excellence in the system. Combining that with the efforts to create a proper pupil premium means that the least advantaged will be most advantaged in our system, and the combination of those effects will be to give excellence and improvement for all.</p>

	<p pid="a.29.2/1">What will happen is a series of things that are inconvenient for the responsible Ministers, rising to something that is rather more than inconvenient. In the first place, a report will be made, which will be available to everybody-no Minister likes to see such a thing appear in public. Secondly, the Minister involved will find himself having a discussion with my right hon. Friend the Chief Secretary and me to explain what has occurred-<i> [I</i><i> nterruption.]</i> I do not know whether Labour Members want to know about this, but I am trying to explain it. The second thing that will happen is that the Minister will meet the Chief Secretary and me, and the permanent secretary will have a conversation with the head of the civil service. Finally, if the problem is still not resolved, the Secretary of State in question will have a meeting with the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister. This is a serious set of incentives; if one thinks about what it was like under the previous Government, or any previous Government, one realises that Ministers do not wish to go through that process and will therefore try to meet their objectives.</p>

	<p pid="a.29.4/1">My hon. Friend is absolutely right that the Select Committees play a vital role in that respect. This approach puts vastly more power in the hands of the Select Committees, because the biggest obstacle to their power is, of course, lack of information-and this approach opens the whole thing up. This is not just a question of the structural reform plans and the dates, on which of course Committees can interrogate, as they can interrogate explanations when things go wrong; it is also about the details of the input costs-what we are putting in-the things that have been achieved on the ground and the outcomes, by which I mean how good it is for the final customer. That gives a Select Committee the ability to haul the relevant Secretary of State up before it and say, &quot;Look, you said you were going to do this.&quot; The Committee could then say: &quot;You did not do it&quot;; &quot;You did it, but at a greater cost than you said&quot;; &quot;You did it at the cost but it did not turn out to produce things&quot;; or &quot;It did produce things but the outcomes were not good enough.&quot; That is a very powerful interrogative tool. Hon. Members may ask why we would subject ourselves to this. The answer is because we think that it is how we will produce a better Government.</p>

	<p pid="a.33.6/1">Will the Minister explain how he squares taking power away from Whitehall and putting it in the hands of peoples and communities with the Government's plan to increase the number of Ministers by 10% relative to the size of the legislature, which is the representative of peoples and communities? Is this not the old Tory centralist state at work?</p>

	<p pid="a.34.0/1">The hon. Gentleman is clearly an apprentice of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40646" name="Tom Watson">the hon. Member for West Bromwich East (Mr Watson)</phrase>, because that was the most marvellous manipulation of statistics. We propose to reduce the number of Members of Parliament, but <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40581" name="Tristram Hunt">the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent Central (Tristram Hunt)</phrase> describes that as an increase in the proportion of Ministers to the number of Members of Parliament. That is a very strange way of describing the situation. We are keeping the number of Ministers constant in order to ensure that we can impose political will on the machine to get the fundamental reforms that give power out to the people of this country. That goal is far more important than particular numbers of Ministers.</p>

	<p pid="a.34.1/1">Following on from that question, the Minister has said several times this afternoon that he wants to increase power locally, yet the Government have just published a report on waste that implies that if they want to do something serious, they will need to recentralise powers, such as by forcing primary care trusts to act together and forcing local authorities to act together. Is there not a contradiction in those two things?</p>

	<p pid="a.34.2/1">In brief, no: we are not attempting to do what the hon. Gentleman describes. We believe that by placing the power of commissioning in the hands of general practitioners, by giving GPs and patients genuine choice over where patients go, and by making hospitals accountable on those choices by transforming them into foundation trusts, we can achieve the efficiencies that are needed in our health service through the medium of competition, which leads to the excellence that can be generated when professionals are able to run their own show. We are moving in exactly the opposite direction from that which the hon. Gentleman describes.</p>

	<p pid="a.34.3/1">As the only time in nature when horizons actually shift is when a tsunami is on the way, can the House and the country expect to be inundated-the Minister gave an example today-with more bureaucracy, more gobbledegook and more management-speak?</p>

	<p pid="a.34.4/1">I respect the hon. Gentleman for his long work in areas such as drugs, but if he reads the plans he will find that they include serious efforts to change things for the better, such as through a payment by results-based drugs rehabilitation programme, for which, I think, he has long argued. That is not gobbledegook, bureaucracy or micro-management. It says to providers, &quot;You know how to provide and we will pay you if you get people off drugs and back into the mainstream,&quot; and nothing could be more important to the people of our country than that.</p>

	<p pid="a.34.5/1">I think I understand what the Minister has announced: a series of tough, demanding and transparent moving-horizon, non-target, milestone reports. If he has, I fully support him, but to build on the point made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40053" name="Tony Baldry">the hon. Member for Banbury (Tony Baldry)</phrase>, may I point out that publishing those reports on 22 websites will make things almost incomprehensible to citizens who wish to hold the Government to account? It would be better to place them in a single spot-perhaps directgov, the Cabinet Office website or data.gov.uk. Will the Minister also consider placing ministerial diaries and details on special advisers' hospitality in a single place on the same site?</p>

	<p pid="a.35.0/1">I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his brilliant translation. Incidentally, I have no doubt that he understood everything that I said because he understands everything that anyone says-he is very clever. Unfortunately, he is not very well informed because, as a matter of fact, we will enable people to go to a single place to get hold of all this stuff. Moreover, it will be put in a format that will enable people to mash it up and easily produce their own charts, and their own comparisons and analyses of everything that we issue. I anticipate that we will make more things transparent, including contracts for Government Departments right across the board, as well as all expenditure down to &#163;25,000-and in local authorities down to &#163;500 per item.</p>

	<p pid="a.36.1/1">On a point of order, Mr Speaker. Following your reporting earlier of the certificate issued by the election court in the case involving the Oldham East and Saddleworth constituency, as the case raises important questions it would be sensible for the House to pause before considering a by-election writ, for two reasons.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.1/2">First, the matter is the subject of continuing legal proceedings by Mr Woolas, as you reported to the House at 2.30, and it seems only proper that the proceedings are allowed to conclude. Secondly-without wishing to stray at all into the details of the case, which we should not do because, as you have ruled, it is sub judice under the terms of the resolution passed by the House in 2001-if the judgment were to be overturned and the former Member were reinstated, but in the meantime we had held a by-election and another Member had been elected, we could end up with two Members of Parliament for one constituency, and that would hardly be desirable.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.1/3">It seems to me that the prudent and practical course of action is to allow the legal process to be concluded before the House considers the writ.</p>

What assurance can you give the House and the people of that constituency that they will not be denied indefinitely, by untested legal proceedings, the representation to which they are entitled?</p>

	<p pid="a.36.8/1">The hon. Gentleman, for whose point of order I am grateful, essentially raises two points. The answer to his first point is yes, as indicated in my statement when I referred to the need for Mr Woolas to vacate his seat from the date of the report, <phrase class="date" code="2010-11-05">5 November 2010</phrase>. The answer to his second point is that of course I attach a premium, as I am sure the House as a whole will attach a premium, to a speedy resolution of the matter in the interests of Parliament, in the interests of Oldham East and Saddleworth constituency electorate, and in the interests of the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.8/2">It is precisely because I attach such a premium that I thought it would help the House if I caused inquiries to be made of the administrative court as to the urgency with which a judicial review application would be treated. Therefore, I reiterate both for the benefit of the hon. Gentleman and for all Members of the House that I did, indeed, cause such inquiries to be made, and I was advised that the administrative court judge has ordered an expedited hearing of the renewed application. He has done so precisely because he, too, considers it essential that the electorate of Oldham East and Saddleworth should know who is their Member of Parliament as soon as possible. I hope that is helpful to all with an interest in the matter.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2010-11-08a.37.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40266" speakername="Edward Leigh" colnum="37"  time="016:09:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm101108/debtext/101108-0001.htm#10110810001287">
	<p pid="a.37.0/1">Further to that point of order, Mr Speaker, and on a more general point, without in any way attempting-because you would rule me out of order if I did attempt-to get into the rights or wrongs of the case, massive constitutional issues are raised by it, which the House should debate. This is the first time in 99 years that a Member has been evicted. It is for the people, not the judges, to evict Members of Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.0/2">My worry is that if the judgment is allowed to stand, robust debate during elections will become virtually impossible. People will be terrified of attacking their opponents. For instance, what happens if a minor candidate for the BNP attacks a major party candidate? The latter would be frightened of attacking the former back because he might be disqualified. These are enormous constitutional issues, which we should discuss in the House.</p>

	<p pid="a.37.1/1">I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. I note his point. Tomorrow he will have served 27 years and five months in the House. Throughout that time he has expressed himself with great force and conviction, and today is no exception. We are grateful to him.</p>

	<p pid="a.37.2/1">Further to that point of order, Mr Speaker. I am sorry that I did not catch your opening statement, but I have caught up with it since entering the Chamber. I in no way want to mention the details of the case, or defend or otherwise what is alleged, but, as you will no doubt know, the House has always been extremely reluctant to expel anyone. I know that this is not an expulsion made by a decision of this House, but the House has refused to expel Members over the years on the basis that this is not a club, despite what some people might say, and that if someone is elected it should be for the electorate to decide.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.2/2">There is therefore bound to be concern about whether a court-judges-should decide, and not the electorate. From the moment I heard of the decision, I felt some concern and anxiety that the decision about whether the electorate wanted that particular Member to serve had been taken out of their hands and given to the judges. Therefore, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40266" name="Edward Leigh">the hon. Member for Gainsborough (Mr Leigh)</phrase> said, the question does arise about whether in future circumstances an unsuccessful candidate will use any means to say in effect that what happened during the election was unfair, and to take the issue to the judges.</p>

	<p pid="a.38.0/1">In so far as the latter part of the hon. Gentleman's point of order appeared to be a question, I hope that he will understand if I say that I will treat it as a rhetorical question. He has essentially raised a point very similar to that of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40266" name="Edward Leigh">the hon. Member for Gainsborough (Mr Leigh)</phrase>, and done so in earnest. That is respected, but I do not think that I need to respond to it. It is on the record, and that is important.</p>

	<p pid="a.38.1/1">On a point of order, Mr Speaker. The House will be aware that at the tail end of last week the Business Secretary referred the potential takeover of BSkyB to Ofcom. The reason most Members will be aware of that decision is that it was released to the media. Is it in order for that decision, although very welcome, not to be announced on the Floor of this House?</p>

	<p pid="a.48.0/1">As the House will be aware, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40626" name="Angela Eagle">the Member for Wallasey (Ms Eagle)</phrase> referred on Second Reading to the fact that we want to bring forward a provision on tax relief in order to help to support the video games industry. Although, undoubtedly, new clause 1 would not do that in every respect, I want to put it before the House, so that we can have an in-principle debate about video game industry tax relief. The new clause provides an opportunity for the House to consider enhanced relief based on UK expenditure on video game production.</p>
	<p pid="a.48.0/2">The new clause suggests that we might consider qualified tax relief for the video game industry, and that it should be based on strict criteria: the video game must be for commercial release; it must be a British video game, assessed on the basis of a points system; and it must meet a 25% UK expenditure threshold, whereby 25% of the total expenditure on the production and development of the video game is UK expenditure on goods or services. We intended to look at that issue, and I would have tabled a much more detailed new clause, but the advice was that we could not. I hope that I have, however, tabled sufficient proposed changes for the Government to consider bringing back at a future date, or supporting the principle of, tax relief for this vital sector in the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="a.48.0/3">The video games industry is a real success story for British industry, and we look to support it in detail. As I am sure that the Minister is aware, research from TIGA, which represents the gaming industry, shows that over a five-year period games tax relief could create or save about 3,500 graduate-level jobs, secure &#163;450 million-plus in new and saved development expenditure, and generate about &#163;415 million in new and saved tax relief. I hope that it would do so in a way that ensures that the cost to the Treasury amounts to about &#163;192 million over five years, which would be more than paid for by the jobs and investment, and encouragement to the industry, that that would develop in due course.</p>
	<p pid="a.48.0/4">My hon. Friends the Members for Dundee West (Jim McGovern), for Liverpool, Wavertree (Luciana Berger) and for West Bromwich East (Mr Watson) have been very vocal in supporting such a tax relief. I hope that the Minister will consider it in principle, so that we can begin to develop a cross-party consensus in due course.</p>

	<p pid="a.49.1/1">Our proposal is based on an existing tax relief for the film industry, which has been very successful in helping to generate extra revenue for that industry and keeping production in the United Kingdom. I am sure that the right hon. Gentleman will be interested to know that the Under-Secretary of State for Culture, Olympics, Media and Sport, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40631" name="Edward Vaizey">the hon. Member for Wantage (Mr Vaizey)</phrase> said this on <phrase class="date" code="2010-04-13">13 April</phrase>-I accept that that was in the middle of an election campaign, so we will take these words as being from that particular time:</p>
	<p pid="a.49.1/2" class="indent">&quot;We are committed to a tax break along the lines of the video games tax credit. We have been calling for tax breaks for the video game industry for the last three years.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.49.1/3">In the spirit of cross-party co-operation, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40062" name="Don Foster">the hon. Member for Bath (Mr Foster)</phrase>, who then held the esteemed position of Liberal Democrat shadow spokesman for Culture, Media and Sport-the Lib Dem spokesmen are now all subsumed into one entity-said:</p>
	<p pid="a.49.1/4" class="indent">&quot;Liberal Democrats support the introduction of a Games Tax Relief. Following consultation on the details, we would implement the Relief as soon as possible.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.49.1/5">At that time, my hon. Friend the Member for Wallasey, who is shadow Chief Secretary, the then shadow Culture Minister, who is now a Minister, and the then Liberal Democrat spokesperson supported this proposal, as did I. Since then, however, it has vanished without trace-until today's debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.1/6"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40667" name="John Redwood">The right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr Redwood)</phrase> may oppose tax reliefs generally. However, such a relief has been proved to work in the film industry to date. Unfortunately, the Chancellor of the Exchequer said in his Budget:</p>
	<p pid="a.49.1/7" class="indent">&quot;we will not go ahead with the poorly targeted tax relief for the video games industry.&quot;-[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2010-06-22.512"><i> Official Report</i>, 22 June 2010; Vol. 175, c. 512</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.49.1/8">I want to test with the Minister whether that is an in-principle opposition to tax relief for the video games industry. If not, is his opposition based on a poorly designed scheme by the previous Labour Government or on poorly targeted suggestions in today's proposals? Is there, in principle, room for discussion, so that it would be possible for him to bring back, at some point, a tax relief that meets the objectives of the hon. Member for Bath, the Under-Secretary of State for Culture, Olympics, Media and Sport, the hon. Member for Wantage and ourselves, and that would, I hope, help to support the video games industry?</p>

	<p pid="a.49.2/1">Just to clarify the point, the right hon. Gentleman should know that I believe that lower tax rates result in more revenue. I am delighted to see that he is now a recruit to that cause, but I suggest that he should not limit it to one industry.</p>

	<p pid="a.50.0/1">We are happy to consider on a case-by-case basis whether tax relief helps to generate employment and earn business and crucially-I think that this is the right hon.

	<p pid="a.50.5/1">The right hon. Gentleman was right to mention the Chancellor's argument that the proposed tax break was poorly targeted, but he will be aware of the evidence given to the Scottish Affairs Committee by Edward Troup of the Revenue. He said:</p>

	<p pid="a.50.6/1">The hon. Gentleman has effectively read out the next section of my speech. I have indeed examined what was said in the Scottish Affairs Committee. The Under-Secretary of State for Culture, Olympics, Media and Sport, the hon. Member for Wantage, said at the same meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2010-10-20">20 October</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.50.6/2" class="indent">&quot;It may be that we can revisit a video games tax break in the future.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.50.6/3">Was he speaking for the Department of Culture, Media and Sport or for the Treasury? I presume that the Chancellor was speaking for the Treasury in ruling out the idea, but three months later his Minister in the DCMS said that we should consider it in future.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.6/4">I do not necessarily wish to press the new clause to a Division, but I have tabled it so that the Exchequer Secretary can clarify whether, in the next 12 months or two years, he can meet the objectives that my hon. Friends the Members for Dundee West, for West Bromwich East and for Liverpool, Wavertree, and the hon. Member for Dundee East, have championed so strongly.</p>

	<p pid="a.51.0/1">The important point about the new clause is the unique position of the video games industry. It has the potential for explosive growth and to create far more high-level, highly paid, highly skilled jobs in the UK. Yet its competitors, with a fiendish interpretation of international competition rules, are picking off the very best designers and developers from UK production shops one by one. The industry worked long and hard with the Treasury to build a robust model for a specific rate to allow the industry to grow over the coming years. That is why hon. Members are so concerned-many jobs are at risk if the new clause is not accepted.</p>

	<p pid="a.51.1/1">My hon. Friend makes the important point that those are high-skilled, highly technical jobs that will bring investment to this country. They are intellectual capacity jobs that are helping to grow the areas of our international markets that we need to grow.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.1/2">To follow up on what the hon. Member for Dundee East said, Edward Troup, the managing director of budget, tax and welfare at the Treasury, said to the Scottish Affairs Committee:</p>
	<p pid="a.51.1/3" class="indent">&quot;There would be issues; there would be boundary issues,&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.51.1/4">but crucially, he continued, &quot;but it would work.&quot; I am not trying to make political capital out of the matter, but if it is proved that the tax break would work-meaning that it can be applied, can deliver, will keep jobs in this country, will grow business and will help resources be reinvested in the British economy-will the Exchequer Secretary be willing to accept the principle and introduce an appropriate clause in some future Finance Bill?</p>
	<p pid="a.51.1/5">If it is found that the tax break would work but the Exchequer Secretary will not introduce it, I will have to presume that he is not interested in doing so, rather than that he is concerned about its applicability and workability. If so, he is on an entirely different page from the one that the Under-Secretary of State for Culture, Olympics, Media and Sport, the hon. Member for Wantage was on in April, that the Chancellor was on before the general election and that the hon. Member for Bath, who is part of the coalition, was on at that time.</p>

	<p pid="a.51.2/1">The right hon. Gentleman makes a perennial point that shadow Ministers make, to which actual Ministers presumably perennially say no. May I point out to him the table in proposed new section 1216Q of the Corporation Tax Act 2009, in new schedule 2? It mentions points being given for at least 50% of a game's production budget being incurred in the UK, and proposed new section 1216R states what the percentage of UK expenditure has to be. Will he confirm that that does not conflict with any European law provision?</p>

	<p pid="a.51.3/1">I have taken advice in drafting the new clause, and my advice is that it is workable and applicable, although I have had to leave out certain aspects. My purpose is not to force this particular model on the Treasury, but to use the new clause as a debating point, so that the Treasury can respond to the principle and decide whether this is a good proposal that will help matters, bring investment back to the United Kingdom and be supportive. I would, potentially, be happy to withdraw the new clause at the end of the debate, and I am happy to listen to what the Minister says, but I want to get to the nub of the issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.3/2">The Under-Secretary of State for Culture, Olympics, Media and Sport, the hon. Member for Wantage, the hon. Members for Bath and for Dundee East, who speaks for the Scottish National party, my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee West and Labour Front Benchers all think that some form of games tax relief to help maintain the industry in the United Kingdom would be a good thing. All I want today is for the Minister to say, &quot;Yes, I agree with that general principle. Over a period of time, I will look at how we make this proposal workable and how we bring it back in a future Budget or Finance Bill.&quot; Indeed, he could say today that he is happy with the proposals and that the Government will look at them again in the near future in whatever format they choose. It is important to get that on the table.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.3/3">Dr Richard Wilson, TIGA's chief executive, has set out his view that we will potentially lose jobs. He said:</p>
	<p pid="a.51.3/4" class="indent">&quot;the UK is losing out on jobs and investment because of the absence of Games Tax Relief.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.3/5" class="indent">High-skilled jobs could be created in Manchester and Warrington. Instead they are being created in Montreal.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.51.3/6">He says that that is particularly because our</p>
	<p pid="a.51.3/7" class="indent">&quot;key competitors, particularly Canada, have tax breaks for games production. The UK does not.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.51.3/8">Others who comment on these matters, such as Danny Bilson, THQ's vice-president for core game brands, has said:</p>
	<p pid="a.51.3/9" class="indent">&quot;The talent in the UK is extraordinary...We have a studio up in Warrington that's an excellent studio...but I'm sorry, it's...about money at the end of the day.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.51.3/10">We need to ensure that we have the support for such things. That is the reality of the market. World-leading publishers recognise that we have an asset, which it has taken years to build up and which is worth hundreds of millions of pounds, but it will go abroad if we do not compete on the same level as our Canadian colleagues. In France, there is a 20% tax reduction for video games, and tax provisions in Canada have driven up staff numbers by 43%, but in the United Kingdom we have seen the head count start to decline over the past few years.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.3/11">I do not want to go into great detail or to take up the House's time. I simply want to tell the Minister that there is real scope for these proposals. There is scope to develop the UK film tax credit model and to use it for the UK video game tax model. We can ensure that we help to grow the sector, and we can meet the commitments that colleagues made during the general election campaign. I tabled the new clause so that we could hear whether the Minister is still of the view that there is no scope for such proposals or whether he could look at the issue in detail and bring back proposals in due course. I commend the new clause to the House.</p>

	<p pid="a.53.0/1">They are the spiritual home of so many things, as I am sure that the Opposition Whip would agree.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.0/2">I have spoken on many occasions to leading lights in the video games industry, and they outlined many of the concerns that have been expressed by the hon. Members for Dundee West (Jim McGovern), for Dundee East (Stewart Hosie) and for West Bromwich East (Mr Watson). There is a risk that a significant amount of business is leaving these shores because of a perception, and indeed the reality, that there is unfair tax and regulatory competition from further afield.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.0/3">One of my concerns, which I expressed before the election to leading lights in the video games industry, is that trying to emulate the film tax credit is not necessarily the right route down which to go. Back-Bench and Front-Bench veterans of Finance Bills going back a decade or more-you are one, Madam Deputy Speaker, from your time as a Minister, as am I from my time in opposition-will know of the concern that the film tax credit has had to be updated almost annually, because of the clear abuses and unintended consequences resulting from it. There was a sense that although the film business in this country benefited from it, there was a significant through-flow of cash that was not in the interests of either the Exchequer or the high-quality products of which our film industry has been rightly proud in decades gone by.</p>

	<p pid="a.53.1/1">Notwithstanding the hon. Gentleman's points about the film tax credit, I am sure that he will understand the business model around which the video games industry operates. A large amount of cash is spent in the development of games, but revenue drops off in the run-up to a new hardware offering or console being developed. The difficulties that the sector faces are exacerbated by the regular new hardware offerings. Does that not make a stronger case for some sort of assistance?</p>

	<p pid="a.53.2/1">I accept that. There is also little doubt that we have some tremendously high-quality people working in this business. I must say, in parenthesis, that one difficulty is that hitherto we have had to import far too many such people from beyond these shores. I know that our university media studies industry is much discredited, but those media studies courses that are linked to the video games industry in particular often ensure that we get some of the brightest and best of the home-grown talent in our universities entering the industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.2/2">I take on board the concerns of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40199" name="David Hanson">the right hon. Member for Delyn (Mr Hanson)</phrase>, given that the issue before us has been in the ether for years. I would prefer not to rush into anything, although I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will take on board the deep concerns expressed today so that we can come back, perhaps during next year's Finance Bill, with a workable model based on the proposals before us.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.2/3">I would like to put in a word not just for the video games industry, unique though its interests are in the minds of those who run and work in those businesses, but for the animation industry. It is a related industry within the media sphere, and faces many of the problems expressed by the hon. Member for Dundee East and businesses in the industry. The animation industry is deeply concerned that it is losing some of its brightest talent, and feels that-this is felt not just in the animation sector-it is facing unfair competition not only from the Canadian and French models, but from Ireland and, dare I say it, Scotland. It feels that it is losing out to a large degree. I would therefore like to see a clause that brings the video games industry, the animation industry and all these other industries under a single protocol. Such a protocol could operate well and effectively, so I hope that the Treasury will consider one in next year's Finance Bill.</p>

	<p pid="a.54.0/1">The hon. Gentleman has indicated that part of the computer games industry is based in his constituency-in fact, he seemed to indicate that the industry originated there. Does he agree that a change of name or title is required? When people hear &quot;computer games industry&quot;, they think of young lads between 15 and 30 sitting in front of a computer screen playing &quot;APB&quot; or &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot;, when in fact, as people who have visited Abertay university in Dundee will have seen, it is used in medical research, construction and architecture. Perhaps we need a change of focus, rather than continuing to call it the &quot;video games industry&quot;.</p>

	<p pid="a.54.1/1">The hon. Gentleman is right to make that important point, although it also raises the question of how we couch such a new clause and schedule in a future Finance Bill to ensure that it takes on board an industry that we want to encourage rather than see go much further afield. I am not a young lad of 15 or 30-or even of 46-so the industry has passed me by, but there is no doubt about the enthusiasm of the companies operating in this sphere. One of my biggest concerns is that all too often those companies have to employ programmers from eastern Europe and other parts of the world in order to get the relevant level of expertise. That is a regrettable state of affairs. None the less it is undoubtedly a thriving and enormous industry, in which we are cheek by jowl with the Japanese in terms of our expertise and export potential.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.1/2">I implore the Minister to take our concerns seriously. Now would not be the time to accept a proposal such as the one before us, but I hope that he will give sufficient comfort to Opposition Members to ensure that they do not press the matter to a vote. However, the issue is worth discussing at length today.</p>

	<p pid="a.54.2/1">One thing that I have not understood-I have not understood it from either the debates that we had in the Public Bill Committee, on which I served, or the responses to the various parliamentary questions that have been asked about the video games industry and tax relief-is whether the objection is to the detail of previous proposals or this proposal, or whether there is a more fundamental objection about giving such a relief at all. At times, it seems to be suggested that it is not appropriate to give such a relief, but it would be extremely helpful to know which it was.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.2/2">If the issue is the detail or exactly how the proposal is to be implemented, that could be discussed further. However, targeting such an industry-or indeed any industries-might be felt to be inappropriate. In one answer given in the Chamber last week, the suggestion seemed to be that a lower rate of corporation tax generally would be sufficient, without targeting specific emerging industries. However, a tax relief is important to a growing industry in that it allows it to get off the ground and develop in the way that it needs to. People have already spoken about the cash-flow difficulties for sectors such as the video games industry, so it would be helpful if the Minister could clarify where the Government are on this issue and what their future plans might be.</p>

	<p pid="a.55.0/1">I am delighted that the Opposition have highlighted the example of the video games industry. However, I fear that it is only one example among many of how we are at risk of losing talent, enterprise, jobs and business development in a number of areas because our rates of taxation are now not internationally competitive. It is interesting that the Opposition, who do not normally favour lower rates, have identified lower rates-or a lower tax imposition-as the answer in this case. I hope that they will think on these things more widely, because the combination of a high marginal rate of income tax and what is now quite a high rate of corporation tax by international standards is not a good combination in an intensely competitive world, where there has been a shock to overall demand and where we are having to fight for our commercial lives in world markets.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.0/2">From my point of view, there are a couple of problems with the proposals before us. The first is that going for 25% for British content is a low ambition. I would have thought that one would want a rather higher rate of British content if we were formulating some special treatment for the industry. There is also a problem with concentrating on the profits that a company generates, because some companies will be small businesses with talented entrepreneurs. They might have just one good game in them that earns them an awful lot of money in a short space of time. That is when high marginal rates on apparently high earnings-they become genuinely high earnings where it is possible to sustain them-could become quite an imposition, because those entrepreneurs might get caught in the year or two of their success, but find afterwards that they are no longer able to achieve that.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.0/3">The issue is therefore not just about corporation tax or profits tax; it can also be about income tax. I hope that the Minister will reassure us by saying something about how he sees our overall tax regime developing, in both corporation tax and income tax, because we have a general problem and we need to show the way to lower rates as quickly as possible in this very competitive world. I would also repeat to my hon. Friend the simple point that the evidence from the American and the British experiences is that when countries have been bold enough to cut rates on enterprise, income and profits, they have usually found their revenues increasing. It is quite obvious that the Government need a lot of extra revenue, so I would recommend that proposal to him.</p>

	<p pid="a.55.1/1">New clause 1 and new schedule 2 seek to provide additional tax relief for companies producing video games. The measure was announced, but not implemented, by the previous Administration. As the Chancellor said in the emergency Budget statement, this tax relief for the video games industry is poorly targeted, which is why we have decided not to introduce it.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.1/2">The United Kingdom's video games industry is recognised as a world leader, having produced hugely successful games such as the &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; series, and has led to innovations in industries as diverse as defence and health care, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40216" name="Jim McGovern">the hon. Member for Dundee West (Jim McGovern)</phrase> pointed out. All that has been achieved without specific Government intervention for the sector through the tax system.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.1/3">We estimate that the relief proposed by the Opposition would cost some &#163;40 million to &#163;50 million a year-that was the costing for the previous Administration's proposal-and we believe that without strong evidence of a market failure in the games industry, it is difficult to justify spending that amount of money on such an intervention, particularly given the state of public finances.</p>

There was a lot of consultation before the then Chancellor eventually announced the decision on tax breaks.

Surely tax breaks that would cost perhaps &#163;195 million and would deliver &#163;415 million in tax receipts are precisely the sort of investment in precisely the sort of industry that would meet the Government's objectives.</p>

	<p pid="a.56.3/1">We have heard the figures quoted by TIGA, but we do not accept the validity of that analysis because we feel that some of the assumptions underpinning those estimates are erroneous. The research commissioned by the industry implicitly assumes that the investment incentivised by the subsidy is entirely additional to the UK economy. In reality, it is likely that the relief will displace investment from elsewhere in the economy, so the net impact on total UK investment could be limited. For example, it is possible that such a tax subsidy would divert investment from more productive sectors to the detriment of the productivity of the UK economy as a whole.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.3/2">If Opposition Members are making the case that lower taxes always result in growth in the economy, I would listen with great interest and it would-my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40667" name="John Redwood">the Member for Wokingham (Mr Redwood)</phrase> made this point-be an interesting conversion to supply-side economics. I do believe, however, that the strongest economic case can be made for lower tax rates as a whole, across a broader base, as opposed to targeting some sectors, unless there is a strong case that there is some kind of market failure. We have not yet heard such a case being expressed in a way that we find persuasive, and that is why we decided not to proceed with video games tax relief.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.3/3">That is not to say that we do not wish to support British businesses-far from it; we do. It is vital that we have a strong private sector to drive the recovery, but we must support that growth in the right way. In the emergency Budget, the Government announced a major package of reforms to the business tax regime with the aim of creating the most competitive corporate tax system in the G20.</p>

	<p pid="a.57.0/1">The Minister has twice referred to the concept of market failure. Did not <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40215" name="Stewart Hosie">the hon. Member for Dundee East (Stewart Hosie)</phrase> make a compelling argument when he spoke about the very nature of this market? Perhaps we should be talking not about market failures but about the way in which the video games industry operates and the fact that its nature makes it susceptible to the kind of tax relief that we are looking for. The Minister is understandably, and rightly, sceptical about some of the figures being put out by TIGA, but a multiplier of nine seems pretty high. What level of multiplier would be so unacceptable as to allow this kind of relief to be put in place?</p>

	<p pid="a.57.1/1">The TIGA analysis makes the assumption that everything achieved as a consequence of the relief would be additional to the economy. It does not appear to recognise that there would also be displacement, and that highly skilled graduates would not remain unemployed if they did not find work in the video games industry. We are therefore sceptical about the TIGA analysis. My hon. Friend makes his point well, however, and the nature and profile of the video games business clearly have some significance for his constituency, but we are as yet unconvinced of the necessity for the tax relief that was proposed by the previous Government, and that is proposed in the new clause.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.1/2">The Government's focus must be on providing a strong business environment for sectors across the board, including video games. Our reforms will reduce rates of corporation tax by four percentage points over the next four years, which means that the UK will continue to have the lowest main rate in the G7. This will improve our relative position significantly, compared with that of our competitors, after the years in which we have fallen behind. This will benefit companies across the economy, including those in the video games industry.</p>

	<p pid="a.57.2/1">My party welcomes the reduction in corporation tax; we believe that it is a good thing. However, some of the businesses that are creating video games are not big enough to pay corporation tax. Many of them are dependent on the annual allowances, but some of those have now gone, and one has been halved. So although I welcome the reduced corporation tax, the overall package will not necessarily help the start-up studios and small studios as they develop their games.</p>

	<p pid="a.58.0/1">We have also reduced the small profits rate of corporation tax from 21% to 20%, when it was set to go up to 22%, and we have effectively reversed the jobs tax-the increase in national insurance contributions that would have hurt start-ups. We are also offering start-ups, including those in the hon. Gentleman's constituency, a national insurance contributions holiday for the first 10 employees, so there were plenty of positive policies for start-ups announced at the time of the Budget. Indeed, given the state of the public finances, it was a very pro-business, pro-growth Budget in the way that it set up proposals for lower taxes.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.0/2">On tax simplification, the Office of Tax Simplification earlier today announced the list of reliefs and exemptions within the tax system. When its work began in the summer, the general expectation was that there would be about 400 reliefs and exemptions; the total reached is 1,042 such reliefs and exemptions. Many play an important role within our tax system-I do not wish to decry that-but we have to think carefully about introducing new areas of complexity and new reliefs and exemptions, unless there is a strong case for doing so. Members have already made the case for video games, but the Government remain unconvinced.</p>

	<p pid="a.58.3/1">I thank the Minister for giving way again. He talks about hearing what has been said in the Chamber, but as far as I am aware he has not yet met Richard Wilson of TIGA. Like everyone else who mentions the organisation, I originally referred to it as &quot;Teega&quot; but Mr Wilson continually refers to it as &quot;Tyga&quot;, and I assume that he knows better than I do. I believe the logo resembles a tiger, so there is a connection with the pronunciation there. Will the Minister agree to come to Dundee and I will arrange for Richard Wilson to be there?

	<p pid="a.58.4/1">I am grateful for that invitation. I am sure it will be small comfort to the hon. Gentleman, but I will accept the pronunciation &quot;Tyga&quot; and concede that point. I am not sure that it would be terribly helpful if we were all in the same room to discuss these particular numbers. As I say, we are not convinced by the case made on these numbers. Of course, Members with constituencies that have a concentration of video game companies will want to make that case, but it is right for the Government to look at the economy as a whole and to bring forward policies that benefit all parts of the country and all sectors, including the video game sector. As I said in the meetings I have had with the hon. Member for Dundee West, there is no sense in which the Government are in any way anti-video games or think it is an antisocial issue or anything like that. It is question of economic efficiency and where we believe the role of Government can be best used-and that is in providing a favourable climate for businesses.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.4/2">I appreciate that the new clause and new schedule proposed by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40199" name="David Hanson">the right hon. Member for Delyn (Mr Hanson)</phrase> are probing measures, but I would like to touch on a point made by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40209" name="Charlie Elphicke">the Member for Dover (Charlie Elphicke)</phrase>. This relief is targeted at a specific sector and it would be considered to be state aid; as such, it would require notification to and approval from the European Commission. The new clause and new schedule would be effective from Royal Assent. As the Government would not be able to secure approval in such a short period, the provisions would create an illegal state aid. As I said, I understand that the amending provisions are probing, but the same issue applies to the previous Government's proposals-and they, too, would have required state aid approval, which is worth putting on the record.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.4/3">The new clause would create unjustified distortion and complexity in the corporate tax system. We do not think that such an intervention would represent good value for money for the Exchequer or be conducive to providing a simple and competitive tax system. The UK needs a tax system that supports all businesses, because it is the private sector across the board that will drive the recovery. I therefore ask the right hon. Gentleman to withdraw the new clause and new schedule.</p>

I am disappointed about that. I remind the Minister again of what the Under-Secretary of State for Culture, Olympics, Media and Sport, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40631" name="Edward Vaizey">the hon.

We must ensure that we do not transfer jobs to Canada, France and other countries just because of the impact of our tax regime on the industry, and just because-as has been pointed out-some companies do not qualify for the help that the Government have provided through capital gains tax relief owing to their size.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.0/6">I accept what the Minister has said today, which I interpret as a closed door, but I must tell him that Members, including those with constituency interests, will return to the issue.

	<p pid="a.60.2/1" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.2/2" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">New clause 2 would force the Treasury to come clean on its plans to withdraw child benefit from families with higher-rate taxpayers from January 2013, which will take &#163;2.5 billion a year from those families from 2014-15 onwards.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.2/3">Ever since the Chancellor announced the policy of means-testing child benefit a month ago at the Conservative party conference, the policy has gradually unravelled. The Treasury has struggled to spell out exactly how it will implement the idea-especially as there has rightly been separate and independent taxation of individuals since 1990, when it was recognised that there were major problems with taxing women as though their income were effectively part of their husbands' property. Those days may seem long ago now-it is 20 years since Lady Thatcher left Downing street, and 20 years since Britain joined the exchange rate mechanism-but the Government have adopted a d&#233;j&#224;-vu approach to policy making which looks set to reopen that history.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.2/4">We have grown used to the principle of independent taxation over the past two decades, and many now take it for granted, but we ought to pause and reflect on why it is so important. The Government's proposed changes to child benefit imply a requirement for mothers to disclose their receipt of child benefit to their partners, and a requirement for partners or husbands to be taxed on the income of their spouses. That represents a potential breach of the principle of separate and individual taxation which, as the new clause says, was introduced in the Finance Act 1988, and which applied from 1990 onwards.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.2/5">The 1988 Act introduced a radical change in the system of taxing husbands and wives: independent taxation. Until then, husbands and wives were viewed as one person for tax purposes, and the Revenue, of course, saw only the husband. The spouse's income and gains were added together, and the couple were treated as if the total income were that of the husband. He was responsible for completing the annual tax return and for paying all tax due, including that on his wife's income and gains. However, with the introduction of independent taxation, spouses were treated as separate individuals for tax purposes and for the first time married women enjoyed privacy in, and responsibility for, their own tax affairs. In addition, some married couples were paying more tax because they were married than they would have if they had been cohabiting. That drew much criticism at the time.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.2/6">It is instructive to look back at the speeches advocating the virtues of independent taxation, especially by the then Chief Secretary to the Treasury, who has since been ennobled as Lord Lamont. In the 1988 Budget debate he called this reform</p>
	<p pid="a.60.2/7" class="indent">&quot;a radical proposal for independent taxation...It will give married women the independence and privacy in tax matters that they have been denied for so long...Under the new system, a married woman will be treated as a taxpayer in her own right with a full personal allowance to set against her income, and her own basic rate band. She will have responsibility for her own tax matters and will be able to enjoy complete privacy if she wishes...It is an important principle that there should be independence and privacy in taxation matters.&quot;-[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/1988-03-16.1193"><i> Official Report</i>, 16 March 1988; Vol. 129, c. 1193-94</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.60.2/8">Clearly the Prime Minister should heed the words of his former boss in these matters. I gather that Lord Lamont is still occasionally called upon to give advice to his former special adviser. Perhaps their diaries clashed on the day of the fateful decision on child benefit, but there is still time for the Prime Minister to make that call to Lord Lamont, and to see the error of his ways and rein in his doctrinaire Chancellor on this issue, especially as the Prime Minister promised before the general election to protect child benefit. Winding the clock back 20 years and reversing decades of progress in equality in taxation and in the responsibilities of individuals for their own income risks creating a set of major perversities in the tax system that could have significant ramifications. That is why the Opposition are opposed to the changes in child benefit.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.2/9">Let us consider the administrative shambles that would be created if the Government were to get their way. <i> The </i><i> Wall Street Journal </i>has reported insiders in the civil service talking of &quot;panic stations&quot; at the Treasury with growing acceptance that the policy is virtually &quot;unenforceable&quot; and &quot;likely to be ditched&quot;. If a mother is under no legal obligation to tell the father that she is in receipt of child benefit-unless we do see the end of independent taxation, of course-how can this tax on families work? Currently, the father's tax status is irrelevant to the mother's entitlement to child benefit. Can the Minister tell the House how this clawback arrangement will work, especially if parents are divorced or divorcing or separated or separating, or if the mother simply declines to report the tax status of the father of her children to Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs officials.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.2/10">Can the Minister also tell us whether the rumour that the Treasury is considering a new database to match mothers with their partners is true, and would that not make the Child Support Agency seem a bit like a pocket calculator by comparison? Will the Minister spell out the mechanisms the Treasury envisages in respect of this policy, and the enforcement mechanisms it is planning to put in place to take these sums off families earning approximately &#163;45,000 or above? Will the Treasury be relying on a self-certification approach by the partner not in receipt of child benefit? Will the Minister take this opportunity to state for the record that the Government will continue with the important principle that mothers should be the primary recipient of child benefit payments?</p>
	<p pid="a.60.2/11">The poor design of this policy could easily undermine revenue plans too. Clawing back the cost of the benefit from higher rate taxpayers through the tax system would be &quot;intrusive&quot; and involve lots of form filling. That is the opinion of one of the Chancellor's own advisers on tax policy, John Whiting, who the Chancellor recently appointed as the tax director of the Office of Tax Simplification. Mr Whiting suggests that the policy would be an administrative burden that would merely &quot;make a dent&quot; in the estimated &#163;2.5 billion of savings the Treasury claims the change would bring. We are not alone in questioning the logic of this ill-thought-through proposal, therefore. We know from the reporting on this policy that the Chancellor rode roughshod over his Cabinet colleagues when it was announced at the Conservative party conference. Clearly many in the Cabinet were oblivious to those plans when the Chancellor sprung them on them, but it is now clear that he also rode roughshod over those in the civil service. They were insufficiently included in the plans for this policy and had he consulted them properly, they would have pointed out the chaos that it would create.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.2/12">These are serious matters affecting millions of families across the UK, not only millionaires such as the Chancellor's family or the Prime Minister's family, but those on relatively modest incomes. They include police officers, college tutors, health service workers, senior teachers, pharmacists, paramedics, train drivers and air traffic controllers. Many are caught up in this category, the arbitrary design of which will create great unfairness with punitively high marginal rates of taxation.</p>

	<p pid="a.62.1/1">The hon. Gentleman is doing his job, supporting a policy that was not the one espoused in his party's manifesto. It certainly was not the policy that the Prime Minister advocated before the election when he promised to protect universal child benefit-he now says that it should be taken away from these &quot;rich&quot; individuals, but I do not agree. I do not believe that this class of middle-income families is necessarily finding life easy on this particular range of salaries. We have to speak up for that squeezed middle in society and that is absolutely what the Opposition intend to do. Where a policy could see a &#163;1 pay rise for these families result in the loss of &#163;2,000 in child benefit, depending on the number of children involved, it involves a punitively high rate of marginal taxation that surely even Members on the Government Benches would agree is flawed.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/2">At last week's Treasury Committee sitting, the director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, Mike Brewer, described these cliff-edge issues as &quot;economically perverse&quot; and &quot;distorting&quot;. He also said that it &quot;seems unfair&quot; that two families in different circumstances but perhaps separated by very small sums should be &quot;treated so differently&quot;. His colleague, Carl Emmerson, added:</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/3" class="indent">&quot;The income tax system, by being individually based, is basically neutral about whether individuals&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/4">should be taxed separately or together and that that is an &quot;advantage&quot; in the tax system.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/5">My right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition has rightly asked,</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/6" class="indent">&quot;why should a family on &#163;45,000 where one person stays at home lose their child benefit-&#163;1,000, 2,000, &#163;3,000 a year-but a family on &#163;80,000 where both partners... are working should keep their child benefit?&quot;-[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2010-10-13.322"><i> Official Report</i>, 13 October 2010; Vol. 516, c. 322-23</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/7">Even the Treasury has, begrudgingly, had to publish some statistics showing that this policy would create all sorts of anomalies and odd behaviour. It published a figure in the Budget suggesting that it expected to lose &#163;270 million each year in revenue from people tax planning as they navigated this madness.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/8">A family with three children on &#163;33,000 a year after tax is to lose &#163;2,500 from 2013-that is the equivalent of a 6p in the pound hike in their income tax. Middle-class families are being hit, and it is particularly pernicious of the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats to focus on children in this way as a means of raising money-they are clubbing families over the head with a higher tax burden while, of course, letting the banks off the hook. At the very least the Treasury should accept the new clause and agree to publish an independent review of the consequences for independent taxation if its plans for child benefit taxation of higher rate paying family members are to proceed.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2010-11-08a.63.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40336" speakername="Chris Evans" colnum="63"  time="017:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm101108/debtext/101108-0002.htm#10110810001336">
	<p pid="a.63.0/1">The conflicting press reports on this policy that we have seen over the last couple of months mean that the Government must explain their plans to withdraw child benefit. Like many commentators and Members of this House, I am deeply concerned by proposals that will see a lone parent or single-earner couple earning just above the higher rate threshold lose their child benefit while a dual-earner couple both earning just under the threshold would continue to receive it.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.0/2">The reform could also distort incentives for those with incomes around the higher tax threshold. As I understand it, those earning above the 40% tax bracket will no longer receive child benefit for their children-that bracket is currently about &#163;44,000. The system is complicated by the fact that that rule applies to single wage earners. If both parents earned, say, &#163;42,000-or &#163;84,000 between them-their family would continue to receive child benefit.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.0/3">The Treasury has a duty tonight to explain how its plans to withdraw child benefit from families with a higher rate taxpayer could work in practice. Some tax experts have said that ending child benefit payments to couples with one higher rate taxpayer earning more than &#163;43,875 a year is unenforceable. The method of recovery will require taxpayers to submit annual paperwork, new HMRC tax codes and a change in the law to cover parents who separate or live apart.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.0/4">Higher rate taxpayers will need to tick an honesty box on their tax return, stating whether they or their partner have received child benefit in the past year and it is said that they will be fined if the information provided is incorrect. According to press reports, taxpayers might face fines if they fail to disclose whether their household received child benefit. On <phrase class="date" code="2010-10-29">29 October 2010</phrase>, the <i> Financial Times</i> stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.63.0/5" class="indent">&quot;From 2013, higher-rate taxpayers in the self-assessment system will be required to tick a box declaring that their household claims child benefit. They will then pay a higher rate of tax corresponding to the level of benefit, which is worth &#163;1,700 to a couple with two children.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.0/6" class="indent">Those on the pay-as-you-earn tax system will be asked in a letter to disclose if their household claims the benefit-a declaration that will put them into a different tax code. The benefit would then be deducted in the next tax year, in an 'end-year adjustment' similar to that in the tax credit system.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.63.0/7">We have seen the problems that that has caused over the past couple of years. The article went on:</p>
	<p pid="a.63.0/8" class="indent">&quot;Legislation to implement the changes will include laws setting out what will happen to the benefit if parents split up, remarry or share custody.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.63.0/9">To me, it is not clear how a system based on an end-year adjustment would cope with in-year changes in circumstances such as the birth of a child, a partner moving out or a new partner moving in. It is also unclear what a household will constitute for these purposes. As I have said, parents who earn &#163;42,000 each would keep the benefit-worth &#163;1,752 a year for a couple with two children-whereas a family relying on one income of &#163;44,000 would lose out. Someone with children on a &#163;42,000 salary would be better off than someone on a &#163;45,000 salary, as they could keep all their child benefit.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.0/10">At present, there are no definitions of &quot;household&quot; in either tax or child benefit law. Defining a couple is not easy, particularly if a couple split up. He might be a higher rate taxpayer while she is the carer for the children-or, with equality fresh in the mind, she could be a higher rate taxpayer while he is the carer for the children. When they part, she could claim child benefit as she has little other income, but if the rules treat them as still part of the same household-perhaps they have split up but are still living together-she could lose her child benefit, or even have to pay back whatever she has received.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.0/11">We already knew that the plans were unfair, but what has been increasingly clear is that they simply have not been thought through. We do not even know if the provisions on independent taxation will be repealed. If mothers are under no legal obligation to tell fathers that they are in receipt of child benefit, how can this tax on families work? The policy will simply create more work; there will have to be a lot of checking up. People will have to put a lot of effort in to get it and to make sure they are getting the right amount.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.0/12">We are now seeing significant confusion about what the policy means in practice. Quite simply, it is creating more questions than answers. In the June emergency Budget, it was announced that the income tax personal allowance will rise by &#163;1,000 to &#163;7,475 from April 2011. However, the 20% tax band is being squeezed so as not to benefit higher rate taxpayers: whereas the 40% tax band currently starts at &#163;43,875, with no tax on the first &#163;6,475 and 20% on the next &#163;37,400, that will change from April next year. At that point, the 40% tax bracket will start at &#163;42,375, with a personal tax allowance of &#163;7,475 and a reduced &#163;34,900 tax band of 20%. Does that mean that people could lose child benefit even if they earn less than &#163;44,000 from April next year? If that is the case, an additional 800,000 wage earners will be brought into the higher rate tax band from next April, which makes a mockery of the Government's claims to be on the side of hard-working families. If tax allowances remain as planned, those earning more than &#163;42,375 will be denied child benefit. The Government must answer these questions ahead of April 2011.</p>

	<p pid="a.65.0/1">Let me make three very quick points, parts of which will pick up on comments that have already been made.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.0/2">The first point is the issue of declaration. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40460" name="Christopher Leslie">the Member for Nottingham East (Chris Leslie)</phrase> mentioned last week's Treasury Committee hearing, during which I asked the Chief Secretary to the Treasury how he intended to enforce the new child benefit measure. He said that the coalition Government will introduce legislation to require higher rate taxpayers to declare whether child benefit is coming into the household. Such a declaration is partly dependent on information being passed from one partner to the other. The Chief Secretary was very clear that the obligation to provide the information will be on the higher rate taxpayer. Why not also introduce a requirement in respect of the other half of the couple? As the Chief Secretary did not answer that, will the Minister now shed some light on it and reveal whether the Treasury has taken proper legal advice? <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40209" name="Charlie Elphicke">The hon. Member for Dover (Charlie Elphicke)</phrase>, a former tax lawyer, is in the Chamber. I wonder whether he advised his colleagues.</p>

	<p pid="a.65.1/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for his kind words. As a lawyer, I might be very cautions, but as someone who has been in a relationship and who has found that couples tend to talk, I will ask the hon. Gentleman whether he is aware of any couples with children who do not share their financial information?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2010-11-08a.65.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40588" speakername="Chuka Umunna" colnum="65"  time="017:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm101108/debtext/101108-0002.htm#10110810001339">
	<p pid="a.65.2/1">I do not usually ask my friends and acquaintances whether they share financial information with their partners, but I hear the comments of the hon. Gentleman.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.2/2">My second point is, how will it be possible to prove the connection between the mother and the higher rate taxpayer, bearing in mind the problems that we have been having at Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs? Given that HMRC's resources have been cut over the past few years, how will it be able to keep tabs on the situation between couples on a monthly basis? As some 1.2 million families will be affected by the new measure, will HMRC be given any more funding to enable it to enforce the new change and to keep tabs on what is happening out there in the nation?</p>
	<p pid="a.65.2/3">Finally, John Whiting, joint interim head of the Office of Tax Simplification, has obviously commented on the problems of the new measure, but what is the point in setting up such an office when the people working within it and those heading it up have not been properly consulted or asked to advise on this measure? Surely, if the Government are not minded to accept this new clause, it would be a good idea to delay the introduction of this measure and ask the Office of Tax Simplification to do its job and advise on how it can be more efficiently introduced.</p>

	<p pid="a.66.0/1">My hon. Friend makes a powerful case to look again at the detail. Does he agree that if the objective was to be fair and to put the burden on to the broadest shoulders, surely it would have been better to raise the marginal rate of tax from 40% to 41% , so that the people who have more pay more, and not just clobber people with children, who now have to pay more for their children. Those are couples, only one of whom might be working, where the 40% does not signal the best-off households.</p>

	<p pid="a.66.1/1">No doubt the Government will consider my hon. Friend's interesting suggestion and comment accordingly.</p>
	<p pid="a.66.1/2">One of the main problems with the new measure is that people fall off a cliff edge when they hit the higher rate. Have the Government considered introducing a taper mechanism to prevent that anomaly from occurring, because obviously that is where the unfairness shines through?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2010-11-08a.66.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40559" speakername="David Gauke" colnum="66"  time="017:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm101108/debtext/101108-0002.htm#10110810001342">
	<p pid="a.66.2/1">The new clause would link the future withdrawal of child benefit from higher rate taxpayers with the principle of independent taxation. The payment of child benefit is clearly a spending issue and is not directly linked to the Bill. I therefore shall not try your patience, Madam Deputy Speaker, but it is important to set out the background to the change.</p>
	<p pid="a.66.2/2">The spending review set out how the Government will tackle the deficit that they inherited from the previous Administration. Given the comments that have been made by the Leader of the Opposition-I congratulate him on becoming the recipient of another child benefit payment, and wish him and his family well-as well as by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40460" name="Christopher Leslie">the hon. Member for Nottingham East (Chris Leslie)</phrase> and several other Labour Members today, I take it that the Labour party remains opposed in principle to our reform of child benefit and believes that it should continue to be paid to all households.</p>

	<p pid="a.66.3/1">Does the Minister agree that this is a case of reforming in haste and repenting at leisure? However tempting it might be to put in place something that sounds simple in principle, the complexity of the proposal should have been examined. The Government could have acted differently, such as by making child benefit part of taxable income. I do not necessarily suggest that that would be the best solution, but it would mean that several issues around independent taxation would not apply. If the Government wish to reduce child benefit to some households, there are other ways of doing it.</p>

	<p pid="a.66.4/1">I take the hon. Lady's point, but I am not clear about whether her party's position is to say, &quot;Something should be done, but we don't like the way it's being done,&quot; which, I think, is the position that she sets out, or to say, &quot;We don't think anything should be done at all,&quot; in which case we must include the &#163;2.5 billion that the measure will save the Exchequer-that is an estimate from the Office for Budget Responsibility-as part of our assessment of the Opposition's fiscal policies.</p>

	<p pid="a.67.0/1">The Minister cites savings of &#163;2.5 billion, but will he estimate the likely cost of administering the new policy, which will have an impact on those savings? John Whiting has said that the extra burden associated with administering the change in the way it is envisaged will make a fairly big dent in the expected savings.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2010-11-08a.67.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40559" speakername="David Gauke" colnum="67"  time="017:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm101108/debtext/101108-0002.htm#10110810001346">
	<p pid="a.67.1/1">The hon. Gentleman asks a fair question, but I will not give him a precise number because that is something that we continue to consider. The implementation of any policy clearly involves a cost, but I assure him that this cost will be small when compared with &#163;2.5 billion. I am keen to ensure that the policy does not place an undue burden on HMRC. He made a fair point about HMRC. It faces a budget reduction, even though the Government are protecting it by ensuring that it has more resources to tackle evasion and avoidance, but we are keen to ensure that the burden of administering the policy will not cause it undue difficulty.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.1/2">We have to take tough decisions and make tough choices, and this is one of the decisions that the Government have taken because we believe it is the right thing to do. We do not think it is fair to tax people on low incomes to pay for the child benefit of those earning much more. We cannot afford to continue providing financial support through child benefit to better-off households where there is a higher rate taxpayer. From January 2013, the Government will therefore withdraw child benefit from families that contain a higher rate taxpayer. Despite the noises from the Opposition, the British people understand that this is a tough, but fair, decision.</p>

	<p pid="a.67.2/1">Can the Minister explain why the proposal to tax higher rate taxpayers in that way was made and announced before the comprehensive spending review? I put it to him that the reason for that was to warm up the audience and to make out that the comprehensive spending review would be fair and balanced, as opposed to the IFS's conclusion that it hit the poor two and a half times as much as it hit the rich. Was not the timing of the announcement entirely cynical?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2010-11-08a.67.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40559" speakername="David Gauke" colnum="67"  time="017:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm101108/debtext/101108-0002.htm#10110810001348">
	<p pid="a.67.3/1">The policy underlines the fact that the Government are looking to address our deficit in a way that is fair, and to ensure that all parts of society play their part and those with the broadest shoulders make the biggest contribution. That is what we are doing. It is remarkable that it is Opposition Members who appear to be trying to prevent that happening, though I am not sure whether they object to the way in which it is being done or whether they intend to fight in the last ditch to defend the principle of universality as it applies to child benefit.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.3/2">We wanted to avoid creating a complex new means test for household income. To do so would fundamentally change the nature of child benefit and come at a significant cost to the taxpayer. This policy has therefore been designed to avoid affecting the vast majority of the population-some 80%-who are basic rate taxpayers. It also avoids additional systems being developed, as the measure can be delivered within existing pay-as-you-earn and self-assessment systems.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.3/3">Let me deal with the issue behind the new clause-the principle of independent taxation, which was introduced in the Finance Act 1988. It is a great pleasure to hear Opposition Members applauding the 1988 Budget. If I remember rightly, proceedings in this place at the time were interrupted as the Chancellor of the Exchequer was shouted down by some Opposition Members. Section 32 abolished the provision that a wife's income was income of her husband for income tax purposes. That remains the case, and none of the proposed changes to child benefit alters it.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.3/4">Child benefit is provided for a child within a family and it is therefore necessary to consider the family as a group. The policy merely withdraws child benefit from a family to whom it is difficult to justify paying it. Furthermore, the withdrawal of child benefit from families containing a higher rate taxpayer will not affect the personal allowance or rate band applicable to an individual. The changes apply a simple test to ensure that child benefit is not provided to those who need it the least.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.3/5">Of course, the House will have the full opportunity to debate the changes to child benefit when they are legislated, ahead of implementation in January 2013. That would be a better time to discuss the various specific issues that have been raised in the course of the debate. Although I understand that Opposition Members may wish to draw a link between child benefit and independent taxation in order to have this debate today, it is clear that the two systems remain separate and independent.</p>

	<p pid="a.68.0/1">I am trying to follow the Minister's logic. Does HMRC envisage child benefit continuing to be paid to all mothers, but that higher rate taxpayers will have a sum equivalent to child benefit deducted from their income, on top of taxes?</p>

	<p pid="a.68.1/1">The hon. Gentleman, who has been somewhat ingenious in tabling the new clause, again seeks to draw me into a wider debate about the implementation of child benefit. He sets out one way in which it could work; in other circumstances, claimants might seek to stop receiving child benefit. However, I must stress that, although he has been somewhat ingenious in raising the issue in the context of the Finance (No.2) Bill, the new clause has nothing to do with independent taxation, so I ask him to withdraw it.</p>

	<p pid="a.68.2/1">I am astonished by the Minister's blinkered approach in sticking to the robotic text, &quot;This has absolutely nothing to do with independent taxation,&quot; when it patently does. If a higher rate taxpayer is being asked to pay for income that their partner or spouse receives, that clearly breaches the principle of independent taxation. The hon. Gentleman would not be drawn into the mechanism by which the scheme would be set up, but, given the great fanfare with which the policy was announced at the Conservative party conference, I would have thought that by now the panic stations at the Treasury might surely have subsided, and that he would be able to share with the House exactly how the measure would work.</p>
	<p pid="a.68.2/2">I am glad that the hon. Gentleman congratulated my right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition on the arrival of his new baby. May I, too, add my congratulations to my right hon. Friend? It reminds me that I should have possibly declared an interest in child benefit at the beginning of the debate, but there may be a sufficient quantum of participants to make that unnecessary.</p>
	<p pid="a.68.2/3">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40336" name="Chris Evans">the Member for Islwyn (Chris Evans)</phrase> was right to describe the chaos involved in the measure. He asked, will tax circumstances be adjusted for in-year changes in circumstance? The answer is no, unless of course a child happens to be born at the very beginning of the tax year, but perhaps that is part of the Government's plan: children will be able to be born only at certain parts of the year, or by quarter, so that HMRC is able to apply the tax rules with administrative ease.</p>
	<p pid="a.68.2/4">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40588" name="Chuka Umunna">the Member for Streatham (Mr Umunna)</phrase> pointed out the Government's sketchy plans in relying on a declaration by the higher rate taxpayer in order to disclose about child benefit something of which, of course, they may or may not be aware. The fact that the Office for Tax Simplification-again, much vaunted when it was established-does not seem to have been consulted or involved leads me to suspect that the OTS may well have been set up for the benefit of high net-worth individuals, rather than to simplify the tax arrangements of ordinary taxpayers.</p>
	<p pid="a.68.2/5">The Minister has failed to set out how the child benefit taxation arrangement will work. There are hundreds of thousands of families throughout the country hanging on his words and trying to find out how on earth the scheme will be arranged, particularly given the perversity that will be introduced through the high marginal rate of taxation. Do not let us forget that that extra pound could result in an individual losing &#163;2,000 in child benefit.</p>

	<p pid="a.69.0/1">In my constituency, my hon. Friend's constituency and throughout the country, there are women who do not earn any money but live in a household with a partner, receive child benefit and spend the money on their children. In the light of their uncertainty about the future, given what we all know about the divorce rates, those women are critically concerned that the hand of government will suddenly come in and snatch that money from them or their children because of what the man earns. The Bill is clearly an infringement of independent taxation and an attack on children and mothers.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2010-11-08a.69.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40460" speakername="Christopher Leslie" colnum="69"  time="017:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm101108/debtext/101108-0002.htm#10110810001353">
	<p pid="a.69.1/1">My hon. Friend highlights the fact that I cannot see this being the end of the matter. The Minister suggests that the measure is part of the Government's carefully calculated spending commitments, but I do not think that they will continue with the plan. There are so many anomalies and problems in its design and operation that they clearly did not think it through properly. They might have looked at the ready reckoner, saying &quot;Oh yes&quot; as they licked their lips at the &#163;2.5 billion that they could take from families, and went straight to the first day of the Conservative party conference to announce their proposal, but it is unravelling by the moment.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.1/2">The Institute for Fiscal Studies and others are starting to highlight the economic perversities and distorting effect of this measure. Even the sole issue of independent taxation is sufficient to hole below the waterline the Government's plans to tax child benefit. I therefore hope that we can divide the House on the new clause.</p>

	<p pid="a.74.0/1" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.0/2" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">This is a short new clause, which stands in my name and those of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40122" name="Kerry McCarthy">the Member for Bristol East (Kerry McCarthy)</phrase> and my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40199" name="David Hanson">the Member for Delyn (Mr Hanson)</phrase>. It might be naive of me to expect that the promises made by the Prime Minister in opposition still hold good today, but this debate is necessary because of his rhetoric then, when he said that</p>
	<p pid="a.74.0/3" class="indent">&quot;there should be a day of reckoning&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.74.0/4">for the banks-</p>
	<p pid="a.74.0/5" class="indent">&quot;A day when we would not flinch from spelling out the rightful consequences of irresponsible behaviour...this is a question of fairness...on behalf of working families&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.0/6">He continued:</p>
	<p pid="a.74.0/7" class="indent">&quot;we show clearly that...there is not one rule for the rich and a different rule for everybody else.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.74.0/8">Those are the words of the Prime Minister-before the last general election, of course. Time has moved on, the ministerial cars have become very comfortable, but the Treasury has barely lifted a finger to fulfil the promises to reform the tax regime in which the major banks operate. Perhaps that is a convenient state of affairs for the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats as they desperately try to shift attention from the banks' culpability for the state we are in, but there is still an urgent need to take stock of their contribution to repairing the public purse and to see decisions taken that might help to alleviate the looming crisis of public service redundancies and cutbacks.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.0/9">The Chancellor's spending review, to which the Opposition obviously take great exception, is based on the pretext that &quot;There is no alternative&quot;. In other words, anyone who even dares to murmur that there is any other course of action is somehow using flawed, unreasonable or unrealistic logic. That not only insults the intelligence of the public at large, but is profoundly short-sighted, as there are a great many alternative strategies that the Government should be considering. However, they insist that there is no plan B.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.0/10">The new clause would shed further light on the facts behind the claim that there are no alternative revenues that could alleviate the burden of service and welfare cuts, which will fall heaviest, as we know, on middle-income families and some of the poorest adults and children in this country. We surely owe it to those people-our constituents-to try harder to find ways to close the tax gap, to create growth and new jobs, to generate new income and to bear down on the tax avoidance that costs billions of pounds each year.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.0/11">Let us remember why we have the budget deficit. Contrary to the spinology that we will no doubt get from Government Members, who are obviously desperate to politicise the deficit in the hope of providing cover for their ideological scaling-back of public investment, our national debt was caused primarily not by a spending spree, as they claim, but by a dramatic collapse in revenues to the Treasury from income tax, VAT and corporation tax as a result of the global credit crunch and recession. The &#163;132 billion rise in the deficit in the last financial year was, yes, partly the result of &#163;53 billion in extra social protection expenditure, which was necessary, for example, for unemployment benefits. More importantly, however, there was the &#163;79 billion decrease in revenues. It is that collapse in revenues, which was compounded by the need to spend billions shoring up the banking system and preventing its collapse, that the Conservative party consistently and mysteriously want to overlook.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.0/12">Let us remind ourselves of the banking bail-out, because significant sums were spent, and had to be spent, on it. Those sums included &#163;76 billion to purchase shares in the Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group, &#163;200 billion to indemnify the Bank of England against losses occurred in providing liquidity support, &#163;250 billion to guarantee banks' wholesale borrowing and strengthen liquidity in the banking system, &#163;40 billion to provide loans and other funding to Bradford &amp; Bingley and the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, and &#163;280 billion agreed in principle to provide insurance for a selection of banking assets. All in all, it was the credit crunch, as we know, that led to the banking crisis and the recession. It is those things, not the public service inflation on which the Conservative party is completely fixated, that were the underpinning factors fuelling the deficit.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.0/13">The banks owe taxpayers a massive debt of gratitude-that much is clear. They would have gone bust were it not for the deficit facility that we are now grappling with. My constituents are therefore repeatedly asking one simple question: will the banks be made to pay their fair share, getting us out of the deficit that they helped to create because of their business mistakes? Before the election, the Prime Minister gave every impression that that would be so, but so far very little action has been taken.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.0/14">I do not want to penalise the banking sector to the point of annihilation; nobody wants our economy's financial services sector to fail further. Indeed, it should be resurrected in a more sustainable, diverse and healthy form for the future. However, when the Government are raising VAT on the rest of us, cutting police budgets, for example, by 20%, severely squeezing students and those on housing benefit, and forcing the closure of fire services, libraries and community services-the list goes on and on-we should surely examine more closely the level of taxation that the banks are paying. That is the point of new clause 3.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.0/15">The Government say that the banking levy is the answer-that is what we will hear from Ministers tonight-but let us explore that point. Although the banking levy is in principle welcome, it is now patently obvious that it has been set at a woefully inadequate level. When the Chancellor unveiled it in the June Budget, it was greeted with relief in the City, which had been bracing itself for a hit of about &#163;5 billion a year. The eventual 0.07% tax that the big UK banks will pay on their assets is less than half the rate envisaged in the United States when it was planning to implement a parallel scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.0/16">Most City experts know that, in reality, the banks are getting off quite lightly. Citigroup estimated that Lloyds could pay a levy of only about &#163;268 million in 2012, compared with &#163;292 million for RBS and &#163;368 million for Barclays, and that for HSBC the levy for the same year could be &#163;311 million. Deutsche Bank analysts said that the Budget was &quot;a good outcome&quot; for the banks, and a City insider was quoted in the <i> Daily Mail</i> as saying:</p>
	<p pid="a.74.0/17" class="indent">&quot;Privately, some banks will have a feeling of glee at the way this has worked out. But none would be stupid enough to say anything openly.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.74.0/18">HSBC's banking analyst said:</p>
	<p pid="a.74.0/19" class="indent">&quot;We'd expect most domestically-orientated banks, for example Lloyds, to be better off after four years than they were pre-budget&quot;.</p>

	<p pid="a.76.0/1">This is interesting. I have seen many of these quotes before, and I am certainly minded to support the new clause, if the hon. Gentleman pushes it to a vote. An examination of the level of tax on banking is sensible, but I would like to know what the Labour party proposes for the level of taxation, given that every billion out of the banks is about &#163;10 million to &#163;15 million less to lend in the real economy. I am curious, therefore, to find out how punitive the Labour party would be.</p>

	<p pid="a.76.1/1">I accept the hon. Gentleman's point. We have to be prudent in how we address these questions, and I hope to come to some of the matters he raises as we explore corporation tax and so on. If he bears with me, I will-hopefully-elaborate.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.1/2">UBS analysts said that they expected Lloyds and HSBC to benefit by 2012 because of the cut in corporation tax bills, which in their case was larger than the hit they expected to be sustained through the banking levy. It seems, therefore, that the banking levy is playing quite a small part, perhaps a walk-on character-</p>

	<p pid="a.76.4/1">I would like to put a couple of points to the hon. Gentleman. First, taking the case of Lloyds and RBS, are there not likely to be substantial carry-forward losses in those banks, which will not be paying corporation tax for many years to come, let alone by 2012? Secondly, were they then to face a higher rate of tax, which I believe he is proposing, would the cost on those banks not result in the devaluation of their shares, which are now owned by the public? Surely, it would go round in a circle.</p>

	<p pid="a.76.5/1">I will come to deferred tax in a moment, because the corporation tax questions require much greater scrutiny. That is one reason we tabled the new clause. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will join me in the Lobby, should we divide on this issue-unless the Treasury concede it-and that he agrees that we should have a review of the level of tax the banks are paying. If they are paying too much, which I doubt, I will be happy to look at the evidence and the facts. However, there is opacity about these questions, and given the hit falling on the shoulders of families and children in this country, it is incumbent on us to ask whether the banks will be paying their fair share. That is all we are asking this evening.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.5/2">We think that the Government's banking levy has been a limp effort so far. Given some of the corporation tax changes, there is a bit of a cashback arrangement for some of the banks. I would like to touch on three areas of corporation tax that I think require more serious and rigorous review. The first is that cashback boost for the banks resulting from the reduction in corporation tax rates announced in the Budget. The Exchequer Secretary confirmed in a written answer that over the lifetime of the spending review the Treasury expects that the cut in corporation tax main rate from 28% to 27%, and eventually down to 24%, will return &#163;1 billion to the banks-specifically to the banks:</p>

	<p pid="a.77.0/1">It is dangerous to intervene given that I do not have the answer to which the hon.

	<p pid="a.77.1/1">It might well be that in that written answer<i> </i>the Exchequer Secretary's definition of &quot;financial services&quot; extends slightly beyond the banks. I am happy to concede that point. Of course, we framed the new clause in order to explore the tax burden not just on the banks but on financial services more widely. However, even the hon. Gentleman would have to concede that the banks will probably be the principal beneficiaries of the corporation tax cut that he is choosing to give them at a time when he is taking money from young, pregnant mothers-the health in pregnancy grant, to name one example of an incongruous decision that might be questioned by our constituents.</p>

I will give way to her if she has to hand the precise figures on what the UK banks will be gaining from the corporation tax cut. Can she tell us what those figures are? If not, I will table a written question. If she can swiftly answer that, it will be for the benefit of the House. I am pretty sure that it will be a net gain for the banks.</p>

	<p pid="a.77.6/1">Let me deal with this directly. The Treasury and Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs figures that we have look at hits by sector-in this case, the financial services sector, which includes not only banking but insurance and financial auxiliary services. The hon. Gentleman quoted his figures and suggested that they represent a net gain. In fact, by the time we get to 2014-15, the bank levy will be &#163;2.4 billion. At the same time, the corporation tax cuts in 2014-15 will benefit the financial services sector by &#163;0.4 billion. However we divide &#163;0.4 billion, it is hard to see how it will ever be higher than &#163;2.4 billion.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2010-11-08a.78.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40460" speakername="Christopher Leslie" colnum="78"  time="018:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm101108/debtext/101108-0002.htm#10110828000715">
	<p pid="a.78.0/1">Were those the only two relevant factors, that might be the case, but of course they are not. There are other tax changes through which the banks will more than benefit from the arrangements. If the Exchequer Secretary had had the patience to wait, I would have elaborated on that. I will come to that quicker.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.0/2">It is important that the Exchequer Secretary listens to those experts who have talked about the benefit to the banks from the corporation tax change. Lloyds Banking Group plc could gain more from a cut in corporation tax than it loses under the new banking levy, according to analysts at Redburn Partners legal practice. Lloyds, 41% of which is owned by the British Government, might see a 3% rise in its earnings per share in 2012 as corporation tax begins to fall to 24% from 28% over those four years, according to Redburn analyst, Jon Kirk. There will therefore be a net positive for Lloyds. That is one example of a net gain for the banks.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.0/3">Secondly, the banks have already found a way of minimising their corporation tax liabilities. A report published only last week by the TUC on the corporation tax gap showed a gap between the headline rate of corporation tax paid and the actual or effective rate of corporation tax paid. The TUC's analysis of data on UK corporate returns showed that the larger a company is, the better it tends to be at reducing its effective rate of corporation tax, which fell from 28% in 2000, when the headline rate was 30%, to about 23% in 2009, when the headline rate was 28%. On that basis, the TUC's economists predict that by 2014, the largest companies will be paying corporation tax at a rate of no more than 17% on average, while small companies will still be paying corporation tax at 20% or more.</p>

	<p pid="a.78.1/1">The hon. Gentleman will know that there are all sorts of reasons why the headline rate of corporation tax may not reflect the rate of corporation tax that is actually paid, which are to do with credits for R and D, and all sorts of things. He keeps quoting what the TUC report says about larger companies, but what does it say about the banking sector?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2010-11-08a.78.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40460" speakername="Christopher Leslie" colnum="78"  time="018:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm101108/debtext/101108-0002.htm#10110828000717">
	<p pid="a.78.2/1">The TUC says that the effective rate of corporation tax for the banks will fall from 25% in 2000 to below 20% this year, which means that, in reality, they are already paying a rate that is below the headline rate that small firms pay. Those findings are certainly eye-catching. All I am saying in new clause 3 is that they merit further review and consideration, which would be a reasonable step to take. Indeed, those findings suggest that we could even be heading towards a regressive corporation tax system in the UK. Small businesses should be paying less in corporation tax than the banks, but the evidence suggests that that might not be the case.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.2/2">The third wheeze that the banks might benefit from, in their navigation of the corporation tax system, is known as deferred tax, which can be defined as the tax liability that might be payable at some point in the future because of transactions that have already taken place, albeit where there is no certainty about when it will have to be paid. Deferring the payment of tax is not something that ordinary taxpayers can indulge in with great ease, yet it appears that the banks are playing that game on a gargantuan scale, according to the findings of Richard Murphy, the director of Tax Research LLP. He suggests in his recent report that the banks' deferral of tax reserves are absolutely phenomenal. He calculates that a sum totalling nearly &#163;19 billion, which is nearly half what this country spends on capital projects annually, might not be paid by the banks in corporation tax as a result. He describes that as</p>
	<p pid="a.78.2/3" class="indent">&quot;an extraordinary double subsidy going on for these banks.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.78.2/4">Not only were the banks underpinned by the taxpayer in 2008-they are still underpinned in the form of the guarantees offered by the Treasury-but they may receive another fillip, he argues, from that deferred corporation tax gain.</p>

	<p pid="a.79.0/1">Unless my memory is playing tricks on me, at least one of the nationalised banks used those unused or deferred tax assets to pay for the asset protection scheme, which was set up-rightly-by the Labour Government in the previous Parliament. Without those unused tax assets or that deferred tax, the asset protection scheme would not have been possible, thereby imposing an even bigger burden on the banks, so I am not quite sure where he is going with this.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2010-11-08a.79.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40460" speakername="Christopher Leslie" colnum="79"  time="018:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm101108/debtext/101108-0002.htm#10110828000719">
	<p pid="a.79.1/1">I am not making any particular proposals at this point; I am simply saying in new clause 3 that we should review the level of tax that banks are paying. There may be perfectly good and justified reasons for it, but we are talking about enormous sums of money. If, as some allege, the banks are playing a canny game, with sums of money that might have prevented many of the swingeing cuts that we are seeing to public services, it is incumbent on us, on behalf of our constituents, to ask those questions. If we are indeed &quot;all in it together&quot;, as we are constantly told, we should ensure that the banks pay their fair share and do not leave the rest of us picking up all the bills.</p>
	<p pid="a.79.1/2">Banker bonus season is around the corner. It seems rather than showing restraint, the bankers may be showing a return to form. Last week, Deutsche bank reported its third quarter results, saying that it had set aside &#163;4 billion in the bonus pool for its corporate and investment bank over the first nine months, amounting to around &#8364;285,000 per employee. According to the financial services recruitment firm Astbury Marsden, banks and hedge funds are stepping up their bonus buy-out offers, as they try to prise key staff from their competitors. Goldman Sachs, a Wall street bank with a large British operation, has managed to set aside around &#163;236,000 per employee in compensation for the first nine months of the year, which is obviously less than the $527,000 that we saw this time last year, although it still demonstrates that potential pay-outs are being lined up in the City for February, when they are traditionally handed out.</p>
	<p pid="a.79.1/3">Richard Lambert, the outgoing director general of the CBI, has called for a global ceasefire between banks, to stop bonuses spiralling upwards, thereby further undermining the public's trust. In his speech to the CBI's annual conference this month, he said:</p>
	<p pid="a.79.1/4" class="indent">&quot;Carrying on with business as normal would seem arrogant and out of touch,&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.79.1/5">pointing out that many workers were facing job cuts and pay freezes. Those comments came as a survey found that seven out of 10 bankers expected to take home more pay this year, with half expecting a bigger bonus than last year, according to the website eFinancialCareers. City head-hunters Morgan McKinley found that 48% of financiers are expecting a higher bonus. The Centre for Economics and Business Research has predicted that &#163;7 billion is likely to be paid out this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.79.1/6">The former Chancellor, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40241" name="Alistair Darling">the Member for Edinburgh South West (Mr Darling)</phrase>, wisely instituted a bank payroll tax on banker bonuses while Labour was still in charge, netting some &#163;2.5 billion for the Exchequer. Yet despite the coalition agreement promising to</p>
	<p pid="a.79.1/7" class="indent">&quot;bring forward detailed proposals for robust action to tackle unacceptable bonuses in the financial services sector,&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.79.1/8">nothing significant has yet materialised from the Government. In fact, worse, the Government now appear to be rowing back from their commitments to tackle excessive banker bonuses. Last Monday, the Treasury Minister in the House of Lords, Lord Sassoon, told peers that</p>
	<p pid="a.79.1/9" class="indent">&quot;the Government have taken action to tackle unacceptable bonuses in the banking sector,&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.79.1/10">although it was not quite clear what that action was. He continued:</p>
	<p pid="a.79.1/11" class="indent">&quot;The Financial Services Authority is updating the remuneration code, which will ensure that bonuses are deferred and aligned with the underlying risks, and significant portions of any bonus will be paid in shares or other securities,&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.79.1/12">which was not something that originated with the Conservatives. He went on:</p>
	<p pid="a.79.1/13" class="indent">&quot;Employees in this industry will no longer receive all their bonuses in cash while leaving their shareholders, and potentially the taxpayer, exposed to the long-term consequences of the risks they take.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.79.1/14">When asked by my noble Friend Lord Myners whether that meant that future bonuses would be &quot;deemed to be acceptable&quot;, Lord Sassoon merely reiterated his earlier remark, saying:</p>
	<p pid="a.79.1/15" class="indent">&quot;My Lords, what I said was that we have indeed taken action&quot;.-[<phrase class="offrep" id="lords/2010-11-01.1417"><i> Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 1 November 2010; Vol. 721, c. 1417-18</phrase>.]</p>

	<p pid="a.80.0/1">Has my hon. Friend noticed that in the same package of measures in the emergency Budget-this was also touched on in the comprehensive spending review Green Book-there is also provision for a remuneration disclosure scheme? In the emergency Red Book and the CSR Green Book, we were told that the Government would come forward with details on how they would implement the scheme, which would require greater transparency in the financial services sector, so that the country could see what those in the sector were earning and whether there were irresponsible remuneration packages in place. It seems that the scheme will not now be implemented in time for the bonus round that my hon. Friend has just mentioned.</p>

	<p pid="a.81.0/1">Absolutely, and it is no coincidence that it is on the first page of promises in the coalition agreement-actually, the reason is alphabetical; the first page starts with b, for &quot;banking&quot;-that many of those promises, including the promise to tackle banker bonuses, were made. The Government have tried to suggest that they are being tough and that they will take action, but that action has not been forthcoming. I want to hear from the Minister whether the Government are now content with the current framework, in which higher banker bonuses look set to continue to be paid. If not, will he say when the Government will bring forward proposals to act? It is a specific and simple question. The House wants to hear what the Minister has to say.</p>
	<p pid="a.81.0/2">The coalition agreement also promised to use net lending targets for the nationalised banks as a means of getting credit flowing to businesses, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40215" name="Stewart Hosie">the hon. Member for Dundee East (Stewart Hosie)</phrase> has suggested. Yet last week, the Prime Minister again shifted his stance. In a meeting with business leaders in Hertfordshire, he stepped back from that pledge, and indicated that lending targets for banks would not be reintroduced. He said:</p>
	<p pid="a.81.0/3" class="indent">&quot;You can go for lending agreements with the banks. The trouble is, what I find with lending agreements is that they will promise to do a certain amount of lending to one sector, but they'll shrink it somewhere else.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.81.0/4">His comments were followed by similar remarks from the Minister with responsibility for small businesses at the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40313" name="Mark Prisk">the hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford (Mr Prisk)</phrase>. Last Monday, the Government published their response to the Green Paper consultation on financing the economic recovery, and it was conspicuous by its absence that no mention was made of net lending targets. Have the Government softened their position on the pursuit of net lending targets to business?</p>
	<p pid="a.81.0/5">During the summer, the Chancellor said that he would be exploring the costs and benefits of a financial activities tax on profits and remuneration. He repeatedly said that he would consider such a levy on the total profits and remuneration of financial institutions rather than on individual transactions, and the European Commission backed the financial activities tax, but when it was brought forward for discussion at the EU Council summit on <phrase class="date" code="2010-09-28">28 September</phrase>, Ministers seemed to be rowing back from even that pledge. Will the Minister tell the House where the Government stand on the proposal for a financial activities tax? The rumour was that the Government did not want that idea going forward to the G20 summit in Seoul this coming weekend. If so, why?</p>
	<p pid="a.81.0/6">Many of our constituents will be aware of the proposal from 50 or so charities and other voluntary bodies for a financial transactions tax, which is slightly different from a financial activities tax, and would apply to a wide range of individual capital movements, including equities, bonds and derivatives. That Tobin tax or Robin Hood tax deserves a thorough review, although clearly there are arguments for and against with regard to the details and the relative impact on London as a centre for financial transactions. Nevertheless, the Government have singularly failed to respond to that campaign so far. Any review of banking taxation would need to analyse the case for a financial transactions tax far more rigorously as it is a serious proposition meriting a serious response. All in all, the banks' tax position needs a far more serious review than the piecemeal commitments offered by Ministers so far.</p>

	<p pid="a.82.3/1">I thought it was a simple question. I thought the whole point of a debate was to exchange views. I am happy to review the financial transactions tax. It is an important proposition, and it deserves serious consideration. The Minister does not seem to know whether she is allowed to review it. Perhaps some inspiration has come down from on high. There is scurrying around, and I see that the Chancellor has been paging her officials. I am sure that inspiration will come to her shortly.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.3/2">Will the Minister say whether there should be a change in tax policy to rectify some of the loopholes, such as those in corporation tax? Should there be a further review of, for example, the bank payroll tax? Should banks have their right to carry tax losses forward limited so that they expire after a specific time, or would that be detrimental? Clearly, the Government's feeble attempt to recoup something from the banks through the banking levy alone is barely denting their balance sheets and is dwarfed by, for example, the deferred tax assets that the banks are wielding according to the report.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.3/3">Ministers should concede that the whole matter needs clearing up urgently if they are to have any hope of preventing widespread public cynicism, discontent and anger. In short, as things stand, all we see from the Government is a puny banking levy, banks still using corporation tax loopholes at taxpayers' expense, promises on bankers' bonuses unfulfilled, promises on banks' net lending targets more distant than ever, and inaction on reforms to the banking taxation system. The taxpayers of this country deserve better.</p>

	<p pid="a.82.4/1">Since coming to the House, I have seen a lot of history being rewritten. We are told whenever we stand in the Chamber that we must apologise for the economy, but to coin a phrase from <i> The Sun </i>on the day after the general election in 1992, &quot;It was the banks wot did it.&quot; There is widespread public anger with the banks, and people believe that they are getting away scot-free.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.4/2">At my surgeries, in my local Labour party and out in the streets, people ask me why our nurses and teachers are bearing the brunt of the deficit-what about those casino bankers? If it were not for their reckless practices, why did the then shadow Chancellor just before the general election commit to follow Labour's spending plans for two years if we were so bad at running the economy? The simple fact is that the banks have not paid the price for the deficit that they helped to run up.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.4/3">The new clause is not about destroying the banking system; it is about strengthening it, which means changing it and making it mixed. I know that this is outwith the amendment, but I would like a mutual element in the banking system, and that could start with Northern Rock. The simple fact is that the banks received &#163;1 trillion. Can anyone imagine what &#163;1 trillion looks like? Can anyone imagine what public works we could do with &#163;1 trillion? Projects in my constituency are crying out for money. The Newbridge Memo, the memorial hall, needs restoration. So much could be done with a tiny part of that &#163;1 trillion. But the bankers remain blas&#233; and people think they are plain arrogant.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.4/4">If no one believes me, let them look at Lloyds TSB, which this week appointed a chief executive. I will not embarrass myself by trying to pronounce his Spanish name, but we are told he will receive a package of &#163;8 million. Who is worth &#163;8 million, and what message does that send to people who are struggling to get by? It sends the message that the Government do not care how much damage bankers have done-they can carry on as they have been. When we read about such figures, what are we saying to people on the ground? They are the ones who must pay.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.4/5">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40460" name="Christopher Leslie">the Member for Nottingham East (Chris Leslie)</phrase> talked about bankers' bonuses, and I wholeheartedly agree that something must be done to rein them in. However, I have been a High street banker. I worked for Lloyds TSB, and I know for a fact that someone working as a personal account manager or personal banker is desperate for their bonus at the end of the month, because it makes up their wage. If we rein in the big City bonuses, we must think about the people on the ground. Let us not rein in their bonuses. They still have to pay their bills, and we must think about that. I ask the Government to consider the new clause because the banks really must pay their fair share.</p>

	<p pid="a.83.0/1">I endorse the comments made by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40336" name="Chris Evans">the Member for Islwyn (Chris Evans)</phrase>. I, too, hear similar sentiments expressed on the streets throughout my constituency.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.0/2">Opposition Members are not under any illusion that banker-bashing, as it has been called, or reining in bonuses alone will sort out the problems with the financial services sector. It is important to reform the way it operates generally, which is why I welcome the banking commission that the Government have set up. Its terms of reference are sensible and, as a member of the Treasury Select Committee, I look forward to providing some input to that.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.0/3">There are legitimate questions to be answered on whether the financial services sector is doing what the Chancellor said in the emergency Budget he would require it to do. He said:</p>
	<p pid="a.83.0/4" class="indent">&quot;I believe that it is fair and right that in future banks should make a more appropriate contribution, reflecting the many risks that they generate.&quot;-[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2010-06-22.175"><i> Official Report</i>, 22 June 2010; Vol. 512, c. 175</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.83.0/5">That is why I welcome the new clause. We should reflect on the huge contribution that the British public have had to make to the financial services sector since September 2007 and before.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.0/6">Of course, some banks were taken into public ownership, including Northern Rock, Bradford &amp; Bingley, Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds HBOS, but we are not talking only about the measures implemented by the previous Government on the eve of the financial crisis to nationalise or take a public stake in those banks. A package of measures was also put in place for the many other banks that were not taken into public ownership, as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40460" name="Christopher Leslie">the Member for Nottingham East (Chris Leslie)</phrase> has mentioned. In addition to the special liquidity scheme, there were the inter-bank lending guarantees and the banning in 2009 of short selling practices.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.0/7">All those factors contributed to helping the entire sector and, as a result, those banks are still operating today. Their balance sheets are looking far healthier and, during the summer, the five biggest players in the sector reported half-year pre-tax profits of more than &#163;15 billion. So the good times are back in the City. My hon. Friend also mentioned the predictions of the bonuses that are likely to be paid in the current round. Over the weekend, for example, we read that at RBS some &#163;2.1 billion has been accrued to pay staff salaries, benefits and bonuses, compared with &#163;2.2 billion a year ago, at a time when revenue has dropped from &#163;9 billion to &#163;6.3 billion.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.0/8">I am puzzled by the package of measures in the CSR Green Book that tell us that the banking sector will be required to make a greater contribution. If we look at the banking levy, for example, we see the sum of &#163;2.5 billion being bandied about as the amount that we can expect the banks to pay. However, I have been told in an answer to a written parliamentary question that the amount coming in from them will be &#163;1.15 billion in 2011-12, that it will be &#163;2.32 billion in 2012-13, and that it will reach &#163;2.5 billion only in 2013-14 before falling back to &#163;2.4 billion in 2014-15. My right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40346" name="Alan Johnson">the Member for Kingston upon Hull West and Hessle (Alan Johnson)</phrase> has pointed out that, by the end of that four-year period, the banks will be paying less than all the parents who are giving up their entitlement to child benefit, thanks to the measures announced by the Chancellor at the Conservative party conference on <phrase class="date" code="2010-10-04">4 October</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.0/9">I would also be interested to hear the Minister's comments on the fact that the banking levy is to be implemented in such a way that the banks will not have to pay it on the first &#163;20 million of taxable liabilities. It is extraordinary that they appear to be receiving a tax break before the tax has even been introduced. Will she also comment on the views expressed by the International Monetary Fund on the rate at which the levy is to be imposed? The IMF is clearly of the view that the banking industry in general has been under-taxed, and it has called for the levy to be tripled so that it could bring in at least &#163;6 billion a year. Just think what we could do with the extra moneys! We could reinstitute the future jobs fund, for example.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.0/10">The IMF's proposal is quite moderate when we consider what Oxfam is proposing, however. It argues that the levy should be imposed in such a way that it raises &#163;20 billion. That is not even being proposed by Opposition Members at present. I ask the Minister to reflect on whether the measures that appear in the CSR Green Book under the heading &quot;Everyone making a fair contribution&quot; will do as they say they will do-namely, require the banking sector to make a contribution that is proportionate to all the problems it has caused for our constituents.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.0/11">The Prime Minister will be attending the G20 summit in Seoul this week. Looking back at the G20 summit in April 2009, I believe that we as a country can be proud that we hosted that summit, and that it resulted in a package of measures that had a major effect on the way in which the financial services sector operates. Lord Turner introduced proposals on remuneration in the industry, which were tabled to all the G20 countries. Many of those proposals were adopted. The tax havens that had been operating around the world were clamped down on, and I believe that the banking levy was first proposed in an international context at that summit. Will the Minister tell us what leadership we can expect from the Prime Minister at Seoul this week? What measures will he argue for, and what can we expect to come out of that G20 summit that will make the financial services sector cease the reckless behaviour that led to the global financial crisis and, above all, contribute to paying down the deficit, on which the Chancellor is so fixated?</p>

	<p pid="a.85.0/1">My right hon. and hon. Friends have asked a number of questions that deserve detailed answers. The new clause calls for a review of the total level of taxation on the banks and the financial services sector before the setting of the 2011 Budget, and at its heart is the simple question of accountability, transparency and openness. It must be made clear to the people of this country that the banks are paying their fair share. It was, after all, the banks that got us into this situation. At a time when this Government are taking so much away from honest, working people-particularly those with families-it is crucial to demonstrate that we are all in this together and that the banks are paying their fair share.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.0/2">People are facing an increase in VAT, students are facing a trebling of tuition fees, the education maintenance allowance is being taken away, and child benefit is being capped, frozen and even taken away from many people. With all those massive cuts in public spending, it is crucial that we should know for certain that the banks are paying their fair share. That is all that the new clause endeavours to achieve. We want to make it clear that the banks are not continuing with their present bonus culture, and that they are making a fair contribution to the country. After all, it was the taxpayers who delved into their pockets to keep the banks afloat. This is a simple proposal, simply put, about openness, transparency and accountability, and I can see no good reason not to support it. It would give the people of this country great confidence in the Government if they were to accept this proposal tonight.</p>

	<p pid="a.85.1/1">The new clause relates to the taxation of the banking and financial services industry, and proposes that the Treasury publish a report before the 2011 Budget examining the level of taxation on those sectors. Before I discuss the new clause directly, I think it would be helpful to set out some of the background and context relating to the Government's approach to taxation of the banking sector. The Chancellor set out clearly in the recent spending review the Government's objective in taxing the banking industry. We inherited the largest peacetime deficit in UK history, and, during these difficult times it is only right that steps are taken to ensure that the banks pay a full and fair contribution.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.1/2">I listened with interest to Opposition Members, who appear to have a very blinkered perspective of regulatory issues. They skimmed over their own Government's part in the regulatory failures that led to the banking sector crisis. It is worth going back to some comments made by the previous Prime Minister, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40348" name="Gordon Brown">the right hon. Member for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath (Mr Brown)</phrase>. I know he is now making speeches in the House again, but it might have been helpful if he had participated in this debate, given his own involvement in these matters. When opening Lehman Brothers' new European headquarters in 2004, he said:</p>
	<p pid="a.85.1/3" class="indent">&quot;I would like to pay tribute to the contribution you and your company make to the prosperity of Britain&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.1/4">He also said that Lehman Brothers</p>
	<p pid="a.85.1/5" class="indent">&quot;has always been an innovator, financing new ideas and inventions before many others even began to realise their potential.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.85.1/6">The last Government clearly had a huge role to play in that the regulatory system they brought in during their term in power absolutely failed the British public.</p>

	<p pid="a.86.1/1">I will give way. I see that Labour Members have now perked up from when they were skimming over their past, as they were so clearly intent on doing. It is more difficult for them, is it not, to hear the failures of their Government being set out so clearly? Let us not forget that the last Prime Minister, back in 2007, described this as a golden age. He obviously felt that the regulatory system he had put in place was a great one, but that was subsequently proved not to be the case.</p>

	<p pid="a.86.2/1">Does the Minister not accept that there was move towards a light-touch regulatory model across the entire political system? I am well aware of this because I used to work in the industry myself, and I do not recall the Economic Secretary or any of her colleagues jumping up and down when the Financial Services and Markets Bill went through this House, complaining that it did not introduce stronger regulation. Secondly, did she, like me, hear the comments of the Governor of the Bank of England, Mervyn King at the Treasury Select Committee this summer? He was asked whether, if the new regulatory model championed by the Minister had been adopted, the global financial crisis would have been averted-and he said no.</p>

	<p pid="a.86.3/1">If the hon. Gentleman checked the <i> Hansard </i>of our debates on the original tripartite regulatory system, he would see that we did raise concerns about the nature of that system. We were told that our warnings were wrong. It is not acceptable for Labour Members simply to wash their hands of the regulatory system that they now clearly feel absolutely failed.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.3/2">In fact, we have to respond to the regulatory failures of the past by returning the role of supervising the banks to the body charged with the overall monitoring of the economy-the Bank of England. That is why we have also set up the Independent Commission on Banking to advise on the reforms necessary to ensure that we are better protected against another banking meltdown in the future.</p>

	<p pid="a.87.0/1">On that point, I entirely agree with the Minister. A fundamental part of this is the new capital requirements under Basel 3-some 7% higher for at-risk banks. Does she not agree, however, that a review of bank taxation, along with the Bank commission and the new Basel 3 regulations would be sensible to ensure that we have the balance in the round between taxation and capitalisation, risk and regulation, and supervision both at the UK level and with respect to this rather complicated European structure?</p>

	<p pid="a.87.1/1">The hon. Gentleman is right that the bank levy itself needs to be viewed in the context of overall policy. He is right that it is not just about the bank levy; we have to look at it in the light of the broader changes around regulatory reform and the work of the Independent Commission on Banking. I will shortly come on to explain what that means for new clause 3.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.1/2">We know that we have to tackle the regulatory failures of the past. We also know that it is right that banks make a contribution in respect of the risks they pose to the UK economy, but there is no benefit in taking action that would simply drive banks abroad. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40336" name="Chris Evans">the hon. Member for Islwyn (Chris Evans)</phrase> pointed out, hundreds of thousands of jobs across the UK depend on Britain being competitive in this industry. For the financial services sector as a whole, as of June 2009, it had 1 million employees. The jobs are not just in London and the south-east, as there are nearly 100,000 people employed within the financial services industry in the north-west, while there are between 69,000 and 70,000 people employed by that industry in the east of England and about 90,000 in Scotland. Although there have been serious failures in the past, we also have to remember that many of the jobs that are part of this overall sector do not bring in high incomes, as the hon. Gentleman pointed out.</p>

	<p pid="a.87.2/1">I am following the hon. Lady's logic. She is saying that we do not want to do anything that would drive the banks away-that old chestnut again-but is she seriously saying that the proposal in the new clause to have a review of the level of taxation would be enough to frighten them all offshore? Is she really saying that?</p>

	<p pid="a.87.3/1">I am sure that the hon. Gentleman is following my comments closely. I was setting out the context for the situation in which we find ourselves. I have pointed to serious regulatory failure, which needs to be sorted out, and the fact that we have inherited a huge fiscal deficit, which also needs to be sorted out. In that context, we should recall that the previous Government had said that they would not introduce a bank levy at the national level and that they wanted international agreement before any such levy were put into place. At that time, we argued that we should get on with that, as a Government, and not necessarily wait for international agreement. The Labour Government rejected that.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.3/2">In our first Budget, we decided to introduce a permanent levy on banks, which we expect to generate about &#163;2.5 billion of revenue each year. The levy reflects the potential risks that banks pose to the UK's financial system and the wider economy, and it will ensure that banks make an appropriate contribution to deficit reduction that balances fairness with the competitiveness of the UK banking sector. It is also intended to encourage banks to move away from risky funding models that threaten the stability of the financial sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.3/3">We were the first country in the G20 to take such action-<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40588" name="Chuka Umunna">the hon. Member for Streatham (Mr Umunna)</phrase> talked about leadership, and I think this is leadership-and we have been joined by France and Germany, which made announcements on bank levies in June. Germany's plans for its bank levy have been before Parliament there, while France outlined the details of its bank levy at its budget in September. Hungary, Portugal and Austria have since also outlined plans to introduce bank levies, while Sweden has already introduced a levy. Our bank levy is a permanent one and a regular source of revenue-unlike the one-off bonus tax of the previous Administration.</p>

	<p pid="a.88.0/1">What does the Minister say to the International Monetary Fund? I have already mentioned the IMF's views on the level at which this levy should be imposed. Conservative Members are fond of quoting the IMF to us time and again, yet the IMF takes the view that at least &#163;6 billion a year can be raised from this levy. Does she agree with the IMF and, if not, why does she think it is wrong?</p>

	<p pid="a.88.1/1">The IMF has expressed its own views around levels of taxation. In the broader international context, which <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40460" name="Christopher Leslie">the hon. Member for Nottingham East (Chris Leslie)</phrase> mentioned, there are questions about the introduction of a financial transaction tax and a financial activities tax. Unlike the hon. Gentleman's party, we were prepared to introduce a bank levy nationally, but there are also discussions taking place about international measures that might be taken.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.1/2">In fact, over and above the bank levy, the Government are taking a tougher approach to tackling tax avoidance by the banks. Prior to the spending review, only four of the top 15 banks had adopted the previous Government's code of practice. We have asked Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs to work with banks to make sure they adopt and implement the code by the end of this month, thereby making the commitment to comply with both the letter and the spirit of the law, and not to engage in or promote tax avoidance.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.1/3">New Clause 3 provides:</p>
	<p pid="a.88.1/4" class="indent">&quot;The Treasury shall publish a report before the 2011 Budget examining the level of taxation on the banking and financial services industry.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.88.1/5">We have had some sort of rationale for it, but I have to say that I see little merit in making such a report in isolation. The report itself would be no substitute for the overall strategy for improved regulation and the complementary bank levy ensuring banks make a contribution in respect of the risk they pose to the financial system and wider economy. As set out in the spending review, the Government will continue to monitor tax receipts from the banking sector to ensure that banks make a fair and growing contribution to the public finances as the economy recovers.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.1/6">In addition, there are, of course, already statistics available on the amount of tax revenue derived from the financial services sector. Historical figures for corporation tax receipts paid by several broadly defined business sectors are regularly updated and published on the HMRC national statistics website. To improve predictability, it is important that the Government provide clarity on the direction of tax policy, and the vehicle through which that is best delivered is the Budget itself. The new clause would require the Government to produce a superfluous report in advance of the Budget and therefore in advance of any announcements that the Chancellor might wish to make about tax policy generally that might impact on the banking and financial services industries.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.1/7">The Opposition want a report on the banking industry. What the Government want, and what we have, is a strategy to ensure that the financial services sector pays its fair share. We have been clear about what we want to achieve, not only through the bank levy but through the code of practice, and by fixing the banks' ineffective regulatory system-the system established by the last Government, who let our country down so badly. The new clause does nothing to support those aims, and I ask the hon. Member for Nottingham East to withdraw it. If he is not willing to do so, an apology to the British people for the mess of a regulatory scheme that he left behind would not go amiss.</p>

	<p pid="a.89.0/1">What cheek the Minister has to start claiming, in that revisionist way, that her party was always saying that it wanted heavier regulation of the banks in the 1980s and 1990s, and that the Labour party was always advocating the lightest of light touches.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.0/2">The Minister has completely failed to address the substance of the new clause. We were not even arguing for a change of policy, although I think that we may deal with that on another occasion; we were simply asking for a review of the levels of tax paid by the banks. The Minister did not address that. Nor did she address the issue of bankability. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40336" name="Chris Evans">the Member for Islwyn (Chris Evans)</phrase> rightly distinguished between lower-paid employees in the banking sector and the high-rolling, highly paid bonus recipients who are in a league of their own.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.0/3">The Government have taken no action on banker bonuses, despite all their rhetoric. As my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40588" name="Chuka Umunna">the Member for Streatham (Mr Umunna)</phrase> pointed out, although the Government had claimed earlier that they wanted to see the banks paying their fair share, they were quite happy to set the banking levy at a puny level.

Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40520" name="Nicholas Dakin">the Member for Scunthorpe (Nic Dakin)</phrase> rightly observed that new clause 3 simply seeks transparency and accountability-which must be an important part of proving that we are genuinely all in it together, as the Government like to claim. The Government are going to hit the public generally, cutting services, abolishing education maintenance allowances, taxing child benefit and raising VAT; yet they are unable to do anything about the banks.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.0/5">We accept that the Independent Commission on Banking is investigating the matter and that regulatory reform is needed, but why can we not have a review of the level of taxes? That is all that we are asking for. What are the Government scared of? They have not given us an answer, and I think that we should divide the House.</p>

	<p pid="a.90.0/1">On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. I have never seen you in the gym, although you may visit it regularly, but when I was there earlier this evening, the Division Bell did not ring. I do not know whether it did not ring in other parts of the estate, but I hope that it will ring on this occasion-although I am here now.</p>

I have asked for someone to be in the gym in time for the next Division in order to ascertain whether the bells are working normally. The hon.

	<p pid="a.94.2/1" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.2/2" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">New clause 5 takes us into completely different territory from that of the previous debate, and it picks up on a discussion we had in Committee about the legal definition of incapacitated persons. Committee members were concerned by the outdated nature of some of our tax law, under which antiquated terminology can often still find its way into our tax regime through extracts from statutes simply being cut and pasted into today's legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.2/3">One such anomaly concerns a definition in the Taxes Management Act 1970, which I am told is still very much a cornerstone of our tax law. It defines an &quot;incapacitated person&quot; as</p>
	<p pid="a.94.2/4" class="indent">&quot;any infant, person of unsound mind, lunatic, idiot or insane person&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.2/5">Those terms of reference are clearly insulting and demeaning to people who would be regarded as incapacitated. Not only is it out of date for those terms of reference to be extant in our legislation, but it is hurtful to those individuals who may suffer from incapacitation to be categorised and described in such derogatory terms. That definition derives from the 19th century lunacy Acts and today appears grotesquely at odds with modern terminology, and this insulting state of affairs ought to have been reformed many years ago. That definition relates to section 72 of the 1970 Act, which says that an incapacitated person's tax liabilities should apply to their</p>
	<p pid="a.94.2/6" class="indent">&quot;trustee, guardian, tutor, curator or committee&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.94.2/7">as if to a non-incapacitated person.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.2/8">In Committee, we pressed Ministers to concede this small and surely non-controversial reform. We did not feel that it was a matter of party politicking; after all, it should not be a dividing line between the parties. The new clause is simply and straightforwardly about replacing and modernising the definition of an &quot;incapacitated person&quot; and aligning it with the meaning in the more modern and more appropriate Mental Capacity Act 2005, whose far more flexible and sophisticated definition is less hurtful in tone and more precise in its interpretation. It states:</p>
	<p pid="a.94.2/9" class="indent">&quot;For the purposes of this Act, a person lacks capacity in relation to a matter if at the material time he is unable to make a decision for himself in relation to the matter because of an impairment of, or a disturbance in the functioning of, the mind or brain.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.94.2/10">That is a far more appropriate definition.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.2/11">By updating the definition, we would also update provisions to encompass new arrangements relating to trusteeships. For example, the new arrangements would also modernise those of donees of powers of attorney, who would be properly included in the legal definitions, as well as those of Department for Work and Pensions appointees. I should like to thank the Chartered Institute of Taxation's low incomes tax reform group-LITRG-for highlighting the issue consistently. It has been championing this minor technical change in the law for at least seven years and has been promised on numerous occasions that, &quot;A tax law rewrite is just around the corner&quot;, &quot;More time is needed for consultation&quot; and so on. I gather that it has been having discussions with officials, following our discussion in Committee. Although LITRG may have cause to trust the Minister's officials, I believe that time is running out for this change to be made. When the Minister was unable to concede on this point in Committee, I said that we would try to have this debate on the Floor of the House because of the importance and urgency of making this reform.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.2/12">It is a pity that the Minister has not tabled a Government new clause on Report, but I shall wait to hear what he has to say. We did try to reflect on the points that he raised in Committee. The provision that we had tabled then did not refer specifically to children and we have rectified that by making the appropriate change for the Report stage. As far as I can see, this new clause has no revenue implications and there is no clear reason for any Member to dispute the need to modernise this terminology. There is clear evidence that people are hurt and insulted by the terminology from a bygone age. It therefore seemed sensible to put this point again on Report, and I urge the Minister to accept the new clause.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2010-11-08a.95.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40559" speakername="David Gauke" colnum="95"  time="018:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm101108/debtext/101108-0003.htm#10110828001267">
	<p pid="a.95.0/1">As we have heard, new clause 5 seeks to change the definition in the Taxes Management Act 1970 of an &quot;incapacitated person&quot;. I appreciate that the purpose of the new clause is not to change the scope of the definition, but to ensure that it better reflects the modern understanding of an &quot;incapacitated person&quot;. Members of the Committee will recall that we debated a similar proposal at the end of the Committee stage. As I explained then, a definition is required to ensure that the obligations of the 1970 Act properly fall to those acting for children or for those with mental health problems. The existing definition can be traced back to at least 1880, and I reiterate that I agree that the wording used, such as &quot;lunatic&quot; or &quot;idiot&quot;, no longer feels appropriate, belonging as it does to the Victorian age, rather than to today's times.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.0/2">Before I address the wording used in this new clause, I wish to reiterate to Opposition Members that I welcome this issue having been raised and am willing to take action. That is not an empty promise: I asked my officials to explore quickly what they thought was possible with the low incomes tax reform group. We now better understand what that group wants to achieve and the complexities involved. My officials are working with LITRG and are willing to listen to it and to others about how best to achieve these objectives.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.0/3">LITRG thought that it should be feasible to change the definition in the next year or two, and I am confident that the Government can work to that timetable in a carefully considered way. In contrast, I do not think that the new clause achieves its objective, nor do I think it is the most appropriate way to make this change. It, like its predecessor debated in Committee, seeks to link the 1970 Act definition of an &quot;incapacitated person&quot; to the Mental Capacity Act 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.0/4">The provision debated in Committee failed to take into account the fact that children were also included within the existing legal definition of an &quot;incapacitated person&quot;. The revised new clause seeks to remedy that position by including</p>
	<p pid="a.95.0/5" class="indent">&quot;any person under the age of 18&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.0/6">Once again, I point out that the provision remains deficient, as the definition would inadvertently include Scottish people between the ages of 16 and 18, who are not included within the current definition for most purposes of the 1970 Act. I do not think that the reclassification of that group in a way that is contrary to the position in Scotland is the intention of Labour Members.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.0/7">In addition, our preliminary discussions have revealed that the reference to the 2005 Act may well create a different definition in practice. The current definition refers to a person's general mental condition, whereas this provision would depend upon an analysis of a person's capability at a specific point in time, and the implications of such a change may be significant. It would be irresponsible to make such a change without considering these potential differences thoroughly with the appropriate representative bodies.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.0/8">The repeated technical difficulties demonstrated in the new clauses serve only to reinforce the point I made in Committee that such changes should not be made in haste, for fear of inadvertently moving groups of persons in or out of the definition. As hon. Members will be aware, the Treasury launched a new approach to tax policy making alongside the June Budget.</p>

	<p pid="a.96.0/1">Earlier today I made the point, on another matter, that it may be unwise to reform in haste and repent at leisure. I am very pleased that the Minister has now decided to agree with me.</p>

	<p pid="a.96.1/1">I am delighted if that is how the hon. Lady interprets my remarks, and if that pleases her, it pleases me.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.1/2">In June, we produced our paper on the making of tax policy and we believe that it is very important to adopt a deliberative and consultative approach and, wherever possible, to consult thoroughly. We wish to avoid the experience of making reactive and piecemeal policy announcements that have been insufficiently thought through and result in unexpected consequences-we saw too much of that under the previous Government. Instead, we believe that appropriate consideration should be given to changes, thus providing an opportunity for those affected to comment and have certainty about our decisions. Any change on this matter should go through that process to ensure that we can come to this House with legislation that will work as intended.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.1/3">Let me be clear that I agree that the wording in the current definition is outdated and that I am committed to delivering change. As I have said, my officials have already started to work with LITRG and will work with other groups that have the expertise to ensure that we get this right. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40460" name="Christopher Leslie">The hon. Member for Nottingham East (Chris Leslie)</phrase> has alluded to the fact that LITRG is happy to work with Treasury officials and accepts the need to get this right. I believe that it will be possible to deliver change to the definition in the next couple of years along the timetable that LITRG accepts.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.1/4">I ask the hon. Member for Nottingham East not to press his new clause to a vote, but I hope that he will engage with us on how to make the change behind the clause that we both agree is necessary. I am grateful to him for raising the issue in Committee and today. I agree that this should not be a matter of party political dividing lines and we will seek to address it. It has been of long-standing concern, but the Government are determined to address it, so I ask him to withdraw the clause.</p>

	<p pid="a.97.0/1">I am impressed that the Minister has taken the time to encourage his officials to meet LITRG. I am pleased that he agrees about the outdated nature of some of these archaic terms: &quot;idiot&quot;, &quot;lunatic&quot;, &quot;insane&quot; and so on should not be part of our modern legislative lexicon. I am interested that yet again he manages to find a flaw in the drafting. It is almost like one of those circular nightmares: no matter what point any Opposition party makes to any Government, there is always a desire to resist by pointing out drafting and terminological problems. I think that the Minister accepts the spirit in which we have been trying to raise this issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.0/2">I agree entirely that it is important to take whatever time is necessary to frame the definitions correctly in law, but we are not talking about designing a whole new regulatory regime for financial services or some convoluted way of taxing child benefit. We are simply talking about a minor change to modernise the terminology in tax law. I am still slightly sceptical about the argument that we need to take another couple of years to do so.</p>

	<p pid="a.97.2/1">Indeed, and that is probably why on this occasion I am happy to accede to the Minister's request that Treasury officials be given more time to frame the change. However, I think that the patience of the House will be tested if we go for another seven years with these terms still in statute as we go through Finance Bill after Finance Bill after Finance Bill-we are going to have three, after all, this year, with another possibly coming shortly, although it is up to the Minister when that happens. I do not want to be back here tabling similar amendments. I hope that during the Minister's tenure, before he is promoted to even higher office-I accept that that is probably imminent, whenever the reshuffle might come-he will make a commitment, at least, to show that this was one reform that he was able to champion. I would be grateful for that. On that basis and in that hope, I am happy to beg to ask leave to withdraw the clause.</p>

	<p pid="a.98.1/1" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move amendment 1, in page 7, line 40, leave out clause 4.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.1/2" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">In Committee, we discussed the implications of clause 4, which I am happy to discuss again. It seeks to extend to seafarers resident in the European economic area the same 100% deduction from income tax of their earnings from employment as a seafarer wholly or partly outside the UK during an eligible period. I know that this is something about which many Members of the House will be very concerned.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.1/3">At present the tax relief is available only to those seafarers who are ordinarily resident in the UK, but there are clearly seafarers resident in other EEA states yet not ordinarily resident in the UK who might also warrant the seafarers' earnings deduction. The measure is listed in the Budget Red Book as costing the Exchequer &#163;5 million annually and we debated the technical details of the clause, such as the navigation of waters beyond the UK continental shelf, how long would be spent away from the UK and how many seafarers are involved in the concession. The Minister said that it was in the order of 16,000.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.1/4">The Minister also helpfully explained that the clause was brought forward as a result of the European Commission's decision to challenge the compatibility of seafarers' earnings deductions with the UK's treaty obligations and to comply with our EU and EEA associations. It is welcome that the Conservative party is rushing to legislate to comply with these European arrangements. I know that some hon. Members-including the Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40600" name="Jeremy Browne">the hon. Member for Taunton Deane (Mr Browne)</phrase>, who is sitting on the Front Bench opposite-will be more pro-European than others, but he seems to be persuading the Conservative party towards the pro-European stance. It is interesting that there is no dissent from that interpretation.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.1/5">In Committee I raised in particular a specific and contemporary issue that has been a subject of some controversy: the impact on the mackerel fishing dispute between UK and Icelandic fishermen. The clause is highly relevant and might have a significant bearing on that dispute, because if enacted it would grant to the Icelandic fishermen-and the Norwegians for that matter-a set of tax relief arrangements that would be very useful to them. I asked the Minister a series of questions on that, but he merely asserted in his indomitable way that the clause was &quot;not relevant&quot; to those discussions. So, I want to try again.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.1/6">Will the Minister say what discussions have taken place between the Government and the Governments of Norway and Iceland in the drafting of the provisions and in what respect they will be reciprocated for UK-resident seafarers in those countries? Has the Minister spoken with his counterparts in the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, the Scottish Executive-I know that some hon. Members will be interested to learn about that-and the FCO regarding the impact that the change might have on the sensitive negotiations between the EU, Norway and Iceland over the mackerel quota? I gather that the practice of the Icelandic fishing community unilaterally to declare a larger catch quota for valuable fish, risking the sustainability of fish stocks and disrupting previously settled agreements, has caused consternation in some quarters. Is it therefore appropriate for the Treasury to grant this tax concession to Icelandic fishermen while there is such great sensitivity?</p>
	<p pid="a.98.1/7">On Friday, I understand that the Icelandic ambassador to the UK, Benedikt Jonsson, met the chief executive of the Scottish Fishermen's Federation and others to discuss the mackerel dispute at a meeting in Aberdeen organised by the Icelandic consulate. I gather that &quot;frank views&quot;, as they are often called, were exchanged about what constitutes responsible management of that mackerel quota. Iceland continues to assert its right to catch a significantly increased quota this year outside the bounds of the international agreements. What are the UK Government doing to bring the dispute to a sensible conclusion? Would it not be wise to pause on the gifting of the seafarers' earnings deduction to the Icelandic fishing community until such time that the question over the fair fishing of mackerel stocks is resolved?</p>
	<p pid="a.98.1/8">Other issues might be relevant, too. Are we, for instance, still confident that the relationships between the UK and Iceland are ensuring that our fiscal position is protected? For example, the UK ought to be getting money back from the collapse of Icesave and other Icelandic banks, but there have been recent suggestions, particularly resulting from protests in Iceland, that there might be some delay in repaying foreign creditors with the priority that is deserved. Is it sensible to be offering tax concessions to Iceland when such negotiations are going on? I understand that there are also some question marks over whether the EEA treaty arrangements necessarily require such a tax concession to be ceded to the Icelanders.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.1/9">I have asked a number of questions and I wonder whether the Minister can address them. They are not necessarily at the top of people's minds in every constituency in this country, but there are some corners of the country where this is a big issue. I would be grateful for the Minister's attention to it.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2010-11-08a.99.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40559" speakername="David Gauke" colnum="99"  time="019:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm101108/debtext/101108-0003.htm#10110831000177">
	<p pid="a.99.0/1">As we have heard, amendment 1 seeks to remove clause 4 on the seafarers' earnings deduction from the Bill. Doing so would prevent the extension of seafarers' earnings deductions to EEA resident seafarers. By way of background, it is worth pointing out that in November 2008 the European Commission sent a pre-infraction letter on this matter. The Commission stated that the rules for seafarers' earnings deductions are incompatible with the EU rules because the deduction is available only to seafarers who are ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom. After due consideration of the Commission's letter, the previous Government decided to respond by enacting a change in the law. Consequently, last year they said that they would legislate to extend the rules for this deduction, enabling European economic area resident seafarers from outside the UK to claim. The previous Government committed to implementing the change from April 2011.</p>
	<p pid="a.99.0/2">Given the expectations that were set by the previous Government, we decided that it was better to enact the changes this year. After the election, we decided to follow the same approach as the previous Government in response to the Commission's letter, although we postponed the legislating until this second Finance Bill of the Session. In July, the draft clause and explanatory notes were published along with the rest of this Bill. Only one response was received, from a professional body, and it did not raise any concerns about competition effects on UK seafarers. Other discussions with interest groups exposed no objections to the extension of the rules because it was felt that it would not have a significant impact on UK resident seafarers.</p>
	<p pid="a.99.0/3">Opposition Members are concerned that making such a change will benefit Icelandic and Norwegian fishermen, who compete with UK fishermen for their catch. In particular, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40460" name="Christopher Leslie">the hon. Member for Nottingham East (Chris Leslie)</phrase> raised the matter of the so-called mackerel war. Although I understand such a position, the clause will make no significant difference. The Government estimate that a maximum of 1,500 EEA resident seafarers will become entitled to claim seafarers' earnings deduction, at a potential cost of &#163;5 million per annum. The numbers and amounts involved are relatively low because few non-UK resident seafarers pay income tax on their earnings in the United Kingdom. Non-resident seafarers are liable to UK tax on earnings in UK waters-that is within 12 miles of the shore-or if they visit a UK port. In reality, that means that they would probably be working in the UK or for UK businesses. Even if there were a liability to UK tax for such individuals, most double taxation agreements would give primary taxing rights to the home state, making the application of the deduction redundant.</p>
	<p pid="a.99.0/4">In practice, we estimate that about 4,000 non-UK resident seafarers pay income tax in the UK. As many of those are not EEA residents, we estimate that the extension of the entitlement to EEA residents would enable a maximum of 1,500 non-resident seafarers to claim the deduction.</p>
	<p pid="a.99.0/5">The Icelandic mackerel fishermen are most unlikely to be subject to United Kingdom taxation. First, many fishermen are self-employed, and so outside any entitlement to the deduction. Secondly, Icelandic fishermen would be entitled to claim the deduction only if they were employed to fish in UK waters or if they visited a UK port. It is unlikely that there are many Icelandic fishing vessels operating within 12 miles of the UK or landing their catch at our ports. Even if they did so, such individuals would still be subject to the double taxation agreement, which in almost all cases gives Iceland primary taxing rights over its resident seafarers.</p>
	<p pid="a.99.0/6">This Government take the mackerel fishing issue extremely seriously. The Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40418" name="Richard Benyon">the Member for Newbury (Richard Benyon)</phrase> has been engaging with his counterparts on this matter across Europe. We are disappointed that no agreement has yet been reached and we find the continuing action by Iceland unacceptable. We will consider further action in due course.</p>
	<p pid="a.99.0/7">The hon. Member for Nottingham East seems to have forgotten why this measure is being put in place and what the consequences are of not enacting it. If we passed amendment 1, the Commission would certainly take a significant and immediate interest, which could result in substantial uncertainty for UK seafarers. If we lose before the European Court of Justice, the result could be a fine from the European Commission of at least &#8364;11 million, and we would still have to enact the measure. To reject the amendment will mean an estimated cost of no more than &#163;5 million per annum, with few -if any-consequences for the UK fishing fleet. I therefore ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw his amendment.</p>

	<p pid="a.101.0/1">I am grateful to the Minister for his comments, which, given that he addressed some of the issues pertinent to the mackerel wars question in respect of arrangements for Icelandic fishermen-that was probably the biggest reason for the question mark over this clause-were certainly more thorough than those we had in Committee. He mentioned a couple of reasons why he did not feel that the measure would bite on that issue-if I may use that fishing pun. I am glad that he did not repeat his red herring claim against the amendment. The self-employment point was a fair one. He also said that the measure would hit only if there was a claim when Icelandic fishermen were landing their catches at UK ports and so forth. In particular, he talked about the European Court of Justice situation and the requirement that would fall on the UK and the consequences that would come from that. I know how much Members on the Government Benches are keen to abide by their European obligations. Given those strictures, I am happy to beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2010-11-08a.101.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40559" speakername="David Gauke" colnum="101"  time="019:36:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm101108/debtext/101108-0003.htm#10110831000179">
	<p pid="a.101.1/1" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move, That the Bill be now read the Third time.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.1/2" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">We find ourselves in the unusual situation of having considered three Finance Bills this year. The first, as usual, was introduced following the May Budget, but was curtailed by the election. The second allowed this Government to enact measures that were deemed necessary to address the financial mess that was left to us. This third Bill has allowed this Government to take forward those technical and uncontroversial measures set out by the previous Administration. The nature and timing of this third Bill are a product of both the economic position and our commitment to improving future Finance Bills.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.1/3">The enormity of the challenges facing Britain was one of the catalysts for a brief, focused Finance Bill in the summer. As my right Hon. Friend the Prime Minister set out, private sector-led growth is at the centre of the changes that this Government need to make to avoid the mistakes of the previous Government. The first part of providing that must be macro-economic stability, which is why it was necessary to enact in the summer those policies that would quickly tackle Labour's deficit. Doing so restored the confidence in the economy of both the financial markets and the British people. Stable public finances are the only way in which to prevent higher interest rates, rising inflation and more taxes.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.1/4">Alongside such policies was the need to show that Britain is, once again, open for business. We have taken such steps and committed ourselves to more. In so doing, we have been opposed by Members on the Opposition Benches, particularly on our measures for growth. I am sure that many hon. Members will remember <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40626" name="Angela Eagle">the hon. Member for Wallasey (Ms Eagle)</phrase> invoking Lord Kitchener on Second Reading. I am more drawn to the words of Churchill, who contended that a people taxing themselves into prosperity is like a man standing in a bucket and trying to lift himself by the handle. That is why we are reducing the rates of corporation tax for large and small companies and removing nearly 1 million people from tax, and why we did not go ahead with Labour's jobs tax.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.1/5">It was because of the need to take such steps in the summer that a short, focused Bill was required, which meant that an additional Bill was needed in the autumn. However, this Bill has also been an opportunity for the Government to demonstrate how we will improve tax policy making. On <phrase class="date" code="2010-07-12">12 July</phrase>, the clauses in the Bill were published in draft for consultation. More than 60 comments were received and resulted in changes to nine clauses. The publication of the clauses in draft followed the commitments set out in the June Budget. The changes will ensure greater predictability, fewer changes and better consultation. We have already made a good start on the first of those. Last week, my right hon. Friend the Chancellor announced the date of the Budget, four and a half months ahead of time. This evening, I can confirm that we will be publishing the majority of the clauses for the Finance Bill 2011 later this year. We will set out the draft clauses on <phrase class="date" code="2010-12-09">9 December</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.1/6">I have discussed the foundations of the Bill and the process that we will undertake for future Bills, but we should not forget the important measures before us. Clauses 1, 2, 3 and 16 will provide for fairer tax treatment for carers. Clauses 5 and 6 will assure the future of venture capital schemes, which have supported more than &#163;10 billion of investment. The support to real estate investment trusts under clause 10 will allow them to meet their regulatory requirements more easily. The changes in clauses 19 to 22 ensure EU compliance on several technical but necessary issues. I shall not press this point, but I remind hon. Members of the important action that we are taking against long cigarettes and the tax avoidance connected with them.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.1/7">The Bill is a result of necessary action that was taken earlier in the year and of the greater scrutiny and consultation to which all future Bills will be subjected. Although it is not packed with headline measures, it will help many groups. It assists businesses and individuals, supports investment and benefits those in need. The Bill will make a real difference in the real world and I commend it to the House.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2010-11-08a.102.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40199" speakername="David Hanson" colnum="102"  time="019:41:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm101108/debtext/101108-0003.htm#10110831000180">
	<p pid="a.102.0/1">The Labour party predominantly supports the Bill. It had its genesis under the previous Labour Government when my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40241" name="Alistair Darling">the Member for Edinburgh South West (Mr Darling)</phrase> brought forward many of its measures. We give the Bill a warm reception, although we scrutinised it in Committee, as was our duty, as the Opposition.</p>
	<p pid="a.102.0/2">I was going to give the Minister a much warmer welcome than I might now do, but he raised several points that strayed beyond the Bill, even though they are important for the House to consider. There is a clear difference between the Government and the Opposition on public spending and taxation regimes over the next few years. Even during today's consideration of the Bill, we saw the clear differences between us on child benefit, taxation on banks and video game tax relief. We will return to such important issues in due course. They will frame the economic debate between the Government and the Opposition over the next 12 to 18 months, and we will watch closely how the backdrop to the Bill meets the needs of my constituents and those of my right hon. and hon. Friends in relation to employment, prosperity, taxation and the economic health of the United Kingdom, because we remain of the view that the Government are cutting too far, too fast, and that they will therefore damage the economy. However, let us put those matters to one side because they are not in the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.102.0/3">As I said, my right hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh South West developed many of the policies in the Bill. The uncontroversial nature of the Bill is attested by the fact that there were only two Divisions in Committee. One was on the sittings motion, following a disagreement about a clash of business in Committee and on the Floor of the House-as a matter of good practice, we should try to avoid that in future. The other Division was on a matter of more significant principle: the definition of &quot;incapacitated person&quot;. We had a rerun of that debate today.</p>
	<p pid="a.102.0/4">We support many of the detailed provisions in this technical Bill. It includes important measures on foster care relief and relief for adopters. It contains provisions to simplify value added tax and to address film tax credit. As the Minister said, it includes important measures to tackle the smuggling of cigarettes through its consideration of taxation regimes for long cigarettes. We support those measures, which were the subject of discussion in Committee. The Bill puts in place important and welcome green allowances as a kick-start for zero-emission goods vehicles. When we discussed those measures in Committee, there was broad support for their implementation.</p>
	<p pid="a.102.0/5">The Bill gives welcome support for asbestos-related trusts through taxation measures, including on capital gains tax. After we tested the Minister on those measures, we reached the conclusion that they were worthy of general support. We also support the clarification in the Bill on landfill tax.</p>
	<p pid="a.102.0/6">Try as I might in Committee, I could not find much in the Bill with which to disagree. However, our sittings allowed us to tease out the Government's thinking on a range of issues and to reflect the concerns of a number of outside bodies about the implementation of policy, rather than the policy itself.</p>
	<p pid="a.102.0/7">As hon. Members can see, Labour Members are so content with the Bill-and have such trust and faith in my ability-that they have left it to me to bring our proceedings on it to a close. Although we welcome the Bill, we will consider real differences between us regarding the economy of the United Kingdom on future days, and I look forward to those debates in due course.</p>

	<p pid="a.104.0/1">As a member of the new intake, it was a privilege to serve on the Government side of the Pubic Bill Committee. I congratulate Ministers on ably putting forward the Government's case in Committee.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.0/2">This important Bill is one of the three key pieces of the Government's programme for the finances of the country-the first was the emergency Budget and the second was the comprehensive spending review. It forms part of the way in which we will start righting the finances of the nation. Only today we heard a lot of deficit denial from Labour Members, yet the nation needs its finances sorted out. We in Dover are trying to help to do that, in our small way, through the prospective sale of our port. We say, &quot;Don't wait two years to flog it off overseas like Cadbury; let's get on and do it now, with a community mutual purchasing the port, to ensure that the Government get their money by the end of the financial year.&quot; Understandably, the harbour board is not pleased about that. Under its plans, it hopes to get millions for management, but I want millions for the people of Dover and the betterment of the community, just as the Government, through the Bill, seek the betterment of the nation as a whole.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.0/3">Our finances are in a bad state. We have a structural deficit of &#163;109 billion a year. By the end of the Parliament, even after we have reined in the deficit, our debt will have increased by &#163;292 billion, and that is before we get on to asking how we pay down the national debt. The key message of the Bill, the Budget and the comprehensive spending review is that we must stop debts mounting before we can pay down the mortgage. We must get the finances of the nation back under proper control and on a level keel.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.0/4">Just as I was privileged to be a member of the Public Bill Committee, I am privileged to support the Bill, and I congratulate Ministers on their excellent work.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2010-11-08a.104.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40485" speakername="Penny Mordaunt" colnum="104"  time="019:48:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm101108/debtext/101108-0003.htm#10110831000182">
	<p pid="a.104.1/1">I wish to start by briefly mentioning the public consultation on the Bill. During our discussions about the Bill and the comprehensive spending review, much was said about the previous Government's mismanagement of the economy and the behaviours that led them to spend &#163;5 for every &#163;4 that they brought in, but the systems that they put in place did not help either. The Minister has referred to the failure of regulation, but the previous Government's other practices-the prime example is their failure to hold a comprehensive spending review-hindered public and parliamentary scrutiny of their ability to manage the economy. That enabled a bad situation to escalate, with a scandalous overspend, as well as allowing them to adopt the shocking scorched earth policy in their death throes with which we are all familiar.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.1/2">I therefore welcome any move towards more transparency and public consultation. We have heard that Departments will publish business plans, and we were given reassurances in the summer that the clear line of sight project would allow us to see not just what Departments were spending, but what they were raising. In addition, consultation on Finance Bills is an extremely good innovation in the interests of quality and transparent Government. I hope that in future consultations, a broad audience beyond the usual tax practitioners will let their views be known to the Treasury. That will help to hold Governments to account, and it will certainly give us something interesting to talk about in Committee.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.1/3">With reference to the Bill, I welcome the amendment to collection procedures for income tax for individuals and the harmonisation of administration regimes for different taxes, which is a further advance towards simplification and transparency. I have received assurances on the issues that I raised on clauses 26 and 27 about the failure to make returns and late payment. I sought assurances that those measures would not overburden taxpayers or impose disproportionate penalties.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.1/4">I applaud first-year allowances for zero-emission goods vehicles, a genuine incentive for logistics firms to pursue a green agenda, and a sign of the Government's determination to reward green behaviour. In Committee, there was some discussion about what constituted a vehicle, which at the time I thought might be rather a waste of time, but given that earlier today, at Defence questions, an hon. Member managed to ask a question about aircraft carriers under the topic of vehicles, perhaps the discussion in Committee was not a waste of time at all.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.1/5">The clause that will be of most interest to my constituents is clause 31, because many people in Portsmouth North are suffering from asbestos-related illnesses. The clause will facilitate compensation payments and is a proper response to the tax liability to which many well intentioned trusts have found themselves exposed. Many of our constituents will suffer from asbestos-related industrial illnesses. The long period from exposure to presentation of symptoms, as well as lack of awareness, means that we will see new cases for decades to come.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.1/6">Currently, the trusts established to pay compensation to asbestos illness sufferers can be liable for inheritance tax, capital gains tax and income tax on their assets. Clause 31 will introduce a retrospective exemption for trusts established between <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-06">6 April 2006</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2010-03-23">23 March</phrase> this year. Ultimately, that means more money going to victims, and it will be warmly welcomed in Portsmouth. I was reassured to learn during the debate in Committee that other trusts that do not fall into that time frame will not miss out. No trusts that might be affected have been set up since <phrase class="date" code="2010-03-23">23 March</phrase>, and in future the problem can be avoided if new trusts fully consult the Charity Commission and HMRC.

	<p pid="a.107.2/1">Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for granting me this debate, and particularly for granting it to me so early in the evening. Before I start, I refer Members to my entry in the register and the fact that I was funded by Sir Joseph Houghton trust for a recent three-day visit to Gaza. I was joined by my hon. Friends the Members for Bradford East (Mr Ward) and for Gloucester (Richard Graham), whom I hope to see shortly in their places. We were also joined by Lord Warner. I would like to thank Graham Bambrough and Ed Parsons from the Council for Arab-British Understanding, and all those whom we met in Gaza.</p>
	<p pid="a.107.2/2">It is entirely as a result of that trip that I requested this debate, to feed back in a public venue the thoughts and reflections that I and my colleagues had while we were there. I should say that I also had other private meetings ahead of this debate, with the Minister and with the deputy Israeli ambassador, Mr Roth-Snir, for which I thank them both.</p>
	<p pid="a.107.2/3">It is worth noting that our delegation was not allowed to cross between Gaza and Israel, and as a result it was, sadly, not possible to talk to people on both sides of the blockade, which we would very much have liked to do. May I, through the Minister, suggest to Israel that its interests may be better served by facilitating people to visit it, as well as Gaza?</p>
	<p pid="a.107.2/4">My purpose in this debate is not to explore the history of the conflict, which has been done extensively elsewhere, and which, I think, does not do any participant proud. Sadly, discussions of the past were all too prevalent in our visit, with discussions going back as far as 1286. Instead, I want to focus on the present and on the future. But first, I believe that we do have shared goals that we all wish to see. Israel has a clear right to exist, and for its citizens to live in peace and security. The Palestinians have a clear right to have a fully potent state, with self-determination and autonomy.</p>
	<p pid="a.107.2/5">Currently, Palestine does not have a truly functioning state or security, and Israel is concerned that it does not have the safety that it needs. Unfortunately, despite the ever ongoing peace talks, I fear that both sides are headed away from those goals.</p>
	<p pid="a.107.2/6">One cycle of recent events began when Hamas won the elections in both Gaza and the west bank, under the banner, &quot;Reform and Change&quot;. Although I am no supporter of Hamas, it was poorly served by the west, which told it that it could stand in those elections only if it agreed to change its name and its platform. It did so and, in what seem to have been legitimate elections, won but was not recognised either in its own right or as part of a joint Government with Fatah. We need to learn the lessons, and consider more carefully how to respond when people whom we do not like win elections.</p>

	<p pid="a.107.3/1">I was out in the west bank as an election observer during the very elections that the hon. Gentleman has mentioned. He said that they were seen to be fair and impartial. It goes a little further than that, in that although people from the Carter delegation and the EU delegation and the British MPs who visited found minor things wrong with the way in which the elections were conducted, generally speaking there was an incredible turnout and there was very little on which we could challenge the elections.</p>

	<p pid="a.108.0/1">I thank the hon. Lady for commenting. It is great to have the vision of somebody who was there and saw what happened. Whatever we think of the election result, Hamas clearly won it.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.0/2">That led to the situation that we see now-a Fatah takeover in the west bank, and a Hamas takeover in Gaza, and to the events with which we are all too familiar: the rockets fired into Israel; Operation Cast Lead, with Israel killing 1,300 Palestinians, including 352 children; brutal repression of Hamas by Fatah and of Fatah by Hamas; the kidnapping of Gilad Shalit; the illegal blockade and siege of Gaza by Israel and Egypt; and the assault on the flotilla bringing aid to Gaza.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.0/3">In our visit to Gaza, we saw a population who felt under siege, trapped inside their own small strip of land, and overcrowded-an intelligent, peaceful population, desperate for education and opportunity.</p>

	<p pid="a.108.2/1">I thank the hon. Lady for intervening on that issue, and I shall come on to develop some of those points.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.2/2">I was struck by the tolerance. We attended a human rights lesson at one of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency-run schools, where the pupils were asked about tolerance. One of the questions was, &quot;How should you respond to people who are not tolerant of you?&quot; and I thought that the response from one young lady was fantastic. She said, &quot;You should be tolerant of them to show them what they ought to be doing,&quot; and a lot of that is taking place, certainly in the UN schools. The message was, &quot;We should be acting and listening. People should pay attention and help.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.108.2/3">We did not see a huge humanitarian crisis while we were in Gaza, but that is largely down to the excellent work of UNRWA, which has been in place, providing housing, food and education since 1949, and its excellent director, John Ging, who has been in place for a rather shorter period. In that short time, however, he has already had to witness his own UN compound being shelled by Israel.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.2/4">UNRWA does amazing work, and I think that I speak for all of us who went on the visit when I say that we were very impressed by the range and quality of provision, from housing for refugees to schooling for their children, from women's centres to summer camps. It was clear as we drove around in UNRWA vehicles that its work is well supported by the general public, with children cheering the cars as we drove by, but its ability to play that critical role is under threat.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.2/5">Although the blockade around Gaza has been lifted somewhat, there are still great concerns, because the construction equipment that should be able to enter Gaza legitimately comes under a lot of scrutiny and is often not allowed in. The crossing at Sofa, which is intended for construction materials, has been closed since 2008, and, although some material is allowed in at other crossings, it is fairly minimal and unreliable. We were told of UNRWA-led housing schemes, which aim to deal with housing shortages and to replace refugee homes that have stood for too long and buildings that were destroyed or damaged during Operation Cast Lead. Those schemes are funded by the international community, including the European Union, but they either cannot go ahead or they go ahead very slowly, because Israel will not allow in the cement and steel bars to build them.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.2/6">We heard of a crisis in UNRWA-led education, which is far more liberal than that in the Hamas-controlled Palestinian Authority schools and even includes a course on the holocaust. However, despite the fact that most UNRWA schools are double-shifted, with separate classes in the morning and the afternoon, there are about 40,000 refugee children who should be educated by UNRWA but are not, because of a lack of buildings. The money for eight much-needed new schools and two extensions has been obtained, the plans have been prepared and the contracts have been let, but the materials struggle to get in. While we were there, of the 48 trucks bringing in materials for the schools, 47 were turned back for no clear reason.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.2/7">I raised the matter in International Development questions on <phrase class="date" code="2010-10-13">13 October</phrase>, and the Minister of State, Department for International Development, agreed:</p>
	<p pid="a.108.2/8" class="indent">&quot;Schools must be rebuilt, and we certainly urge the Israelis to ensure that any materials that can be used for the essential reconstruction of schools and the like can be allowed through.&quot; -[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2010-10-13.316"><i> Official Report</i>, 13 October 2010; Vol. 516, c.316</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.108.2/9">I hope that he and the question have had some effect, because on Friday I heard from the Israeli embassy that approval had been granted for the eight schools, the two extensions and for two clinic centres, and that building materials will be allowed into Gaza in accordance with the building work.</p>

	<p pid="a.109.0/1">My hon. Friend speaks eloquently about our visit, and I agree with all the points he has made. Does he agree that the slowness in building those schools, which Israel has already approved from a list of 13 projects, is partly due to the fact that the crossing in Karni is not properly open? Of the 404 trucks for which UNRWA requested permission to enter Gaza, only 70 have so far done so. Does he agree that that is a crucial issue, and one on which we would be grateful for the help of the Minister here tonight?</p>

	<p pid="a.109.1/1">Indeed, and I thank the hon. Gentleman for going on the visit. It was a great pleasure to share many experiences while we were there. He is absolutely right. One can look at different time scales, and his figures date back to <phrase class="date" code="2010-10-03">3 October</phrase> if I recognise them correctly, but in general UNRWA says that only about 1.7% of the material that it requires is allowed in. Indeed, as he says, the Karni crossing is open only two days a week. It could be open six days a week. The Sofa crossing could be open, and we could allow for the transfer of construction materials at Kerem Shalom. I am delighted, however, that we seem to be making progress on those schools, because the materials for them were our number one priority after the visit.</p>

	<p pid="a.110.0/1">It seems entirely counter-productive not to allow through those construction materials, when, as the hon. Gentleman says, the UNRWA schools are far more moderate in their teachings than the Hamas-led schools. I appreciate that he did not have a chance to visit Israel and hold meetings there, but did he receive any feedback on why there are delays, and why there is no real push or zeal on the part of the Israeli authorities to get those schools built?</p>

	<p pid="a.110.1/1">That is a fascinating question. I thank the hon. Lady for raising it, and in a moment I shall refer to what I have heard about the situation.</p>
	<p pid="a.110.1/2">I am delighted about the schools, but we should be cautious. Approvals have been given in the past and then withdrawn, and allowing such basic building materials in should be a standard right, not a long drawn-out victory, but I thank the embassy for its information and urge the Minister to monitor carefully the progress on those projects, and to make the strongest protests possible if the flow of materials for those projects is curtailed. I hope he will agree to that.</p>
	<p pid="a.110.1/3">On the question the hon. Lady asked, the argument used by Israel for not allowing construction materials in for these and other projects is one of security. The argument is that such materials-and there is a relatively long banned list, although it is better than it used to be-could be used by Hamas for military purposes. That argument makes sense superficially, and Israel does of course have a legitimate reason for wanting to control materials that could be used to make rockets, but it falls apart on closer examination.</p>
	<p pid="a.110.1/4">It is well known that there are hundreds of tunnels under the border with Egypt which are used for smuggling. At the peak of the blockade, there were 1,200, including some large enough to drive a car through. We went into one-not the whole way, I hasten to add-and they are impressively constructed. At its peak, we were told, the value of the tunnel economy was between $500 million and $700 million a year, although the relaxation of the blockade on food and similar consumer goods has reduced activity significantly. The taxes that Hamas levies on imports through the tunnels provide a significant income to that organisation, helping to fund its activities and to buy up land and businesses throughout Gaza. However, those tunnels provide a regular supply of building materials, and we saw trucks being loaded with large amounts of cement and steel bars, along with signs throughout Gaza of construction works.</p>
	<p pid="a.110.1/5">We found it ironic and deeply concerning that Hamas and related private individuals can have all the materials they need to build anything, from apartment blocks to bunkers, while the only effective constraints appear to be on the UN, non-governmental organisations and legitimate businessmen. That is surely counter-productive to Israel's interests. It also serves to weaken UNRWA, which risks losing support through its inability to build while others are able to, because it is of course not prepared to use illegal materials. Given the flow of materials through the tunnels, Hamas can quite easily obtain any military equipment it requires, without having to try to acquire goods via the Israeli border.</p>
	<p pid="a.110.1/6">Egypt plays an important role in the area. Indeed, we entered Gaza through Egypt. The press rarely highlights the fact that Egypt maintains a blockade on people movement in Gaza, just as Israel does, largely out of fear of the spread of Hamas ideology. However, Egypt could easily close down the tunnels if there was a desire to do so centrally, and if local military and police commanders were prepared to act-although that might go against their financial interests.</p>

	<p pid="a.111.0/1">Was my hon. Friend as amused as I was by the secret, hidden tunnels from which one could wave at the Egyptian border guards who were apparently unaware of their existence?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2010-11-08a.111.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40142" speakername="Julian Huppert" colnum="111"  time="019:54:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm101108/debtext/101108-0003.htm#10110831000195">
	<p pid="a.111.1/1">I thank my hon. Friend for intervening. It was a great pleasure to have him on the trip as well, and yes, it is absolutely absurd to imagine that Egypt does not know about the tunnels, when one can drive along and see large tents. One has to speculate on how materials suddenly, magically appear out of them. Egypt could find those tunnels on the other side of the border as well, and the trucks that go backwards and forwards to supply could surely be found, too. There is a considerable Egyptian presence of tourist police and other organisations, as anyone who has been there will know.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.1/2">Egypt is concerned about Hamas ideology, and it was fascinating to discover how broad the Hamas support base is, along with the spectrum that it covers, from reformers to hard-liners. It was also interesting to see how some of the more extremist Islamic groups there consider Hamas to be far too moderate. Those groups have been involved in many recent attacks on Israel, and Hamas has where possible put them down brutally. The feeling is often reciprocated.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.1/3">While I am on the subject of tunnels and imports of materials, let me mention the lack of exports and the effect that that has on the economy. Exports have been barred since June 2007, with minimal exceptions: there have been a few shipments of strawberries and carnations. This does not make for a serious export market or a way of earning income for a country. I was fascinated to find that some entrepreneurial Gazans use the internet to do paid work, but that is very much in its infancy and cannot be a substitute for a proper export economy. I note in passing that one of our party inadvertently left a medical device behind in Gaza, and we are still struggling to find a way to get it back again. Without exports, there is no hope of the Gazan economy starting to re-function. The collapse of the economy has led to 40% unemployment rates, and 60% youth unemployment. These are not good conditions for a transition to a more peaceful solution.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.1/4">There are problems with the provision of fresh water and with sanitation, and we heard about the desperate struggle to undertake rebuilding projects of those kinds as well. On physical construction, we need to think ahead. When the next Operation Cast Lead happens-we all hope that it will not happen-what steps will the Minister be taking to ensure that any future assaults by Israel would not blow up the provisions that we in the international community paid to have built? We need to ensure that we are improving Gaza, not stuck in a cycle.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.1/5">Reconstruction is not just about the economy or just about infrastructure; mental reconstruction is also an issue. We met a fascinating gentleman called Iyad Saraj from the Gaza community mental health programme, as well as people from other non-governmental organisations that operate there, who made it clear how much psychological harm is being done to Gazan residents, especially children. As well as the traumatic events of Operation Cast Lead and other Israeli assaults, there is a sense of imprisonment in what the Prime Minister has called a &quot;prison camp&quot;. There are 800,000 under-18s in a population of 1.5 million, and more than half of them have never left Gaza.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.1/6">Serious construction is needed in leadership. Time and again, we heard of the desperate shortage of leadership on all sides. The ongoing feud between Hamas and Fatah exemplifies the suggestions that they are each more interested in their own interests. There is a long history between the factions, and an urgent need for them to overcome their differences. Talks facilitated by Egypt have been ongoing for two years, but are still unresolved. At the intended signing of the deal recently, there were five remaining differences, which have now been reduced to one-security. However, the talks on this issue that were supposed to start on <phrase class="date" code="2010-10-20">20 October</phrase> fell apart almost immediately, and it is now urgent for these two factions to unite if they are to be able to represent the Palestinian people.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.1/7">We were told on several occasions that some exciting visitors from Britain had come to visit. Gerry Adams went to Gaza to give advice to Hamas. Of course, he is in a unique position to do so, with the benefit of detailed experience of armed uprising. In his comments, as reported to us, he said that there is a time to stop fighting, and that in Northern Ireland they had waited too long, increasing the death count for no benefit; and he argued that Hamas had gone beyond that point. I hope that he is heeded. Hamas has also been in talks with the African National Congress and with bodies around the world. It is not clear, however, that there is a Palestinian leader who can be Gerry Adams, Nelson Mandela, or anyone even close; it seems that there is no one who can take the dramatic steps required for peace to be serious. Hamas will not take steps to amend its founding, and outdated, charter. There is no one who will release Gilad Shalit, who has been held by Hamas for more than four years.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.1/8">However, there is leadership in other places. I would highlight the leadership in human rights provided by Jaber Wishah of the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights. He was jailed by Israel for his part in fighting against the Israelis, and he spent many years in jail, but while he was there he decided to renounce violence, and he now dedicates himself to fighting fearlessly for human rights throughout Gaza, courageously reporting infringements by Palestinian and Israeli alike against people from any background. It was a privilege to meet him; we need more people like him in Gaza and elsewhere.</p>

	<p pid="a.112.0/1">Does my hon. Friend agree that in an environment in which the people have been so badly let down by their leaders and their neighbours, the best role that Britain can play in this difficult situation is to encourage the moderation and education that come through UNRWA's crucial work in Gaza, and that that is where our focus should be, while encouraging the Palestinians to try to create unity among themselves?</p>

	<p pid="a.112.1/1">Indeed; we have to focus on what is there. I was struck by the fact that many of the younger generation are ready for something different. We met people who are ready to start thinking in another way, and they need our support. I hope that that Minister can comment on whether the British Government are in any way able to provide support and training to some of the up-and-coming young people in Palestine.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.1/2">Israel is not acting like a partner for peace at the moment. Although it is clear that the vast majority of Israelis do seek peace, as indeed do the vast majority of Palestinians, the leadership in Israel is undermining the search for a lasting peace. Avigdor Lieberman's recent comments are inflammatory, as is the continued construction of illegal settlements on the west bank-only today, we heard of 1,300 more. The time available for peace is running out. There are currently Israelis and Palestinians who know each other, who have worked together, or who are friends, but this is fading. The younger generations on each side increasingly know each other only as enemies, and with every passing year this becomes worse.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.1/3">We were told a chilling story, with which I will conclude. One woman we saw was given permission to travel to Israel to meet a colleague, and to take her daughter with her. Her daughter met her friend, and asked what she was. She was told that she was, inter alia, an Israeli. The daughter said, &quot;That can't be right. Israelis are soldiers who wear masks and carry guns.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.112.1/4">If we are to avoid a perpetual state of conflict, a perpetual siege of Gaza, and a pressure cooker that will eventually explode in furious violence, then Israel and Palestine must up their games. They must find leadership to overcome their differences-to act in the common interest and the long-term interest of their citizens. We in Britain must play a role in supporting and helping them to take these difficult steps. We must be prepared to criticise firmly and actively when needed, and to encourage and assist when required. We must not take our eyes off Gaza. We must not allow the people in Gaza to bear the brunt of collective punishment and bear the burdens of a long and sorry history. The siege has to end. Senior Members of Parliament, from the Foreign Secretary down, must go there to see for themselves what is happening.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.1/5">I look forward to hearing the Minister explain how he will ensure that Britain is a more active participant in the region, how Britain will ensure that UN Security Council resolution 1860 and all the others are enforced, and how Britain will ensure that it is a force for peace, for human rights, for the rule of law and for the people.</p>

	<p pid="a.113.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40142" name="Julian Huppert">the hon. Member for Cambridge (Dr Huppert)</phrase> on securing this Adjournment debate. It is an extremely important debate that needs to be had.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.0/2">I went to Gaza this summer with two Members of the House of Lords. It was the first time that I had been to Gaza or anywhere in the middle east region. Like the hon. Gentleman and his colleagues, we travelled to the Rafah crossing from Egypt into Gaza, and we saw some of the tunnels as well. We spoke to people from UNRWA and saw the people living in the camps. It completely shocked me and, I think, the people with me to see almost three generations of people-grandparents, children and grandchildren: people of all different ages-who had lived in one room for more than 40 or 50 years. That surely cannot be acceptable in the 21st century. It does not matter about the rights and wrongs of Hamas, Israel and so on. We, the international community, have an obligation.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.0/3">As Members probably know, under a settlement made a long time ago, people cannot extend their camps into any other space but must keep building on the land they have. There are therefore a number of layers of homes, with people in flats of up to eight floors. On each level there may be a room with a family of 10, 12 or 15 people living in it. Some 1.5 million people live in a space of 2.5 or 3 sq km of land.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.0/4">I saw many people rushing off to the beaches, yet we were told that all those beaches were unsafe and polluted. They cannot be cleaned, because pipes would need to be sent out there, and no materials for reconstruction are allowed through. The only pastime that young people seem to have is going to the beach. In this country, we would never tolerate people going en masse to severely polluted beaches that were very bad for their health. A number of people in Gaza have suffered ill health precisely because they have disregarded advice, gone to the beach and gone swimming.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.0/5">We spoke to people in Gaza and saw some of the schools that they have constructed. The tragedy of Gaza is that, as the hon. Gentleman said, there is money there. It is not like some parts of the world where there is no money and no finance, and nothing can be done. The money is there, but Israel has imposed embargoes that do not allow anything to be exported or imported properly. In some respects Israel is kicking itself, because if goods were allowed to come in properly and the money could be used to rebuild schools, hospitals and other institutions, it would create an enormous number of jobs and the economy would prosper. Trade with other people would be possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.0/6">Historically, the best way for countries to negotiate or become friendly has often been through trade. That is often the most peaceful way for countries to build better relationships. By not allowing trade and reconstruction, Israel is hurting itself. It is important that the siege is lifted and reconstruction can start. That will be better for everyone concerned.</p>

Friend now-on securing the debate. I appreciate not only what he said but the way in which he said it, and I thoroughly enjoyed his contribution. It was made better by the fact that he did not have to squeeze it into the usual time and could extend it. I thank him for the great courtesy of giving me the outline of his speech earlier, because, at their best, Adjournment debates are not ambushes but an opportunity for colleagues who share many opinions and concerns to inform each other, the House, yourself, Mr Deputy Speaker, and the public of what we are about.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.0/2">I also thank <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40100" name="Yasmin Qureshi">the hon.

Occasionally, the House has to defend itself against those who think that every time we step outside our own shores, it is for purposes connected more with us than with what we are about. The descriptions that both colleagues gave of their personal experiences, and those of my hon. Friends the Members for Gloucester (Richard Graham) and for Bradford East (Mr Ward), who accompanied the hon. Member for Cambridge on his visit to Gaza, were good examples of how important it sometimes is to see things on the ground, so that we can report them faithfully to the House. I see my long-standing friend, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40072" name="Simon Hughes">the Member for Bermondsey and Old Southwark (Simon Hughes)</phrase>, in his place. He will know of the many times that we went to South Africa together in the difficult days of the 1980s. We hope that our personal experience of going there when many others could not made a difference to discussions in the House.</p>

	<p pid="a.115.0/1">I am grateful to my very good friend the Minister for that kindness.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.0/2">In probably every constituency in the United Kingdom, and certainly every urban one, there are people who daily worry about the future of Palestine, Israel, Gaza and the middle east. We therefore have a particular responsibility to be informed. I have been twice to the west bank and Israel, although I have not been to Gaza. The faith groups want us to do that, and Britain has a historical responsibility to be as engaged as possible-not just Government but Parliament. My hon. Friend is absolutely right that we are right to go and right to put the matter on the agenda in the House.</p>

	<p pid="a.115.1/1">Yes, indeed, and the number of letters that I deal with from colleagues expressing the concerns of their constituents certainly confirms what my hon. Friend says.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.1/2">I applaud the aim of the hon. Member for Cambridge, following his recent visit and that of his colleagues, to ensure that eight new UNRWA schools are built in Gaza. Like him, I welcome the recent announcement that that will be done. The situation in Gaza continues to cause the Government concern, and it was high on the Foreign Secretary's agenda during his recent visit to Israel and the occupied territories. I hope to explain in my remarks what action the Government are taking to reconstruct and stabilise Gaza, and why that matters to the middle east peace process.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.1/3">To begin with, I should like to set out the scale of the reconstruction challenge in Gaza and explain briefly how we got where we are. Although we agree with the hon. Gentleman that there is no longer a humanitarian crisis as such in Gaza, the situation there remains extremely fragile and could deteriorate very quickly. Despite Israel's welcome announcement on <phrase class="date" code="2010-06-20">20 June</phrase> of measures to help ease access restrictions, we remain worried about what the UN has termed the &quot;de-development&quot; of Gaza, with the economy, institutions and skill base steadily eroding.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.1/4">Although I am not tempted to go back to 1286, it is impossible to consider the current issues in Gaza without recognising the historical context and noting the tragedy of the people of Gaza, caught up in the generations-old dispute concerning Israel and Palestine. After years of occupation, and much international criticism, Israel withdrew from Gaza in 2005, pursuing its policy of swapping land for peace and evicting a number of settlers and settlements. The UK, along with international partners, welcomed the withdrawal as a positive step towards meeting Israel's road map commitments. We also pushed hard for Israel to co-ordinate with the Palestinian Authority on the aftermath of withdrawal.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.1/5">However, far from being freed, Gaza's population found itself the battleground for a gradually intensifying dispute between Fatah and Hamas for the control of the land. Hamas's repressive control of Gaza gradually tightened. Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit was kidnapped in 2006, kept completely incommunicado for many years and denied Red Cross access, and he is still detained. Hamas violently ousted Fatah from the Gaza strip in 2007, leading Israel to declare Gaza a &quot;hostile entity&quot;. A regular barrage of rockets directed towards southern Israel began. Israeli Government statistics claim that in 2005 Hamas and other Palestinian groups launched about 850 rockets and mortars at Israel from Gaza. By 2008 that figure had climbed past 2,000.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.1/6">Although I heard and understood the hon. Gentleman's point about responding differently to those who win elections with policies that we may not like, equally, those who wish to play a serious part in deciding the future of a people need to know that an acceptance and encouragement of violence, and a refusal to accept the existence of the state of Israel, will result only in closed doors, and rightly so.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.1/7">A downward spiral of restricted access, the cutting of fuel supplies and retaliatory violence prompted aid agencies to describe the situation in Gaza in early 2008 as the worst since the 1967 Yom Kippur war. As hon. Members know full well, a shaky ceasefire was not renewed towards the end of 2008. Militants in Gaza fired barrages of rockets at Israel, and Israel responded by launching Operation Cast Lead. The conduct of both sides in that war is the subject of a number of inquiries and is not for this debate. However, the consequences for the people of Gaza have been severe.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.1/8">To prevent the rebuilding of supplies of arms, Israel ensured a tight blockade of Gaza. The UK Government understand and support Israel's right to protect itself. However, to come to one of the hon. Gentleman's key points, we were, and are, less persuaded that the economic blockade that was simultaneously imposed would be of any benefit to Israel, and we share the hon. Gentleman's assessment. The fact that the economy of Gaza has been so reduced that 80% of Gaza's population is in receipt of food aid, and that unemployment is calculated at 40% for adults and 60% for youth, has not produced serious political gain for Israel or ruin for Hamas, but simply added to the misery of the people. We do indeed call on Israel to rethink that part of its policy, which would not undercut its concern on security, and might indeed, for reasons that have been outlined, assist its security. We make that case regularly to Israel, and we will continue to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.1/9">Following Operation Cast Lead and resolution 1860, the international community lobbied Israel hard on the need to allow access for humanitarian and reconstruction relief to Gaza. However, it was not until after the flotilla incident earlier this year that international pressure made a difference, and Israel announced on <phrase class="date" code="2010-06-20">20 June</phrase> measures to ease controls on goods entering Gaza. We welcomed that announcement and the Israelis' subsequent implementation on <phrase class="date" code="2010-07-05">5 July</phrase> of a move from a list of permitted items to a list of banned and dual-use items. The latter step resulted in an increase in the variety and volume of goods entering Gaza.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.1/10">Further steps have been taken by Israel, including procedures to allow the entry of dual-use items, such as building materials, into Gaza, and I will come to that key point a little later. The Government of Israel are also taking steps to improve access for Palestinian business people into and out of Gaza. We welcome those steps and acknowledge that the volume and range of goods entering Gaza has increased in recent months.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.1/11">I spoke this morning to John Ging, and I very much echo the hon. Gentleman's appreciation of his work. I had the pleasure of meeting John during the summer to help me understand the area for which I now have responsibility. He tells me that the consumer goods picture is much improved. Indeed, he estimates that there is only 20% of the tunnel traffic that there was. Once again, we share the hon. Gentleman's perception. Tunnel traffic simply became a source of revenue to Hamas and to criminals and appears to have done little damage to Hamas politically.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.1/12">However, John Ging also said that the situation in terms of construction material remains dire. He cannot find what he needs to tackle the under-resourcing of school building. We share his welcome, and that of the hon. Gentleman and other colleagues, for the eight school projects, but they will not satisfy the demand of 40,000 children. Once again, I echo the hon. Gentleman's point. If UNRWA, with the support of the international community, is not seen to, and cannot, provide the development that is needed, yet Hamas and its allies can provide it because of access to materials through routes other than the official crossing, who will get the blame and who will get the support?</p>
	<p pid="a.115.1/13">It is possible that it is not any political ill will that is affecting the delivery of construction material specifically orientated towards UNRWA, and UNRWA must, rightly, be held responsible should any material go missing and assist Hamas. However, John Ging informs me that there is a significant capacity issue, which hon. Members have mentioned. I understand there are sheer logistical difficulties in getting more material through the existing crossing. To that extent, therefore, reopening other crossings may assist, and we certainly intend to take that up, although we appreciate that it requires serious consideration and cost to Israel. The gain, however, may make it well worth while.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.1/14">It is not just schools. The sewerage system needs serious work to stop untreated sewage entering the Mediterranean. Some 90% of mains water is undrinkable. As I indicated, 80% of the population is dependent on food aid. It is also vital, therefore, to take steps to revive Gaza's economy, including allowing exports and the movement of people. That is key to ensuring Israel's long-term security interests. The empowerment of Gaza's legitimate, non-Hamas controlled business community will act as a counterweight to radicalisation.</p>

	<p pid="a.118.0/1">The hon. Lady makes an important point, on which I have received a number of letters. Our position is: we do not advise unauthorised travel to Gaza. As we know, it is still a dangerous place, and we cannot guarantee the safety of British nationals who go there. For those who want to contribute aid to Gaza, there are recognised channels to go through, which include the United Nations. We encourage that. There are ways in which people can take aid directly and use existing channels to ensure that it gets through. However, as she will be aware, there are opportunities taken where the political point of breaking the blockade appears to be almost as important as any of the humanitarian aid behind it, with sometimes tragic consequences, so we are right to be cautious. We want to ensure that those who feel strongly have an opportunity to express it, and there are legitimate ways to do so. However, we do not encourage unauthorised activity, hard though it may be for some to accept. We advise people to use the official channels to support Gaza.</p>

	<p pid="a.118.1/1">We had a number of interesting conversations about the convoys while there, and one concern expressed to us was that, in many instances, the goods being provided were not the things that were desired. Medical supplies have far too much of some things, and far too little of others. They do not need more Tamiflu, and they do not need old X-ray scanners; they would rather have some spare parts. Perhaps people considering sending convoys could first find out what is wanted and needed, and then go.</p>

	<p pid="a.118.2/1">That makes a lot of sense. The aid agencies actively involved are very good and know what they are doing. However, I do not want this to be misconstrued. We do not want the aid agencies to be there at all. We want the economy to be working properly, and we want Gaza to be a fully functioning part of the middle east.</p>

	<p pid="a.118.3/1">Mine is a question raised often by constituents. Their belief is that the UN aid is not getting through. Can the Minister reassure me on the Government's view of whether that aid is getting through to Gaza?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2010-11-08a.118.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40435" speakername="Alistair Burt" colnum="118"  time="020:22:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm101108/debtext/101108-0003.htm#10110831000207">
	<p pid="a.118.4/1">As I indicated earlier, we know there are capacity problems, but in the main we believe that aid gets through. I do not think it is fair for people to feel that, if they send it through a recognised source, sometimes it all just sits there. There were more issues with that in the past, but we have found, since the flotilla incident, that the Israelis are genuinely moving more goods through, and have responded to the concerns. There might be individual instances of hold-up, and where that happens all pressure should be applied, However, there is a logistical problem with the amount of aid, to which I just referred, and the hon. Lady was right to pick up on that.</p>
	<p pid="a.118.4/2">I made the point about ensuring that if the business elite in Gaza are given the opportunity to develop and grow, and handle things themselves, they can be a counterweight to radicalisation. John Ging made an interesting point to me this morning. He said that the closing of the tunnels, with more goods travelling through official routes, has not met with what might have been anticipated, which was an aggressive response from militants seeking to disrupt official traffic. They have gone along with it, partly because, we think, the business community and others have made it clear that they want to see the official channels open and will not accept the militants and extremists getting in the way of the development of the economy. That is good news for those who believe that the economy is the key to the future of Gaza.</p>
	<p pid="a.118.4/3">There are issues on the Palestinian side, however, that also need improvement. The Department for International Development is working closely with the Palestinian Authority to help increase its co-ordination of goods into Gaza and to speed up the approvals process. I would like to reiterate the call for Hamas to release Gilad Shalit, because it is clearly unacceptable that he remains in captivity after four years. The Foreign Secretary met the Shalit family during his visit to Israel and heard their experiences at first hand. I also call on Hamas to end its interference in humanitarian operations in Gaza.</p>
	<p pid="a.118.4/4">I am sure that hon. Members would agree, following the remarks of the hon. Member for Cambridge, that there are sobering facts on the ground, and that reconstructing Gaza will require vast amounts of reconstruction and development support. He concluded by asking what the British Government are doing and what more we intend to do to fulfil resolution 1860 and other requirements. The United Kingdom should play, and is playing, its part, primarily through aid provided by DFID. We are providing basic services to Palestinian refugees through funding for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency. Some 70% of Gazans are refugees who rely heavily on it. Last week the Minister of State for International Development, who was on a visit to the west bank, announced an additional &#163;8 million for UNRWA, bringing our total support for 2010 to &#163;27 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.118.4/5">Turning to the Gazan economy, we have just announced a further &#163;2 million in new funding to support the recovery of Gaza's dormant and damaged private sector, which was laid waste after Operation Cast Lead. That will help 300 existing businesses and four start-ups to generate an additional $5 million in revenue and employ an extra 2,200 people. Finally, we are funding the United Nations and Palestinian Authority teams working to facilitate access to imports in Gaza.</p>

	<p pid="a.119.0/1">The Minister referred to the severe problems with good water supplies and the offshore pollution along the coastal strip. Will he say whether the Government are working with others to deal with what is both an environmental and a health crisis? Clearly we cannot deal with it on our own, but is that on the agenda of DFID or his Department? Clearly, not much has been satisfactorily achieved so far, so what more can we do?</p>

	<p pid="a.119.1/1">So as not to flannel my hon. Friend, I should give a better response when I have spoken to colleagues in DFID. I know that the problem that he raises is a serious one, and it is also caught with the problem of construction materials, which are vital to do the work that is necessary for the sewerage system and the like.</p>

	<p pid="a.119.2/1">We were disturbed by the appalling situation -which we could smell as we drove along the beach-of sewage going into the sea. The terrible consequence is that the sewage is finding its way back into the land through the water table, which is serious for agricultural development as well.</p>

	<p pid="a.120.0/1">My hon. Friend describes an unbearable situation. I know that colleagues are on to it, so rather than speak in generalities I will find some detail. Indeed, if he submits a written question, I can supply an answer, and that will disseminate the information more widely.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.0/2">On the diplomatic side, we are working closely with the UN, the office of the Quartet representative- Mr Blair-and the European Union to co-ordinate the international community's demand for further progress. Mr Blair has played a very important role on Gaza, and was helpful in the period immediately following the flotilla incident. He did a great deal of work-and continues to do so-with the Government to deal with the authorities there. We are also working with the European Union to co-ordinate the international community's demand for further progress. Although we welcome the steps that Israel has taken so far, we need to see further progress. In particular, we want to see faster approvals for key UN reconstruction projects. The international community is listening closely to UNRWA's feedback. We urge Israel to work with UNRWA to expedite its reconstruction plans, particularly for schools. We want Israel also to show greater flexibility on the movement of people and exports, in order to increase employment, reduce aid dependency and allow the full movement of humanitarian workers.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.0/3">There is a final point to make this evening. Sometimes I worry that a given situation remains unresolved because, in reality, it suits all parties, rather than those most affected, to leave it be. For Israel, Gaza is a heavy security risk-a dagger potentially pointing at its heart, through Hamas. It is a place of missed opportunities, following-Israel believes-the generosity of its withdrawal. For Hamas, Gaza is a counter to Fatah-an element in its war with Fatah, as much as in its role of resistance to Israel. For Egypt, Gaza is a conundrum too-part of the need to resolve the Palestinian situation, but where, in authority, it finds a political entity to which it is opposed, and in whose success it has no more vested interest than Israel. In the middle are the people-the children; those whose future could and should be so much better; those who, as my hon. Friend the Member for Cambridge said, are crying out for leadership, to take them out of this situation, and for a future.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.0/4">The only path is that Gaza will be part of the ultimate settlement in the middle east. That is why we and other parties are urging those involved in the direct negotiations to keep at it. We are pressing both sides to stay with the talks, to overcome the difficulties on settlements. That is why the Foreign Secretary pressed the point in relation to Israel, and why all friends of both Israel and Palestine should keep the parties at it. Ultimately, Gaza's future salvation lies in a comprehensive peace settlement: the two-state solution, which is so important.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.0/5">As my hon. Friend the Member for Cambridge said, time is running out. My story meets his in terms of those he spoke to. A couple of years ago, I was on Israel's northern border and talking to some of the young people-they are very young-who guard those border posts. I asked them whether their children and grandchildren would be doing the same thing, and they thought that they probably would be. That is as sad and depressing as my hon. Friend's story.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.0/6">We have lived through momentous times during our period in Parliament. We have seen the unresolvable dealt with, and we have seen all sorts of things change during the past 20 or 30 years. The most intractable political problems have been solved, and it is always possible that that can happen in the middle east. The time is now.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.0/7">I hope to visit Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories early next year. I have been to the west bank and Israel, and I hope to have the opportunity to go to Gaza. I will take a message from this House that we are all determined to redouble our efforts to drive the peace process forward, and we look to all those in the region and beyond to join us for the sake of all those in Gaza we have spoken about tonight.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.0/8" class="italic"> Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.0/9" class="italic"> House adjourned.</p>
