<li>(1) whether, in view of the declaration of war by Italy against this country, the British Government any longer feels itself bound to recognise in the future Italian rights in connection with Ethiopia; and whether the Government holds itself free to consider any proposals that may be laid before it in this connection by His Majesty Haile Selassie, or by the Ethiopian people;</li>

<p>I am happy to state that His Majesty's Government and the Japanese Government have signed in Tokyo to-day an Agreement on certain local questions relating to the British Concession at Tientsin. These questions include police arrangements for the suppression of terrorist acts and the more effective maintenance of law and order, the circulation of currency in the Concession, and the disposal and custody of the silver reserves in a Chinese bank in the Concession. The arrangement covering this latter point has received the assent of the Chinese Government. In order not to occupy the time of the House with a long statement on this matter at the present time, I will, with the hon. Member's permission, circulate certain further details in the OFFICIAL REPORT. I should, however, like to say that His Majesty's Government welcome the conclusion of this Agreement in the confidence that it will facilitate the removal of at least some of the disabilities under which British and other third Power nationals and their trading and shipping interests have been suffering in China, and also as a manifestation of the possibility of solving the mutual difficulties between our country and Japan by patient negotiation.</p>

<p>I would like to ask my right hon. Friend two questions. Will he tell the House what has happened regarding the barricades that were erected round the Settlement, and can he say whether his reply referring to the silver deposited refers to the whole of the Chinese silver in British hands or what proportion of British silver; also whether it refers to that silver only?</p>

<p>In answer to the first point, the barricades round the concession are now being removed; and in regard to the


second point, I think I should prefer to call it the Chinese silver. The Agreement provides for about one-tenth of the total amount to be used for the humanitarian purpose of relieving distress among the famine-stricken population in the Northern areas, while the balance will remain under seal in the bank until its ultimate disposal can be decided later.</p>

<p>Certain particulars of the Agreement relating to Tientsin signed at Tokyo on 19th June on behalf of His Majesty's Government and the Japanese Government are being laid before the House in a White Paper. This paper comprises a joint communiqu&#x00E9; summarising the objects of the police agreement together with the text of the agreements reached on silver and currency. I would add the following observations to what I said in my Oral reply to the hon. Member.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1940-06-19a.141.2" colnum="141" time="">
<p>The police arrangements provide for closer co-operation between the British municipal administration and the local Japanese authorities in cases against persons in whose criminal activities the latter are interested. I wish to emphasise, however, that in such cases the necessary action will always be taken by the municipal police themselves and that the administrative integrity of the British Concession is fully preserved in the Agreement.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1940-06-19a.141.3" colnum="141" time="">
<p>The Japanese Government have contended that the silver reserves belong to the people of North China and should be surrendered for their use. The Chinese Government on the other hand claim their ownership as part of the reserves for the national currency. The provisional agreement now reached does not prejudge this issue. It provides that about one-tenth of the total amount shall be used for the humanitarian purpose of relieving distress among the famine-stricken population in the northern area, while the balance shall remain under seal in the bank until its ultimate disposal can be decided in a less controversial atmosphere than is now possible. This settlement of the problem has received the assent of the Chinese Government.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1940-06-19a.141.4" colnum="141" time="">
<p>The circulation of the Chinese national currency within the British municipal area will continue. Federal Reserve Bank notes have, however, for some time past circulated side by side with the national

currency. This existing state of affairs is recognised in the Agreement.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1940-06-19a.142.0" colnum="142" time="">
<p>As hon. Members are aware, barricades have for the past year been maintained round the Concession and numerous restrictions have been imposed on its residents. These barricades and restrictions are now being removed and the Japanese authorities in North China have also undertaken to do everything in their power to suppress any anti-British action or agitation in the regions under their control.</p>

It was added that the occupation is of a provisional character, and that all the rights of interested Powers and of the established services in the zone would be respected.</p>

that close liaison exists between the design, production and maintenance directorates of this department to ensure that unnecessary elaborations in specifications are eliminated before production commences.

In addition the local technical staff stationed at firms have since the Ministry was formed been given wider discretionary power to release equipment not conforming precisely to specification.</p>

<p>The Inter-Departmental Committee set up to consider offers from the Dominions, the United States and elsewhere for the reception of British children overseas has presented its Report, and the Government has adopted it as a basis for approach to the Dominion Governments. The Report will be published forthwith, and copies will be available in the Vote Office this evening. An executive body to be called the Children's Overseas Reception Board will immediately be established with the necessary secretarial staff to administer the scheme in this country. The Chairman of this Board will be the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, who will answer all Questions in Parliament in connection with the operation of the scheme. He will be assisted by an Advisory Council composed of persons with experience of the problems involved. Lord Snell has consented to act as Chairman of this Advisory Council, and the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Education, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Health and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Pensions have also agreed to serve on the Advisory Council.<br/>
His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom are deeply grateful for the generous offers received from the Dominions and elsewhere to maintain and educate for the period of war children sent out from Great Britain. The Government consider the establishment of the necessary machinery for the operation of the scheme to be a matter of the utmost urgency. Preliminary discussions have already taken place with representatives of His Majesty's Governments in the Dominions, and I have every confidence that the consent of those Governments

and complete co-operation in the scheme will be forthcoming at an early date.</p>

<p>I would refer my hon. Friend to the statement made on 22nd May by my right hon. Friend the Lord Privy Seal as to the establishment of the Production Council and local organisations based on area boards to deal with the regulation of labour supply. The Labour Supply Committees are beginning to function, and a staff of inspectors of labour supply has been appointed. The immediate duties of these bodies will include a survey of the labour position in their areas and the arrangements for transferring workpeople from one factory or job to another as required to secure the best use of available labour. Skilled engineers at present engaged on nonessential production who want to transfer to armaments work should give their names and addresses and occupations to the local Employment Exchange, but they should not leave their present employment until asked to do so. I have no information that permission is being refused to men engaged on less essential work to leave their employment for work of national importance. If my hon. Friend has knowledge of such cases, perhaps he would be good enough to send me particulars. I would also refer my hon. Friend to the reply I have just given


to the hon. Member for Llanelly (Mr. J. Griffiths) on the subject of the health and welfare of workers.</p>

<p>I beg to move, "That the Clause be read a Second time."<br/>
This new Clause deals with certain aspects of excess profits taxation. The House will remember that when we discussed it on the Committee stage I gave an undertaking to take into consideration

a number of suggestions that were made then. I stated that I was impressed with the case that had been put in relation to companies working wasting assets. On further consideration of the matter, I had to admit that a case had been made out for allowing a higher percentage upon the capital of concerns engaged in obtaining minerals, oils, or similar natural wasting sources. In such cases the return on the capital must provide, over the life of the wasting source, for the amortisation of the capital expended on the undertaking. This is particularly necessary at the present time because the wastage of such assets during the war has been and will be accelerated by the demands made on industry for increased output, and this, of course, inevitably affects our natural resources. The Government have recently made many requests in cases of this kind which have been responded to by the concerns affected.<br/>
This new Clause will affect two classes of percentages on capital. The first is the 6 per cent. and 8 per cent. laid down in Clause 27 of the Bill in relation to the application for a substituted standard where the profits of the standard period are very low. The second is the statutory percentages of 8 per cent. or 10 per cent. on capital prescribed in Section 13, Subsection (9) of the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1939, as amended by Clause 31 (2) of this Bill. I think it is right to weight the allowance for this particular factor and to provide for a ceiling of the ordinary rate plus a further rate of 4 per cent. It is true that under the provisions of the new Clause the Board of Referees might, in theory, grant the whole of the additional 4 per cent. in any case that comes before them. I suggest that it would be much more likely that, although the maximum addition to be made in the most extreme type of case might go to that extent, the Board will grant additions of 1, 2 or 3 per cent. in cases of this description. It is for the Board of Referees to decide whether an application is made by a body of persons who can claim to represent any sufficient part of a trade or business, and they will decide whether an application can be made in general terms or whether individual application will have to be made. On the last occasion the Committee agreed with me that this was a case that I should meet. I have considered the other cases, but this is the only one which is not met by other


provisions in the Bill. It is, I think, a fair and reasonable concession to make.</p>

<p>Those of us who have been connected with the mining industry are wary about this proposal. I well recall that at the end of the 1926 stoppage in the coal industry, when we made new wages agreements, we had to discuss a re-arrangement of the ascertainment of wages, and the question of what permissible costs apart from wages were to be set off came under consideration. The question raised by this new Clause was then brought forward, and the claim was made that, because the mining industry was engaged in obtaining a wasting asset, that coal was being worked and that some day it would be worked away and all the capital sunk in it lost, therefore the owners were entitled to claim an amortisation allowance. I would remind the Chancellor that that claim was closely argued. In the end it was withdrawn in some areas, the owners being convinced that a claim had not been made out, but where it was not withdrawn it was submitted to independent arbitration and turned down.<br/>
I would ask the Chancellor to give further consideration to this question. Those of us who are connected with the mining industry want to see the owners given the same fair play as everybody else, but we do not want to see, and we shall not stand for, profits being made out of the mining industry in this war on the scale on which they were made in the last war. In company with my colleagues in South Wales, I attended a conference last Saturday at Cardiff at which the miners were asked, and willingly and enthusiastically gave, a pledge to do their utmost in the national interest at this time. They were asked to give up things which they valued very much. The South Wales miners were asked to work on a Sunday night, and that was asking them to do something against their religious instincts. They were asked to give up practices and customs, and they agreed to give them up willingly because they believed they were thereby doing a service to the nation. A personal appeal was made by my hon. Friend the Secretary for Mines. We were asked, "If the miners respond to this appeal and put forward their best effort, are we sure that

that effort is being made for the nation and not for the profit of individuals?" We replied, what we all understood to be the case, that the profits of the coal mining industry would be subject to the same provisions as other industries, and that there would be 100 per cent. tax on all excess profits.<br/>
What is the position in which the Chancellor is placing us to-day? Under this new Clause the mining industry may be able to get more favourable terms and extra profits. That is the meaning of it. They will be able to go to the tribunal and say, "We are working in the mining industry, engaged upon what is a wasting asset and therefore we are entitled to an increased rate of dividend, to something over and above what is going to other industries." It is not merely the coal that is a wasting asset; the life of the miner is a wasting asset, and when men are asked to speed up in the pits it means that they are being asked to take greater risks. We are not merely speeding up production but speeding up danger. I would speak frankly and say that this is not the time to give the mine owners greater profits.</p>

<p>I understand that this provision does not apply to royalty owners. We settled the royalty owners a long time ago, and they have no claim. I ask the Chancellor to consider the point of view I have put forward, because it is not a service to the nation but a disservice to give the owners of coal this augmentation of profits. We know what the position is now. We know that profits are being made, far too large profits. Why should the owners be allowed to make this appeal? It is an appeal which has been turned down before. It is something they have tried in wages ascertainment negotiations for many years past. As it has been turned down in that connection why should the Chancellor admit the claim now? The Chancellor said that representations had been made to him about the matter. In days like these, when we want national unity, it should have occurred to him that in a matter of this kind, having regard to the agreements existing in the mining industry, the men's representative should have been con-


stlted. In the wages ascertainment arrangements, first of all the prices realised for coal are ascertained and then there is set off against that sum wages costs and costs other than wages. Therefore, proposals of this kind vitally affect the wages of the men. Was any consideration given to the question of consulting the Mineworkers' Federation of Great Britain? The Financial Secretary to the Treasury was for years Secretary for Mines, and in considering this problem he must have had in the background of his mind his knowledge of the mining industry and its problems. Why should not the Mineworkers' Federation be consulted? It has quite as much right to be consulted as have the mine owners. Therefore, I ask the Chancellor to withdraw this Clause. In the interests of the nation we have asked the miners to give everything for the nation, and they will do so, but if it goes out from this House that we are giving the mine owners more profits, that will undermine anything that we are doing.</p>

<p>I do hope that my hon. Friends opposite will not think that I am speaking on behalf of property or anything of that sort. I take an entirely different view from that which I was so very sorry to hear put forward by the hon. Member for Llanelly (Mr. J. Griffiths). I would remind him that during recent years the mining industry has been working under Government schemes. All bon. Members opposite know this. Those Government schemes have been introduced under the Coal Mines Act for the reason that the mining industry, and particularly the export section of it, has been a depressed industry. The mine owners, I mean the working owners, the lessees, have been controlled by sales schemes and all sorts of things, and in the depressed sections of the mining industry, as hon. Members opposite know very well, there has been a constant carrying forward of deficits on wages ascertainments, particularly in Durham and South Wales.</p>

<p>No, let me put my point. I want to put it fairly. Hon. Members also know that as the war approached and since the war has started the mine owners of this country have been called upon by the Government to make superhuman efforts

to increase production in order to increase the export trade.</p>

<p>Yes, and the miners. I want hon. Members to listen patiently. I am not trying to put a hostile case. Indeed, so different is the position that I wish the hon. Member for Chester-le-Street (Mr. Lawson), with whom I have talked this over, were here. I very much regret his absence from the House. What was the position? These mining companies, which had been struggling in these depressed areas, had little or no finance with which to open up and develop additional coal faces. They were in grave financial difficulties. But, answering the call of the Government, they set to work to raise additional finance and to get the mines back into production. There is not an hon. Member opposite who does not know that in Durham, in South Wales and elsewhere coal is being produced to-day which none of us could have hoped two years ago would have been produced.<br/>
What was the position when the 100 per cent. Excess Profits Duty was introduced? It is not a standard of distributable profits. Hon. Members must realise that the standard profits are all that the owner of the business has to put aside for reserves, for capital improvements and for distribution of dividends&#x2014;they are all he has to deal with as his. All the rest belongs to the Government. Therefore, when the 100 per cent. Excess Profits Tax was introduced owners said, "We are willing to do all we can to get our mines back into full production. We want to employ every miner we can. There are miners whom we can get back into production, but we must have money to do it. If we have only the ordinary standards of profit left to us we shall not have finance with which to do it." It is not only the mine owners who are affected, but hundreds of thousands of miners cannot be brought back into work unless some exception is made for this particular depressed industry.<br/>
I make no apology to the House or to those who represent miners for saying that in the last three months I have been doing all I can to try to get out of my right hon. Friend an arrangement under which some special consideration shall be given to the mining industry in order that this great development of the mines of the


country may go on. I ask hon. Members who take the opposite view seriously to reconsider whether they are doing a wise thing, because, believe me, if this Clause does not go into the Bill, the extension of the mining industry which is so desperately necessary for our war effort, particularly in Durham and South Wales in respect of our export trade, is bound to be curtailed. Therefore, I beg my right hon. Friend to hold fast to the Clause, which I regard as one of the most essential in the Finance Bill.</p>

<p>I hope the Chancellor of the Exchequer will withdraw the proposed new Clause. If he does not, some of us will be almost compelled to vote against it in the Lobby. The hon. and learned Member for Ashford (Mr. Spens) began by stating that he did not intend to speak on behalf of the coalowners, but I thought he did extremely well for the coalowners. I do not know any hon. Member who could have delivered a better speech on behalf of the coalowners than that to which we have just listened. What were the reasons advanced by the hon. and learned Member? He argued that the coalowners had been hampered and had had put upon them conditions, such as those relating to sales associations and other things of that kind. In whose interests was that legislation passed? It gave power to the coal-owners to fix prices, to arrange production and to sell the coal. That legislation was passed in the interests of the coalowners and nobody else.</p>

<p>Yes, we supported it, because while it was in the interests of the coalowners, the miners also got some benefit. But our men would get no benefit whatever from the proposal in this new Clause. The hon. and learned Member for Ashford argued that in order to develop the coal mines at the present time, it was essential that the coalowners should have money. If they want money, let them get it as other people have to get it. Why should the Government provide them with money? I submit that the development of the coal mines in order to employ more miners does not depend

upon the coalowners getting more money. During the past week-end I was looking at an ascertainment in the county of Durham covering the past 12 months. It showed that the profit of the coalowners had been 1s. 5d. per ton. That is not a bad profit. Nobody can sneer at it. It is, indeed, a handsome profit, and when the coalowners are getting profits of 1s. 5d. a ton there is no need for the Chancellor of the Exchequer to extend any pity to them, or to say that because they are only getting 10 per cent. there should be power to bring that up to 14 per cent. That kind of thing we will not stand.<br/>
We remember how coalowners and others in 1929 were relieved of three-quarters of the local rates. Although industry has been having a good time since then, while owners of property have had to bear the burden of local rates, there has been no proposal to rescind that legislation or to ask the coalowners and other owners engaged in production to pay what they had been paying prior to 1929. That was one of the actions of the late Prime Minister when he was Minister of Health and when the present Chancellor of the Exchequer was Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry. They relieved the employers of three-quarters of the local rates, while poor people occupying houses and shopkeepers and others had to bear the burden of local rates. There is no proposal to put these employers of labour back where they were in 1929 in relation to local rates. We have also to remember that coalowners and others have had advantages in regard to reliefs for wastage of machinery and in other respects.<br/>
Now when we expected that the Government really intended to do something and to make coalowners and others pay 100 per cent. of their extra profits during the war, when we felt that, at last, a really important step was about to be taken in this direction, we have the Chancellor of the Exchequer coming forward with a proposal to make up the profits of coal-owners and others. This proposal applies not only to those engaged in coal-mining but also to those engaged in the extraction of oil. There cannot, however, be very many oil mines in this country, while we have an enormous number of coal mines. It is not right that the Chancellor of the Exchequer should at this time bring for-


ward a proposal to increase the profits of coalowners up to 14 per cent., and if he in tends to go on with it, we shall be compelled to go into the Lobby and vote against the Clause.</p>

<p>I think there is some misapprehension about the meaning of the proposed new Clause. I hardly think that anyone who has followed the discussions on the technical parts of the Finance Bill, and especially those who took part in the Committee discussions, would easily reconcile the speeches of the two hon. Members opposite with the actual proposal in the Clause. All we are doing in this Clause is to make an equitable arrangement in connection not only with coal mines, but with other concerns which have wasting assets. The Clause, I would emphasise, applies not to coal mining only, but to all mines and in particular to copper mines which are being called upon to produce, in one year, a copper output which normally would not appear for several years. It is very largely to assist concerns of that kind in the special circumstances existing to-day, that this concession is being made, and I do not think the fact has been sufficiently appreciated by hon. Members opposite that apart from new businesses and new capital it applies only in relation to the provisions of Clause 27 (2) of the Finance Bill. Those provisions relate to cases where there have been no profits in the standard period or where the profits of that period were
<q>so low that it would not be just to ascertain the standard profits of the trade or business by reference to the actual profits of the standard period.</q>
Therefore, this is not a proposal having results such as those to which hon. Members opposite have referred. It relates mainly to the particular cases which I have indicated, and the main purpose of the new Clause is to provide a fair standard for those concerns&#x2014;not only coal-mining concerns, but many others&#x2014;which may have had losses or which have had practically no profits at all in the standard period. Under Clause 27 provision is made for fixing a figure of 6 per cent. on the amount of the capital employed as a maximum in ascertaining the standard. The main object of what I propose to do in this Clause&#x2014;and I have rejected all the other proposals which were suggested to me&#x2014;is to provide that

in cases where there have been no profits in the standard period or where those profits were so low that it would not be just to ascertain the standard profits of the trade or business by reference to them, the Board of Referees shall have the right, on a case being made out to them, to increase the percentage by 4 per cent.</p>

<p>The right hon. Gentleman has obviously gone into this matter very carefully. He must be aware that of the cases which will be submitted, the great bulk will be cases of coalowners. It is plain that the coalowners are chiefly concerned, and the speech which we heard from the hon. and learned Member opposite was on behalf of the coal-owners. May I, then, ask the right hon.

<p>It is not a matter of a tonnage rate at all. It applies, as I have said, to cases in which the Commissioners of Inland Revenue or the Board of Referees are satisfied, in the words of Clause 27 (2):

<p>I take it that it would be a matter of the general profits of the concern, but perhaps the hon. Member will allow me to deal now with the point put by the hon. Member for Llanelly (Mr. J. Griffiths). I want to satisfy the hon. Member that there is a misapprehension of the purpose of the Clause. It applies mainly in the two cases which I have mentioned. Where there are no profits, there will be no doubt or difficulty. I should imagine that no one would argue that where there are no profits at all in the standard period, the Referees should not be able to put this extra percentage into operation. Then the hon. Member asks what is meant by profits which are so low as not to represent a fair standard. The Commissioners or the Referees themselves will have to be satisfied on the case presented to them, that it would not be just to ascertain the standard profits of a concern by reference to the actual profits of the standard period. They will have to determine, having taken into account all considerations whether or not it would be just in the special circumstances of the particular case to fix the standard profits by reference to the actual profits in the period.<br/>
The primary purpose of the new Clause is to give a fair standard to all those companies which have either losses or have made practically no profits at all in the standard year. I do not think the hon. Members opposite have appreciated the fact that for all ordinary trading concerns under Clause 27 six per cent. on the capital employed is the maximum nor do I think they have sufficiently appreciated the fact that the 100 per cent. Excess Profits Tax applies in these cases. This new Clause is an effort which is being made, I think justly and rightly, to give a reasonable standard to concerns which are in such a condition that the profits for the standard period would not be a fair or proper basis. Unless you do this, you are taking away from them not only the 100 per cent. excess profits, but probably the possibility of any profits at all, which would not, I think, be in the interests of anybody concerned. There is no attempt to give an extra 4 per cent. profit to the mining industry generally. It is merely an attempt to meet fairly a

very difficult situation in cases where it can be shown that the profits are so low that a standard calculated on them would not be just. I hope that hon. Members will be satisfied with that explanation. I would examine the matter further in order to see whether there are any additional safeguards which I can suggest to meet the points put by hon. Members, but I think they will find that it will be in the interests of everybody concerned that this proposal should be adopted.</p>

<p>As I understand the proposal, it is put forward to give to certain mines an opportunity of making a profit because they may have had a bad period, and also because the profit which it is intended by this Clause that they should have is dependent upon a wasting asset. I do not understand how coal, oil or any mining business is a wasting asset. It is a diminishing, but not a wasting, asset. The point which was put forward by my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Ashford (Mr. Spens) was a very good one, but was entirely beside the point of the proposed new Clause. The points put forward by the other side have also been very good, but I cannot see that to regard the use of minerals as a wasting asset, and as a basis for further provision for profit for the owners and operators of those mines, is the right course to adopt. If this course is accepted, it means the acceptance of a


very vicious principle. The basis upon which it is intended to make a reserve fund for the purpose of meeting losses suffered from time to time by mines&#x2014;like every other industry&#x2014;is wrong in principle, and I should like to see the proposed new Clause withdrawn.</p>

<p>I am glad that the Chancellor of the Exchequer is talking the matter over, because I can appeal to him more easily for reconsideration of the declaration which he has made. I do not think that he quite appreciates one point about the Excess Profits Tax. The argument about this tax has been used by every hon. Member on this side to convince the workers that, in this war, we are to get a fair deal, and that Parliament is calling upon the wealthy classes of this country. The right hon. Gentleman ought not to forget that the miners have an organisation; he seems to have forgotten its existence altogether. He says he does not think the organisation ought to be consulted. May I remind him that this proposal affects adversely or otherwise every miner in the country? I do not think the right hon. Gentleman has yet appreciated that wages in the mining industry are settled in relation to the whole proceeds of the industry.<br/>
We have no desire to divide the House on this matter, but the proposal will not get approval from hon. Members on this

side, especially from the mining Members, in its present form. The right hon. Gentleman tells us that he has brought the proposal forward only because he was afraid that the mining industry might suffer an injustice. Very few mines are in operation which were not operating on 3rd September last year. There may be some colliery companies which were not making excess profits on 3rd September; the profits in the quarter at the end of July were not as good as their owners desired them to be. The right hon. Gentleman must not be surprised if we are not impressed by his arguments. He does not appear to know&#x2014;I say it in all humility&#x2014;as much about this Clause as does the hon. and learned Member for Ashford (Mr. Spens), who was very honest. He told us that he had been working for weeks and weeks to get this Clause, and, having got it, he hopes that this side of the House, whom he never consulted, will be convinced by what the Chancellor of the Exchequer has said.</p>

<p>We know the hon. and learned Member for Ashford. We remember where he stood during the discussions on the nationalisation of royalties. We know that he is not the champion of the miners, but the champion of the coalowners every time, when he speaks in this House. The Chancellor of the Exchequer must give serious reconsideration to this suggestion. During the last war, the coalowners of this country took every advantage to fill their pits with new machinery, paid for by the State. Let me warn the right hon. Gentleman that a similar thing is not happening now in the mining industry. The Secretary for Mines could tell him, as we have told him, that the coalowners of this country are taking great care of their own interests. They always do. I want the Chancellor of the Exchequer to reconsider this question. He has a consultative committee, consisting of representatives of owners and men in the mining industry, national leaders on each


side. Surely this important question should be sent to that committee for consideration. The committee should be asked to consider it. The right hon. Gentleman need not be afraid that the national leaders of the miners will not consider every fair proposal. They do not want the coalowners to be treated worse than other concerns, but they do not want proposals brought forward in this House which would give the coal-owners preferential treatment.<br/>
At the moment I do not like talking in this House, because my mind is occupied with the serious crisis in which we are placed. I have a job to talk at any time, but when I find an issue brought here which I know will endanger the supreme effort of the miners, I must tell the right hon. Gentleman that, if it gets about in this country to-day that he is championing a proposal which will defeat the 100 per cent. Excess Profits Tax, he will undermine the confidence and the effort of the miners, without which this war, and any other war, cannot be won. I therefore ask the right hon. Gentleman to reconsider the proposal. Before the Bill gets to another place will he consult both sides of the industry? We have no desire to divide the House to-day, and there will be no Division so far as I am concerned. I want the Chancellor to say, in return, that, between now and the Bill getting to another place, he will consult both sides of the industry.</p>

<p>I should like to add a word or two to the discussion. I think we should congratulate the hon. Member for Southampton (Mr. Craven-Ellis) upon the point of view he has put. If the proposal of the right hon. Gentleman were carried out, our people in the mining industry might share what could be veritably called the loot, but we are not wishful to do it, from any point of view. We realise, as my hon. Friend the Member for Ince (Mr. G. Macdonald) has said, that, in the immediate winning of new coal, old mines are not likely to be opened. It is largely going to be done by further development of existing mines. Not only in the producing, but in the coal-consuming regions there will be great dissent from the right hon. Gentleman's proposal. I heard the hon. and learned Member for Ashford (Mr. Spens) talk

about wasting assets, the implication being that the coal was a wasting asset. We do not object to the idea that the machinery which is used to get the coal is a wasting asset, but to talk about the coal being a wasting asset is like a shopkeeper who sells bacon over the counter saying that he is selling a wasting asset.<br/>
We are definitely against the proposal. I contrast the suggestion of the right hon. Gentleman and the terms which are brought forward with those meted out by the Government to the human material that they take to fight in the winning of this war. I remember that we discussed to what extent we should have regard to the standard of living in the households from which young men have been taken to fight the country's battles. Like my hon. Friend the Member for Ince, I loathe getting up and striking a discordant note, or anything which might tend to lower the morale of the fighting men of the country in these serious times, but I would point out to the right hon. Gentleman that there is a volume of protest in the country against this proposal, and, in view of the difficulties to which it may give rise, I suggest that the right hon. Gentleman withdraw the proposal forthwith.</p>

<p>I ask the Chancellor, in the interests of the country, to withdraw this Clause entirely. We miners' representatives desire that the output shall be maintained, and, in fact, increased. I cannot see in this Clause anything but a severe blow at the loyalty and enthusiasm of the miners of this country. I was in my division attending a church parade on Sunday; and at three of the pits there they were finding coal, although they had never before done anything of the kind on a Sunday since the pits were sunk. There were 800 or 900 men working in the pits that day. They were doing that in order to pull their


weight in defeating the enemy. This is not a case of working on Sunday nights, as in South Wales, where a cherished religious principle has been given away in order to allow of coal being mined on Sunday nights. In Yorkshire, they have worked on Sunday nights during the whole time that I have been in the county, which is over 40 years.<br/>
On Sunday I presented medals to two men of the British Legion. There had been a big march to church, and the men were full of loyalty to the country. At the ceremony I impressed upon them the need for every man to throw his full weight into the job, so that we might win. If I go back next Sunday the men will say, "George, what are they doing down yonder?" That is the way we talk there. I say to the Lord Privy Seal and to the Chancellor of the Exchequer that, instead of increasing output in the mining industry, this will make our fellows feel that their efforts are for the profit of the coalowners, and for nothing else. I am amazed at the profits that have been made in my coalfield during the last five months. In that time, the Yorkshire coalfield has made profits of &#x00A3;2,250,000. That is "shown profit," as one of my colleagues says. Even for last month, the profits are shown by the ascertainments to have been &#x00A3;495,000. The Clause says:
<q>Provided that no order shall provide for increasing the said percentages by more than a further 4 per cent.</q>
It does not say, "more than 4 per cent.," but "more than a further 4 per cent." My hon. Friend the Member for Llanelly (Mr. J. Griffiths) asked the Chancellor what is the basis of the minimum profit upon which he is prepared to put this percentage; and the Chancellor said that he did not know. They have no basis. They do not start from the minimum of no profit at all. If they did that, and said, "These pits that have had no profit can have 4 per cent.," we could understand that. But they are to be allowed an additional 4 per cent. over the profits that they have made already. We have supported this Government, almost to the detriment of some of our own political beliefs. We feel that the country is in a difficulty, and that it is up to every man in the pits to pull his full weight; and the men have agreed to do so. I said to my men the other day, "You are under conscription now." They

will say, "If we are under conscription, the coalowners must be as well." I have a great feeling in my own soul that this will help to reduce the output. I was talking the other day to a man who had only just come off work at the pit. He said, "I went to the pit the other day, feeling dead beat before I started, but I carried on because the Minister of Mines made an appeal to us over the wireless. I had to work, although I did not feel fit to do so." There are thousands of men doing that sort of thing, and this Clause will not encourage them to go on.</p>

<p>This is a lesson to Law Officers not to come in and listen to the discussion on parts of the Finance Bill which in no way concern them. Since I have offended against the rule, and am here, I had better say something about it. I think, first, that there has been a good deal of misapprehension about what this Clause does, and, secondly, that it is enormously important that we should carry everybody with us, because the unity which we have at present is vital. If we endanger that in any way, we endanger our whole existence. Before I say what I have in mind&#x2014;which I hope and believe will give some satisfaction to hon. Members opposite&#x2014;let me examine quite simply what this Clause does. It is a great mistake to think that this is any departure from the 100 per cent. Excess Profits Tax. Any Excess Profits Tax presupposes a standard. It is on profits over that standard that 100 per cent. is to be levied. There are obviously certain cases in which it is difficult to ascertain what the standard should be. Take, for instance, the simple case of a company beginning with a loss. It starts off with a loss; then, it may, for a few years, break even. It does not follow that the company has not a very good prospect for the future. In cases like that, what are you to do about fixing your standard? Clause 27 provides for that. It provides, broadly, that where you have no profits in the standard year, or where the profits in that year are so low that it would not be just to compute a standard by reference to those profits, you may apply to the Commissioners, and make out your case&#x2014;you are not automatically granted this concession&#x2014;and they may then give you a standard, the amount of which is not


fixed, except that the maximum may not be more than 6 per cent., or sometimes 8 per cent.</p>

<p>Let me just finish. It was pointed out to the Chancellor that even this standard in certain cases would create very great hardship. The matter arose, in the first instance, not in relation to coal mines, but in relation to other concerns; but if we are to make a concession for which an overwhelming case has been made, an obvious industry to be assisted is the coal industry. When you are dealing with a mine you are dealing with what may be fairly called a wasting asset. It was obviously necessary to give the Commissioners power to fix a standard for a company whose standard year would show no profit at all, or a very low profit. Faced with the present emergency, we may want mineowners to open up a new section of a coal mine which involves considerable capital expenditure. As a matter of common sense, they would have to provide for writing off so much of that capital every year. If you only allowed them to have the 6 or the 8 per cent. provided in Clause 27, it would not be possible for them to write off any part of the capital expenditure which they have to make.<br/>
I am satisfied that there is no risk of injustice to hon. Gentlemen opposite, and I know that if I could make out this case to them, they would agree. If only time is given to consider this matter, they will see the justice of this case, and I would far rather carry this by consent than try to force it through the House by putting on the Whips and having a Division, and so would the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Therefore, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, with whom I have had the opportunity of discussing this matter, has authorised me to say this. It is inevitable that in a very few months' time

he will be introducing another Finance Bill. He is quite prepared not to press this Clause in order to allow ample time for discussion, and if I may, I will place myself at the disposal of hon. Members opposite and assist in any way I can. While we do not weaken in our view that this Clause is right, fair and proper, yet we would very much rather carry it with the consent of hon. Members opposite than against their wishes. Therefore, the Chancellor authorises me to say to the House that we will not press this Clause at the present time, but hon. Members must not understand this as a weakening or faltering in our desire to have this Clause carried. Indeed, I have already said that we are, in substance, committed to it, but in order that it may be carried, as I am confident it will be, with the assent of hon. Members opposite, we will not press it now, it being understood that we reserve to ourselves the full right, after the fullest consultation with hon. Members opposite, to put it in the next Finance Bill.</p>

<p>I rise to thank the Solicitor-General, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer who has authorised this statement, for the concession which the Solicitor-General has just announced. I wish to say, speaking not only for myself but for all my hon. Friends who are associated with me, that it would have been a very great regret to us if any matter such as this had led to differences and a Division in this House. I am sure that the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Solicitor-General will share our view that, even if the new Clause had been forced through by means of a Division, it would not in any way have mitigated the very serious result which would have ensued. Clearly we are looking to the miners of this country to do heroic work at great strain, and, as it has been pointed out by one of my hon. Friends, at risk to their own bodily health and safety, and it would be a very great misfortune if in their opinion, rightly or wrongly, a concession was being made which was unjustifiable. Had this been part of the original Bill, or had it been brought in on the Committee stage, there would have been plenty of time for everyone to consider the matter. If it had been brought in on the Report stage in ordinary times, no doubt my hon. Friends and I would have


examined meticulously every line of the proposal, and we could have fought it out with the Chancellor of the Exchequer. On this occasion the circumstances, as we all know, are very exceptional, and there has not been time or opportunity for this matter to be fully considered. Therefore, in view of the fact that this could not be altered at any stage in this Bill, as we propose to take the Third Reading to-day, and, as hon. Members in all parts of the House know, no Amendments can be made in the Finance Bill in another place, the Chancellor of the Exchequer has shown wisdom and courtesy&#x2014;and we thank him&#x2014;in coming to the only solution which meets the case. If, as the Solicitor-General hopes and believes, this Clause can be demonstrated in discussions to be thoroughly sound, I am sure that no one will be more willing to be convinced than my hon. Friends if that meets the justice of the case. It will not prejudice the Chancellor of the Exchequer in any way because the Excess Profits Tax will take a considerable time, and we are promised this in a Finance Bill at an early date. Therefore I hope that the trouble which has arisen is now fully ended.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 5, line 37, to leave out "is," and to insert "was."<br/>
In moving this Amendment, which also stands in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing (Sir F. Sanderson) and my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Ayr Burghs (Sir T. Moore), I should like to deal at the same time with the following Amendment on the Paper&#x2014;in page 5, line 38, leave out from "1920," to "or," in line 41, and insert:
<q>during some period during which a licence under the said Section thirteen was in force in respect of the vehicle.</q>
The object of these Amendments is to provide officers and men returning on leave from outside this country with greater facilities for using motor transport than they have under the Clause as

it stands. I need not go in detail into this matter. It was fully discussed during the Committee stage of the Bill, but unfortunately, through no fault of my own, I was unable to be here at that time. I have read all the speeches which were made and the arguments which were put forward in opposition to the Amendment which was then put upon the Paper, and which went a good deal further than the Amendments on the Paper to-day. I realise that there are other arguments in addition to that of opening the door too widely. To open the door widely would be to the benefit of the Chanceller of the Exchequer because every additional licence that is taken out brings additional revenue to the Exchequer, but I realise that there are other considerations. Circumstances have changed materially in the last few weeks, and in the last few days.<br/>
This Amendment will give an officer or man the opportunity of getting a permit for a car which has at any time been registered in his name, notwithstanding the fact that he may have transferred the car to a member of his family or a friend or even sold it. But if such a car has at any time been registered in his name, he will be able under the Amendment to obtain a permit for the use of the car. That opens the door a little but nothing like as much as I would like to see it opened. The House is agreed on the principle that serving men who come home on leave from overseas should have as much opportunity as possible of making full use of the short time at their disposal, and motor transport is very necessary for them to get about to see their friends and enjoy themselves. We cannot do too much for them, and my Amendment would give them more facilities than they can obtain under the Clause as it stands. I am sure that the Chancellor of the Exchequer is sympathetic in this matter and that all Members of the House will wish to do everything possible on behalf of these men. I hope that in the circumstances the Chancellor of the Exchequer will not consider that I am trying to open the door too much, and that he will agree to accept the Amendment.</p>

For this Amendment and the following Amendment on the Paper we are indebted to the hon. Member for the Abbey Division of Westminster (Sir H. Webbe), who pointed out the possible danger of using the words in Sub-section (2) of Clause 15 "or entitled to occupy." The point of the Clause is this: If a man having, for instance, a block of flats uses some part of that block of flats for his own purpose, in order to arrive at Schedule A valuation you have not only to consider the rents he receives in respect of the parts he has let out but also what figure is appropriate to the occupation which he himself has, and you have to gross the figure up to that extent. If we use the words "himself occupying or entitled to occupy," it might bring in the case of a flat which is unoccupied, and which he is doing his best to let, but has not succeeded in letting. Therefore, in law, he is entitled to occupy that flat, but that is not what we mean; we mean that part of the premises which he is occupying. I think the words of the Amendment will give the effect which we and the House intended.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 33, line 1, to leave out "the purpose of."<br/>
The House may remember that on the Committee stage in dealing with the Excess Profits Tax I indicated that there was need for further amendment of what I might call the personal standard which exists as an alternative to actual profits in the cases of individuals, partnerships, and director-controlled companies. As the law now stands, the personal standard consists of &#x00A3;750 per person, with a maximum of &#x00A3;3,000 when there are four or more partners or controlling directors. There are, of course, many businesses which have low profits in standard years where it would be unfair to allow only &#x00A3;750 per head for the services of those running the business and to take the rest in taxes. There were a number of representations made by nearly everybody about this matter when the tax was less than 100 per cent., and now the Excess Profits Tax is 100 per cent. it makes the difficulty and injustice all the more. As no deduction is allowed in computing profits for E.P.T. purposes in respect of the remuneration of proprietors who are individuals or partners, it follows that where such partners or directors are actively employed in the business the figure of &#x00A3;1,000 or &#x00A3;750 per working proprietor represents remuneration for the services of the working proprietors and return for capital employed in the business.<br/>
I will give an example. Say you have a partnership which has &#x00A3;20,000 capital employed in the business. The minimum standard which at present obtains is &#x00A3;1,500. I think everybody will agree that that is clearly inadequate for the remuneration of two partners and a return on &#x00A3;20,000 capital. Accordingly, I am proposing that the figure of &#x00A3;750 per working proprietor should be increased to &#x00A3;1,500. The minimum standard where a business is carried on by a body corporate will remain at &#x00A3;1,000 as before, but where a business is carried on by an individual or partners or a director-controlled company, then it is suggested that there

should be such sum not exceeding &#x00A3;6,000, which is arrived at by taking &#x00A3;1,500 each per working proprietor, subject to a possible further addition not exceeding &#x00A3;4,000 or &#x00A3;1,000 for each working proprietor in certain cases. In cases where the minimum standard will remain at &#x00A3;1,000 these will cover all the companies not director-controlled and will also cover individual proprietors who take no active part in business but employ a manager to run the business on their behalf. In such cases a company is allowed to deduct directors' remuneration, and an individual proprietor is similarly allowed to deduct the salary of his manager so that the minimum standard is not intended to cover any element in respect of remuneration.<br/>
As regards other cases, the new figure of &#x00A3;1,500 for each working proprietor, with a maximum of &#x00A3;6,000, will be allowed in all ordinary cases where the business is carried on by an individual, a partnership, or a director-controlled company. There is also the provision which permits the Commissioners of Inland Revenue, where they are satisfied that the standard of &#x00A3;1,500 is inadequate, to increase by an additional sum not exceeding &#x00A3;1,000 for each working proprietor, or &#x00A3;4,000 in all. The proviso I have inserted is to meet cases of hardship, which are of two particular types. The first is where the ordinary minimum standard would be inadequate in view of the nature of the business. You may have a business where it is essential that they should employ a highly qualified technical expert whose remuneration in the ordinary way would be &#x00A3;2,500, and if he is a director and holds more than 5 per cent. of the share capital, his remuneration will not be deducted in computing profits, and unless this proviso is inserted the standard will be only &#x00A3;1,500. In such circumstances the Commissioners, if satisfied, will be able to allow an additional &#x00A3;1,000.<br/>
The second type of case is where the normal minimum standard will he inadequate having regard to the size of business as shown by its assets. For example, there may be three partners, working proprietors, and the capital employed is, say, &#x00A3;50,000. In such circumstances the minimum standard, apart from the proviso I have mentioned, would be &#x00A3;4,500 when the standard is supposed to


represent a reasonable remuneration for partners and something by way of return on capital. The figure of &#x00A3;4,500 cannot be fairly regarded as adequate remuneration for partners and return on capital. Again, in that case the Commissioners, if satisfied, could direct the standard to be increased by an extra &#x00A3;1,000 for each working proprietor, or &#x00A3;3,000 in all. I hope that adequately explains the meaning of the Amendment and that it will be generally acceptable to the House.</p>

<p>The Chancellor has explained this Clause with considerable lucidity and I think the House is in possession of the situation. With a great deal of what he says I find myself in agreement. The object of this Amendment is to rectify certain cases of hardship, and in so far as it confines itself to that I am prepared to support it. Further than that, taking the two Amendments together, I am glad to see he has put in a definition of the working proprietor, because without that definition a good many people calling themselves working proprietors might go to their offices for one hour each week and claim large remuneration for doing so. I am perfectly satisfied that the Inland Revenue ought to have a certain amount of latitude to go beyond the standard proposed in the earlier part of the Amendment where special cases demand it. But what I am not quite satisfied about&#x2014;and the Chancellor has not altogether allayed my misgivings&#x2014;is in regard to the paragraph beginning:
<q>(2) The minimum amount referred to.&#x2026;</q>
I am not quite satisfied why that should apply in all cases and why there should not be some discretion, not to allow this addition, left to the Inland Revenue. The Chancellor gave us, breezily, an example of a business with a capital of &#x00A3;20,000 and four working partners, and called attention to the fact that it might not earn more than &#x00A3;2,000. That may be the case, but suppose you take a weaker case&#x2014;a business with a small amount of capital, partners, earning small salaries, who have limited ideas, but owing to the war suddenly come into increased business without any particular exertion on their part. I do not quite see why a business which is now able to earn

double or treble the remuneration in years gone by should not be subject to this Excess Profits Tax. I hope it may be possible to make some addition to that first paragraph, so that the Inland Revenue should be satisfied and that there should not be universal application to all cases, whether it was wanted or whether it was not. I would be glad if someone on the Government Benches could explain why such a provision was made. I fear there will be some cases where there will be quite needless expansions as a result of which the Inland Revenue will lose money.</p>

<p>The answer is that owing to the raising of the basic rate of the Excess Profits Tax to 100 per cent. and the effect of that increase upon this class of case, it has been thought necessary to make this concession. It is a matter which will obviously have to be watched in the course of administration, and, if it is found to be too generous, steps will be taken to deal with it.

<p>I do not think we can, even in these days, allow the Third Reading of the Finance Bill of the year to pass <i>sub silentio.</i> I do not propose to take up a great amount of time in dealing with it. There is no doubt that the provisions of the Bill make very considerable inroads upon the resources of our people. When the Budget was introduced, and when the Second Reading of the Bill was being discussed in this House, the House showed unmistakably that, heavy as the burdens w ere which the Bill was imposing, they would be accepted, and so far from being considered too heavy the House realised that in their aggregate they were inadequate. If the House thought them to be inadequate at a time when the war was still in its quiescent stage and when our gallant Allies across the Channel were still in the full vigour of their military preparations, how much more are we forced to realise that they are inadequate to-day after the events of the last two months. Quite clearly, great as are the burdens which the Bill imposes on our people, it cannot be the last word with regard to the financial provisions of 1940&#x2013;41. The Chancellor of the Exchequer has told us that that is the case. There must be grave sacrifices of a financial character made by the country. They are grave as imposed by the Bill,

and they will be graver still we fear when the Chancellor of the Exchequer gives us his whole mind with regard to the finances of the year. But, viewed from the point of view of the whole burden which the country is bearing, these financial sacrifices are tiny and almost insignificant. The country will bear them gladly, almost willingly, knowing that they are absolutely necessary for the tremendous task which is in front of us.<br/>
In the larger perspective of the immense sacrifices which have to be borne in all fields, there will be little opposition in this House or in the country to the financial sacrifices which must be imposed not on one but on all sections of the community; with this one exception, that additional burdens placed on the very poor, those who are already below the standard set by Sir John Orr, are burdens which will not benefit the country in any way. On the contrary, they would be injurious to the country, because they would lower the morale of our people. With that exception I believe it is the general feeling of the House that all sections of the community will bear these burdens in order to face the tremendous problem in front of us. The regard for which these sacrifices are being made is one which cannot be over-estimated. In the days gone by our forefathers secured for us a "pearl of great price," the freedom of our people and the liberty to act, to work, and even to think, in the way that they desired. That pearl of great price is in jeopardy to-day. We dare not allow it to be filched from us. It is not merely our own democratic institutions, not merely the lives of individuals who sit in this Chamber or who are our comrades and friends in the country; we stand for the integrity of this country, and the sacrifices we have to make are for that integrity and for the fundamental basis of human civilisation.</p>

<p>If the importance of this Bill was measured by the length of time of the discussions in this House, it might be judged to be a Bill of small consequence. That is not the case. It imposes imposts of an irksome character and, in fact, is the most formidable instrument for the transfer of private means to the public Exchequer that has ever been passed in this House. The right hon. Member for


East Edinburgh (Mr. Pethick-Lawrence) has just said that when the Budget was introduced it was criticised, and justly criticised, as being a most inadequate measure of the nation's will to carry on the war and mobilise all our resources for the prosecution of the war. We know now that this Finance Bill is an interim Measure and must be followed by supplementary financial measures in the near future which will be related to the maximum effort the country or the Government is determined to make. There is one lesson which stands out from the way in which the Bill has been received in the House and in the country. It is this: that the most revolutionary financial proposals can now be accepted by the whole country, not only without opposition but even in a spirit of willing co-operation. It is now quite clear that the Government are not under the necessity in future of entering into any elaborate process of bargaining with regard to interest rates or the duration of loans. The duty of the Government now is to make up their minds what they think is necessary for the prosecution of the war and the satisfaction of the nation's needs and to come down to the House and explain them. On these terms, whatever may be the proposal, it will be accepted. I agree with the exception made by the right hon. Member. It would be futile to try and place burdens on those who are not able to face them, and we do not expect the Government to make any attempt of that kind.<br/>
I do not know whether there are any people who are under the belief that the march of events in recent weeks and the changes in the character of the war lead to any less vigorous need for watching the finances of the country. The changes in the character of the war and the locality in which it is to be fought may lead not to a diminution in the national expenditure and financial effort, but to a change in the direction of that effort and the way in which some of the money may have to be expended. If we have to remain, possibly for years, as a beleaguered fortress, we shall have to adapt our finances to that situation. We have not yet reached our maximum production or anything like it. If our national expenditure is running below what we anticipated, if it is running at a level which is less than our maximum effort and much

less than we are determined to make it, it is, nevertheless, a very heavy expenditure indeed in relation to the amount of consumable goods in this country which remain for the civil population. It is clear that there is now every need for every citizen to regard his own consumption in the most minute detail. Those who live in a beleaguered fortress cannot allow themselves any latitude in expenditure. I should not regard the provisions of the Bill as representing what is necessary to reduce individual consumption.<br/>
A question has been raised recently in the House with regard to joy riding, excursions, dog racing and the like. These are not matters which are to be decided entirely within the Clauses of this or any other Finance Bill. They are matters on which the conscience of each citizen should be brought into play, and each citizen should examine them in the light of what he considers to be his duty. There are at the present time some signs of a revolutionary nature in the financial make-up of the country. Some of those signs are very encouraging. I do not remember any Chancellor of the Exchequer in the past having been called upon to state clearly, for the convenience of prospective lenders, the terms on which they could lend money to the Government free of interest. I do not remember there having been any pronounced demand for facilities of that kind in connection with any other Budget. The right hon. Gentleman explained that the process by which such loans could be made was simple and easy and open to anybody who found himself in a position to enter into a transaction of that kind.<br/>
This leads me to say that I have observed that the voluntary savings method, as apart from the interest-free loans method, is making satisfactory progress; but from the point of view of avoiding the process of inflation which must follow inevitably from a reduction in the amount of consumable goods and from the great transfer of spending power which has taken place between some members of the community and others&#x2014;the immense spending power, for example, which has been conferred upon members of the engineering industry&#x2014;which, if it were to be let loose on the reduced volume of consumable goods, would speedily lead to an increasingly awkward situation, there is still scope for increased momentum and volume in the voluntary savings cam-


paign. That is one safeguard against inflation, but clearly, the situation is one that calls for the strictest personal discipline in expenditure and consumption by all those who have any money which they are free to spend above that necessary for the preservation of health and a normal standard of life.<br/>
I do not wish to trespass further on the time of the House, but those who can help the day-to-day finances of the country in the ways I have endeavoured to indicate will certainly be doing something to sustain the State and shorten the war. This island of ours is now an outpost of civilisation. Probably it is the remaining key in Europe which still maintains the possibility of the survival in Europe of any reasonable standard of good life. That is being realised not only throughout Europe, but the world over; and in these matters of finance, we must not fall short of our full duty at the present time.</p>

<p>There is one matter, which may seem a small one after the very lofty attitude of the speeches to which we have just listened, to which I must refer in order to put myself, and if I may say so, also my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer, right with the Forestry Commission, which I represent in the House, and with the representatives outside of the woodland owners of Great Britain. During the Second Reading Debate, I referred to the curious anomaly which had arisen with regard to the taxation of woodlands, and I pointed out that this was standing in the way of the easy and ready acquisition of standing timber in Great Britain for purposes of the war. From that point of view, I asked the Chancellor to consider the matter very carefully in order, not to remove a burden or relieve a hardship, but to clear away an obstacle to one item of the war effort. I will explain the nature of that anomaly.<br/>
As the law is at present, it happens that standing woodlands are capital for purposes of Death Duties and become liable to payment of those Duties when they are felled, and not when they pass at death. The timber that is felled is also liable to the Excess Profits Tax. It may well be that on an estate which would not normally sell any timber, but

which is now, for war purposes, asked to sell a great deal, the whole of the timber felled might appear to be liable to Excess Profits Tax as income and also liable to deferred Death Duties as capital. There is a number of cases where there is no doubt whatever that the liability to the Crown for taxation would be in excess of the total price which would be paid for the timber if it were acquired, either voluntarily or compulsorily, for purposes of the war. Obviously, that is a ludicrous position which has to be dealt with.<br/>
At the time of the Second Reading of this Bill, it appeared to the organisations representing woodland owners and to the Forestry Commission that this obstacle could not be removed without an Amendment being made to the Finance Bill. My object in speaking to-day is to say that this matter has been very carefully studied. The subject of the treatment of woodlands for purposes of the Excess Profits Tax is under careful examination by the Board of Inland Revenue, and I am absolutely satisfied that the matter is one that can be adequately dealt with by administration and without its being necessary to amend the law. Therefore, I want my friends outside to feel satisfied that the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Board of Inland Revenue and I have not in any way neglected their interests by reason of the fact that the Finance Bill is being given a Third Reading today without having been amended in this respect.</p>

<p>I should like to make a few remarks before the Bill is given a Third Reading. I confess that when I approached the Bill in the first instance, I was in doubt as to whether I ought to proceed with the whole of its Clauses, and I was also confronted with the fact that the situation had fundamentally changed between the Budget Statement of 23rd April and the date at the end of May when the Finance Bill was ready. However, I felt that a good deal of hard work had been involved in the Bill and that to jettison at any rate a considerable portion of the Bill would have meant the loss of a good deal of that careful and most useful work. In those circumstances, after consulting right hon. Gentlemen opposite and hon. Members in other parts of the House, I decided to proceed, because I was assured that facilities would


be given to expedite the passage of the Bill which would otherwise have been an onerous, long and difficult undertaking.<br/>
The Bill has now reached its Third Reading, and the only matters on which I desire to comment are those which relate to the Excess Profits Tax, which has received the greatest consideration from the Committee and the House. It is right to emphasise that it was proper that that examination should have been given, because with a tax of this kind, which nobody can claim to be scientific in its application, it is essential that the basis for the charge should be as equitable as the exigencies of the Revenue permit. Undoubtedly, with the very important change which we have made during the course of the progress of the Bill involving Excess Profits Tax at 100 per cent., it is obvious that hard and difficult cases cannot be avoided, and I am afraid they will be bound to occur, but I think that, with the assistance of hon. Members in all parts of the House, we have gone a long way to meet the representations that were made, both inside and outside the House, at any rate with regard to the hardest cases. I want to assure all those who are naturally interested in this tax, whether they be great concerns and industries or small ones, that we shall continue to watch the operation of the tax, and of course, there will be opportunities for amendment and discussion in subsequent Finance Bills.<br/>
I should like also to add a word to what was said by my right hon. and learned Friend the Solicitor-General this afternoon with regard to the Amendment which I withdrew, having regard to the representations that were made to me by hon. Members opposite. I must say that I feel there was a complete misapprehension of the whole position. The chief reason which actuated me in withdrawing the Amendment was the desire to maintain agreement and the belief that there was a misapprehension of the position. I have no doubt that, with the help of the Solicitor-General, we shall be able to explain matters sufficiently to hon. Members opposite, so that we shall be able to proceed, as I intended to proceed, in the next Finance Bill, to meet the very critical situation that arises as far as certain companies are concerned. If I had been aware that there was any misapprehension on this matter, I should

have been only too willing to meet hon. Members who were so concerned about this during this afternoon. The last thing I want to see at this hour is a division of opinion or any statements in the country concerning the provisions of this Bill which would be quite erroneous. It is only fair to say to the House that, in the case of those concerns, such as copper and coal, which are making great efforts at this time in the national interest, it is my intention to proceed.<br/>
I should like to make one or two remarks, as other hon. Members have done, about the future and about our taxation generally. There is only one thing on which I disagree with the right hon. Member for East Edinburgh (Mr. Pethick-Lawrence). He referred to the present burdens of taxation as tiny. That is not how I would describe them.</p>

<p>Perhaps I may correct the right hon. Gentleman as to what I said. I said that great as those burdens are and still heavier as they are expected to become, they are tiny in comparison with the terrific sacrifices that are being made in other directions.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1940-06-19a.212.1" hansard_membership_id="7445" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/27643" speakername="Sir K. Wood" colnum="212" time="">
<p>I entirely agree in that respect with the right hon. Gentleman. It is a fact that at this time taxation does weigh very heavily upon great masses of the community. That is why I indicated to the House, in the Second Reading Debate, that I felt there must be some time for a measure of adjustment before other taxation has to be faced. I wish to elaborate the matter further this evening by simply adding that a second Budget and a second Finance Bill must be regarded by this House and the country as inevitable. We have to face it together, as the right hon. Gentleman said, and, so far as I am concerned, we must see that all sections of the community shall bear their fair share of responsibility for the burdens which face us, without which, of course, victory cannot be achieved.<br/>
I was grateful to the hon. Member for East Birkenhead (Mr. White) for what he said in regard to the necessity which still exists, notwithstanding our very heavy commitments, for careful finance and watching, so far as we can, its operations. That should not be lost sight of, because, in the end, we may have to fall back on the weapon of finance much more than


people imagine at the present time. This is certainly not a moment to give up any methods of supervision which do not impose vexatious restrictions, or delay, or anything of that kind. I desire to thank the House for what has been said about my appeal, yesterday, for loans without interest. Already there has been considerable response in that connection, and I have received some of the most touching letters, during the last few days, from rich and poor alike, who have sent gifts at a time of crisis. Many organisations, as the hon. Member said, are also responding.<br/>
In asking the House to pass the Third Reading of this Bill, I would say that in this momentous struggle the chief function of finance is to serve the State. I feel that what is required must be, and will be, provided to the utmost limit of our resources, and that at the present time we must throw those resources into the scale against the enemy whatever the additional burdens involved may be. I agree with what has been said to-day, and I am sure it is weighing on the minds of everyone, that, after all, the sacrifice of money and property must be regarded as trifling compared with the sacrifice of life and limb which so many of our countrymen have been making and will have to be called upon to make.</p>
