<p>asked the Under-Secretary of State for India whether any date prior to June, 1948, has been fixed for the transfer of power; and whether officers now on leave in England and not due to return for some weeks will be permitted to retire with compensation, without returning to India.<br/>

<p>The Indian Independence Bill provides for the transfer of power on 15th August.

<p>I am aware that the leave in question was refused by the Government of India, presumably on the ground that Lieut.-Colonel Stonham's services were required in the Middle East, and the hon.

The position has, however, been fundamentally altered by the advancement of the date for the transfer of power, and I am asking the Government of India to


examine Lieut.-Colonel Stonham's position afresh in the light of the most recent constitutional developments. Meanwhile this officer will remain on leave.</p>

<p>asked the Under-Secretary of State for India why persons on the India Office establishment who were transferred to the office of the High Commissioner for India under the Order in Council of 13th August, 1920, and have since retired, are not being paid by the India Office the increase of pension granted to civil servants under the Pensions (Increase) Act, 1947, although the Order in Council provides that such persons should be in no worse position for purposes of superannuation than if they had remained on the establishment of the Secretary of State.</p>

<p>The difficulty in this case arises from the fact that the Order in Council to which my hon. Friend refers provided that the persons in question should be in no worse position than if they had remained on the establishment not of the Secretary of State, but of the Secretary of State in Council, a corporate entity which ceased to exist after the 31st March, 1937. As a consequence, the Pensions (Increase) Act, 1947, does not automatically apply to them, and my noble Friend has no power to apply it without the agreement of the Government of India, whose consent has not yet been obtained. The matter is however, receiving further consideration.</p>

<p>No, Sir. I am advised that the introduction of season tickets on their omnibuses would not, on balance, result in savings to the London Passenger Transport Board. The work of conductors would be greatly complicated. There would thus be no justification for rates representing a reduction in ordinary fares, without which there would be little advantage to the public.

<p>With your permission, Mr. Speaker, I propose to make a statement about the functions and membership of the Economic Planning Board. The primary task of this body will be to advise His Majesty's Government on the best use of our economic resources, both for the realisation of a long-term plan and for remedial measures against our immediate difficulties.<br/>
The Chairman of the Board is Sir Edwin Plowden, the Chief Planning Officer, although I may on occasion take the chair myself. The other members are:
<ul>
<li>Sir William Coates&#x2014;Nominated by the Federation of British Industries and the British Employers Confederation.</li>
<li>Sir Graham Cunningham&#x2014;Nominated by the F.B.I.-B.E.C.</li>
<li>Mr A. Naesmith&#x2014;Nominated by the Trades Union Congress.</li>
<li>Mr. W. R. Verdon Smith&#x2014;Nominated by the F.B.I.-B.E.C.</li>
<li>Mr. J. Tanner&#x2014;Nominated by the T.U.C.</li>
<li>Mr. H. V. Tewson&#x2014;Nominated by the T.U.C.</li>
<li>Sir John Woods&#x2014;Permanent Secretary to the Board of Trade.</li>
<li>Sir Godfrey Ince&#x2014;Permanent Secretary to the Ministry of Labour and National Service.</li>
<li>Sir Archibald Rowlands&#x2014;Permanent Secretary to the Ministry of Supply.</li>
<li>Mr. A. S. Le Maitre&#x2014;Central Economic Planning Staff.</li>
<li>Mr. H. T. Weeks&#x2014;Central Economic Planning Staff.</li>
<li>Mr F. W. Smith&#x2014;Central Economic Planning Staff.</li>
<li>Mr. R. L. Hall&#x2014;Director of the Economic Section, Cabinet Office.</li></ul>
The industrial members of the Board, representing as they do both employers and workers, bring to the problems of planning wide practical experience and knowledge, while the Permanent Secretaries represent the three Departments chiefly responsible for dealing with problems of trade and industry. Very close co-operation and consultation between Government and industry will, therefore, be possible. These arrangements are, of course, in addition to and not instead of the arrangements for close consultation already maintained between industry and individual Departments. There may, however, be matters lying outside the field of experience of the industrial members on which other interested organisations


will have a contribution to make, and it may be appropriate at a later date to hold conferences on particular economic questions with the organisations best able to advise and assist us in such cases.</p>

<p>That, of course, is a matter for the T.U.C. in selecting their representatives, but it is possible that in specific cases affecting particular industries it may be possible for us to keep that aspect particularly in mind.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1947-07-07a.1805.2" hansard_membership_id="5533" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/15771" speakername="Sir Patrick Hannon" colnum="1805" time="">
<p>Is the Lord President of the Council satisfied that the Board includes adequate representation of the smaller manufacturers in this country, and why does not the Economic Advisory Council include a representative of the National Union of Manufacturers?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1947-07-07a.1805.3" hansard_membership_id="9544" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/29780" speakername="Mr. Morrison" colnum="1805" time="">
<p>That matter was very carefully considered. We are very anxious, as I am sure the House will agree is wise, to keep the Board to a reasonably small size, and it was felt that it would be rather difficult to go outside the Federation of British Industries and the British Employers Confederation, who represent the main stream of economic interests on the employers' side. I appreciate the point made by the hon. Member, but the trouble was that if we went that far, we should have to go farther. For example, there is a great deal to be said for the specific representation of agriculture as such, and I do not know where we would have stopped. As a matter of fact, we shall seek on proper occasions to consult agriculture specifically, and I hope that from time to time it will be possible for my representatives to meet the National Union of Manufacturers and other bodies who may be specially concerned with particular problems.</p>

<p>On the first point, now that the Board has been constituted the sooner it starts work the better so far as I am concerned, and virtually the answer to the hon. Member's question is "yes." With regard to the hon. Gentleman's second point, it is not proposed that the Board should report directly to Parliament.</p>

<p>I have informed the House that we shall certainly keep agriculture&#x2014;which is of very great importance economically&#x2014;in mind, but that if we were to proceed to the representation of specific industries, then the Board would be too large and I am afraid that we cannot go beyond the general broad constitution of the Board.</p>

<p>The title of this Schedule has given rise to some misunderstanding and has led to requests to include numerous other exceptions from the development charge. The object of the Amendment is to change the title of the Schedule, which is to be divided into two parts. The main purpose of the Schedule is to settle the dividing line between the existing use values and the development values. The operations specified in Part I are exempt from development charge but no compensation is payable if planning permission to such operations is refused. In the event of a refusal and it being shown


that the land is incapable of reasonably beneficial use in its existing state, it will be open to the owner to require the local planning authority to purchase the land under Clause 16. If the land is purchased under that Clause or under any other of the provisions of the Bill compensation will be assessed on the basis that there is a right to carry out the operations referred to in Part I. It may be asked why no compensation is payable under the refusal of the planning permission. The answer is that the refusal of permission in these cases does not necessarily mean any immediate loss of income to the owner.</p>

<p>I quite realise the position of the owner, but what would happen if the best fields were taken from a farm, leaving the tenant only with the worst? How does the tenant stand in such circumstances? Is he safeguarded in the same way as the landlord where he no longer has a commercial unit?</p>

<p>But is it exempted? What about land taken for house building? I have a case in mind. I ask the Joint Under-Secretary&#x2014;I am not at all in a controversial mood&#x2014;to look into this if he is not absolutely certain because it may be necessary to amend the Bill in some other place</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1947-07-07a.1813.3" speakerid="unknown" speakername="Mr. McKie" colnum="1813" time="">
<p>I would like to support the hon. Member for Torquay (Mr. C. Williams). During the war here were many such cases. Very often the best fields or the best land were taken and sometimes the tenant&#x2014;perhaps the tenant of a very good dairy farm&#x2014;was left with a mere shred of the kernel and unable to carry on the dairy production which is so essential for the nation's need. I should like the hon. Gentleman to respond to the advice of the hon. Member for Torquay and to tell the Committee just where the tenants will stand. Even the Socialist Government is concerned with the principle of fair and just compensation, and I want fair and just compensation for the landlord and the tenant too. The hon. Gentleman has not been able to assure us where the tenant stands. This is a reasonable plea which we put forward, and it is essential that we should know.<br/>
I would very much have preferred the Joint Under-Secretary&#x2014;I have never before seen him do what he did today&#x2014;to come to the Box and explain the Amendment without a brief. The hon. Gentleman is always much happier without a brief. I do not say this is any sense offensively, but the hon. Gentleman gave me the impression that he was endeavouring to explain this Amendment to the Committee when he was not completely master of the subject. That is why he has aroused in our breasts fear as to where the tenant may stand or may not stand.</p>

<p>I thank the hon. Member for Galloway (Mr. McKie) for his courtesy and brevity and I trust that we shall get through this Bill in the same reasonable spirit. The answer is that the tenant has equal rights with the owner to make a claim.</p>

<p>I would like to thank the hon. Gentleman for his courtesy and to say that I should not have raised this except that I believe an injustice exists. I encountered a case on Sunday which I have put before the Minister. I would like him really to see that the tenant gets adequate compensation for the fact that the farm is no longer an industrially working unit.</p>

This is the first of a series of Amendments extending the exemptions from the payment of development charges. Upstairs we were asked not only by the Opposition, but by some of my hon.. Friends, to extend the scope of this Schedule. This Amendment makes it clear that no development charge is payable in respect of rebuilding as often as the person having the right to rebuild has the desire to do so.</p>

<p>We appreciate the Government's action in meeting points which were raised upstairs, but I should also say that in this very large Order Paper there are a great many Amendments which go entirely the other way, and, so far from meeting the points raised, stiffen the Bill very much against


the points put forward by the Opposition. We shall have to say something on that class of Amendment. I quite agree, however, that this Amendment and the next two Amendments show the fruits of our somewhat lengthy and tedious efforts in Committee.</p>

<p>I beg to move in page 123, line 4, after "exceeded," to insert:
<q>in the case of a dwellinghouse, by more than one-tenth or fifteen hundred cubic feet, whichever is the greater, and in any other case.</q>
Upstairs we heard a great deal of criticism from both sides of the Committee on the 10 per cent. tolerance which applies to small and large houses. The point was made that in many of the small houses in Scotland 10 per cent. was nothing at all for practical purposes, though it might be all right in a large house with 20 rooms. My right hon. Friend went into the matter and thought something ought to be done to ease the position of the person with a small house who wanted to make decent lavatory or bathroom accommodation. Therefore, he suggests 1,500 cubic feet or 10 per cent. whichever is the greater. We think this concession meets the criticism made upstairs and goes some way to meeting what we think is a real need.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1947-07-07a.1815.3" hansard_membership_id="4699" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/32733" speakername="Commander Galbraith" colnum="1815" time="">
<p>I agree entirely with the hon. Gentleman that this was a matter put very strongly in Committee. What we had in mind was the small house, particularly in the rural areas. The hon. Gentleman said that he considered 1,500 cubic feet would be sufficient for additional sanitary accommodation. I agree, but we were looking to the inclusion in a building attached to the cottage of a kitchenette with bathroom attached. I have been working it out, and it would seem that the 1,500 cubic feet would cover that, but it may be a little tight. As we look at things at present it might be considered to be sufficient, but times change and we do not want to add something on now which in 10 or 15 years' time we shall be told showed a complete lack of imagination. We accept willingly this gesture and we appreciate it, but we would have liked it to go a little further; even another 100 cubic feet would have made the condition more clear.</p>

<p>Not only that, but there is a point to which the Committee addressed itself for some time upstairs, namely, that of industrial buildings and shops. The hon. Gentleman will remember that we discussed the case of shops which have been swept away for some reason&#x2014;burned out or bomb destroyed&#x2014;or which were no longer there at the appointed day, and which the owners desired to rebuild with more than a 10 per cent. tolerance in view of their desire to make them conform to modern standards of accommodation and modern requirement for the display of goods, adequate lighting and so on&#x2014;</p>

<p>As one of those who raised this matter upstairs, I would express our thanks to my hon Friend for this Amendment. I am not sure that it goes quite as far as one would like. It depends upon the standards which we set ourselves. I rather think that in Scotland we have to get out of the habit of thinking that two rooms and a bathroom are sufficient for a wife, husband and children because it does not allow of sex separation. I would have liked to see this Amendment go further, particularly as the comparison with the treatment of animals in this Schedule is rather invidious. However, I and my hon. Friends are grateful for what has been done, and we shall accept this Amendment.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1947-07-07a.1816.4" speakerid="unknown" speakername="Mr. McKie" colnum="1816" time="">
<p>I join in the chorus of approval, especially with regard to what has just been said by the hon. Member for North Edinburgh (Mr. Willis). I, too, wish that the right hon. Gentleman had been able to go a little further in the drafting of this Amendment, in order to allow more elbow room in the rebuilding of the houses specified in the Schedule. The hon. Member for North Edinburgh was speaking as the representative of a highly organised urban constituency in the Scottish metropolis, and I can understand that his words were very restrained when he spoke of the conditions there and the uncomfortable surroundings of many unfortunate people in his Division and,


indeed, in the Divisions in the Scottish provinces with the exception of land represented by the hon. Member for South Edinburgh (Sir W. Darling). However, while sympathising with the urban point of view, I, as the representative of a purely agricultural area, am specially concerned with the plight of those who have to depend for their living on tilling the soil, and very many people in the countryside of Scotland are living in conditions described by the hon. Member for North Edinburgh. I wish, therefore, that this Amendment had given us a little more elbow room, because the new wording will scarcely meet completely the kind of case that we have in view. I hope this will not be taken as a "law of the Medes and Persians which altereth not." The hon. Gentleman may say that in ten years we may have to make fresh provision in a new housing Bill. If that is so, well and good, but I hope that by accepting this Amendment we are not locking the door to any additional improvements in the future.</p>

<p>This Amendment does three things. It exempts from development charge the conversion of a dwelling house into flats; it enables any increase in value due to the possibility of such conversion to be paid to the owner and, in the event of an unconverted house being purchased under compulsory powers, it precludes the owner from claiming against the &#x00A3;300 million for any development value due to the possibility of such conversion. In effect, therefore, it recognises that any value from conversion purposes is part of an existing use value of land which the Bill leaves, and not part of the development value which the Bill transfers to the State. This matter was debated upstairs and we think this goes some way, at least to meet the views expressed.</p>

<p>The drafting of this is so difficult that I am not sure whether timber yards are or are not a permitted use without paying development charge.

<p>I think not. What is exempt is
<q>&#x2026; carrying out, on land &#x2026; or forestry &#x2026; other than</q>

Therefore a timber yard will be one of the things which are not exempt from development charge, if the words are put in in this place. I cannot help thinking that they are put in in the wrong place, and for that reason I ask that this matter shall be looked at again. I think the intention is to exempt timber yards, but it is put the wrong way round. As I say, the drafting is complicated, but if the hon.

<p>I beg to move, in page 123, line 18, to leave out "before," and to insert "on."<br/>
This follows an earlier Amendment. Paragraph 4 of the Third Schedule enables the Secretary of State to specify any general class of use within which buildings or other land used for purposes before the appointed day may be used for other purposes without paying development charge. This Amendment is to specify that that shall be done on the appointed day and to make it clear that it is only on the appointed day.</p>

<p>I think this Amendment narrows the matter unduly. If the word "on" is inserted this paragraph will read:
<q>In the case of a building or other land which, on the appointed day, was used for a purpose falling within any general class&#x2014;</q>
Very often one does not use a building or land for that purpose every day of the year. It may well happen that it is not being used on the appointed day for any purpose at all, and we shall get into all sorts of troubles if we try to tie it up narrowly like this. I thought the intention was to prevent the old prewar use, and I would not have objected if it had been limited to the use made of the building or land within the last 12 months. I hope that the Amendment will not be insisted upon, but that at a subsequent stage another word for the word "before" will be inserted. To tie this to one day, and say that the land must, have been used for this purpose on 1st April but that it does not matter for what i was used on 31st March or 2nd April, is making it too narrow. I hope that this cramping Amendment will not be insisted upon.</p>

<p>We thought we were being helpful. Paragraph 4 places no limitation on the length of time for which buildings or land may be used for any purpose in a specified general class.

<p>It would be ungracious not to say that this Schedule has been considerably improved. On the other hand, it is highly desirable that one should again say here, where our proceedings get much more publicity than do our proceedings upstairs, how extremely unsatisfactory even the amended Schedule is. I will mention only two points. Other of my hon. Friends may have other points to raise. Under the Schedule, with all its Amendments, one still has to pay a charge, if one wants to set up even the humblest new dwelling house anywhere, even in the most remote fastnesses of the country, where there has been no question of the owner of the property having had any share of the &#x00A3;300 million. I can see the argument for saying that a person who wants to build a dwelling house, and who has had a share in the &#x00A3;300 million, ought to pay back part of that share if he wants to put up a house. Even that, however, would be unduly limiting and cramping the rehousing of our people, and the Government would have been well advised to forego the tiny financial advantage they get in order to place no obstacles in the way of rehousing our people. When we consider agricultural land the owner of which has had no share, and could have had no share, in the &#x00A3;300 million, it is monstrous for the Government to say, "We shall fine you before you are allowed to rehouse your agricultural workers."<br/>
I cannot help stressing once again the grave danger to agriculture in particular which this Schedule will constitute. There is another point. It is surely important in the coming years, the more so as pessimistic statements by the Government develop, that we should grow every ounce of food we can in this country. Therefore, I should have thought it highly desirable that the way should be free for a transfer from general farming to market gardening and intensive cultivation of that kind. Again, one has to pay a charge before one can change from general farming to market gardening. One must not erect, enlarge, improve or alter any building used for the purposes of market gardening without being fined. That is surely in flat contradiction of Government policy for the encouragement of agriculture.<br/>
I can understand, in England, the Minister of Town and Country Planning, who has no direct responsibility for agriculture, allowing these things to go into his Bill, but I cannot understand the right hon. Gentleman, who is Minister of Agriculture in Scotland, allowing two provisions to pass which are so directly contrary to his own interests as the Minister charged with the improvement of our agriculture. How he can reconcile allowing these provisions to go into this Bill and thereby cramp and hamper the growing of food in Scotland, with his agricultural responsibilities, passes my comprehension. I wish to make the most emphatic protest on behalf of those of us who sit on this side of the Committee against this niggling way of trying to get a few pounds of money out of agricultural landlords, even though in the process it seriously hampers the growing of food for our people, who will very soon want it.</p>

<p>I would like very strongly to support what my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Hill-head (Mr. Reid) has said in this respect. It is of the utmost importance today that we should develop in Scotland all the food production we possibly can, and this Schedule will undoubtedly have a restricting effect on the people who are trying to carry out that most necessary development. As my right hon. and learned Friend has said, one has only to consider the development from ordinary straightforward farming to market gardening. Nothing is needed more desperately in Scotland today than the extension of market gardening. This Schedule cramps the opportunity of people to develop land in that way, which will be much to the detriment of the Scottish people. I cannot understand how the right hon. Gentleman can agree to legislation of this kind on such a vital matter, which he and his colleagues are telling us every day will affect the wellbeing of this country as never before.</p>

<p>It is difficult to understand why the Secretary of State resists the demand which has been made from this side of the Committee on the question of market gardening and agriculture. In practice, it is impossible to distinguish between the one and the other. As I said in the Com-


mittee, some of the most outstanding farmers in the world are in Scotland, where, in fact, every day of the year for years past, and I hope for years to come, market gardening and agriculture are combined to a perfection which is without compare in any part of the world. A particular farm to which I direct the attention of the Secretary of State has its system of underground steam piping, which has been described in almost every agricultural paper in every English speaking part of the world I have also seen an account translated into many languages. This farmer has many hundreds of acres of arable land, and also hundreds of acres of first-class highly cultivated land devoted to market gardening. Neither of these two sides of his undertaking could be worked without the other.<br/>
If the Secretary of State says to him, "You may put an extra building in that field because that, in my judgment&#x2014;the great Secretary of State for Scotland&#x2014;is agricultural land, but over the fence, where you are stupid enough to be growing lettuces, no, not a single building must be put there or I shall fine you." That is sheer nonsense. What will that man and other men like him do? They will dodge the law because they think so much of food production, and will make a fool of the Secretary of State. They will put a building in a particular place and call the land agricultural land when it is used for market gardening, and I question whether there is a judge in the land who will say that they are doing anything illegal or stupid. Surely, the Secretary of State does not intend gratuitously to make a fool of himself as he is doing in this Schedule. Is it not possible for him to consult his own advisers on the matter? Every Department in the country has its sections. The Department of Agriculture in Scotland has its horticultural, livestock and other sections, but they are all under one head, that of agriculture; there is one Minister and one permanent secretary in charge. The National Farmers' Union is divided into branches. The farmworkers in Scotland have their branches. There are men and women, mostly women in the East of Scotland, working in market gardens for certain hours and under certain rules. There are sections dealing with every branch of farming. Why does the Secretary of State close his eyes and

refuse to recognise that the two branches are part of agriculture? I find it crazy. The Secretary of State is doing one of two things, either inviting people to flout the law, or cutting down food production Either must surely be a bad thing<br/>
4.30 p.m.<br/>
The Secretary of State has made a grudging response to our appeal to free the farm cottage. I admit that he has gone some way, but it was a very grudging concession. It will still hamper the development and extension of farm workers' cottages. One cannot, at one and the same time, condemn capitalism, as the Government and their supporters are doing, and take away from these people the only way in which they can justify their existence and improve social conditions. I condemn as readily as any hon. Member opposite any landlord who declines or fails to improve his cottages. It Is his duty to improve his cottages if he is allowed, but now he cannot do it. [AN HON. MEMBER: "Why did not the Government do it before the war?"] If hon. Members want to talk about conditions before the war we can go back, but surely we are concerned with the position today. Let us discuss the position as it is now.<br/>
I could quote countless cases in East Fife where owners of agricultural properties are faced with the most appalling obstacles in their endeavours to have their cottages repaired, extended and improved Hon. Members opposite must know the position. Why do they make it more difficult? Do they not want farm labourers to be better housed? Throughout this Bill this awful prejudice against the private ownership of property is reflected, not in the owner, but in the poor men and women who occupy these cottages today. That is the damning thing about this Schedule and other parts of the Bill. The Government know perfectly well. I see the Joint Under-Secretary of State laughing at me&#x2014;let us say that it is an encouraging smile. I was today handed this book on rent restriction. What does this mean? It means as hon. Members know very well, that no owner of property can get his rents increased. Therefore, he is going to get nothing out of improvements to his cottages. An extension or development would not bring him in any more money. Why for the sake of these stupid prejudices,


prevent people who occupy little cottages being given better conditions? This is a crime on the part of the Government of which I should have thought they would be utterly ashamed. If this Schedule goes through without any alteration, the Government should be ashamed.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for East Fife (Mr. H. Stewart) has spoken with his usual venom and his usual lack of appreciation of all the things involved in the subject about which he is talking. He talked as If this were something new. He says the Secretary of State for Scotland is trying to differentiate between agricultural land and market gardening land. He accuses the Secretary of State of showing no great sympathy for the future of our agricultural land and especially for the future of our market garden land near our great cities. The hon. Member mentioned the market garden land near Edinburgh. I am sure he knows as well as anybody in this Committee that hundreds of acres of precious market garden land near Edinburgh, and equally hundreds of acres of precious market garden land near Glasgow, were swallowed up between the wars by ill considered development which this Bill is designed to prevent. He said that there was no distinction or, at any rate, that there would be a process of law dodging. I take it that he was not advocating that or putting it down as the policy of the Liberal-National Party.</p>

<p>If I recollect the hon. Member rightly, not only did he say that there would be law dodging, but he went so far as to say that not one of His Majesty's judges would dare to do other than condone such a thing. He said that there is no difference between agricultural and market garden land. Personally, I feel that there should be no distinction of any kind in regard to land. We ought to deal exclusively in one commodity&#x2014;land. That has not been the practice of landowners in the past. We have had land which has been derelict waste land, or purely agricultural land, and then, when some corpora-

tion wanted to do something to improve the value of the land and improve the service to the community, its value has shot up and it has acquired a completely different designation. This Bill is designed to prevent that sort of thing.<br/>
This Schedule makes exemptions. I am glad that the right hon. and learned Gentleman the Member for Hillhead (Mr. J. S. C. Reid) had the courtesy, as he usually has, to acknowledge that the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Joint Under-Secretary have gone a long way to meet the desires of the Committee in the Amendments which have been made. That is true, and the Secretary of State and the Joint Under-Secretary should be congratulated. We on this side of the Committee are at least as keen as the hon. Member for East Fife, or anybody else, to protect agriculture and market gardening. We believe that these causes will be furthered by this Schedule.</p>

<p>What the hon. Member for Rutherglen (Mr. McAllister) did not tell the Committee was the effect of the passing of this Schedule as it stands, upon agriculture, particularly with regard to the housing of rural workers. Under the Schedule, as amended, the owner of agricultural property can improve his farm steadings without incurring a liability for development charge. He can improve the byre in which he keeps his cattle. As the hon. Member for North Edinburgh (Mr. Willis) suggested, he can improve the conditions under which his livestock are housed. But if he endeavours to build a new cottar house for a farm worker, or to extend an existing cottar house by more than 1,500 cubic feet or 10 per cent. whichever is the greater, then he has to pay a development charge which my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Hillhead (Mr. J. S. C. Reid) rightly described as a fine of an unknown amount.<br/>
I am very disappointed that the Secretary of State has not told us today that he has been able to go further along the road which was outlined by the Minister of Town and Country Planning as long ago as 20th May last. On that occasion, in connection with a proposal that had been made upstairs when the English Town and Country Planning Bill was under discussion, he told the Committee that he was in consultation with agricultural interests to see whether it would be


possible to allow farm cottages to be treated somewhat in this way. They were to be valued in the usual way, the improvement was to be assessed, and a development charge imposed such as is proposed in this Schedule. If, upon a certificate of an agricultural committee, it could be shown that that cottar house was to be used for agricultural occupation only, then and from year to year so long as the certificate held good, the liability for development charge, which would be upon an annual basis, would be waived. I and some of my hon. Friends pressed that the Minister should embark upon a similar course. He told us that he would look at it sympathetically. I am very disappointed indeed that he has not done anything in this Schedule and that we must pass it now in the form in which that kind of hindrance to the proper housing of agricultural workers in Scotland is possible.<br/>
I would like to ask one question arising from this Schedule and an Amendment which the Committee has sanctioned today. In another part of the Bill, in Clause 9 (3, <i>a</i>),the Committee will later be asked to say that:
<q>the use as two or more separate dwelling-houses of many building previously used as a single dwellinghouse involves a material change in the use of the building and of each part thereof which is so used;</q>
Ought not that paragraph to be withdrawn, in view of the Amendments which we have passed recently on this matter? I am not sure that this is the proper place to raise this point, but I do not know, if I do not raise it now, where else I can raise it. I hope that whoever replies will give the Committee some guidance upon that point.</p>

the condition in which we would all like to see them. There is no question that the passage of this Schedule in its present form will have a very depressing effect upon those engaged in horticulture and market gardening. It is usual to declare one's interest in a matter on which one is speaking, and I certainly declare my interest in market gardening, because I go in for it in a small way, and I can say that the views that have been expressed by my hon. Friends exactly fit my own point of view, because I find that I am likely to be penalised if I make some small development in my own small venture.<br/>
Further&#x2014;and this is a point which has not yet been made&#x2014;as I read paragraph 3 of the Third Schedule, forestry will also be penalised to a certain extent, because, after market gardens, we see that nursery grounds are also to be placed in the same category, in which anybody proceeding with a development may have to pay a substantial fine. The right hon. Gentleman knows just how largely forestry bulks in the general economy of Scotland. Certainly, I would say&#x2014;and the Joint Under-Secretary nods his approval&#x2014;it comes a very good second to agriculture, horticulture and market gardening, and I certainly think that anybody connected with forestry who reads this paragraph carefully may have ample grounds for fear that developments which he might have expected will not be entered upon in consequence of the risk to be run and the dire results that will follow. The right hon. Gentleman, in another Amendment to which the Committee has agreed, has now caused timber yards to be inserted in the Schedule, and they are now placed in the same category as market gardens, so that anybody who tries a modest development may run very serious risks. It is true that, at line 17, the Committee has agreed to an Amendment covering the cultivation or felling of trees, which may cancel out any fears I have expressed as to how forestry development would be effected. I see the right hon. Gentleman shakes his head. Then, I have no safeguard at all as to what the interpretation of the law may be&#x2014;</p>

<p>I hope that we are not going to have the kind of conundrum as was envisaged by the hon. Member for East Fife (Mr. H. Stewart). I think that, in the defence which the hon. Member for Rutherglen (Mr. McAllister) put up, he gave a caricature of what was said by the hon. Member for East Fife, who only suggested that the matter might be so involved that no judge would be in a position to say just what the law was or exactly what was intended, and, therefore, the people who wished to evade it would be able to do so. I hope the Under-Secretary may be able to say something about that point. I am not satisfied that, as regards rural housing, this would work out in the way we would like. The hon. Member for West Renfrew (Mr. Scollan) asked us why we did not do it in the years before the war. A very great deal was done in Scotland, and I would advise him to look up the records for the counties in Scotland and see what was done. I admit that some counties came out very much better than others. I say that the rural worker will not have his state of affairs bettered as a result of the passage of this Schedule, or, at least, bettered in the way in which that task was done in the so-called bad old days before the Labour Government came to office.</p>

<p>The argument has been used that this Schedule will arrest all development in housing for agricultural workers in Scotland. That is the criticism of the Schedule. If that were true, then, obviously, something should be done about it, but it is not true. Therefore, one is entitled to ask, what arrested the development of housing for agricultural workers before this Bill came in? At the present time, whatever is done for agriculture will only be done with the help of Government subsidy. Consequently, we are entitled to see that any large house which is turned into a number of separate dwellings pays a development charge. This Bill is not an agricultural area Bill; it covers the whole of Scotland. Therefore, this Schedule must be read in conjunction with development under urban as well as rural areas. I do not think that any real criticism of the Bill can be offered, especially in view of the fact that when there was plenty of material and labour, and when money was plentiful, the party to which hon. Members opposite belong never tried to build houses for the rural workers in Scotland.</p>

<p>I think that this is the most important Schedule to the Bill, and that, therefore, the discussion has, perhaps, been well worth while. I would like to say one word in reply to


the hon. Member for West Renfrew (Mr Scollan). I think he will find that money was not plentiful. Where a farmer has money, the fact is that he is only too anxious to build for the occupation of his workers. I want to mention two things which, I think, have been missed out, and which are going to affect the development of housing in the rural areas. The first is the extra charge that is going to be inflicted, and the second is delay. When people want to go ahead with a thing, and then find all kinds of delays cropping up, they are likely to become discouraged. I agree with the hon. Member for Rutherglen (Mr. McAllister) I am quite certain that both the right hon. and hon. Gentlemen are as keen as anyone of us to help the production of food. Therefore, having listened to the arguments which have been put forward, and which are of some force, I would ask them to consider once more before this Bill becomes an Act, whether it would not be wise to help the production of food in every way they can. I leave that matter with the right hon. and hon. Gentlemen to consider once again.</p>

<p>Three points have been covered in this discussion. The first is the effect on dwelling houses; the second, the point about nursery gardens; and the third, the point raised by the hon. Member for West Aberdeen (Mr. Thornton-Kemsley), as to why we have not dropped Clause 9 (3). The answer to the last point is that it is necessary to have that provision in order to make it clear that there is planning control<br/>
With regard to the first two points, the hon. Member for East Fife (Mr. Stewart) always commands my sympathy, first, because I have spoken so many times from the corner in which he sits, and, second, because I, in common with him, always had the failing when speaking of being inclined to overstate my case. There was his condemnation of the nursery. It is always difficult when a Government go out to meet their opponents and the criticisms made, because, if they give way on any point, that fact is always put forward as proof that they were wrong For instance, if we had brought agriculture within this Bill, the hon. Gentleman's speech would have been completely out of line, because then he would not have been able to

mention the nursery; he would only have been able to ask why we had left out agriculture. Listening to him, I almost felt like bringing in agriculture in order to hear the glowing speech he would have made. We have been generous, but the line has to be drawn somewhere Many hon. Friends of mine think that agriculture nowadays, taking into consideration guaranteed markets, etc., should not be treated differently from the rest of the community. We have gone that way to meet the hon. Gentleman, but, because we do not go further, we are attacked Let me deal with the question&#x2014;</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman is not answering the point I made. How does he distinguish between the one and the other?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1947-07-07a.1832.1" hansard_membership_id="1837" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/29486" speakername="Mr. Buchanan" colnum="1832" time="">
<p>The only way to meet the hon. Gentleman's case would be to bring agricultural land into relation with the rest of the land dealt with in this Bill. For instance, he says that the nursery land is necessary But the engineering shop which makes the agricultural machinery is also necessary. I say quite frankly to the hon Gentleman that the business of nursery farming and the development of nursery farming are, in many ways, as good a commercial proposition as that of the engineering works on the Clyde and in the Glasgow area.<br/>
One would think from the speeches which we have heard this afternoon that we were altering the law with regard to the development or alteration of a house. We do not make any change there. The owner of a house can change and alter it as much as he likes without any interference from us. We say&#x2014;and here we meet hon. Members opposite again&#x2014;that in the case of the smaller house there should be considerable room for improvement. We have put that into the Bill. It is true that the dwelling house is provided for. Speaking from memory, I think it is under Clause 63 that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has power, when he looks at the situation, to exempt any dwelling house he may desire when issuing his regulations. That, I think, really answers the point made by the hon. Member for West Aberdeen in relation to a speech made by the Minister in connection with the English Bill. If, when my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State issues his regulations, he


feels that something like that ought to be done, he has the power under Clause 63 to do it.</p>

<p>My right hon. Friend will cover the points when he sees the broad outline. That is the answer which he has already given. On the whole, we have gone a considerable way to meet the various criticisms and, with the explanations we have been given, we trust this Schedule will now be agreed to.</p>

<p>I would like to say one more word arising out of the statement of the Joint Under-Secretary. In answer to my hon. Friend the Member for East Fife (Mr. Stewart) the hon. Gentleman took the line that he had given way on the question of agriculture, and appeared to think that he was being asked to give way further on the question of market gardens. Nothing is further from the truth. One must have a comparison with something. The comparison is with agricultural land; otherwise, there would never be any development values at all. There is no giving way. What is the basis of this legislation? Surely it is the Uthwatt Report. That Report says:
<q>The owner of a farm, for instance, will remain free to farm in such a manner as be thinks fit and to make any such improvements as are in his view proper.</q>
What could be more proper than building additional houses on a farm? The Report goes on:
<q>The occupier of a house and garden or park which falls within the scheme will remain free to use his property for all the purposes of his residence, and (subject to compliance with any local bye-laws) will remain entitled to put up such additional buildings as are necessary or designed for the improvement or amenities of his house.</q>
Those are the two things for which we are asking, and for which we think there should be provision in this Schedule. On agricultural land a man should be entitled to build houses for his workers and to improve the houses which exist there

without any limitation; secondly, a person who is in occupation of a house should be able to make any improvements he wishes to that house, and to build anything in his garden without payment of a development charge, provided, of course, he gets planning permission. Those are the two things which we think should be in the Schedule.</p>

This new Clause is based on Section 33 of the 1932 Act, and the object of the Clause is to enable local planning authorities, with the approval of the Secretary of State, to make agreements with owners and other persons with an interest in land for restricting and regulating the development and the use of land

<p>I would like to ask the right hon. Gentleman of what use this new Clause is, particularly from the point of view of Subsection (3). If I understand it aright, an owner of land may bind himself not to do certain things or to develop his land in a certain way, and he may get the approval of the Secretary of State and the planning authority, but at any moment any other Minister may break the whole bargain, or, indeed, the Secretary of State himself may do so if he changes his mind. There is no security to the landowner that the Government will keep their side of the bargain. Subsection (3) seems to give notice to anyone intending to make an agreement, to this effect: "Take notice that the Government may break their side of the bargain at any time they like." What is the good of asking people to make agreements in those circumstances? Surely, when the Secretary of State gives his approval to an agreement, be ought to be able to say, "My part of the agreement is that I guarantee you will not be interfered with for ten, 15 or 20 years." Unless he can give a guarantee of that sort, the agreement is just waste paper. Before this Bill becomes law, I hope the right hon. Gentleman will consider whether he can do something of that description which will make it worth while for landowners to enter into an agreement.</p>

<p>Before the right hon. Gentleman replies, I would like to know whether Subsection (2) is enforceable in the hands of the owner of land. It is enforceable at the instance of the authority, but is it enforceable at the instance of the authority alone?

and to give it full consideration. I will certainly consider the point with regard to the possibility of making it a fixed agreement. Subsection (3) is the ordinary safeguarding provision. This point was repeatedly argued in Committee, and it is the usual constitutional point. No Minister will take action unless he is consulted, and then it becomes a collective decision. With regard to the point concerning the possibility of giving a guarantee for a certain period, I will look into it.</p>

This new Clause is in substitution of the present Clause 31, which we think could be improved. At present, it is not quite clear from the wording whether the other enactment referred to is one which will be in force when the Bill becomes law. Moreover, the original Clause 31 made no provision for amending the references to Part II of the 1945 Act. This also is provided for. The new Clause is simply a clarification of the original Clause.</p>

<p>I beg to move, "That the Clause be read a Second time."<br/>
Clause 3 of the Bill makes it clear that if an area of land is to be comprehensively developed, it does not necessarily mean that every yard of the land&#x2014;every portion&#x2014;is to be developed. That is what Clause 3 does. We think it desirable to include in this Bill similar powers in connection with the new towns. The new Clause also makes it clear that development corporations under the New Towns Act may dispose of land not only for the purposes of securing development of the new towns, but for any purposes connected therewith. That is the purpose of the new Clause.</p>

<p>Owing to our procedure we are coming now to this question of comprehensive redevelopment in a narrow sphere, before we deal with the more general question at a later stage of our proceedings today. Therefore, I must deal with it here and not let it pass by default. I cannot understand what the reason is for one of these corporations acquiring land which it does not intend to alter or develop. If it is not going to alter or develop the land, only two motives, that occur to me, can possibly actuate the corporation; either it wants to offer the land to the existing owner at a rent which gives it a profit over the price it chooses to pay; or else it wants to turn out the existing owner&#x2014;I am taking the existing owner-occupier for simplicity, and very often he will be an owner-occupier&#x2014;and put in some friend of its own. I should have thought both of these highly unsocial things to do; but there is no provision against them that I am aware of, either in this new Clause or in the subsequent Amendments that are to be moved from the benches opposite in due course.<br/>
If neither of these is the object, what is the object? Why should not the landlord remain there? What harm is he doing? I cannot see why the new town corporation


or any other corporation should seek to buy this land except to make a profit. If that is the motive, let us know about it. Let us, at least, have a guarantee that that would be the motive. If there is not to be any redevelopment, the person who is in occupation at the moment should have security of tenure. I ask the hon. Gentleman whether the Rent Restriction Acts apply against the new town corporation. I do not know the answer to that question. If the Rent Restriction Acts do apply, and there is to be no knocking down of the houses, then, to that extent, my point is met. But there are a great many people not covered by the Rent Restriction Acts, such as people who pay rent above the limit; people who have mixed residential and business premises; people who have services or furniture in addition&#x2014;though it is not likely in this connection&#x2014;to the premises; and then, of course, there are offices, shops, and so on.<br/>
5.15 p.m.<br/>
Will the hon. Gentleman give us a firm undertaking that if any of these new bodies acquire land which they are not going to develop, they will be compelled by the Secretary of State to afford security of tenure to the people they find in occupation when they buy? That seems to me to be a very reasonable request, and one which we cannot possibly leave unanswered if we are to accept this new Clause; one to which, I think, we are entitled to have a definite answer before we get past this new Clause. When I say security of tenure, naturally, I include the people who own the land today. If they are owners at the moment, then there must be some provision for arbitration as to the proper amount for them to pay in future as tenants. If we buy out an owner-occupier and promise him security of tenure we must refer to some independent person the amount of rent he is to pay as the tenant. He was the owner before, and now becomes a tenant. If he is to remain in occupation there must be some means of fixing his rent.<br/>
I hope very much that the hon. Gentleman can answer that question, which seems to me to require an answer before we can accept this new principle. I am not at all clear that we can accept it even with that assurance, when we come

to the body of the Bill. I should not myself be inclined to divide on this new Clause if I got that assurance, and I say so for this reason: that it is quite obvious that the serious situation with regard to housing is such that no one, no Minister, could properly proceed with the building of a new town just now, because, quite obviously, it would take at least twice as much labour and material to settle 100 people in a new town as it would to settle them in, new houses in an old town. I cannot believe that any Minister with any sense of responsibility would proceed at present with the building of a new town. Therefore, I am not so urgently concerned about this matter as I am about the same provisions in the body of the Bill. But when we come to the body of the Bill we shall have to pursue this matter at some length. I should be prepared to advise my hon. Friends to accept this new Clause if, and only if, we get a firm assurance that no person will be displaced as a result of the compulsory acquisition of land which it is not intended to develop immediately.</p>

<p>If I may have permission to answer a number of points that have been raised, I would say, first, that it is not the intention of the Secretary of State that the new towns corporations ought to buy land for the purposes of speculation&#x2014;that is, for the purpose of ensuring a high rent on favourable terms I am really surprised that the right hon. and learned Gentleman should always look for sinister motives. This is not sinister. With the new towns starting, it is difficult to say to a yard or to an acre just exactly what is the actual ground that is required, and the corporation, the new town corporation, may take in more ground than it afterwards finds it actually needs. That is all that this Clause does, and it is not with any purpose of having a tenant or increasing the value. It is for that purpose and for that purpose alone. The Rent Restriction Act does apply under the New Towns Act and under this Bill. It does not abrogate or set aside the Rent Restriction Act.</p>

<p>The New Towns Act does not set aside the Rent Restriction Act, and the Rent Restriction Act, will, therefore, apply to the new towns. As to the question of security, as the right hon.


and learned Gentleman knows, another Clause of this Bill looks after the security of the person displaced from a house, and makes his position reasonably secure. That will be applied in the same way by the Secretary of State to persons displaced under the New Towns Act. For the information of the right hon and learned Member, I say that I would not be a party, even with a new town, to turning anybody out on to the street needlessly and thoughtlessly. Indeed, I have been in conflict with one or two local authorities who almost want to put out on to the street what we call "squatters," because they want the land for a park or something of that description I would not be a party to that. The House may take it that all the reasonable assurances in other Clauses of the Bill, which apply to reasonable safeguards for the purpose of securing alternative accommodation, will, in my view, be operative in regard to the new towns. With the safeguards and guarantees I have given, I trust that the right hon. and learned Member can now accept the proposed new Clause.</p>

<p>I beg to move, "That the Clause be read a Second time."<br/>
In the Scottish Standing Committee we had a fairly lengthy discussion on the problems associated with designation, and this new Clause is intended to meet some of the points which were put forward by hon. Members opposite during those Debates. The Clause provides that where land is designated by a development plan for compulsory acquisition and has not been acquired at the end of 12 years, or in the case of agricultural land at the end of eight years&#x2014;no doubt it will be argued that we have not gone far enough, but this is an honest endeavour to try to meet the points which were made, and the Government are fixing a limited number of years&#x2014;the owner may, by notice, require the Minister, the local authority or the statutory undertaking for whose purposes the land has been designated, to buy the land. If at the end of six months thereafter, notice to treat has not been served, or an offer has not been made to acquire the land, the designation ceases to have effect. As I have already said, this is an honest endeavour on my part, having considered the arguments that were used in Committee, to meet a point which was then raised.</p>

<p>I beg to move, as an Amendment to the proposed Clause, in line 2, to leave out "twelve," and to insert "seven."<br/>
I should also like to discuss at the same time the following Amendment, which is consequential: In line 39, to leave out "eight," and to insert "five." We on this side of the House are grateful for this new Clause, so far as it goes. As the Secretary of State has said, it is an attempt, which he described as an honest attempt&#x2014;and I am sure none of us would think that he could contemplate doing anything dishonest&#x2014;to go as far as he could to meet what we said in the Committee. Let us look at what is being done. Under this Bill, land can be designated on a development plan as subject to compulsory acquisition for certain purposes. Those purposes are varied and wide. Land may be designated as subject to compulsory acquisition by any Government Department for the purpose of that

Department. It may be designated as subject to compulsory acquisition by statutory undertakers for the purposes of their statutory undertakings. It may be designated as subject to compulsory acquisition by local authorities for any public local purpose. It may also be designated, if it is part of an area which it is intended to develop comprehensively, or to redevelop.<br/>
Also&#x2014;and here is the rub&#x2014;it may be designated as subject to compulsory acquisition if, in the opinion of the local planning authority it ought to be subject to compulsory acquisition for the purpose of securing its use in a manner proposed by the plan. If that does not mean almost anything, I do not know what it does mean. It means, in effect, that almost any land comprised in a development order may be designated by the local planning authority as subject to compulsory acquisition. What happens to the owner of the property comprised in that area of designation? He is immediately cast under what we have described as "the blight of designation," which hangs like a cloud over his head. A man who owns a house, a farm, a shop or a factory sees from the plan that that house, that farm, that shop or that factory may be taken from him by compulsory powers within the next five years. It may even be taken from him within the next 10 years, because the Secretary of State cannot confirm the plan, in so far as it designates land subject to compulsory acquisition, unless he is satisfied that that compulsory acquisition is likely to take place within the next 10 years.<br/>
What we argued in Committee, the point of view we put forward and sought to bring to the attention of the Government, was that where a man had in that way been placed, as it were, under sentence of death, he should be allowed&#x2014;if he had an opportunity of rehousing himself, or of re-accommodating himself elsewhere&#x2014;to go to the local authority and to say, "I have found another house, or farm. Fulfil now the purpose of your designation and take my property from me compulsorily now; and pay me for it so that I will have the money with which to buy another place." One can conceive circumstances in which agricultural land will be designated as subject to compulsory acquisition, because, indeed, most of the development which is likely to take


place under the terms of this Bill will be the development of agricultural land. Agricultural land is practically the only source of vacant land in this country.<br/>
5.30 p.m.<br/>
So a farmer owning a farm within an area which has been designated as subject to compulsory acquisition will at once do two things. First, he will stop doing anything but essential repairs. He will carry out any maintenance which is necessary, such as putting tiles on the roof to keep out the weather, but he will not go in for any schemes of improvement. He will not try to convert a mixed farm into a dairy farm. He will not go in for planning which involves capital sums. He will certainly not do that unsocial thing, as one might be led to think from the attitude of the Government, of building a new cottar house. He will spend as little as possible, because he will know that his farm is likely to be taken away from him in the next 10 years. In the second place, he will look around to find another farm in which to rehouse himself. That means going round two or three counties to find the right type, because farms cannot easily be picked up in Scotland today. There will be a newspaper advertisement to the effect that offers are to be lodged on such and such a date, that boundaries will be pointed out on application, appointment to be made, and so on. It is not a case of only one or two offers being made, but of dozens. There is no doubt that this man will be in a very difficult position, because he will not know what he can offer for any property.<br/>
We argue that such a man ought to have the power to compel the local planning authority to fulfil the purposes of designation by acquiring the farm from him if he so desires, which will provide him with the money to rehouse himself. The right hon. Gentleman has made an honest attempt to meet us. By this Amendment, we are seeking to make this honest attempt a little more honest. The Government have said that in the case of farmland the farmer will have that power if the land has been designated for a period of eight years. Goodness me, is he for eight years to sit with this sword of Damocles hanging over his head, with his property unimproved, and without being able to help himself until the period has expired? We are seeking to do a

little more for him by reducing the period to five years.<br/>
In the case of the owner of a house, the Secretary of State, in his honest desire to meet us as far as he can, has said that after 12 years the owner can come along and say to the local planning authority: "Dash it all, you have had this compulsory purchase hanging over my head for 12 years; you must now come and buy the property." Only after 12 years can he make them do that. We are suggesting that the period should be reduced to seven years. I wish to justify this period of seven years, because it may seem rather an odd period. The House will recollect, that, under the terms of the Bill, planning authorities have to draw up development plans at once, and these have to be revised after five years, and thereafter in quinquennial periods. We say, if land has been designated for the first quinquennial period and has then been redesignated, and if the planning authority have not exercised their powers two years after the first revision, the owner should then be able to compel them to do so.<br/>
An owner who compels a local authority to take over his land will not be particularly well off, because he is not getting the market value, but the market price for the existing use. It will not come under the old compensation terms of the Acquisition of Land Act, 1919&#x2014;the market value as between a willing buyer and willing seller&#x2014;but it will be the restricted value under the terms of the new Clause we accepted in Committee. Therefore, it will not be any great inducement to the owner to come along. There will be no glittering prize here. He will have to take a very modest value. In spite of that, we ought to give the owner the power to compel a local authority, at the earliest possible moment, to take over his house, or farm, his base of operations, his factory, or his shop, after this cloud of designation has been hanging over him for many years.</p>

<p>I beg to second the Amendment.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for West Aberdeen (Mr. Thornton-Kemsley) referred to this honest attempt by the Government to meet us, and asked the right hon. Gentleman to make it more


honest by accepting this Amendment. I should have thought that our modest attempt is too modest, because it leaves this period of uncertainty hanging over the individual who has had his land or property designated, for an extremely long time. One of the grave anxieties from which this country is suffering at the present moment is the cloud of uncertainties, some of greater magnitude than others, such as whether we are to get our coal, attain our exports and dollars, and so on.</p>

<p>I had no intention of expatiating on that, but wished merely to show that here was another uncertainty, admittedly a minor one compared with the enormities we have to face in other directions. Under this new Clause, a man will not know whether his property or land is to be taken away from him at the end of the day&#x2014;in one case it is 12 years, and in the other case eight years&#x2014;of whether it will be handed back to him. Let us take the case of the owner of a timber yard. He finds that his timber yard is within a designated area. For 12 years he will not know whether he has to equip himself with another timber yard, or whether it will be handed back to him at the end of the day. The Joint Under-Secretary said on another Clause that the new towns corporations may take more land than they may ultimately find necessary.<br/>
So the chances are very real that individuals will find themselves in a designated area, and will not know whether they will have their asset refused or whether it will be taken. That puts people into an intolerable position. I do not know if Members opposite realise the paraphernalia which has to be gone through if a farmer wishes to turn his farm into a "T.T." farm. New buildings have to be put up and all sorts of regulations observed. Is there any chance that the farmer will take those steps when he does not know whether his farm will be taken from him or left with him? This is a modest attempt to improve the Clause. I, personally, would have liked to go much

further. Does the right hon. Gentleman say that the Government are unable to make up their minds, in five or seven years, whether they will need these assets, this land, or not? If so, that is not the streamlined Socialist legislation which the people have been looking for from this Government.</p>

<p>I have listened carefully to the arguments which have been submitted in favour of the Amendment and which admitted, in principle, that there must be a number of years of uncertainty. I admit that designation might lead to some uncertainty. The only issue between us is as to the number of years. Designation has an advantage, but I am prepared to admit that it has certain disadvantages. We are now dealing with long-term planning for Scotland, and in that planning there must some uncertainty for some people. Designation has an advantage in that it limits the uncertainty by making it clear that the land is to be compulsorily acquired within a certain time, although some people might suffer disadvantages through the designation of their land. It has been proposed that instead of 12 years and eight years there should be substituted seven years and five years respectively. Designation is intended to cover a programme of development for 10 years ahead, and it is known to Members who took part in the Standing Committee proceedings that at the five-year point the plan has to be reviewed, a process which will take several months to complete. So the 12-year period will correspond roughly with the completion of the second review of the plan.<br/>
If the 12-year period is reduced to seven years, and the eight years is reduced to five, local authorities will be most reluctant to designate land and the whole purpose of designation will be defeated. There is no lack of initiative or inability on the part of the Government to make up their minds in this matter. The local authorities will be designating the land, not the Secretary of State for Scotland. They must have some time in which to carry through their work. I thought I had gone a reasonable distance to meet the points which were discussed in Committee, and I trust that the Amendment will not be pressed to a Division. If it is, I must ask the House to reject it.</p>

<p>The right hon. Gentleman told us that he has accepted the principle, but the principle can be so watered down that it is not worth anything at all, which is about, the position we have come to here now. To suggest that local authorities, having made their plans, require two periods of five years to think out modifications, seems to be stretching things a little too far. If they consider the plans carefully to start with &#x2014;as they will&#x2014;then have another consideration of it after five years, and then be allowed a further two years, and the land is not then required for any purpose, surely they have had sufficient time. Agricultural land will be nearer the outside than the other land, and five years should be sufficient to enable local authorities to decide whether they want the land. Local authorities are quite capable of working within a reasonable time, and I could not follow the right hon. Gentleman when he said that if they were to get only seven years they would not be willing to designate. Why not? They have a right and duty to do that. The term of uncertainty should be as short as possible, and unless the right hon. Gentleman is willing to think again I must advise my hon. Friends behind me to divide the House.</p>

<p>So that we can have some guidance on this matter, I think we should be told by the Government whether they put in the English Bill the seven and five years, or eight years?</p>

<p>I would not dream of dealing with the English Bill now, Mr. Deputy-Speaker, but when there is a Scottish Bill which covers the same point as an English Bill I think we are entitled to know whether the balance is the same. Am I right?</p>

<p>Perhaps we might get some guidance from the Government. It would seem to me as well to have the shorter period, because that would tend to make local authorities hasten in making up their minds.</p>

If it meets with your approval, Mr. Deputy-Speaker, and with that of the House, it might be convenient if we discussed at the same time the next Amendment on the Order Paper, in the name of right hon. Gentlemen opposite, in page 1, line 11, leave out, "have an office," and insert:
<q>appoint a Committee for Scotland which shall consist of members of the Board, not less than three in number, who shall reside in Scotland, and the Board may delegate, subject to such restriction or conditions as they think fit, any of their functions to the Committee so appointed and the office of the Committee shall be.</q></p>

<p>The Amendment which 1 have moved is designed to comply with an undertaking which I gave in Committee that I would consider the wording of Clause 1 with a view to making it clear that the Scottish office of the Board would handle the ordinary run of Scottish business without reference to the headquarters of the Board in England. I take this opportunity of pointing out that in carrying through their work in Scotland the Board will be under the instructions of the Secretary of State for Scotland and not the Minister of Town and Country Planning who will be responsible for giving instructions as regards the operations of the Board in England. We have not yet determined the precise number to be appointed to the Board, a matter which is still under consideration, but we have decided that the Board shall include at least two representatives from Scotland. These members, of course, will be available for consultation as necessary by the Board's Scottish staff. I suggest that by these arrangements the Amendment would achieve what we all want&#x2014;namely that Scotland should have a real say in the policy of the Board and that Scottish busi-

ness should be handled expeditiously from the Board's offices in Scotland.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1947-07-07a.1854.0" hansard_membership_id="11310" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/30031" speakername="Mr. J. S. C. Reid" colnum="1854" time="">
<p>I rind it very disappointing that after a considerable interval the right hon. Gentleman has not been able to be any more definite than he has been. To begin with, to take the words of the Amendment, all that he seeks to do is to leave out a provision under which the Board were to have had an office in Scotland and to substitute a provision that they shall have an office in Scotland and shall maintain a staff there. I should have thought that it was a very odd thing to have an office without a staff, and therefore it seems to me that the Amendment adds absolutely nothing to what is in the Bill already. We frequently express the view that on important matters of this character we ought to have something in black and white in the Bill, and ought not to be dependent on the mere assurance of a Minister who may or may not survive for a long time, and who may be followed by some one with different views. Even assuming that the right hon. Gentleman's views will continue to be held by his successors for all time to come&#x2014;or at least until we have an opportunity of putting the matter right&#x2014; what has he said? All that he has told us is that the Edinburgh office is to handle the ordinary run of business and that two members of the Board will be available in Scotland for consultation&#x2014;not that the two members of the Board will be stationed at Edinburgh and will themselves conduct the business. Of course he has not said that, because if it were so, they would be absent from the Board in London and would really cease to be members of the Board at all.<br/>
Unless we have a committee or a subdivision of the Board sitting in Edinburgh it necessarily implies that all policy questions which have to come up to the level of decision by the Board must be decided in London. If we are only to have individual members of the Board who are kind enough to travel to Edinburgh and explain to the Edinburgh officials the decisions which they have taken on the Board in London, that is falling a very long way short of having a body in Scotland with executive powers. The Secretary of State has said that he has power to give directions, but he has pointedly refrained from saying what directions he intends to give.<br/>
I do not think that it would be possible under the Bill as it stands, for the Secretary of State to give the only direction that would satisfy me, at least&#x2014;namely, that Scottish members of the Board, sitting in Scotland, shall decide all such Scottish questions as do not require joint decision from the United Kingdom. That cannot be done by direction, because if there is no provision for the Board setting up an executive department or committee in Scotland then all Board decisions must be taken in England. The Secretary of State describes the position accurately when he says that there can only be members of the Board proceeding from the boardroom to Scotland to explain to Scottish officials what the Board have decided or think about a question. There is, therefore, a very sharp conflict in principle between the two views.<br/>
Is the business to be conducted in Scotland only the ordinary run of business? That is to say, is it to be only the routine carrying out of policy decisions reached in London, or is to be the actual executive decision on all such questions as do not require joint action between the Boards of the two countries? The right hon. Gentleman has some experience of forestry, for example, where there is one organisation sitting in two parts, one of which is responsible to the Minister in England and the other to him. I cannot see how, as a matter of practice, a board sitting in London can at the same time obey directions from two different Ministers, and it necessarily follows that so far as general questions are concerned the Secretary of State will not be able to give directions to a board sitting in London. All he will be able to do is to give his directions as to what the Edinburgh people are to do once they have received the London decision on principle. That seems to us to be wholly unacceptable.<br/>
I cannot understand&#x2014;and the Secretary of State has not given one word of explanation&#x2014;why he will not allow a separate Scottish Committee at least, if he will not allow a separate Scottish Board. I should have thought that the conditions in the two countries and the legal and other questions which arise were so different as to make it essential that anybody, dealing with Scottish questions should have a pretty free hand, and that

is quite impossible under the suggestion of the right hon. Gentleman He says, "Well, we may have two people who may consult." I suppose one comes down one week and one another. Scotland will not be fobbed off with something of that kind if we can prevent it, and therefore I am bound to say that I think that Scotland has been extremely shabbily treated in this matter, and that the method which the Secretary of State insists upon inserting into this Bill will merely lead to delay and frustration and to decisions being taken not on special knowledge of Scotland and of Scottish conditions but on a view which may be prevalent in London 400 miles away. The result in practice at the end of the day will be extremely unsatisfactory.</p>

<p>The concession which we have had today from the Secretary of State is an example of how concessions have to be wrung from the Government by sheer hard work in this matter of town and country planning. It reminded me that when the English Bill was first introduced it covered Scotland in only two respects&#x2014;in the fact that there was a Central Board for England and Scotland and there was a certain global sum of &#x00A3;300 million which was divided between England and Wales on the one hand and Scotland on the other as compensation for loss of rights. I had the honour to be a member of Standing Committee D which in detail examined the English Bill, and I further had the honour of moving in it&#x2014;and, if I may say so, I think this is strictly in Order&#x2014;that there should be a separate land board for Scotland, the point about which we are speaking here.<br/>
I was astonished to have a statement from the Minister in charge of the Bill that at no period had any Minister representing Scottish interests ever asked for a separate board or a separate committee for Scotland. That seemed to be a most extraordinary thing&#x2014;so extraordinary that my right hon. and hon. Friends put down an Amendment in the Scottish Committee to secure that we could have a separate committee in Scotland if we could not have a separate land board. That was refused, and now at last on the Report stage we have had an announcement made by the Secretary of State, not in the form of an Amendment, but an announcement on the Amendment on the Order Paper, that there will be at least two members


of the Board who will concern themselves with Scottish matters. It does seem to me that this is an extraordinary way of going about the administration of Scottish affairs.<br/>
We have in this Bill a complete planning code. We have everything necessary to deal with the development of town and country in Scotland, except that we have to go to a Board sitting in Whitehall. It has got at least three things to do. It has to allocate to Scotland a share of the &#x00A3;300 million compensation for loss of development rights; it has to examine individual claims from Scottish owners of lands and buildings who consider that they have lost development value; and it has to adjudicate between them how much they are to receive. It has, in the second place, to assess development charges. When landowners in Scotland want to develop their land they have to go to an English Board sitting in Whitehall to have the development charges assessed and determined. Finally, this Board has, under one of the Clauses of the Bill, to act as a middleman in holding land which has been compulsorily acquired, and reselling it with the addition of the development charge. All of these functions should, in our view, be undertaken by a board of Scotsmen sitting in Edinburgh. There is no need to allow these peculiarly intimate Scottish matters to be determined by Englishmen in London, and it is scandalous that Scotland should be treated in this way. All we can get is this concession that two members of the Board of nine, who will give their consent to matters determined by the Board, should come from Scotland. It is a disgraceful way to deal with this matter.</p>

<p>I share the feelings of my hon. Friend the Member for West Aberdeen (Mr. Thornton-Kemsley) in this matter. I am profoundly disappointed that the Secretary of State should bring forward such a tenuous proposal before this House. We hope that we will convince our English friends that we have a very considerable case irrespective of party. I would remind the House that the problem of the redevelopment of Scotland is not a problem which can well be solved from an office in Edinburgh with one or two persons. In England there are 59,000

square miles to develop and in Scotland there are 33,000 square miles to develop, which is nearly half, I admit, but surely every Scotsman will agree, as will Englishmen, that there is a much greater field of development in Scotland than there is in England, and, on business grounds, we should have something more than a small office to deal with what is half of the amount of land to be developed in these islands.<br/>
If that development of land were an industry, it would not be effectively carried out from what is described as an office. What kind of an office has the Secretary of State in view? He has not condescended to give us any details. Is it a postal box or a box number, because that is what the proposal indicates to me that it may very well be? It seems to me that it is a matter of business arrangement, but if the object of this Bill is only to make provision for the development of Scotland on a semi-effective basis&#x2014;</p>

<p>I am sorry, but the advice was intended for and necessary for the hon. and learned Member for North Aberdeen (Mr. Hector Hughes). He might well consult the Postmaster-General and the Post Office Guide and learn something in regard to a post box. I should


like to ask the Secretary of State to elaborate his views as to what kind of an office this will be. I would be satisfied with an office of the same type and magnitude as the Department of Agriculture in Scotland. I would be satisfied with the example of separating education in Scotland from education in England. I think it would be quite in order if the Secretary himself looked after town and country planning as he has looked after other Departments. I would be satisfied if the office would deal with planning in the same way as the Scottish Office deals with health and housing in Scotland. There is nothing in the Bill to indicate what kind of an office it is, or if it would be an office of the character which 1 have described. I am inclined to think that the Bill enables the Secretary of State&#x2014;I am impressed more by his modesty than his manliness&#x2014;to carry out the statute by asking two or three persons to be in an office somewhere in Scotland. The Amendment does not even say that the office is to be in the capital of Scotland The Secretary of State may take it down to one of the new towns, shortly to be baptized after him by name. That might very well be within the scope of the Amendment, which is quite unnecessary<br/>
This Bill is an important Measure, with a far-reaching effect on our fives. To relegate it, and to delegate it, to a minor office somewhere in Scotland is not seriously meeting the situation. I have said before that the Secretary of State for Scotand suffers from a quality from which I do not suffer myself, and therefore I can identify it more easily in others. He suffers from an overweening modesty and a simplicity of character, which may be commendable in private life but are detestable in public life. He should acquire a greater degree&#x2014;</p>

<p>The hon. Member for West Aberdeen (Mr. Thornton-Kemsley) has referred to this Amendment as embodying a concession, but I cannot see much about it in the way of a concession.

<p>I am very much obliged to my hon. Friend. His intervention clarifies the point, but I still feel that there is no concession in the Amendment. If there is to be a staff in Scotland, it seems to exclude the possibility of any kind of committee or board. The staff will be employees. What was suggested from this side of the House was that there should at least be a committee, but I do not see why there should not be a board. I cannot see


why the Secretary of State for Scotland should not have pressed for a separate board. We have learned that the Lord Chancellor in another place did not object to it, and I see no objection to it. I see no reason why there should not be two boards. The right hon. Gentleman himself said what he will do. He will give instructions to the office. In other words, he will become a sort of branch manager. He will give instructions to the office, but the principal instruction will obviously have been laid down by the Central Land Board, on the instructions of the Minister of Town and Country Planning.</p>

<p>I would direct the hon. Member's attention to the fact that instructions to the Central Land Board are to be given by the Minister of Town and Country Planning, and the Secretary of State for Scotland. I will be inferior to no one in connection with this matter.</p>

<p>I quite understand that the right hon. Gentleman wishes to take a full part in promoting the welfare of Scotland, but we say that he will not be in a position to do so. After all, he will not represent anything like the same population as will the Minister of Town and Country Planning, who is to give the broad directives to the Central Land Board. At best he will be the junior partner. Subsection (3) says:
<q>The Board shall, in the performance of their functions under this Act, comply with such directions as may be given to them by the Secretary of State.</q>
Are the Board to receive two separate sets of instructions, one for England and the other for Scotland? If so, why have one single board? There should be two boards. If, on the other hand, the whole object of having one Central Land Board is that there should be uniformity of policy throughout the country, obviously it is the Minister of Town and Country Planning who will give the instructions, and not the Secretary of State for Scotland. Therefore, the Amendment is wholly unacceptable. We are in this Bill establishing a broad new principle. The Bill represents possibly the greatest amendment in the law of land tenure for a very long time. No one can say how far-reaching this change will be. Surely, we should bring it into line with past procedure, and have different beards for England and Scotland

to deal with the different land system. It is wholly unacceptable that we should be fobbed off with a sub-office and a staff to run it.</p>

<p>It has after been our habit to describe Scotland as being in the position of an office boy to the managing director, England. Now it is proposed to set up an office for the office boy.

I am surprised that no Scottish Member on the other side who is really interested in Scottish affairs has stood up to say so.</p>

<p>I certainly think that no one interested in Scottish affairs would consider that Scottish interests are being properly met. Of all the things which are bad in this thoroughly bad Bill, the Central Land Board is the most disastrous, from the point of view of Scotland. It is not the least bit of good for the Secretary of State for Scotland to say that he will fight for Scotland and that everything will be all fight. We have heard that promise about several other Bills which have gone through this House, and we know where Scotland has gone as the result of them. There is not much chance of the right hon. Gentleman getting his way over the other seven members of the Board who are to say what shall be done. It is tragic that we should have to put up with an Amendment like this and be told that it is a concession which will do all that is necessary for Scotland. It is an absolute travesty of government for Scotland.</p>

<p>I take a very definite view with regard to Scotland's place in legislation. After listening to this discussion, I cannot see that there is any material difference between what is proposed by the Government and what is proposed by the Opposition. There is a Central Land Board which is to be responsible for general policy throughout the United Kingdom. Hon. Members above the Gangway suggest that there should be a committee of that Board in Scotland under the direction of the Central Land Board. If that committee is to be under the


direction of the Central Land Board, I cannot see that there is any fundamental difference between the two sides in this matter. With the Minister of Town and Country Planning, the Secretary of State for Scotland is giving instructions to the Central Land Board, and in doing so he will be seeing that the particular circumstances of Scotland are adequately dealt with. Having listened to what hon. Members said about Scottish interests, the Government are seeking in their Amendment to make it plain that this office in Scotland will be a very responsible one with a full administration in Scotland for carrying out this Bill.</p>

<p>I cannot agree with the hon. Member for Camlachie (Mr. Stephen) that there is no substantial difference between this Amendment and the one which will not now be called. I am very disappointed at the manner in which the Secretary of State for Scotland submitted his Amendment. He seemed somewhat unhelpful. This point is vital to Scottish interests. In Committee the Secretary of State expressed himself as fully seized of the matter, and I should like to recall the actual words in which he resisted a similar Amendment upstairs. He said:
<q>I am entirely in agreement with the statement that has been made that we require more than an office in Scotland, and I have tried to keep that in my mind in all the discussions in which I have taken part in seeking to frame the Bill now before the Committee."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, <i>Standing Committee on Scottish Bills,</i> 17th April, 1947; c 13.]</q>
If the Secretary of State really thought and felt that, he has not done very much this afternoon to make good the intentions he told us he had in mind in Committee and to which he promised he would give effect on the Report stage. He has proposed only that the office shall be enlarged so as to ensure that there shall be an adequate secretarial staff always there, but that goes no way towards ensuring that there shall be permanently in Scotland, not employees of the Board, but people of independent mind and judgment, having special knowledge and care for the interests of Scotland, who shall decide questions relating to the very special interests of Scotland when they come up for decision before the Central Land Board as a whole. The land area of Scotland is rather more than one-third of the United Kingdom, and there is, possibly, more litigation over land questions in Scotland than over any other matter. Surely, the Secretary of State for Scotland realises that it will be impossible to deal with Scottish land interests by the mere addition of these words regarding the secretarial staff. Independent people with special knowledge of land tenure and agriculture as prac-


tised in Scotland should be permanently in Scotland for this purpose. There is nothing in the Amendment to ensure that.<br/>
We are setting up a great new landlord in Scotland. A lot has been said about the smaller landlords of Scotland in the past. I should have thought that hon. Gentlemen opposite would have sympathised with the spirit underlying our fears and would have supported us, if necessary, in the Division Lobby, against the Secretary of State for Scotland, not on the grounds that this Amendment is in itself contrary to Scottish interests, but from the point of view that it does nothing at all to ensure that there shall be permanently in Scotland, people with special knowledge of land tenure and agricultural conditions.</p>

These matters could quite well be passed over to them. I want to know who is to take decisions? Is every decision to be taken in England, or is there to be someone in this office in Edinburgh to make decisions so far as Scotland is concerned? Unless we can get absolute clarity on that point and be convinced that there is to be some person or persons in Scotland who can take decisions on their own, without referring every matter to England, then we shall require to divide against this Amendment.</p>

<p>If I may, I will reply briefly to the points raised Certainly the decisions will be taken by the Board. It is perfectly true that the Board may be sitting in London, but on that Board of, shall I say, seven&#x2014;because that is what I have roughly in mind&#x2014;there has been no final determination as to the number&#x2014;Scotland will have its two representatives. When the decisions are arrived at, there may be, in the application, principles which will be common to both countries. Incidentally, I have over-run the point that the decisions will be made by the Minister of Town and Country Planning and the Secretary of State jointly, and in the operation of the Board in Scotland, the Board will be under the instruction not of the two Ministers but of the one only, the Secretary of State for Scotland. He is the one who will be empowered to give instructions in the operation of their work inside Scotland.<br/>
I have all along resisted the idea of two boards. The Central Land Board will be dealing with principles of valuation common both to England and Scotland, and in amplifying what was already in the Bill by the Amendment I have moved I thought I was meeting some of the points raised in Committee that it would only be a post box, that it would only be an office boy, and charges of that kind. Right hon. Gentlemen opposite did not seem to understand in Committee that when one used the. Term "office," it meant the necessary staff to carry through the work, and the pledge I gave the Committee was that I would seek to amplify that, and


the Amendment now before the House does so and guarantees that there will be an adequate staff to carry on the day to day administrative work in Scotland. One of the functions will be the distributing of Scotland's share of the &#x00A3;300 million available to the United Kingdom. Any proposals for the constitution of a separate Board or, indeed, for a separate Scottish Committee of the Board, would imply that the Board or the Committee might proceed on entirely different principles in Scotland. That I am not prepared to accept; that I am resisting, and that I will continue to resist because I think it cannot be to the advantage of Scotland when we are dealing with general problems of valuation or of revenue or of the collecting of the moneys necessary in connection with the development charges.</p>

<p>I have already decided that when the general principles are accepted, the administration of those principles&#x2014;particularly in view of the fact that Scotland has a distinct system of land tenure as compared with England&#x2014;will be under the instructions of the Secretary of State. That is what I set out to achieve. If anyone says I did not, they are wrong. I will argue for what I think is right on the part of Scotland; if I am wrong, it will be for this House to turn it down and, ultimately, for the country to turn it down, but I am sure that will be a long time ahead.

<q>(4) The report made by the Board for any year under Section two of the Town and Country Planning Act, 1947, shall set out any direction given by the Secretary of State to the Board during that year unless the Secretary of State has notified to the Board his

opinion that it is against the national interest so to do.</q>
This Amendment means that it is incumbent on the Central Land Board to set out any arrangements come to during the year at the direction of the Secretary of State, unless they are quite definitely

<p>I do not object to there being disclosure of directions but I do object very strongly to the Secretary of State having power to suppress some directions on such vague grounds as "the national interest." When we are dealing with security considerations, the Armed Forces, or something which affects foreign countries, or as in the Health Bill when we were dealing with information premature disclosure of which might be extremely hurtful to certain people who are rather hypochondriacal, I consider there is a need for concealment of certain matters. But I cannot imagine a possible class of direction with regard to anything which happens under this Bill, which it is contrary to the national or public interest to disclose. I hope that whoever replies will tell us the kind of case they have in mind. Then, possibly at a later stage, we can get a more restricted word to cover it.<br/>
The national interest may appear quite different to people on different sides of the House. A Secretary of State may some day consider it in the national interest that his party shall remain in power, and not be discredited, and therefore take the view that some direction, publication of which he thought might bring his party into discredit, ought not to be disclosed in the national interest. That is a process of argument which might very easily be followed. There is no check, and if a Secretary of State took it upon himself to do that, no one would ever know. We had an argument about this subject on the National, Health Bill and it was pointed out that there were a number of people serving part-time on that body, and if they thought that the Secretary of State was misusing his power they could say so. But here we are dealing with a small body, the Central Land Board, everyone of whom is indebted to the Government in one form or another, and however much a member of that Board may feel that the Secretary of State's direction is bad, he will have too great a personal inducement to allow him to open his mouth, and there will never be any disclosure of a suppressed direction.

People will then begin to wonder whether the Board&#x2014;who have been acting in a very political way&#x2014;have been influenced by some underhand direction which the Secretary of State has decided to suppress. There is no doubt that that sort of thing will get about. It may be that no responsible person in this House, and no responsible person outside, would say it, but some irresponsible people would say it, and it is very wrong that they should have an opportunity of saying it. I hope we shall be told what the Government have in mind; that they agree that this limitation is not necessary, and that Amendments will be introduced to make certain that everything is square and above board, and all directions are published.</p>

<p>The right hon. and learned Gentleman says that this might be used for a party purpose, but as I read the words, not being a lawyer, that would not be the case, because it says, "in the national interest." Certainly, a party interest, as I understand it, would not be described as the public interest. This is a provision which has been in many other enactments If I am asked what I am guarding against, I say frankly, "Nothing at all at the moment, other than that in other enactments similar to this one, this power has been taken by all Cabinets and Governments in the past, in case an emergency arises in which the public interest may be involved." We are doing nothing more than has been done over a long period of years. If I am asked whether we propose to use this Subsection now, my answer is definitely and decidedly, "No. 'We take this power for one reason only, namely, that a set of conditions may arise in the future in which, in the national interest and the public interest, such a direction should not be stated in the Board's report</p>

<p>The Joint Under-Secretary of State has given us a pathetic and inept reply. He says, "I do not want this power for use now. I am thinking of the future, of some terrible thing ahead." By that I presume he means, for example, war. If a Government were to find themselves in the middle of an emergency, in which they need special powers, the hon. Gentleman


knows as well as I do that this House would give the Government all the emergency powers they wanted in a matter of a few hours. Therefore, this proposal is pure humbug. If a Government require powers in an emergency, they can get them. If the Government do not need any such power as this what right have they to ask for it? Let us consider the case of the small man. There will be tens of thousands of small claims upon this Board. The small man will come to the Board, which will issue a decision. Who is the dominating character in the Board? The Secretary of State says that the Board acting in Scotland takes its orders from him. Therefore, he is the boss. This little man makes his claim and is turned down; he loses all his possessions, his land or his property for a mere pittance, or he is obliged to pay a heavy development fee.</p>

<p>That is not an issue raised by this Amendment. All that is raised is that there will be an annual report published, and any direction which has been given by the Secretary of State must be published in that report, unless it is not in the public interest to do so.</p>

<p>That bears on the case of a small man whose appeal is turned down by the Board and who applies to his lawyer for help His lawyer looks at all the published regulations and advises him that there is nothing in them to cause the Board to come to that decision. The man goes to law. But is it then disclosed that the Board is working under the secret direction? Apparently not. Is that justice? Are we to hold in this country that Ministers are to act on secret powers which not even a court can discover? It is rank Hitlerism&#x2014;[<i>Laughter.</i>] No wonder hon. Members of the Labour Party laugh. They want rule by central direction, but this country has not fought and won the war for that; it has done so to defend the essential liberty and law of our land, which is that rules and directions issued by Parliament, and by Ministers through Parliament, shall be given the fullest public notice. Since that is not ensured here, we must oppose this Amendment.</p>

<p>The Joint Under-Secretary of State said that this provision has been included in several Bills lately. He is quite right. It has been, and in each case, I recall, it was a matter of national security which was involved. In the case of a Bill which we have just passed on to another place the Solicitor-General stated that national security was what the Government had in mind when he said, "in the national and public interest," and an Amendment was accepted substituting "national security" for "national interest." It is in that sense also that the words "national interest" have been interpreted in relation to the Civil Aviation Act, for example. Surely, the Joint Under-Secretary will tell us that he means that; that he does not mean what the Minister of Food means when he says that it is not in the national interest to disclose the prices of foreign bulk purchases.</p>

<p>I will look at the matter between now and the time when the Bill goes to another place I am strongly advised that these words cover the point, and that that is the only interpretation that can be placed upon the Amendment. The hon. Member for Dumfries has asked whether the national interest means what he interpreted it to mean. I say, "Yes, in its best sense, the security sense." That is all that is meant, and I am advised that that is all that would be allowed by the terms of the Amendment.

<p>I beg to move, in page 3, line 14, to leave out "commencement of this Act," and to insert "appointed
day."<br/>
As the existing planning Acts have been repealed as from the appointed day, and as the existing planning Acts system will cease to operate, it has been thought better to bring the provisions of Clause 3 into force as from the appointed day instead of from the date of the passing of the Bill. There is nothing to prevent a local authority from going ahead with this work in spite of this provision.</p>

<p>It may be that, in fact, local authorities will go ahead, but I am afraid that if they read this Bill carefully, they will not go ahead. I entirely accept the hon. Gentleman's reasons as being good in the case of the Amendment to line 17, where it is proposed to leave out "commencement of this Act" and to insert "appointed day." However, they are not good reasons for doing it at line 14. If this Amendment is made, the Clause will read:
<q>As soon as may be after the appointed day, every local planning authority shall carry out a survey &#x2026;</q>
That means that they must not start until the appointed day. If the Clause is left as it stands, it reads:
<q>As soon as may be after the commencement of this Act, every local planning authority shall carry out a survey.</q>
Then they are not only allowed, but encouraged, to go ahead straight away. We all know that their resources in manpower and skilled assistance are limited. I should have thought that the hon. Gentleman would want them to get ahead at the earliest possible moment. Therefore, I should have thought he would have dropped the first Amendment, but would have insisted on the second. That would give them an extra six or nine months to conclude their job. Even with that extra time. it is very doubtful if they could do it. I suspect that some one, having seen that it was necessary to change the wording at line 17, also changed it at line 14 without a great deal of thought. I suggest that it would be very much better to drop this Amendment and to proceed with the next one.</p>

<p>What I mean is that J have consulted the officials. I should think that hon. Gentlemen opposite would do me the credit of saying that I am as little in anybody's power as any hon. Member. I have consulted the officials who guide me in these matters, and they take the view that it would be administratively difficult if this Amendment were dropped. They take the view that on the appointed day, salaries and other considerations should be fixed. This is not a political point. It is one of administration. The hon. and gallant Member for Central Glasgow (Colonel Hutchison) said that it would help if we knew when the appointed day is to be. I will answer him quite frankly. We are working in order to make a start early in the New Year. We have not fixed a date, but it is hoped that the appointed day will be in the early part of next year. I will discuss this matter with my advisers. They advise me that it is necessary to have this wording for the purpose of uniformity in connection with salaries, etc. If the Clause were left as it is it would lead to confusion.

<p>I will take whatever is the most convenient course for hon. Members. The Amendments in page 3 hang together. They are really a redraft of this part of the Clause. I agree that hon. Members opposite have a point in regard to page 4. The first two Amendments to page 3, those dealing with lines 41 and 42, deal with the designation of land for the purpose of a Minister, local authority or statutory


undertaking. As the Clause stands, it provides that any land required by a Minister, local authority or statutory undertaker may be designated. We think that it would be better if the designation applied to land allocated by the plan for the purposes of the functions of a Minister, local authority or statutory undertaker. That is what these two Amendments provide. The Amendment to line 43 is purely drafting.<br/>
So far as page 4 is concerned, the Amendment in line 12 provides that a development plan may designate, as land subject to compulsory acquisition, land which, in the opinion of the local authority, ought to be subject to compulsory acquisition for the purpose of securing development in the manner proposed by the plan. Under the Clause as it stands, land may be designated as subject to compulsory acquisition where, in the opinion of the local authority, it is likely to require compulsory acquisition. Where land is designated, it does not necessarily follow that it will be compulsorily acquired, but, if the owner is willing to develop it in accordance with the plan, or will sell it at a reasonable price for that purpose, compulsory acquisition would obviously be unnecessary, and that is why we suggest this change as an improvement. The Amendment to line 14, I think, raises an issue in which hon. Members opposite are particularly interested. In effect, it provides a definition of the area of comprehensive development.</p>

<p>There is a matter of some importance concerned with these Amendments, and, particularly the second one. I hope the right hon. and learned Gentleman will tell us what that Amendment means, because, frankly, I do not know. The drafting of Subsection (2. <i>b</i>) will now, I think, be as follows:
<q>(6) designate as land subject to compulsory acquisition by any Minister, local authority or statutory undertakers, any land allocated by the plan for the purposes of any of their functions"&#x2014;</q>
So far, that is clear enough, and then, in brackets&#x2014;
<q>(including any land which that Minister of authority or those undertakers are or could be authorised to acquire compulsorily under any enactment under than this Act).</q>
I fail to understand the purpose of that parenthesis. If it is only intended to mean that there shall not be allocated in the plan anything which a Minister could not acquire, well, that makes sense, but that is not quite what it says, and I am wondering whether it is not opening the door to an allocation of land in the plan, not on the grounds that a Minister is authorised to acquire it or because he might want it immediately, but only on the grounds that he could be authorised to acquire it. I cannot see the purpose of putting in those words, and I would ask that the inclusion of the words in parentheses should be reconsidered.<br/>
The drafting of this Subsection has now got into something of a tangle. It always did suffer from trying to compress too much into a few lines, and we very often find that, when trying to compress a lot of ideas into a few words, they do not fit very well and that the result is somewhat confusing. I think that we are here trying to put enough material for two or three Subsections into one. I hope that all that is meant is that there shall not be allocated on the plan anything that could not be compulsorily acquired. That could be one meaning, but the Subsection goes on to mix it up, and it seems to me that it may mean the designation of a great deal of land that ought not to be designated at all at that stage, and I


should be glad if the Lord Advocate could explain what the purpose of those words in parentheses really is.</p>

<p>There is nothing sinister about this, I can assure the House. It is simply to make clear that, in addition to what a Minister or an authority can do under this Act, they will also be allowed to do under another Act. Its purpose is to include any land which the Minister or the authority or these undertakers are or could be authorised to acquire compulsorily under any enactment other than this Act. They are authorised to acquire compulsorily under this Act, and that is the first of its provisions. Then, they could be authorised to acquire compulsorily under any other enactment. That is really all there, is in it. In view of what the right hon. and learned Gentleman has said, I will certainly have a look at it again, but I do assure him and the House that we are not intending to do anything but make a drafting improvement in the Bill.</p>

This Amendment provides that the development plan may designate as land subject to compulsory acquisition land which, in the opinion of the local authority, ought to be subject to that compulsory acquisition for the purpose of securing its use in the manner proposed by the plan. That is a new test. In the Clause as it stands, the test is slightly different, and it is whether, in the opinion

of the local authority, the land is likely to require compulsory acquisition. This seems to be an improvement which I thought would rather have commended itself to the right hon. and learned Gentleman the Member for Hillhead (Mr. J. S. C. Reid). Where land is designated, it does not necessarily follow that it will be compulsorily acquired, because, if the owner is willing to develop the land in accordance with the plan or is willing to sell it at a reasonable price for the purpose, obviously, compulsory acquisition will not be necessary. That is why it has been thought that a proper test of the need is whether it ought to be subject to compulsory acquisition rather than likely to require compulsory acquisition.</p>

<p>It may seem some what meticulous to go into the niceties of language in this connection, but I think the House will realise that there is a very important question behind this, because if one thing emerged from our discussions upstairs, it was that the designating of land was extremely harmful for the time being, both to the owner and to the public interest. During the interval between designation and acquisition, not only does the market of land contract, and, therefore, the price fall, but obviously nobody is going to develop land which is designated and subject to acquisition, because the land may be taken the next day. We have an Amendment on the Order Paper to deal with that, and I trust that we shall have an opportunity to discuss it later. If this Bill is not to do immense damage, it is essential that we should limit to the utmost possible extent the amount of land designated at any one time, and should say that there should be the shortest possible interval between the decision that it may be wanted and the decision that it is wanted. The question, therefore, is what is the best and the most limiting form of wording to put in this very vague Subsection. As it now stands, the Sub section reads:
<q>any other land which, in the opinion of the local planning authority, is likely to require compulsory acquisition &#x2026;</q>
That seems to suggest that it will not be properly developed unless compulsorily acquired. We raised this question in Committee, but I am bound to say that the wording which it is proposed to substitute is a good deal worse because,


<q>in the opinion of the local planning authority, ought to be subject to compulsory acquisition &#x2026;</q>
seems to my mind to mean nothing at all, unless one knows the political views of the planning authorities. To what is the word "ought" to be related? It should be related to some principle which works in the mind of the planning authority. When we are dealing with what "ought to be" compulsorily acquired, we are getting extremely close to purely political considerations. Hon. Members opposite may say that every piece of land ought to be acquired. Some hon. Members on this side of the House may say that very little should be acquired. Some of us may take a middle view, and say that land ought only to be acquired in limited circumstances, but not in others. Every section of opinion in the House would relate the word "ought" to a different criterion, and, to a very large extent, that criterion would be interpreted according to how far to the Right or Left our general political views happen to be. Therefore, it seems to me to force upon a planning authority which does not want to operate on political grounds, a criterion which as public administrators, they would rather not have.<br/>
If the Lord Advocate wants to use the word "ought," he should say "ought" on some criterion or other, and not leave it in the air. I have no doubt that he is tired of looking for the right wording here. My own view is that the conception of the thing being wrong, probably no right wording exists. He may not find an ideal wording, but he will find a wording which is both better than that in the Bill already, and a great deal better than the words of the Amendment. I hope, therefore, that he will undertake to apply his mind again to this matter in the light of what I have just said, because if we put in the words on the Order Paper we shall be asking for a good deal of trouble in a matter which ought to be as clear and concise as we can possibly make it, if we are not to hamper the development of great areas of our country.</p>

<p>I said that I was prepared to look again at the drafting of this Clause, and I will certainly look at this particular point also. However, I am not holding out any great hope of meeting the right hon. and learned Gentleman's

wishes, because it seems to me that the criterion as to whether land ought to be subject to compulsory acquisition should be judged in the light of the plan. That is the standard. I will certainly look at the matter again.</p>

<p>I think they do. Certainly the first two necessarily hang together, and I think that the third one does&#x2014;at


least, there is one point involved. I can discuss the matter in one speech. If we are to have an area of comprehensive redevelopment, I accept for the moment the view that the whole proprietary rights of that area ought to be acquired at one time by the authority which is charged with the duty of redevelopment. I will not repeat what I said a few moments ago, but it is very unfortunate if the interval between designation and acquisition is too long. I am very apprehensive that as housing development is slowing down, so the date at which we can expect the development of these areas is being postponed, and I am afraid that this Bill may do more damage than it otherwise would, by reason of there being a maximum interval between the first designation and the actual redevelopment. Therefore, perhaps, one has to look a little more narrowly at what is being done.</p>

<p>At any rate, perhaps it is unnecessary to get the grammar exactly right, because I have no doubt that the right hon. and learned Gentleman, when he accepts the Amendment, will put it in order, if it is not already in order. The purpose of the Amendment is clear. We want to exclude from designation land which does not require redevelopment. I am accepting that all land which requires any kind of redevelopment should be acquired in a unit by the authority and redeveloped by that authority. That development may consist in making it an open space, a house, shop or cinema. If that is necessary, I accept that it may then become necessary, although obviously it cannot be done in the next five years, to remove a habitable house which gets

in the way of a new plan, in order to have a proper lay-out. No one could contemplate that sort of thing today in the present state of housing development, but the time may come&#x2014;and will come when we on this side of the House come into power&#x2014;when it will be possible. One must look forward to the possibility. Therefore, I am not objecting to the acquisition of habitable premises even, provided they are going to be reshaped. What I object to is the acquisition of property which is not to be altered in any sort of way by the acquiring authority. There is no purpose whatever in the acquiring authority being authorised to do that.<br/>
At an earlier stage this afternoon, on an Amendment which only partially raised this point, I referred to the question of what reason there could be for an acquiring authority being made the owner of this property. I still can see only two reasons. One is to make a profit out of it, and the other is to plant their friends there in the place of the people who are there already. In dealing with undeveloped land, one knows that in all litigation for the compulsory acquisition of land there are limits of deviation. One does not fix just exactly where the authority has got to stop; they are given a certain limit of deviation so that when their plans are worked out in more detail, they can go 50 yards to the right if necessary. So far as undeveloped land is concerned, an authority ought to have the same sort of tolerance there as an ordinary statutory undertaker would have. What I object to is the granting of power to acquire whole blocks of buildings which are not going to be altered or taken down, but which are to become the property of the new authority. This is not purely a theoretical question.<br/>
7.45 p.m.<br/>
I do not profess to know all the ins and outs of some of the controversies which are going on in England, but I gather there is a controversy just now in the South of England about the acquisition by an authority&#x2014;I do not know if it is a town council&#x2014;of perfectly habitable offices which it is not proposed to take down. Why should they be acquired by this authority? What is the reason, if it is not one of the two reasons to which I have referred already? It would not be


so bad if the acquiring authority bought it "on the nail," so to speak, on the day that it was designated. One would then avoid the fall in price which takes place owing to the shadow of designation, and one would also avoid the sterilisation which occurs in the interval between designation and acquisition. Therefore, it would not be so bad from the point of view of the owner; although it would be equally bad from the point of view of the occupier if this were done straight away. But the owner will suffer very much if there is a postponement, and the occupier will suffer very much when acquisition takes place.<br/>
I would like to hear an explanation of the inter-relationship between this Amendment and Section 29 of the 1945 Act as reprinted on the Order Paper. I do not wish to develop this point, because I shall have a good deal to say about that Section when we reach that point, and I do not want to anticipate my argument, but it does appear that there is no adequate security of tenure once this land is acquired. I think this provision would apply to a property of this kind. If that is so, the new occupier or the new developer&#x2014;not even a public authority; it may be a private person to whom the building is given over for some purpose&#x2014;has an absolute power to dispossess the former occupier, notwithstanding rent restrictions or anything else.<br/>
If it can be explained how these reprinted Sections do not apply to property acquired under this Clause, I shall be very interested. I have given some research to the matter and these points are so complicated that, without a great deal of labour, it is impossible to get to the bottom of them. I would be glad to have a clear statement about the position of the occupier of property which falls within the last four lines of this Subsection. I think I understand the position of the owner. On the ground of detriment both to the occupier and to the owner, I suggest, not that these four lines should be omitted, but that their meaning should be reversed so that it should be plain that there is not to be an acquisition of property which is not required for the purpose of redevelopment.</p>

<p>The right hon. and learned Member for Hillhead (Mr. J. S. C. Reid) seems rather alarmed at the situation. He seems to see something sinister in every Amendment that we put down. In fact, most of our Amendments have been put down in order to accommodate hon. Members opposite. The point here is simple, and I think the right hon. and learned Gentleman sees the point and accepts it, but his suspicious mind makes him think that something lies behind it. We are simply seeking to ensure that there is a certain measure of latitude. It is most important that there should be power to designate a whole area, even though certain parts of it may not necessarily be redeveloped. That is the whole trouble. One cannot guarantee at the outset that one is going to redevelop every square yard of a particular area. Details will be adjusted at a later date and there must be a certain degree of latitude. That is really all that this Amendment is designed to do. Therefore, if one altered it as suggested by the Amendment to the Amendment, it would tie the hands of local authorities in dealing satisfactorily with the redevelopment of areas of land, and it is highly undesirable that their hands should be so tied. The right hon. and learned Gentleman's assumption is that these planning authorities will act in an oppressive and wrong way. Hon. Gentlemen opposite are not entitled to assume that. I gladly assume that the local planning authorities will act properly as popular bodies. They require this latitude to carry out the job. For these reasons, we must resist the Amendment to the Amendment.</p>

<p>The right hon. and learned Gentleman said that my right hon. and learned Friend was taking it for granted that these great planning authorities would act in an oppressive or wrong way. If that were at the back of his mind, he might have some justification for it. The right hon. and learned Gentleman will no doubt remember what happened in Bristol and in Plymouth. In each case the local planning authority endeavoured to take over some property which they had no intention whatsoever of interfering with in any way so far as planning was concerned. One cannot imagine why they should have wanted to do that, unless they wanted to make some profit out of


it. It is to prevent that kind of thing that we desire that our Amendment to the Amendment should be accepted. I cannot see why not. Why on earth, if they do not want to touch the land, should they acquire it? The right hon. and learned Gentleman says there must be a certain amount of latitude; but, surely, when people make out these plans they know perfectly well whether it is necessary to obliterate an area or widen it.<br/>
I cannot see where the need for this latitude comes in. The planners will know perfectly well whether, in any particular place, they are going to leave a street exactly as it is, or whether they are going to leave property exactly as it is, and do nothing to it. Yet the right hon and learned Gentleman says the local planning authorities must have latitude in case they want to alter the property; but they should know first whether they want to alter it or not. I want to know whether the Government really intend to legalise the kind of things the local planning authorities wanted to do in Bristol and in Plymouth, because that would seem to be another reason why this Government Amendment ought to be resisted. I hope I have made myself clear; and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will deal with these two cases. There is evidence that, occasionally, for some reason or another, local planning authorities want to do things which are oppressive.</p>

<p>May I just say a word in reply to the hon. and gallant Gentleman the Member for Pollok (Commander Galbraith)? I candidly admit I am not fully seized of the Plymouth and Bristol cases. What I am clear about is the position we have taken. I wish to associate myself fully with what the Lord Advocate said&#x2014;that no local authority will act oppressively. The first thing a local planning authority has to do is to draw a line on the land they require, the property they require. They do not do that in a fully detailed fashion first. They draw a line that gives them all they think they need, and then, after they have done that, they acquire the land. It may well be that when they get down to closer grips with the subject, they find they have taken within that compass some property that they do not intend to develop. But if we took the point of the hon. and gallant Gentleman, it would mean that the local authority,

if they drew a line and narrowed themselves to everything that they thought was absolutely necessary, might well find, in the future development of their plans, that they were being circumscribed in their development, because they had felt that some land would not be required.</p>

<p>I cannot see the position here of the right hon. and learned Gentleman. All that we are asking is that these public authorities may draw a line, in a rough way, of what they desire. They draw a rough line and say, "That is the property we need in the development area." It may well be that, when they come to develop, they may find that they have taken certain property that they have no desire to take. They can dispose of it. As I said in dealing with the new Clause concerning the New Towns Act, we have nothing in our mind except to allow local planning authorities not to be narrowly circumscribed, but to have a fair field.</p>

<p>With permission, Mr. Deputy-Speaker, I would like to put this small question that I want to clear up. I apologise for not asking permission before I started. The hon. Gentleman says that within the area which a local authority wants to develop, there may be property which they find, later on, they do not want to develop.</p>

<p>It would be for them to decide in all the circumstances. My own view is that if the owners wanted it back, the local authority's duty would be to offer them the first opportunity of acquiring it.</p>

This Amendment is designed to make the position clear. It represents a concession in respect of taking over agricultural land.

Clause 5 (2) provides that where a local planning authority defaults in the preparation or amendment of the development plan, the Secretary of State may, instead of himself making or amending the plan, authorise the local planning authority for any other district to do so. That is in the case of default. This Amendment provides that the other planning authority must be the authority for a neighbouring district. In other words, instead of the Secretary of State exercising these default powers, which I am told have rarely been used, in the case of a local authority default the power is placed on another local authority. Obviously, if such a thing happened in


the South of Scotland we should not want an authority in the North of Scotland dealing with it. This is merely to make certain that it will be an authority in the close neighbourhood which will do the job.</p>

This Amendment is to meet the argument in Committee that there should be consultations with the agricultural executive committees when development plans are being prepared. It would not be feasible to single out the agricultural executive committees for consultation, as this would lead to representations being made from other bodies with just as much

right to be taken into consultation. This Amendment enables the Secretary of State, by regulation, to prescribe that local planning authorities shall consult with such bodies as may be specified. I give the assurance that I am quite prepared to specify in the regulations that agricultural executive committees in county areas shall be among the bodies that must be consulted.</p>

The right hon. Gentleman has said that the regulations will stipuate that the county agricultural executive committees shall be consulted. If that is the case, why will he not put it in the Bill? He said that he did not want to specify all the authorities who might be consulted, but, after all, agriculture is the most important of all bodies, and the land being taken over is agricultural land. Having undertaken to put this in the regulations, why cannot he put it in the Bill? No other parties can be half as interested as the agricultural people, and it seems only right that they should be consulted.</p>

<p>I beg to second the Amendment to the proposed Amendment.<br/>
I wish to support what has been said about the importance of the agricultural interests. Those who had occasion during the war to seek the advice of the agricultural executive committees in regard to camping and training sites will realise how important it is that one area should be chosen as against another. To the layman it often seems that two or three areas are of equal value. But when it comes to the detail of the matter only the agriculturist can tell why one area should be chosen and another left alone. That applies particularly in town and country planning. It is of the greatest importance that the local planning authority, in deciding where housing, industrial development, and new centres of population are to be, should act in the closest accord with those responsible for the maintenance and development of


agriculture. No one is better qualified to give advice on this matter, in the different localities, than the members of the agricultural executive committees. They are local men, and often they are farmers, who are representative of the agricultural interests. They know exactly the quality of the land, all about water supplies and access roads, and so on, which are so important. The right hon. Gentleman has said that he is prepared to put this into the regulations, but I join with my hon. and gallant Friend in urging him, even at this late hour, to put it into the Bill. Regulations have not quite the force of an Act of Parliament, and if the right hon. Gentleman is prepared to provide for consultation, which was what we pressed for in Committee, I hope he will now accept the point of view that there should be a specific requirement that planning authorities should consult agricultural committees.</p>

<p>Here, again, I have done my best to try to meet the points which were put by right hon. and hon. Members opposite in Committee. I cannot, however, accept this Amendment, because it is often the case in connection with legislation that if one thing is specified there may be exclusion of others. I have made it clear that in the regulations there will be consultation in the county areas. But not all planning authorities have agricultural executive committees. I imagine that Glasgow has not got one; I know that Kirkcaldy has not got one; I imagine that none of the other 19 large burghs have got one, and that the four cities have not got one. Agricultural executive committees operate in the county areas. I agree about the need for consultation, and I have tried to widen the Bill to this effect. Having given the pledge that through the regulations I will see that agricultural executive committees are consulted in the agricultural areas, I ask the House to reject the Amendment.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 8, line 10, at the end, to insert:
<q>(3) If as the result of any objections or representations considered, or of any local inquiry or other hearing held, in connection with a development plan or proposals for amendment of such a plan submitted to or prepared by the Secretary of State under this Part of this Act, the Secretary of State is of opinion that the local planning authority or any other authority or person ought to be consulted before he decides whether to approve or make the plan either with or without modifications, or to amend the plan, as the case may be, he shall consult that authority or person, but shall not be under any obligation to consult any other authority or person, or to afford any opportunity for further objections or representations or to cause any further local inquiry or other hearing to be held.</q>
This Amendment allows the Secretary of State after considering objections or representations or the holding of a local inquiry, to enter into further consultations with any person or body at his discretion. He is able to enter into these consultations without having further meetings with the people with whom he has been previously in consultation. The Amendment is designed to provide facilities in connection with the approval of development plans. It is important that after the Secretary of State has received the report of such an inquiry that he should be free to consider it in the light of further information and further consultation. To prevent him doing that would curtail his opportunities of producing a good scheme</p>

<p>I beg to move, as an Amendment to the proposed Amendment, in line 1, to leave out from "considered," to "in," in line 2.<br/>
If it would be in Order, I think that it might be convenient to consider together this and the following Amendment, in line 9, to leave out from "representations," to the end.<br/>
While the directions of the Secretary of State through the local planning authorities are a natural means of requesting information, the performance of the duties and functions by local planning authorities ought, we think, to be regulated only by statutory regulations under the Act&#x2014;regulations which are open to public scrutiny and to annulment by Parliament under the terms of Clause 104. Where such directions are of a general character and refer to all or a majority of the local planning authorities,


they ought to be in the form of directions. This point was raised in Committee in a rather different way. The Joint Under-Secretary, I think, gave an assurance then that the matter would be looked into, and if it was felt to be one of any substance an Amendment would be put down. We are sorry that an Amendment has not been put down, and that was the reason why we were prompted to put forward these two Amendments.</p>

<p>The Amendment, of the hon. Member for West Aberdeen (Mr. Thornton-Kemsley) is, as he has stated, really to point the opposition to the Amendment which we have proposed.

<p>I beg to move, in page 9, line 48, at the end, to insert:
<q>(5) Where under paragraph (<i>c</i>) of the proviso to Subsection (4) of Section three of this Act any land to which a development plan relates is designated as subject to compulsory acquisition in pursuance of an order to which the Statutory Orders (Special Procedure) Act. 1945, applies, then&#x2014;
<ol>
<li>(<i>a</i>) if the order is confirmed by Act of Parliament under Subsection (4) of Section two, as read with Section ten, of the Statutory Orders (Special Procedure) Act, 1945,

or under Section six of that Act, Subsections (2) and (3) of this Section shall not apply to the plan so far as it designates that land; and</li>
<li>(<i>b</i>) in any other case this Section shall have effect in relation to the plan so far as it so designates that land, as if in Subsection (2) for the reference to the date on which the notice required by Subsection (1) is first published there were substituted a reference to the date on which the order becomes operative under the Statutory Orders (Special Procedure) Act, 1945, and as if in Subsection (3) the words from 'and shall become operative' to the end of the Subsection were omitted."</li></ol></q>
The proviso to Clause 3 (3) provides that where a development plan has been submitted to the Secretary of State and designates as subject to compulsory acquisition land belonging to a local authority or statutory undertaker, or inalienable land belonging to the National Trust, if objection is taken to the proposed acquisition and is not withdrawn, the land must not be designated except by an order made by the Secretary of State, which is subject to special Parliamentary procedure. The effect of the Statutory Orders (Special Procedure) Act, 1945, is that if objections are made the order under the procedure of that Act applies to those objections, and if they are not withdrawn an inquiry must be held by the Commissioners under the Private Legislation Procedure Act. If the Secretary of State does not accept the findings of the Commissioners, he must present to Parliament a Bill for the confirming of the order. Under Section 6 of the Statutory Orders (Special Procedure) Act, an order must under certain circumstances be confirmed by Act of Parliament, and where that happens under the 1945 Act it is inappropriate that there should be the right to challenge the order in the courts. That really is the point of the Amendment. Accordingly, the present Amendment provides that Clause 8 (2, <i>b</i>) dealing with applications to the court shall not apply to such an order.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 10, line 8, to leave out "mining."<br/>
If I might, I will also take the Amendment in page 10, line 10, at the end, to insert:
<q>other than operations or the making use of land for the extraction of minerals.</q>


The purpose of these two Amendments can be stated quite simply. It is to exclude minerals from the operation of this Bill. There is no doubt that the value of minerals in the soil is very high indeed, This value is one upon which Death Duties have been assessed in the past and very large sums paid, and in certain cases it is a large element in valuation. If the House had not so much work before it tonight it would be possible to go in detail into the value of mineral deposits in Scotland. Various estimates have been given at different stages both of the English and the Scottish Bills to show that the value of mineral rights is somewhere between &#x00A3;50 million and &#x00A3;100 million. I am not prepared to say at this stage where the right figure should lie, but it is certainly above &#x00A3;50 million. If any right hon. Gentleman opposite challenges that statement I am prepared to produce figures here and now which will justify a value of &#x00A3;50 million at least on the basis of the values of 1938, which are very different from those obtaining today.<br/>
The value of iron, limestone, sand and gravel, which are very much in demand for building of every kind, of igneous rocks and shale, and of such things as fullers' earth can all be assessed fairly accurately. If it is true that all these minerals are worth not less than &#x00A3;50 million and not more than &#x00A3;100 million, it becomes clear that if the owners are to be properly and justly compensated for the withdrawal of mineral development rights they will take up a very large proportion of the &#x00A3;300 million which is the global sum set aside for the compensation of owners who lose development rights in Scotland on the one hand and England and Wales on the other. That reduces the &#x00A3;300 million by a very large amount. I am aware that it would not be appropriate on this occasion to go into details as to how that figure might have been arrived at, but I would remind the House of the assessment of value of development rights, excluding mineral rights and redevelopment rights in urban areas. The assessment of that value made by the Chief Valuer of the Inland Revenue Department in 1938 was &#x00A3;400 million as against the &#x00A3;300 million under the English Bill, and, as I say, that figure did not include redevelopment rights, in land or mineral development rights.<br/>
For these reasons we say, first, that if the &#x00A3;300 million is to be anything like adequate to compensate for loss of development rights, we must exclude the value of mineral rights. The second thing we say is that a Bill of this kind is not a proper medium for introducing nationalisation of mineral rights. That question is quite apart from town and country planning, and should properly be dealt with by a Measure of its own for the acquisition of those rights. We say that if it is the Government's policy to acquire development rights in minerals, the Government should have the courage of their convictions and come forward with a Bill specifically directed to that end. They should not try to introduce it as it were by a side wind, in a town and country planning Measure. We have much to do before we go home tonight, and in view of that fact, I think I need not labour the point any further. I am sure it is one of which we are all fully seized.</p>

<p>I beg to second the Amendment.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for West: Aberdeen (Mr. Thornton-Kemsley) has already put the case succinctly so that nothing more is needed from me. The Government have said that they are prepared to give fair compensation to mineral owners. We might differ as to the meaning of the word "fair." If the figure of &#x00A3;50 million to &#x00A3;100 million mentioned by my hon. Friend is correct, then it is clear that the proposed &#x00A3;300 million will not cover that fair compensation. I second the Amendment in the sincere hope that the Secretary of State will reconsider the matter, which at present is far from justly dealt with.</p>

<p>If the Amendment were accepted, it would take mining operations out of the definition of development. The effect would be to remove mining operation from planning control&#x2014;and this is a planning Bill. It would also exclude minerals from participation in the &#x00A3;300 million. I think that sums up the points which have been made and admitted by the sponsors of the Amendment The mover indicated that this matter was fairly fully debated in Committee. I should never say "fully" on a problem of this kind. An exactly similar Amendment was moved, and was negatived. The point made, quite correctly, in Committee was


that mining operations covered quarrying and the extraction of all minerals, including sand and gravel. It was urged that the necessity to obtain permission for the extraction of sand and gravel would delay house building. It was also stated that &#x00A3;300 million would not be adequate to compensate the local authorities. I mention these matters to prove that the matter was fully debated in Committee<br/>
Power to control mining operations was conferred by the 1932 Act, although the control has been modified by the Town and Country Planning (Interim Development) (Scotland) Order, 1946, made by the Secretary of State. It is essential to retain the right of control over mining. Otherwise, planning control by local authorities may be stultified by mining operations leading to subsidence and flooding. The Bill recognises that special arrangements may have to be made, as in the case of the present Interim Development Order, in relation to mineral workings, and Clause 76 provides that regulations may be made applying the provisions of the Bill to such workings, subject to such adaptations and modifications as may be prescribed. I trust that this Amendment will not be pressed to a Division. I cannot possibly accept it.</p>

<p>I am very sorry to hear the last words spoken by the Secretary of State, because I am afraid that we shall feel it our duty to press this Amendment to a Division. The White Paper, Command 6537, dealing with the control of land use, pointed out that special considerations must arise in the case of mineral workings. It also laid down that that type of development should not be included in the proposals made in regard to compensation and betterment. Here we have happening the very thing that the White Paper said should not happen. The compensation fund, which we already know is much too low to be fair all round, will be reduced by a very large proportion due to the fact that these minerals are being taken into account. We are firmly of the opinion that this is unjust and unfair, and that is not doing what the Government promised to do&#x2014;that is, to pay fair compensation. For those reasons, we must press the Amendment.</p>

<p>The outstanding reason why the word "mining" should

be left out of the Clause is that the Central Land Board is unlikely primarily to be capable of dealing with under-surface workings. That is not its job. It will add enormously to the complications of the work of the Board if this has to be undertaken. That is essentially a matter for the Ministry of Fuel and Power and it is wrong to overburden the Central Land Board with matters of this kind. Apart from that, as my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Pollok (Commander Galbraith) said, special considerations are involved. There is the very wide consideration of what is actually being taken out of the mines, which cannot be dealt with simply by the Board.<br/>
In Committee two separate aspects were referred to. There is the aspect of those concerns and enterprises which have already acquired their own mining rights. It is quite wrong that they should be deprived of the development rights they have already acquired and should then have to pay again. It is true that there will be a certain compensation or hardship allowance, but they will have to pay again in order to have the minerals they have themselves acquired. That is not paralleled in any other aspect of development, and it should be dealt with entirely separately. For those reasons, I feel strongly that the word "mining" should be left out of the Bill.</p>

<p>I speak for a number of business people who have been at some pains to approach me on the matter of mineral rights. What they allege is that if this provision remains in the Clause, as is proposed by the Government, it will hinder seriously the development of mineral rights in Scotland. Hon. Members will be aware that they have not been developed to anything like the extent they have been in other parts of the country, and this Clause will hinder rather than encourage their future exploitation. Some surveys made by the Scottish Council of Industry have discovered during the war a number of valuable minerals which have not been exploited commercially in Scotland. I have a list here. They include silica, fluorspar, china clay, gypsum, sandstone, slate and a number of others. The development of these substances is at best a speculative enterprise, and the addition of the development charge to their already somewhat speculative character


will be, in the opinion of my correspondents, inimical to the interests of Scotland.<br/>
If the Minister can assure me that these views are ill-founded and that, on the contrary, the retention of these words will make for the more effective exploitation of this mineral wealth of Scotland in the future than has been the case in the past, I should be inclined to value his views against those put before me. However, he must be aware that these minerals are in a very undeveloped condition. I am not blaming anyone for their lack of development&#x2014;that feature is a feature of the past and we are looking encouragingly into the future&#x2014;but these substances, of a varied and unusual character, are waiting for exploitation, and that, it is alleged, will be hindered.<br/>
There is another substance which is important, and here I agree with my hon.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1947-07-07a.1906.0" colnum="1906" time="">
<p>Friend the Member for Dumfries (Mr. N. Macpherson) that it is a matter for the Minister of Fuel and Power. The Minister of Fuel and Power has the mining development of Scotland in hand under his special jurisdiction, but there is an important and valuable fuel in Scotland in the form of many thousands of acres of peat. Peat will be included under this development charge and it would seem to be unfortunate, when the Minister of Fuel and Power is engaged just now in an investigation of the character of peat for its calorific qualities, if it were so included. I hope the Minister will be able to satisfy the public, if not myself, that this Clause will make for a development of Scotland and not a retardation.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 10, line 20, at the end, to insert:
<q>(c) the carrying out by any local authority or statutory undertakers of any works for the purpose of inspecting, repairing or renewing any sewers, mains, pipes cables or other apparatus, including the breaking open of any street or other land for that purpose.</q>
The Amendment provides that operations by a local authority or a statutory undertaking necessary for maintaining, for example, sewers, gas and electricity


mains, are not development for the purposes of Clause 9, and that they will, therefore, be outside planning control, and will not be liable to any development charge. There is no need to keep these operations within the scope of the Bill because no development charge will be payable in any case. The Amendment has been limited to the maintenance of authorised apparatus, but the whole question of the breaking open of streets is under consideration by the Minister of Transport, and special legislation will be required for that. Until that is done, a measure of control should be maintained over new apparatus, at least until new legislation comes into force.</p>

<p>I am sure that this is a good Amendment, though I wonder whether it goes far enough. So far as I can see, it applies only if existing cables, pipes, or the like are replaced. In a developing district it is obvious that an extra cable or pipe may be required, and in that case an extra piece of apparatus is laid in the same street. It would be a great pity if the authority were limited to the exact number of pieces of apparatus which it had in the past, and had to pay if it put in an extra one, though there was no real development at all. I wonder whether the Amendment is wide enough or whether it should be extended to cover reasonable amplification of existing resources.</p>

<p>I think that nearly all those are laid by a statutory undertaker or a local authority. I confess that the hon. and gallant Gentleman may have a case in regard to the large hotels in the Highlands.

This Amendment should be read together with the two following Amendments in page 12, lines 15 and 24. Subsection (4) of Clause 10 enables the Secretary of State, by a development Order, to suspend any enactment in the interests of proper planning. The Subsection might, however, be construed as confining the power of suspension to acts passed and regulations made before the passing of the Bill. The present Amendment would enable the Secretary of State to-suspend regulations, orders or bylaws made after the passing of the Bill under Acts passed before that date. The Amendment also provides for the power to direct that all enactments shall not apply or shall only apply subject to-modification. This power to modify is a new provision which we think will be useful in the future.</p>

<p>This is a very great extension of what I think we must always watch very carefully&#x2014;delegation of power to a Minister to make alterations to Acts of Parliament and other enactments, without even publishing or submitting to this House the alterations he makes. We did not take strong exception to the original Subsection, because that merely enabled enactments to be suspended. That would probably not be done without good cause, and does not introduce much complication. But here we have a power, not only to suspend, but to modify to an indefinite extent. If we are to have an Act of Parliament modified in one direction here and another there, all certainty is gone. We do not know whether these modifications are going to be published. If someone sees something taking place on somebody else's property, how is he to know whether what the other person is doing is legal or illegal? It may be that the other person may have up his sleeve some modification under an order which may not be a general order; it may be a special


order for a particular subject. To allow a Government Department to make one law for one place and another for another, and not even to publish or submit it to this House, is really going a very long way indeed.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman did not explain what was the necessity for this. He merely said it would be useful. Of course, in one sense, it will be useful, because he can give away what he likes in any direction. But, in another sense, it will be very much the reverse, because if we are going to have a variety of practice according to the person who gives the permission, or according to the district in which it is given, we shall get into confusion. I had hoped that the hon. Gentleman would be able to tell us the real need for this. I am afraid it is the old story that if one gives them an inch, they take an ell. Every time Government Departments are given some small chance of going their own way and altering what has been done by this House, then the next time they ask for more. There is no stopping them. This sort of thing has got to come to an end sometime.<br/>
We are getting a little tired of the way in which this power is being extended to Government Departments to play fast and loose with what this House does, and with no control by this House over the action of the Departments. These Orders cannot be prayed against. I do not know whether they can be discovered by the ordinary person, or whether they are even to be published. I hope the hon. Gentleman will answer that point. I do not think that they come under Statutory Rules and Orders. If I want to find out the extent to which the provision under an Act of Parliament has been modified in other cases, so that I can ask for a similar modification in my own case, where do I find what the Department has done in the past? If the hon. Gentleman could tell us that, it would go some way to meeting our troubles, because it would then be possible to see what the policy of the Department is. Unless these Orders are easily discoverable, I think tins is indeed going too far.</p>

<p>After all, there is no substance in saying, "You shall do this for one side, but you shall not do it for another." The real point that the right hon. and learned Gentleman is raising is

that these things should not be done without the House of Commons being made aware of them. That is legitimate criticism. My answer is that in each case, unless an Order is covered by the Second Schedule, which is limited in extent, the Order must not only be published, but must be the subject of an affirmative Resolution. On page 12, line 23, hon. Members will see these words:
<q>provided that, without prejudice to the foregoing provision, where any such order makes provision for suspending any enactment contained in a public general Act (other than any of the excepted enactments specified in the Second Schedule to this Act)"&#x2014;</q>
That applies to this case&#x2014;
<q>the order shall be of no effect until that provision is approved.</q>
It does not only involve placing the Order on the Table, but this House must approve it. Therefore, it is a very salutary power.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 17, line 7, to leave out "purposes," and to insert "class or classes of purpose."<br/>
This was a matter which was raised in Committee, and it was thought, I think in all quarters of the Committee, that the definition required some reconsideration, because, without that, there was great doubt as to what were the purposes, and how narrowly the particular purposes might be defined. We thought it was better to put in "class or classes of purpose" to make sure that the definition would be pretty wide. The point is, as the House is, no doubt, aware, that when planning permission is granted for the erection of a building, the permission may specify the purpose for which the building is to be used; and our object is to make certain that that will be done in a very broad way, so that it will say whether it is for shop or business purposes, or for residence, or for some broad purpose of that sort. The application would be for a commercial office or for a draper's shop, or something of that sort, and would make it clear that the permission would be for the shop, or offices, as the case might be. The person who applies for the permission necessarily says what he wants to use it for. If he is a draper, he obviously says he wants to use the thing as a draper's shop. But unless the permission is made a good deal wider than that, when the time comes when he wishes to move to larger premises, and Wants to realise on his present premises


&#x2014;or his executors want to realise on those premises&#x2014;and if the new person to use the premises is not a draper at all. but an ironmonger, or something else altogether, it will be necessary to go back to get a planning permission, and pay another sum.

<p>I must have been giving too much credit to the hon. Gentleman, but I certainly thought that his view was&#x2014;and I submit now to the House that the view of the House ought to be&#x2014;that if a man had paid his charge and got his permission for a shop, then, provided he did not want to increase the size of the shop or alter its design, he ought to be allowed in future to use those premises for any kind of shop&#x2014;except a kind of shop which he is not allowed to put in under public health regulations and the like. There are certain places where one is not allowed to have a butcher's shop or a fishmonger's; and that will persist whatever we do in this Bill. But there is no reason why one should not change from being a draper to being an ironmonger without paying another development charge, surely? Surely the development charge is not going to be so narrowly calculated as to be one figure for a draper and another for an ironmonger, so that if a man changes from being the one to being the other, he has to pay the balance between the two charges? It may be that the hon. Gentleman has a case for saying&#x2014;though I do not think so&#x2014;that we ought to have some control over the number of shops&#x2014;&#382;</p>

<p>&#x2014;or over the particular kind of shops in a particular street. But if that is not his view&#x2014;and he says it is not&#x2014;then, honestly, I do not see why he should object to this Amendment. Is the Government's purpose to make money for the Government out of the change? Is it to control the number of drapers' shops in the district? If it is not one or the other of these hampering controls at all, I do submit that this and the following Amendment&#x2014;which is precisely the same Amendment, proposed to be made in line 8 as well as in line 7&#x2014;ought to be accepted, unless the hon.

<p>I wonder if the right hon. and learned Gentleman would excuse me making this personal reference to him? The more I sit here the more I remember my callow days spent in the Glasgow High Courts with the right hon. and learned Gentleman as the procurator, and myself as the criminal in the dock. Because with everything I do the question arises: "What are you going to get in the way of money." Let me assure him that that is not what is in my mind. I am sorry the hon. Member for Cathcart (Mr. John Henderson) is not present, because what I had in mind is what happens in the city, part of the representation of which he and I share, he in the West and myself in another part. We must give local people some power in these matters without their being cribbed, cabined and confined. The right hon. and learned Gentleman says: "Here is a butcher's shop I want it to be changed into an ironmonger's shop." In my own place, what happened was that overnight a butcher's shop was turned into a cobbler's shop, much to the annoyance of everybody near at hand, as well as spoiling one of the finest streets in the country. Huge machines were installed, without anything being added to the shop. Overnight into this first-class residential quarter they moved powerful machines, with a shocking effect on the street, as anybody who knows that area will appreciate. The hon. and gallant Member for Pollok (Commander Galbraith) knows it, because it is in his Division, namely, the Victoria Road district of the City of Glasgow.<br/>
I will not stand that, and I trust that other hon. Members will not stand it. That is what we want to avoid in this respect, apart from the Public Health Acts. There have been baker's shops, conducted on very limited lines, and the whole atmosphere has been changed suddenly, while still nominally retaining the baker's shop, with a consequent shock to the residents in tenement localities. They are the people of whom I am thinking in this regard&#x2014;the people in the tenement localities. The one safeguard in this connection is not the Government at all, but the authorities who are administering these provisions. In my view, they will continue to administer them as they have done constantly in the past, with a fair measure of justice and equality.</p>

<p>That is new. That is not what the hon. Gentleman said before. His case was that a butcher's shop was turned into an industrial factory. That is exactly what we want to do. We are quite agreeable to giving local authorities power to say it should be a shop or a factory; or that it shall be some kind of commercial shop. These are two distinct classes, for which we are asking in the Amendment; that is precisely what we do want. I do not think the hon. Member would want to give a local authority power to say: "You must not have a baker's shop. You must have an ironmonger's shop," or something of that description. Surely, that is asking too much? If the hon. Gentleman asks merely for a general classification of shops, then I really do not know why he does not accept the Amendment, because that is all we are asking. Would not he look at it again? I think that in essence we are agreed upon this. I do not think the words at present in the Bill, if Interpreted by anyone else, would bear the same meaning as the hon. Gentleman has put upon them. I accept what he says; I accept that that is his intention. That is what the words mean. I submit that the words we propose more accurately translate his meaning.</p>

<p>I should have thought that it was quite simple. It is the difference which was shown by the Joint Under-Secretary. The industrial concern is one class; another class of purposes is the baker's shop, the butcher's

shop, or some other kind of shop. It is wrong to give a local authority power to say that there can be a grocer's shop but not a baker's shop.</p>

<p>It is very interesting to hear the Joint Under-Secretary defending the amenities of the better districts. I think we are all trying to achieve the same purpose. What we all wish to ensure is that an area shall be for shopping purposes rather than for manufacturing purposes. It seems to be largely a question of words. Both sides of the House seem to wish to achieve the same purpose. In the circumstances, it might be a good thing to see whether words cannot be found to cover the meaning we want. None of us wish to see the kind of thing the Joint Under-Secretary mentioned happening in the future. On the other hand, we do not wish to have the use of an individual building restricted too narrowly. Is it not possible to get a form of words to meet the purposes both sides of the House have in mind?</p>

<p>I think the Joint Under-Secretary, from his experiences, can now see more reasons for this Amendment than he did when he first saw it on the Order Paper. I suggest that he has seen the development of many suburbs in the great city to which he belongs. The first development is not the final development. When the new suburb comes into being, the kind of shop opened in the first instance is probably an "a things," but, as the population fills up, the original "a' things" or haberdashery shop becomes a shop of a more exact character, and other shops are built up around it, until there are adequate shops to meet the demand. If this is followed, the original purpose is apparently the final purpose for a very long period of time.<br/>
I have in mind the little shop failing to get adequate custom to support it, which is bound to fall into some manufacturing process, such as a cobbler's shop, to the detriment of the area. I have seen that happen more than once. In Edinburgh, we have seen corporation shops taken over, not for shopping purposes, but for residential purposes, with the result that the original intentions of the local authority have been defeated. I suggest that if they were guided by such words as "purposes or class of purposes," they would have greater latitude. In Scotland, there are scores of buildings designated as


masonic halls which were erected some 40 or 50 years ago. These were places for public meetings, but they have long since departed from their original and narrow association, now being public halls in the fullest sense of the term. They are used for dances, cinemas, public entertainments, even political meetings. It seems to me that if such a hall was being built by a body specifically designated for that purpose, this Subsection would limit it to that narrow use. If the Government accepted the Amendment it would not be so limited. The local authority, if they had the power, would be able to widen the designation, and would be given the measure of freedom which the expanding or contracting character of the community demanded.<br/>
May I refer to a further instance, which is well known to me from my experience as a Scottish shopkeeper? The Scottish co-operative societies are alive and expanding. They feel their way. They do not open large and extensive premises in new areas. Throughout Scotland, because of the limitation in housing, there are wooden buildings in many of the new developing suburbs which belong to the co-operative societies, and from which vans distribute goods. These would be designated under the Bill for a specific purpose, and the societies would seem to be hindered in developing. Their interests would be restricted, if not actually extinguished. In a Scotland which is developing, there should be the maximum freedom, through this Measure, to local authorities to control essential planning.</p>

<p>I am in difficulty about the words of the Amendment, because they do not appear to do what the Opposition suppose they will do. They propose to leave out, "purposes," and to insert, "class or classes of purpose." "Purpose" is a general term, but it seems to me that the words, "class of purpose," introduce a limitation. The Clause says:
<q>Where planning permission is granted for the erection of a building the grant of permission may specify the purposes for which the building may be used.&#x2026;</q>
What would any lawyer read into the word "purposes"? I, as a lawyer, do not take it to relate to the provision of drapery shops, but to a shopkeeper. If I were to put in an application I would say that my building was for the purpose of providing shops, and stores in connec-

tion with that shop. It would not be a question of whether a draper was going to give place to a bookshop or a candlestick maker. I take it that the authority would require to specify what kind of shop was meant by the word "purposes." That power under "purposes" might be too wide, but any changes in the form should not be allowed. It is worth while for the Government to consider whether there should not be some alteration of the words.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Camlachie (Mr. Stephen) has said that the word "purposes" is wider than the words proposed in the Amendment. It is because there can be introduced under that word anything, and it would allow for specifying that there must be a baker's shop or a grocer's shop that we put in "class of purposes." We want to see the Clause worded so that there shall be permission for shops or for factories. I thought, when we had a previous discussion on this matter, that I was in full agreement with the Joint Under-Secretary. I agree with him that on no account should a shop be turned into industrial premises, and that is what has been happening, to the intense annoyance of those who live round it. The hon. Gentleman said that we ought to treat the local authorities as reasonable persons. They are to a large extent reasonable persons, but there are times when they do things which cause the greatest annoyance in certain localities. It is the people living in the localities who really know what is best for themselves, and if a shop is put in a locality where it is not necessary, that shop is quickly removed because it goes bankrupt. I suggest that there are many instances in which the local authorities are not the best judges of what is required in their particular localities. We have known of instances where a local authority has had a grievance against some locality&#x2014;perhaps because of the person who represents it&#x2014;and it vents its displeasure by restricting facilities to that locality. I have known cases of that kind to happen, and here the power is being put directly into the hands of a local authority, and it is a very great power. I am fully with the hon. Gentleman in what he wants to stop, but, at the same time, I think the local authorities should not have this complete power


of designating exactly the type of shop that should be put in a particular place. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept the wording of the Amendment.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Camlachie (Mr. Stephen), says that the Clause may be too wide as it stands; therefore, make it more strict. My answer is that the local authorities on the whole will be the best judges as to strictness and fairness. It may be that the words are rather wide, but I believe in trusting the local authorities. I think I know the object of the Amendment which has been put down, but I think that the words would allow the abuse to go on. I am advised, and I know from my own practical knowledge, that it would not be advisable to accept the words put down by the Opposition. I do not wish to do hon. Members opposite any injustice in the matter. They think that a local authority may use these powers in a harsh way and prevent a private trader from getting a shop as against a co-operative society. That, I feel, is at the back of their minds.</p>

<p>Let us see what happens. When I look at the immense powers which local authorities, have I am surprised at what the Opposition say. They have got increasing powers throughout Scotland. They own all the new shops in the housing estates and they can allocate them to whom they like, while at the end of 12 months they can turn them out if they so desire. I think of these which are in my native city and owned by the local authority&#x2014;now run by school friend? of mine&#x2014;and they are not allocated in a prejudicial fashion. Every person gets a fair share. They have more power than is given under this Bill. I defy anyone to say that the local authorities who own shops do not let them equitably and reasonably. My plea is for the Opposition to make up their mind. A minute ago they were criticising me because I was forcing things on them, and here I am asking them to give the local authorities a greater measure of control</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 53, line 25, after "section", to insert:
<q>or the interest to be acquired is the interest of an Owner-occupier of a building within the meaning of this section.</q>
I think it would save the time of the House if at the same time I referred to the further Amendment in page 54, line 45. Clause 47, makes temporary provision for eliminating the enhanced value of land between now and the notional date of 1st January, 1954, owing to the value of vacant possesion at the present time and in the ascertainable future. What is provided is that if land is being compulsorily acquired during that period, the enhanced value attributable to vacant possession, and the enhanced value of buildings, because of vacant possession at the present time, should not have to be paid by the acquiring authority. Provision has already been made for the exclusion of agricultural land and buildings from that provision.<br/>
My right hon. Friends and I want to go further and to exclude land or buildings belonging to an owner-occupier, and we define what we mean by an owner-occupier in the further Amendment in page 54, line 45. The position I think will be quite clear to the House. If a local authority is acquiring land which, by definition, includes buildings, it is to give an owner-occupier from whom it acquires, market value for its present use. The Government say, under this Clause, "Well, that was right, but at the present time we would have to give a very much enhanced value where we are getting vacant possession because everything is up in price." That is quite true, but they say that in the limited period between now and a date when notice to treat is served up to 1st January, 1954, they will give instead a restricted value determined in accordance with the provisions of this Clause under which the notional lease idea is introduced.<br/>
That is all right from the point of view of the Government, but what about the point of view of the individual whose property is acquired? Take a man who owns a house which he has had taken from him compulsorily and who is given less than the fair market value. He has to go out into the cold hard world and re-house himself with the money he has received, and when all the prices are raised against him. The Government recognise that prices have gone up, so they say, "We will give you less than the enhanced value." Yet this man has to go into the market and find another house. There should be some provision in this matter. The Government have made provision for the owner-occupier of agricultural land. Why cannot they make provision for the owner-occupier of a house? That is stating it as briefly as I can.</p>

I am quite certain that the right hon. Gentleman will be in sympathy with this Amendment. It is simply facing the practical difficulty which exists for these people who are dispossessed. They have to find other accommodation, and they cannot find it unless they are compensated at the existing value of their house. There is no answer to it. You simply cannot get accommodation today unless you get from your existing property the present-day value for it. I hope the right hon. Gentleman will see his way to accept this Amendment.</p>

<p>The same sort of situation arises under the 1945 Act. There one was driven to make concessions to other persons. Once one begins to make concessions to other persons, one begins to get into difficulties. What about the owner of war-damaged property who is anxious to re-occupy it as soon as he can rebuild, and various other types of that kind? Once one begins to get into


classes of that sort, one has to consider the intention of the person in relation to the house he is occupying. The real trouble in the owner-occupier case is not so much the monetary problem as the difficulty of getting alternative accommodation. That is the real practical problem. I would remind the House that the new basis of compensation is really much more favourable than the basis originally put forward. We have gone a considerable distance to meet the owner-occupier in this way. I am afraid the difficulties of going further are too great.</p>

<p>If the right hon. and learned Gentleman is going to treat us to a completely illogical argument of this character, and to admit that he is refusing to do justice for one class of case because that would require something else to be done in another and smaller class of case, we cannot on this side of the House accept that kind of thing. I will resume the matter in a few sentences. The right hon. and learned Gentleman has made no attempt to show that injustice is not being done in a large number of cases where owner-occupiers of non-agricultural houses are concerned. Therefore, I take it as common ground in the House that the Bill as it stands is going to do injustice in that type of case. If any hon.

<p>I saw the hon. Gentleman half rise and I invited him, as I thought perhaps he had a point to make. There is no doubt that if the Bill is allowed to stand as it is, the owner-occupiers are not going to get the present market value of their houses, even though it is obvious from their circumstances that they must get another house to replace the one taken

away from them, and therefore, these owner-occupiers&#x2014;and they are the great majority&#x2014;who have to find another house for their families are being given much less money than will be required to buy that other house. If that is not injustice, I would like to know what is. That being admitted, the Government are deliberately imposing injustice on this section of the community. What is the argument? The only argument is that if we do justice to these people, there are a few others left in the cold, and we will have to think of something for them. They are only a few. The only class mentioned by the right hon. and learned Gentleman were people suffering from war damage, who are very infrequent in Scotland, and very easily dealt with. It is inconceivable that it should be said in this House that justice should be refused to 95 per cent. because it is difficult to give it to the other 5 per cent. of borderline cases. If that is the argument of the Socialist Government, we mean to go into the Lobby against them.</p>

I ask him to say now that if this Amendment were accepted, it would have, by its acceptance, repercussions of a most serious nature, and that, while in itself it may be simple and reasonable, these repercussions would be serious. If that is the case and he is prepared to say so, it would certainly help me in whatever decision I make.</p>

<p>I would like to know what are the implications of the "repercussions" of which the Lord Advocate has given a hint, a hint which, as I interpret it, meant that the repercussions would be minor compared with the fairness that would be the immediate effect of our Amendment. I am not a Member of long experience, but I never heard a more lame excuse given for the attitude taken by a Government than that given by the Lord Advocate in this case. He was clearly uneasy and unhappy, and I sympathise with him because I under-


stand his discomfort. He said that it was very difficult to make provision&#x2014;thereby implicitly agreeing that provision should be made&#x2014;because of the difficulties that would arise, and that the Government would find themselves pressed in other directions. In other words, the Government would, in fact, be in a difficulty; but this Government ought by now to be used to being in difficulties. They are pressed by them on all sides, but they fob off a small matter of this kind by saying, "We, the great Socialist Government, cannot get ourselves out of the difficulty while we have inflicted on the country thousands of greater difficulties." That is an argument which I, for one, absolutely fail to understand, and cannot accept.<br/>
11.0 p.m.<br/>
This is a temporary need, but let us admit that it may recur. However, it is not a situation which is going to continue in perpetuity, and, therefore, it is a temporary business for a small section of the community. Yet, with their eyes open, the Government recognise that they are inflicting a hardship and, with their eyes open, they propose to continue to inflict that hardship, because they have created difficulties which they have failed to solve. The Lord Advocate also said that this was not a monetary problem, because even ii more money were given he indicated, by implication, that the dispossessed owner of a house would fail to find an alternative place. We cannot accept that explanation either. The Government are going to dispossess an owner-occupier and say to him, "It does not matter how we do it, you are not going to find another house." That was, in effect, the right hon. and learned Gentleman's argument.</p>

<p>I must confess that in the last two years I have heard some very lame speeches from the Treasury Bench, but I do not think I have ever heard in this Parliament a poorer case than that put up by the right hon. and learned Gentleman. In effect, he said absolutely nothing. It was with great difficulty that I followed his subdued tone. I can quite understand that, because he was very bashful in presenting a very bad case. I listened with great interest to the speech of the hon. Member for Tradeston (Mr. Rankin). I was buoyed up into hoping,

as I listened to the beginning of his speech, that we were going to see on this occasion from the placid third Bench&#x2014;always noted for the docility with which it follows the Government&#x2014;a free and independent point of view. I thought we were going to see an independent point of view which would even compel the hon. Gentleman&#x2014;</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1947-07-07a.1948.1" speakerid="unknown" speakername="Mr. McKie" colnum="1948" time="">
<p>With all respect, that is what I am dealing with, in my own way. I was saying that I was buoyed up by listening to the speech of the hon. Gentleman the Member for Tradeston, and I thought that he would go into the Lobby with us in default of a reasonable explanation by the Lord Advocate of his reasons for resisting this Amendment, because the hon. Gentleman asked the Lord Advocate to give his reasons. It is true, however, that in the concluding sentences of his speech, the hon. Gentleman associated himself more or less <i>in toto</i> with what the Lord Advocate had said. In hushed voice he told us that, inevitably, there would be serious repercussions. I ask him what repercussions there would be in granting this very modest request, namely, that the people who are being expropriated, the owner-occupiers, shall not be mulcted, because that is what it will amount to, as the owner-occupiers will not be receiving any enhanced value. They will be doubly mulcted. The hon. Gentleman the Member for Tradeston cannot run away from it, because there is no doubt that he will have several cases in his own constituency. These people will come under the operation of this Bill without an enhanced value being given to them. Then where will they be? They will be left to drift into the world without being able to obtain new houses&#x2014;houses are difficult to obtain anywhere&#x2014;having been denied them by the Government which especially claims to be speaking for the working classes. Owner-occupiers are small people of the working class. No one can say where the working class begins or ends, and these are of the working class.<br/>
The hon. and learned member for North Hammersmith (Mr. Pritt) seems to think this is a matter for hilarity. I


would have thought he would have associated himself with the words I was saying, because many people in Hammersmith will be in the same category as the people of whom I am speaking. I ask the right hon. and learned Gentleman seriously to reflect again, and to realise that it would be much the wiser course to associate himself with us in the view we have expressed, rather than to espouse the course he has. I hope the Joint Under-Secretary will perhaps make another reply. I think it is due to us on this side. These are people who will be deprived of their homes; certain numbers will be deprived of their homes without being given an enhanced value.</p>

<p>May I say a word or two about the allegedly inadequate statement made by the right hon. and learned Gentleman the Lord Advocate. The hon. Member for Galloway (Mr. McKie) has made similar claims about every speech we make, so it does not very much matter. The point here is this: The owner-occupier gets full market value. Let us get that clear. What we do not pay is market value plus the right of immediate entry. The house which can be sold with immediate entry has an additional, inflated value: that is different from the house that is sold without immediate entry.</p>

<p>I was going to deal with that point. We pay full market value. What we do not make any attempt to do&#x2014;I say this frankly&#x2014;is to assess payment with immediate entry attached to it. I say that frankly because hon. Members are talking about the matter. I say that we wish we could have got our people

in the past as reasonable terms as the owner-occupier is offered today.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman has made that point with some heat, as he has made points once or twice before. He says that the Government pay full market value. Under Clause 47 they do nothing of the sort. Unless he is familiar with that Clause, he ought not to put forward that claim. Clause 47 introduces a notional lease, the lease expiring on 1st January, 1954.</p>

<p>We are saying that we are paying full market value. We say to the owner-occupier that he should be provided with suitable alternative accommodation. That is a tremendous step forward. I wish I had seen the ordinary shopkeeper, for whom on both sides of the House there is human sympathy, getting this guarantee that he would have an alternative place to which to go. We are giving full market value plus an alternative place to go, and in this way we are giving a liberal treatment.</p>

<p>The Joint Under-Secretary has said several times that the Government are paying full market value under Clause 47. May I remind the House of what, in fact, they are doing? They are saying that where a local authority acquires land compulsorily, under terms of notice to treat served before 1st January, 1954, they will not pay the full market value of a house with vacant possession; they will instead invent the fiction of a notional lease with a tenant who has to go out on or after 1st January, 1954. They are, therefore, eliminating the enhanced value which attaches to land at present owing to its scarcity value. They are therefore, in my submission, not paying the market value, or anything like the market value.<br/>
Our submission in Committee was to make a special concession in the case of an owner-occupier of agricultural land. We are asking the Government now to make that concession in respect of the owner-occupier of a house. They say they cannot do so. They recognise, I suppose, the justice of our claim, but they say&#x2014;in some of the lamest speeches I have ever heard&#x2014;that it would cause repercussions, and injustice here, there, or somewhere else. We say that a Government of planners ought to be able to plan to eliminate these injustices. It is monstrously wrong for an owner-occupier to have his property taken from him by the action of the State and not to be given sufficient compensation to enable him to go out into the cold world, where all the prices are raised against him&#x2014;as admitted by the Government&#x2014;and rehouse himself in a property comparable to the one he occupied before. That is the basis of our contention. There is no point in labouring the case. We can only show our great indignation in the Division Lobby.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 54, line 17, to leave out from the first "gardens," to "and," in line 19.<br/>
In the Committee, an Amendment was put down to leave out the words
<q>a person of the labouring classes.</q>
That would have meant a definition of agricultural land, including allotments or allotment gardens, and gardens exceeding one-quarter of an acre attached to a house. The reason gardens exceeding one-quarter of an acre, and so on, were included under the Bill originally was because they were regarded as being of the same character as allotments or allotment gardens. I sympathise with the criticism of the words
<q>a person of the labouring classes.</q>
which was taken from an earlier statute as a convenient way of describing this type of garden. But it seems best to strike out this type of garden, as it is comparatively unlikely that there will be many gardens of that type.</p>

<p>This is a mean little Amendment. What the Government are doing here is depriving members of the labouring classes who happen to have a quarter of an acre of garden of their right to market value compensation. We had the argument out before over comparatively well-to-do people, and I suppose the Government now think that, because they are going to deprive other owner-occupiers of justice, they had better give the labouring classes a little of the same medicine. I trust the Government are getting near the end of this idea that they can do injustice when they feel inclined. The right hon. and learned Gentleman says there are not many cases, and the simplest plan is just to let them stew.</p>

<p>I would like to congratulate the Government on what I think is really rather an honest performance. For a very long while they have attached the name "Labour" to themselves; but they do not look much like it. They never have; and I congratulate them on dropping for once this name "Labour," which really does not apply to any Socialist Member of Parliament. The use

of that name goes back to the days when there were Labour members. I congratulate the Government most sincerely as far as this Amendment is concerned, and I hope it is an omen for the future.</p>

<p>May I, with permission, say this: it is a desirable thing to earn the reputation of being quite a cool, calculating Member. If the right hon. and learned Member for Hillhead (Mr. J. S. C. Reid) feels that we are going too far, I would like to say that we do not want to deprive what one might call the ordinary working man of his bit of ground. The right hon. and learned Gentleman talks of our being mean. I am prepared to discuss the matter with him between now and the time when this Bill reaches another place to see if we can find some other phrase. I have thought of "working class," but that is not the best term either. I do not want to include large houses with gardens. If there is an alternative phrase that can be found, I guarantee that I will look at it with the right hon. and learned Gentleman with as much sympathy as anyone else. Perhaps the best possible man to deal with this is the Secretary of State himself. I have no love of the phrase "labouring classes." That is why we dropped it. On the other hand, I do not want to be driven too far in the other direction. If there is a compromise which we can arrive at between now and the time when the Bill goes to another place, I will look at it.</p>

<p>I am glad that the hon. Gentleman has realised at last that there is a limit to the injustices that this House will tolerate. I will, of course, cooperate with him in removing as much injustice as we can. I am glad that there is one Member on the Government Bench who will co-operate to remove as much injustice as possible.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 54, line 37, to leave out "unencum bered."<br/>
This Amendment goes with the next Amendment in line 38. This is one of the alternatives described in Clause 47 rela-


tive to the calculation of rent under a notional lease. These two Amendments make it clear that the capital value of premises will be assessed with due regard to any servitudes or other restrictions affecting the land on the date of the notice to quit.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 17, line 40, to leave out from

"state" to the end of line 43, and to insert "and."<br/>
This Amendment does three things. First, it omits from Clause 16 (1, <i>a</i>) the words
<q>whether by reason of deterioration or obsolescence of buildings or the occurrence of war damage or otherwise.</q>
The reference to deterioration, obsolescence or war damage was inserted for


the purposes of illustration; and the words "or otherwise" were intended to extend the Clause to land incapable of reasonably beneficial use for any other reasons. The inclusion of the words "or otherwise" might, however, limit the Clause to cases similar to cases of deterioration, obsolescence or war damage. The intention of the Clause is better fulfilled by leaving the words "incapable of reasonably beneficial use" completely unqualified.<br/>
Secondly, the Amendment omits the words "of development" in line 40. This is to make it clear that the Clause extends to agricultural land and is not confined to land already built on. This was always the intention of the Clause but it is desirable to make this intention plain. Thirdly, the Amendment makes it clear that the condition specified in paragraph (<i>a</i>) must be satisfied in all cases, that is, the land must be incapable of reasonably beneficial use as it stands; and in addition it must be shown that the land cannot be made reasonably beneficial by redeveloping it in accordance with any permission which has been granted, that is, under paragraph (<i>b</i>) or paragraph (<i>c</i>)</p>

Subsection (2, <i>c</i>) says that where the Secretary of State thinks it is expedient that another local authority should acquire for the purpose of any of their functions land in respect of which a purchase notice has been served, he may modify the purchase notice by substituting the other authority for the local planning authority. There may be cases where the other authority requires only part of the land in question, and this Amendment enables the Secretary of State to modify the purchase notice as regards either the whole or any part of the land.</p>

It is only fair, if we are to exclude the advertisers themselves, that we should also exclude the other side, so that no interested party should be a member of the tribunal.

<q>and where any such building is acquired under this Subsection the local planning authority shall not execute, or cause or permit to be executed, any works for the demolition of the building or for its alteration or extension which would substantially affect its character.</q>
The purpose of this Amendment can be briefly stated. We gave some attention to this matter in Committee and the Joint Under-Secretary said he would consider it. It is in order to elicit from him the result of his deliberations that we have put down the Amendment. Subsection (4) deals with cases of buildings which have been taken over by local authorities but which are not the subject of building preservation orders. If they were the subject of such orders, these ancient and beautiful buildings would have to be preserved, but since they are not the subject of orders we think it is important that the local authority should be under some compulsion to maintain them in good order.</p>

<p>We have looked at this carefully and we think the present words should stand. The Amendment would mean that a local planning authority would have to preserve buildings for all time and would never be able to alter them even though it might be necessary in the interest of public health. In point of fact, it would impose on a local planning authority even more onerous conditions than exist in the case of a building in respect of which a building preservation order had been made.</p>

<q>(5) An authorisation may be given under this section notwithstanding that a clearance order or a demolition order has been made under Section sixteen of the Housing (Scotland) Act, 1930.</q>

As hon. Members no doubt realise, this Clause gives to local authorities the power to acquire by agreement land which contains any building in respect of which a building preservation order is in force. This Amendment carries the matter a little further. It empowers the local authority to acquire buildings which may be in the area of a clearance or demolition order, but which are of historical interest and in respect of which no building preservation order is in force. It is of value that we should keep as many of these old buildings as we can.</p>

<p>The powers given by this Clause can be used only when a building preservation order is already in force. In my view, the Amendment would not alter that position. It is really most improbable that a local planning authority would ever make a building preservation order in respect of a building upon which a demolition order had already been made. There is no method under the existing law, so far as I can see, under which the demolition order, once made, can be rescinded. It is equally unlikely that a local authority would make a demolition order for a building in respect of which a preservation order had been made. I can see what hon. Members opposite want here, but I still think they need have no real anxiety but that the matter may be left to us.</p>

<p>I do not want to press the matter, but it is not at all difficult, to my mind, to think of cases where a building, as a shell, ought to be preserved historically as a monument, but the inside of which is such that a demolition order is required. It may very well be that we may get the demolition order first when we ought to have had a preservation order, and if, as the Lord Advocate tells us, there is no way of rescinding the demolition order, the position is even worse than we had anticipated. I should have thought that he would take this opportunity of putting into the Bill some method of undoing a demolition order so as to preserve the outside of a building which might very easily be the subject of a demolition order if one took account only of the inside. I hope the Lord Advocate will look at this matter again, as mistakes are bound to happen


sometimes, and it seems to me that we may get to the point where a demolition order has been made in respect of something which ought to be preserved, and that there is no way out of that position. This point having been raised, the Government should find a way out, and, as the Bill is the proper place for providing that way out, we think it ought to be inserted before this Bill becomes law. I hope he will be able to do this, because it is in everybody's interest that it should be done.</p>

<p>I very much hope that the Lord Advocate will take to heart what my right hon. and learned Friend has said, because Scotland is very rich in buildings of historical interest, and I share the apprehensions which have been expressed, as representing a constituency which is particularly rich in historical monuments. Although they have been fairly amply safeguarded by the Preservation of Ancient Monuments Act, we all know what has happened in the past, in all the countries of Europe, where demolition has taken place for the purely utilitarian purposes which my right hon. and learned Friend envisaged. I hope the Lord Advocate will do something about it, because, as a true lover of Scotland, I should expect him to share our concern in this matter. In putting forward this Amendment, we desire only to prevent the undue spoliation of buildings of historical value in Scotland, and I therefore ask the Lord Advocate seriously to reconsider the matter</p>

<p>I am sorry the Lord Advocate said he would look into this matter again, because I do not think it requires reconsideration. If there is any building of historical interest within the boundary of the local planing authority, nobody can visualise that body acting in a manner likely to bring about the destruction of that building. In cases where there are very old buildings of historical interest, the local authority, in consultation with the Secretary of State, will decide that the building is a monument worthy of preservation. If the local authority does

not agree, I do not see why the Bill should compel them to preserve something, if they do not wish to do so.</p>

<p>I have listened to what the hon. Member for West Renfrew (Mr. Scollan) has said, and I should like to refer to an ancient building known as Gladstone's Land in the City of Edinburgh. It was designated by the local authority for demolition to make way for the construction of some of the modern buildings which the hon. Member for West Renfrew has in mind. This decision by the local authority caused a public outcry, and if my memory is right, I think I am right in saying that the Ancient Monuments Commission undertook to find half the money if the public would find the other half. As a result, this ancient and characteristic building which is known as Gladstone's Land still exists in the City of Edinburgh, and is still owned and is occupied by the Saltoun Society, one of those public-spirited cultural societies which have done so much for Scotland. I am saying this to refresh the memory of the Lord Advocate. It is not an unimportant matter that a great many such buildings will be rather ruthlessly demolished with a great loss to the community if an Amendment of this sort does not get the support of the Lord Advocate. I am sure the Lord Advocate would be the last man in the world to want these characteristic buildings demolished and replaced by something of less historical value.</p>

<p>I wonder whether, for the purposes of record, the Secretary of State can make a statement on the position of planning authorities where Government Departments carry out development?

I should like to know what the rule is to be in future. Will there be an opportunity for planning authorities to object before other Departments come in and commence operations?</p>

Friend explaining the whole position and pointing out that I had already given instructions to see that, as far as possible, there would be no slip-up in future in dealing with this. It is my intention that there shall be the closest consultation between my Department and local authorities before anything is done, if that is at all possible.</p>

<p>The incident which the Secretary of State for Scotland has quoted is by no means an isolated incident, and consultation, in spite of his assurance is, in fact, still not taking place. May I cite to him an in-

stance which has taken place quite recently, on 3rd July, in which a substantial building has been erected in the grounds of the coastguard station at Heswall, without the knowledge of the local authority, by His Majesty's Office of Works? That building, in the view of the local authority, will constitute a great danger in view of the fact that it completely blinds a dangerous corner. That is perhaps a minor incident, but it shows that the consultation on which the Secretary of State is relying, and which we consider to be very important, is in fact still not taking place. I would like to draw his attention to this, and to ask that we may have some assurance that, in fact, local authorities will be consulted and that he will see that machinery exists for consultation before Government Departments proceed in the way I have indicated.</p>

They have again spoken to me about the matter, and have asked me to say that they will go into the matter with the hon. Member whose business it is. Speaking broadly, and without committing myself in any way, I must say that if the facts are true, it is not a thing which the Secretary of State would welcome. He does give an assurance that he intends to see that the provision is carried out properly and thoroughly, and that he will make what representations are necessary to see that an incident of this kind, if the facts are correct, is not repeated.</p>

The object of this Amendment is to enable regulations to be made by the Minister of Transport authorising pro-


ceedings for the compulsory acquisition of land under Clause 44 to be taken at the same time as proceedings connected with the making of an order stopping up highways under this Clause.

<p>This seems to me to be a most odd proceeding. You are to take at the same time proceedings to determine whether an order shall be made and proceedings to acquire land to carry out the order. How can you determine whether land will be required until you have determined wether the order is to be made? I cannot see how it is possible to conduct these operations concurrently, and the same point arises in regard to a subsequent Amendment which we will come to later. I cannot see how it is possible to begin operations for acquisition of land without stultifying the whole procedings in connection with the making of the order. Of course, if you are going to adopt the attitude that anybody who objects to the making of an order is just "blowing off steam", and that naturally the Minister will ride roughshod over everybody, whatever a person may say, then I can see there can be concurrent proceedings, but you cannot have concurrent proceedings without admitting that the whole proceedings for the making of the order are just a farce.

I do not know whether this got in by some oversight, or whether it is really the Government's intention that some of these interests shall simply be confiscated without any compensation at all, because undoubtedly the Clause, as it stands, entitles the Treasury to make a scheme under which certain classes of interests are simply to disappear without compensation. I know that there has been controversy among hon. Members opposite as to whether any compensation should be paid for interests that are confiscated by the State, but we had understood that for the time being that controversy had been resolved in favour of some compensation. It would be inadequate in many


cases, but at least the principle of compensation has hitherto been recognised. I know that there has been an attempt in this connection to say that the &#x00A3;300 million is not compensation, but is something to meet hardship, but it is a very serious criticism of the Government's actions, if they are going to admit that they have created hardship to the tune of &#x00A3;300 million.<br/>
I can understand the Government operating a large-sized scheme of nationalisation and saying that the cost to the country will be &#x00A3;300 million or even &#x00A3;3,000 million, for what they get, but to say that nobody is entitled to a penny, although they agree they are creating hardship to the tune of &#x00A3;300 million by what they do, is a pretty good criticism of their actions and is creating hardship without any legal right at all. Is it supposed that there is no hardship involved in taking away certain rights without compensation? Why none at all? Is this a means test? Is it the idea that the poor man suffers hardship, but that if a man is above a certain level he does not suffer any hardship, and is it the proposal that everybody, in claiming compensation, must declare the whole of his assets so that the Government may determine on a means test whether or not he is to suffer hardship?<br/>
Let the people of the country understand if that is what is proposed. It will be difficult for some hon. Gentlemen opposite to propose a means test. It that is so, let us understand what it is, and that the proposal is that everyone who makes a claim under the Bill shall undergo a means test and that if they have means over a certain amount, they are not deemed to suffer any hardship. No doubt as the means fall so does the hardship rise&#x2014;or are there some other circumstances to be taken into account? I do not know. Let us understand what we are doing, and let us be told the basis on which this strange compensation is to take place. I do not think the country as a whole realises that the rights of a number of people are to be consficated without compensation. Nor do they realise that there is to be a sliding scale of compensation which apparently is to be envisaged, if I interpret the right hon. Gentleman's nod aright. I think it is time the country did understand just

what is happening. I need hardly say that we on this side of the House take the view, as did the Uthwatt Committee, that the rights being taken away here are legal rights which ought to be compensated.</p>

<p>I hesitate to interrupt the right hon. and learned Gentleman, but I am sure he has read the Uthwatt Committee's report sufficiently well to realise that it said nothing of the kind. The Committee made it perfectly clear that in common law they have no rights at all.</p>

<p>They made it plain that where you are sterilising land, when you are telling someone he must not use land in a certain way, there is no room for compensation at common law; but they did not say that when you are taking valuable rights which you, the taker, propose to sell, there is no right of compensation. They never said that. That is what the Bill is taking. The Bill is taking from the landowner valuable rights and vesting them in the Central Land Board and proposing that the Board shall sell them for the benefit of the Government. Therefore, you are taking property from people which you are proposing to sell for a considerable amount, and yet you are saying that that property is not to be compensated. The Uthwatt Committee never suggested that was either legal or moral, and I suggest that it is neither legal nor moral.</p>

<p>The right hon. and learned Gentleman says that the country has a right to know. To that we do not demur. The country has a right to know, and in Committee when it was discussed, we made no attempt to hide the facts. On Second Reading, when the matter was raised, it was fully discussed. The same thing applied on the English Bill, when the principle was fully debated at every stage. So far as we are concerned, we admit the right of the country to know, and indeed, we are prepared and anxious for the country to know the facts. The nation is taking over development values.<br/>
It is said by some Members on this side&#x2014;and I do not deny it&#x2014;that we are rather mild in only taking over development value. They say we ought to take over the land itself, but being a very moderate Government&#x2014;[<i>Interruption</i>]&#x2014;


yes, a very moderate Government, considered on Socialist standards, particularly following a war in which people fought for land&#x2014;we do not take an extreme view. We take the moderate view that the value of the land should be taken by the community because that value was created by the community. The protagonists on both Front Benches, leaving out my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State all represent Divisions on the banks of the Clyde. Where would the value of the land on Clydeside be without the industry, capacity and work of the shipbuilding workers? The value of the land was not created by the particular owners at the time, but by the capacity and intelligence of the common people.<br/>
The money payment of &#x00A3;300 million which we propose is regarded by some Members on this side as being value, if we are taking over the land. The Government have come to the conclusion that it is absolutely essential that the development of land should belong to the nation. The Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Government have looked on broad lines at what the nation can justly afford and have decided on the sum of &#x00A3;300 million. We propose to allocate this sum to those who own development values so that if there is any hardship or suffering, it will be modified and the taking-over will bear less hardly on those who can afford it least. If the right hon. and learned Gentleman says there is some kind of means test, I say frankly, "Yes, there is." I do not deny it. This is an <i>ex gratia</i> payment which is not derived out of any real right. It is a community right But recognising that hardship may be caused, this Government, with a generosity and kindness well becoming to it, have granted the owners of development values this payment. On a broad view, I think it is a very generous payment and one which the hon. Gentlemen opposite, instead of opposing, should welcome, coming from this Government.</p>

<p>The honeyed words which have come from the Joint Under-Secretary will deceive nobody. Now that the other side of the House have openly admitted that they approve of the means test, which will come somewhat of a surprise to many of their supporters, we have come to the stage where it is perfectly obvious that the Socialist Government are floundering worse than they

did before. The hon. Gentleman suggests that perhaps many of his friends would prefer that they should take over land completely. He also knows that they would be quite incompetent to run the land if they did take it over.</p>

<p>That is why I was apologising for making the mistake. I was not doubting your Ruling, Mr. Deputy-Speaker, but I was apologising for making a mistake. My right hon. and learned Friend put the case very clearly when he showed that there was discrimination in compensating people. To give compensation where the Government think there is an advantage is preposterous to ordinary thinking people with an idea of justice, and it makes a lamentable record for the Government, certainly much worse than it was before. When one listens to the Government spokesmen, who pose as pioneers of justice, saying that justice will only be done in certain cases ?if we like the people," I think it is a most disgraceful state of affairs. To say that justice shall be done in certain cases or not, which is worse because the Government might have to do it in a few more cases, is a travesty of everything connected with fair Government in this country, and I cannot help thinking that this is the most regrettable thing to which we have listened so far.</p>

<p>I should like to clarify my own mind in this matter. If I understood the contention of the Government, it is that the sum of &#x00A3;300 million was provided for making payment in respect of interest in land in Scotland, England and Wales. Having made this provision quite clearly under Clause 3, it seems as if an effort is to be made to whittle down that sum and to find some excuse or justification for not paying it.</p>

<p>No. I wish the hon. Gentleman would not provoke me. There is no whittling down of the &#x00A3;300 million by a penny. It will remain unaltered.</p>

<p>The allocation of the &#x00A3;300 million will unquestionably be whittled down, if the claim to eliminate certain classes because they are ineligible for any advantage is carried. The scheme, to which the Treasury agreed, provided for distribution as between those interests in development values in land or&#x2014;and this is where the whittling down can take place&#x2014;such of them as may be prescribed by the scheme. The Joint Under-Secretary said with heat and eloquence that this was not a just scheme, but he certainly claimed for it that it was one of generosity and kindness. I venture to say that it would be more commendable to those concerned&#x2014;and, after all, we are dealing with persons who are feeling their rights, no matter what the feelings of the Government may be&#x2014;if he had added justice to that. Kindness and generosity are suitable relations, especially between one person and another, but one looks for something more elevating, something above emotion, in a case such as this. I suggest that justice would be the proper way of deciding between those various interests on the one hand
<q>or such as them as may be prescribed by the scheme.'</q>
That prescription, during the French Revolution, was the prelude to execution; I feel the prescription in this Clause is the prelude to something nearly like it. I put it to the Secretary of State and his colleagues that the use of his provision, if it is retained, will mean less of that global sum for some people in Scotland. I am sure the Government agree that we want to make the distribution of this global sum fair to all parties who feel they are deserving of compensation in these circumstances. I think the elimination of</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1947-07-07a.1964.0" colnum="1964" time="">

<p>A suggestion has already been made from all quarters of this House that there is no kind of right to compensation or hardship payment of any kind for the loss of unrestricted or development rights. That is the claim that has been made. The Uthwatt Report was referred to, and it is true that there is no common law right arising out of the loss of these rights. What the Uthwatt Report says is quite clear. It says:
<q>But the point may be reached when restriction imposes an expenditure beyond obligation. At this stage restriction becomes equivalent to the expropriation of proprietary right or interest, and, therefore, it will be claimed should carry a right to compensation as such.</q>
That is the point. There is no doubt at all that the rights now being taken away are, in fact, far beyond the rights merely of not creating a nuisance between neighbours. The whole right of the use of property is being taken away, except the existing use. In exchange for that, it is said that those losing rights have no right in turn to receive any compensation. That is not the opinion of the Uthwatt Report. The second contention of those on this side of the House is that if these rights are being taken away, compensation should be even, in the same way, indeed, as those who are losing rights in industries which are being nationalised are compensated evenly. We deny to Members on the other side, or any body of men, the right to pick and choose whom they should compensate. The compensation must be done evenly, fairly, and with justice.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 61, line 20 to leave out from "that," to the end of line 25, and to insert:
<q>by reason of the prospects of development other than the making good of the war damage, the value of the hereditament in the state in which it was immediately after the occurrence of the damage is higher, and the amount of the value payment is accordingly lower, than it would be apart from the prospect of such development.</q>
Clause 53 provides for the making of payments, additional to those payable under the Treasury scheme in Clause 52, in the case of war-damaged land in respect of which a value payment

falls to be made under the War Damage Act, 1943. In calculating the value payment, account is taken of the redevelopment value of the site, and the higher the redevelopment value, naturally the lower the value payment. Under the Bill, however, the owner will no longer be allowed to enjoy the development value, and the purpose of the Clause is to set this right and to entitle the owner in such cases to a rectifying payment outside the &#x00A3;300 million which we have been discussing. The object of the Amendment is to express more clearly what is intended. The wording of the Clause as it stands gives rise to some doubt.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 62, line 41, to leave out paragraph (<i>c</i>).<br/>
This is for the purpose of trying to clear up a difficulty which arises under this paragraph, which provides:
<q>for rendering the right to a payment under this part of this Act conditional upon compliance with the provisions of the regulations with respect to the making of claims.</q>
I do not think that the Government mean that if one does not use the right form, or does not sign on the right dotted line, one will not get one's money. But that is what this paragraph means. Surely it is not right to say that because one does not follow the right procedure one will be deprived of one's compensation? I hope the Secretary of State will drop this or give an absolute assurance that there will be no use of this power in the way I suggest when it comes to the making of regulations.</p>

<p>I can assure the right hon. and learned Gentleman that the regulations which may be made will not be such as to cause the result he has mentioned. But we must have some kind of power, and what we have in mind is

regulations to deal with the matter of submission of proof of title and that kind of thing. This paragraph is for the purpose of having a reserve power for the sort of things which are the <i>substrata</i> of a claim.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 63, line 14, to leave out "different," and to insert "adjacent or contiguous."<br/>
This is a matter of rather more substance. The provision here appears to be that although a landowner has a number of parcels of land scattered all over Scotland he may be required to bring them all into the same claim. There seems to be no point in that, but this is what is allowed. This is what the Central Land Board is permitted to do. If one has contiguous parcels of land it is all right. I agree that a man should not get more compensation by dividing an estate into bits, but nor should the Government avoid the payment of proper compensation by taking one piece of land in Berwickshire and another in Sutherland and saying: "Here is a big bit of land, and landowners are very wicked people and they shall not get paid." Can the Secretary of State give some practical reason why distant bits of land should be put into the one claim? Either the right hon. Gentleman means that, or he should drop this altogether.</p>

<p>It is not intended to aggregate parcels of land separated by great distances in the way in which the right hon. and learned Gentleman suggests. The difficulty is in really finding a satisfactory word for dealing with this. The term "adjacent or contiguous" will not do because that means just bordering on each other. We have looked into this with the object of finding some kind of formula which would prevent the sort of case which the right hon. and learned Gentleman has mentioned. But it is difficult to get any satisfactory formula, and it appeared to be better to leave it to the good sense of the landlords, with the assurance that we will not attempt to aggregate claims in respect of widely separated parcels of land.</p>

<p>Does this mean that the Central Land Board is going to deal with these matters without any definition?


Surely it would be as easy for the Lord Advocate to find suitable words as it will be for the Central Land Board. The Lord Advocate's answer surely means that it will not be possible to tell people in advance whether to aggregate their claims or not and that they will have to make special inquiry in each case separately. Surely the Lord Advocate cannot mean that. It cannot be impossible to find words to tell people what the position is. Is the Central Land Board a greater master of the English language than the Lord Advocate so that where he has failed it will succeed?</p>

<p>The difficulty appears to be that the Lord Advocate cannot find suitable words. He has admitted the desirability of doing so, and the absurdity of collecting different parcels of land and aggregating them for one compensation. He admits that this would be a preposterous and difficult situation. He will not have the words "adjacent" or "contiguous." Would "in proximity" do? It would in my view do justice to the Clause. "In the neighbourhood of one another"&#x2014;are these suitable? I suggested, in Committee, that the words, "parcels of land," which are in the Clause will lead to the possibility of considerable injustice. There are many counties in Scotland, and I might have a parcel of land in each. Under this Clause they could be aggregated as the Central Land Board may direct. But "contiguity" would give some justice and reasonableness.<br/>
The suggestion contained In the Clause will create a position of absurdity. It is at known fact that there are landlords of property in different counties of Scotland. There are landlords of land in the North of Scotland and the South, in the East and the West. I do suggest that the Central Land Board should have some direction or indication how it should aggregate these parcels of land. The words "in different parcels of land" do not seem to give such direction. It seems surprising that the Lord Advocate is unable to give a different interpretation from that which is given in the Clause. I suggest that with the range of resources and the information at his disposal he can

put before the House something which would meet its views on this subject.</p>

the Board shall, on application made to them in accordance with regulations under this Act, vary the determination and amend, discharge, modify or release any agreements or securities made or given in respect thereof, so far as may be just in consequence of the modification, order or purchase, as the case may be.</q>
<q>(4) Where compensation is payable under Part II of this Act in consequence of any such order as mentioned in paragraph (<i>a</i>) or paragraph (<i>b</i>) of subsection (2) or subsection (3) of this section, then, in calculating for the purposes of the compensation any depreciation in the value of the land to which the order relates, or any other loss or damage sustained by a person interested in that land, regard shall be had to the foregoing provisions of this section and to anything done by the Board thereunder.</q>
<q>(5) Where compensation is payable under the said Part II in consequence of any such order as aforesaid, or where land is compulsorily acquired as mentioned in paragraph (<i>c</i>) of subsection (2) or subsection (3) of this section, then, if any sums have been paid to the Central Land Board by way of development charge in accordance with the determination referred to in those subsections, the Board shall pay to the authority or person by whom compensation is payable in consequence of the order or, as the case may be, in respect of the compulsory acquisition, a contribution towards that compensation representing such proportion of the sums so paid by way of development charge as may be agreed between the Board and that authority or person, or, failing agreement, as may be determined by the Secretary of State, to be appropriate in all the circumstances of the case.</q>
<q>(6) Subsection (3) of section nineteen of this Act shall apply for the purposes of this section as it applies for the purposes of that section, and shall accordingly have effect as if the reference therein to the foregoing provisions of that section included a reference to the foregoing provisions of this section; and any reference in this section to the compulsory

acquisition of land shall be construed as including a reference to the acquisition of land by agreement by any authority or person who has power or can be authorised to acquire it compulsorily.</q>
This is largely a drafting Amendment but it does mean one or two changes of substance. The most important of these changes are: first, the powers conferred on the Central Land Board to vary the amount of the charges and to discharge or modify security deeds given therefor in cases where planning permission is revoked or modified, are extended to cover any such cases where land is compulsorily acquired; second, the Amendment provides that where a development charge has been paid and planning permission is subsequently revoked or modified, if the land is compulsorily acquired the Central Land Board shall pay to the local authority compensation for the revocation of the planning permission as a contribution or such amount as may be agreed with the local authority; and failing agreement the amount of the contribution will be determined by the Secretary of State. This allows for the appeal against the decision of the local authority to the Secretary of State. This, I suggest, largely meets the point raised by hon. Members in Committee that some more definite obligation should be placed on the Central Land Board to make a proper contribution to local planning authorities.</p>

<p>It is true that the position in Clause 19 is different from that in Clause 74. Clause 19 deals with the revocation and modification of planning conditions after the Bill becomes law, whereas Clause 74 deals with uncompleted developments begun under the existing law. Clause 74 continues the existing law in relation to those developments for a further period of six months under the existing law where permission is granted, or a planning scheme is revoked or modified by a subsequent scheme and the developer gets, broadly speaking, compensation in respect of expenditure incurred in carrying out work which is rendered abortive in respect of any liability for the abandonment of a contract of work; and similarly, where planning permission is granted under an interim development order prior to the nth November, 1943, and that as the date of the Town and Country Planning Interim Development (Scotland) Act, 1943, is revoked, the existing law allows compensation on the same basis as Clause 74.<br/>
12.30 a.m.<br/>
I suggest that there is no justification for having compensation on a wider basis. Where a building was erected or begun when no planning control was in operation the owner should have applied under the Town and Country Planning (Interim Development) (Scotland) Act, 1943, for permission for the completion of development. If he was refused permission under that Act, compensation would have been payable on precisely the same basis as under Clause 74. On the other hand, if the developer failed to apply for permission after the Act of 1943 was passed, but continued to complete his building and incur expense, as in the ordering of plant or machinery, it would clearly be unreasonable to expect the local planning authority to compensate him, as the loss


would have been due to the neglect of the developer. In these circumstances, I suggest that the Amendment is unjustified and could not possibly be accepted.</p>

<q>on application made to him within one year after the appointed day or within such extended period as the Secretary of State may in any particular case allow.</q>
This is the first of four Amendments to Clause 75 which it might be convenient to take together. The others are to lines 33, 34 and 43 on page 85. The object of the Clause, broadly speaking, is to take out of the compensation and betterment provisions of the Bill, land which is dead ripe for development on the appointed day. This would probably commend itself to hon. Gentlemen opposite. At present Clause 75 provides that the Secretary of State may direct that Parts IV and V of the Bill shall not apply. As a matter of machinery the Secretary of State issues a certificate to the effect that he is satisfied that the land specified in the certificate comes within the Clause. The owner can then produce this to the Board or purchasing authority. The issue of the certificate under the Clause follows automatically, so that this Amendment is just an improvement in machinery and does not involve any change in principle.<br/>
The second point is that before issuing a certificate, the Secretary of State should review the planning position and, if necessary, see that the planning permission is revoked. This may occasionally be necessary, particularly as the Clause applies to land subject to interim development permission granted since July, 1943. While the Bill proceeds on the assumption that such permission would have been based on modern planning requirements and can safely be preserved, this may not be so in all cases; for example, where permission was given before the new plan was made to erect houses. Where the Secretary of State issues a cerficate, as I have already described, under this alternative machine, no development charge will be payable to an owner in respect of the proposed development, that

is, development of land dead ripe. In this respect the Amendment to line 43 makes no change. There is, however, a slight change in the position as regards Part IV. Subsection (1) as drafted completely withdraws the right to claim on the &#x00A3;300,000,000. The Amendment provides that the point may be made in respect of any development value over and above the value for the proposed development. This brings the Clause into line with Clause 73. It is really a complicated matter, but I do not think Members opposite need be very apprehensive about the results.</p>

<p>I think the Government are to be congratulated in this case on their ingenuity. The House will be aware that during the discussions upstairs Members on their own side raised a very strong attack against the whole principle of this Clause. We, on the other hand, demonstrated that if you accept the principle of the Clause the Clause did not go really far enough. It was full of logical absurdities. What the Government have done is to save face by not giving way to their back benchers, but, in effect, by opening the door to nullifying the whole effect of this Clause if they want. Let me explain. All claims must be made within a year. No reason was given for that at all. The only reason that appears on the face of it is to give the Government plenty of time to operate the procedure under the fourth Amendment for the revocation of permission. No limitation is placed on that. The Secretary of State could revoke every permission if he wanted to.<br/>
If the Secretary of State is pressed sufficiently by supporters to avoid payment, he has only to step up the rate at which he revokes permissions to take instances out of the dead ripe category and put them back into the main pool which shares the &#x00A3;300,000,000. How far he will go in this direction nobody can say. He could not say himself possibly at the moment. But if it is admitted in principle that there is such a thing as dead ripe land, surely those who have qualified already for that category by having permission ought to get the benefit. I cannot understand how it comes about that permission can be revoked at this time of day and the vested right to compensation be taken away. The House will remember that there must not only be building permission, but there must be either


a building contract or an application for permission to build.<br/>
To come forward now and say that people who have made all their arrangements and have established that they are preparing, as soon as the shortages of labour and material allow, to carry out their development, are to be refused compensation on the basis of dead ripe land merely because the Secretary of State chooses for no reason stated to revoke the permission granted, maybe months or years ago, is introducing into our legislation for compensation an uncertainty, a dependency on the whim of the Minister for the time being, which I think is unique. It goes even beyond the suggestion of an earlier Amendment where the Treasury were to be left to make rules of any kind they chose. Here we have not even rules. The Secretary of State may deal with each individual case as he likes. He can revoke permission or not, and there is no rule, no remedy, no reason, just "go as you please." If that is the way to administer compensation, it is novel to me, and I am surprised that even this Government should reduce the award on compensation to an unprincipled morass such as will be created by the acceptance of this Amendment.</p>

<p>I have to submit that this Amendment is out of Order on the Report stage. The purpose of the Amendment is to reduce the Government grant to local planning authorities from a maximum of 60 to a maximum of 50 per cent. The only source from which the local planning authorities can make up the balance is the local rates, and it is the established practice in this House that you cannot increase the charge on local rates on the Report stage of a Bill. It is not necessary, in order that the Amendment shall be out of Order, that it shall necessarily increase the rates, it is enough that it may increase them. This Amendment enables the Government to lower the grant, and therefore makes it possible for the amount from the rates to be increased.</p>

<p>I am not the Secretary of State, and I had no idea that this was to be raised. I can only give my own opinion, and I do so on the spur of the moment, but I give it freely and honestly. My view is that it does increase the rates, that it will have that effect. May I say, however, something to offset that? It may be a point for you to consider, Mr. Deputy-Speaker. On these matters I take the view very strongly that we should safeguard the rules of the House. This Amendment certainly reduces the grant. There is no minimum in the Bill. There is a maximum. When this was fixed the idea was that there should be a maximum figure, and there should be a minimum figure for the authorities less in need. While the maximum figure was fixed in the Bill at 60, the minimum figure was then fixed at 10 by the Treasury. In subsequent negotiations the Treasury took the view that we should make it 50 and raise the minimum to 20. I do not pro-


pose to say anything further than that. Undoubtedly, if the 60 is taken by itself, then it might have an effect on local rating.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 101, line 23, to leave out Subsections (2) and (3).<br/>
The Subsections proposed to be left out are concerned with the payment of expenses by local authorities. The cases where compulsory contributions under these Subsections would be likely to be made are those of small burghs. This might well be intolerable, and it is for that reason that we have proposed this Amendment. This matter was raised in Committee on one of the very few days when the right hon. and learned Gentleman was absent, but I said then that I had strong views on the subject and promised that I would consult with my hon. Friends. I have done so, and, after consultation, I ask that this part of the Clause might well be dropped.</p>

Members, it has now been decided to set out any repealed provisions of the 1945 Act as applied to the Bill in a new Schedule to the Bill. It is really for the purpose of allowing the people who have to administer this Act to know, instead of having to go searching through other Acts to which reference is made in this Measure. Therefore, I am sure that on this occasion whatever the word "curtilage" may mean in law, it is good law as regards the ordinary people who have to administer the Bill from day to day.</p>

<p>I beg to move, "That the Schedule be read a Second time."<br/>
This is the Schedule we have already referred to. As the right hon. Gentleman and his colleagues are aware, a White Paper was presented to Parliament shortly after the Bill was introduced setting out the provisions of the 1945 Act which we are incorporating in the Schedule. It is now considered convenient to reproduce those provisions in the new Schedule to the Bill, and we think that this will be of great advantage to local authorities and others who have to administer the Bill.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1947-07-07a.1987.4" hansard_membership_id="11310" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/30031" speakername="Mr. J. S. C. Reid" colnum="1987" time="">
<p>I am in some doubt as to the proper course to pursue here. This Schedule incorporates a number of Amendments which have not yet been reached on the Eighth Schedule, and it might be convenient if I discussed them here. Then when the Eighth Schedule comes up for consideration it could perhaps pass without discussion. There are three in particular to which I think attention ought to be drawn.<br/>
1.15 a.m.<br/>
Section 21 of the Act, as reprinted in the Schedule, provides that work done on land acquired by the Central Land Board and then transferred by them to some person who is to develop, may proceed notwithstanding that it interferes with the servitudes of other people and in particular notwithstanding that it withdraws some other person's natural right of support. It does seem to me to be going a very long way, and I wonder what the justification for it is. The Central Land Board can come and buy my neighbour's

land in order to sell it to some private developer and that private developer can go and take away my right of support without my being entitled to object. Unless I misunderstand the new provision&#x2014;not the one as it was in the White Paper but as it will be after tonight&#x2014;there is no doubt that will be the effect. That was not the effect it had up till now. That will become the effect. Is it really intended that the Central Land Board should have power to put a private person in possession, who can then destroy his neighbour's right of support without any possibility of question other than payment of compensation? I cannot help feeling that is an unintended consequence of this Bill. There are so many loose ends knocking about as a result of the Bill that it seems to be both theoretically and practically indefensible, and I cannot understand how it ever got through.<br/>
I pass to the amended Section 22 in the Schedule, and here I take up the point which I put at an earlier stage. Section 22 (5) entitles the Minister to conduct as concurrent proceedings, the authorisation of certain developments and the acquisition of land necessary to carry it out. Again I say to the right hon. Gentleman, are the whole of these proceedings to be a pure farce? Is the whole thing to be prejudged? Is it to be judged, is it to be taken as decided, before you have gone through an investigation? Is it to be said, "Of course, we shall brush aside objectors. We are the masters now. They are only allowed to blow off steam." Is that the attitude of this provision? It is the only attitude that can justify this concurrent procedure and, therefore, I suggest that this is a bad provision.<br/>
I pass finally to Section 29, and I hope that the country will take note of what is being done in the name of planning. Under the Rural Housing Act there was an obligation to provide housing accommodation under Section 79 of the Act of 1925. Section 29 as now amended provides that that salutary provision shall not have effect in relation to an acquisition by a local planning authority under this Bill, and it goes on to provide that where possession of any building on land which has been acquired by a local planning authority, which has been acquired by the Central Land Board is required by them, then at any time, if the tenancy of the occupier has expired, the authority


may serve notice on the occupier of the building requiring him to move within 21 clays. Then the Central Land Board may pay a reasonable allowance for disturbance, but a reasonable allowance for disturbance is very different from security of tenure or the certainty of getting a new house.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman is priding himself that he has made good provision for displaced persons being attended to. If he looks at this, I do not think he will be quite so pleased. It seems to me to be rather bad. He is doing away with perfectly clear rights of reinstatement and he is allowing the Board to dispossess the dispossessor on a mere 21 days' notice. I take it that includes a person under the Rent Restriction Act. I am not clear about that, and I would like to know, because the contractual tenancy can be determined, but a statutory tenancy cannot under the Act. I think it is very doubtful if the Rent Restriction Act is saved. J would be glad to have an answer on that point.<br/>
These are all technical matters, but I have no doubt the right hon. Gentleman has the answers. It is very unfortunate that these complicated matters should have been held up and only thrust on us at the Report Stage. I cannot understand why these matters were not brought before us on the Committee stage when they could have been examined at leisure and not at this time of the morning. But such are our methods of procedure in legislation that the Government cannot keep pace with their own programme. They produce a Bill which requires extensive amendment on the Committee stage, and still they forget the most important points and only bring them here on the Report stage. We are told the time of the House is very valuable and that we cannot have time for essential debates on one thing or another, yet the Government waste time by failing to produce these things at the right time and bringing them up at the last moment. How does it happen? There arc a whole string of amendments to Schedule 8 on the Order Paper. Why were they not put down sooner and why not on the Committee stage? I do not want to take up the time of the House at this late hour, but I want to make a protest against the way in which these detailed and complicated matters are dealt with and legislation is held up and thrust on us at the last minute. It seems to me that

the purchasers from the Central Land Board are being given wholly improper powers over their neighbours That the acquisition of land is necessary to do it is a confession by the Government that their boasted safeguards amount to saying: let us get on with the purchase of land before we know whether the order is going to be made. I would not like to ask the House to divide on this, but I do want to register my protest.</p>

<p>Before putting the Question, may I say that, while I appreciate that this new Schedule is put down for the convenience of Members, it is unfortunate that it includes Amendments which cannot be dealt with adequately. My taking it in this way must not be taken as a precedent for future occasions. I mention it because the right hon. Gentleman has indicated we are going to deal with them now, but I trust this procedure will be altered in future.</p>

<p>This is the sort of thing that happens when we try to be accommodating. We were invited to produce this Schedule, and when we produce it, it seems to give rise to a considerable amount of criticism. May I say quite generally what this Bill tried to do with the 1945 Act. It incorporated, subject to modifications, the provisions of Sections 18 to 29. These Sections lay down a code dealing with the disposal or appropriation of land acquired under the 1945 Act by local planning authorities for planning purposes. They contain other powers to enable development to proceed; for example, they provide for the setting aside of restrictive conditions affecting land, the stopping of highways and the extinguishment of private rights of way and rights as to apparatus of statutory undertakers, and the extension and modification of powers and duties of statutory undertakers. There is really nothing new. All that has happened is that the setting out of the provisions of the 1945 Act in this Schedule has brought to the right hon. Gentleman a number of points which he had not brought forward in committee.</p>

<p>May I be allowed to correct the right hon. and learned Gentleman? Not one of the points to which I referred appeared in the Committee stage or in the Bill or in anything until we got the Order Paper now before us.</p>

<p>The Amendments already contained in the Eighth Schedule


to the Bill and additional Amendments now being made are largely for the purpose of tidying and clarifying the application of these Sections of the 1945 Act. I concede to the right hon. and learned Gentleman that this also widens the scope of the application of these Sections to include, in addition to local authorities, Government Departments, the Central Land Board and statutory undertakers. So far as Section 21 is concerned, the modifications affected by the present Amendment is to limit the application of the Section to land acquired for general development and where the acquiring authorities do not themselves develop, the benefit is limited to persons deriving satisfaction from the land. The scope of Section 18 is limited to land acquired by local planning authorities under Clauses 34 and 36 of the Bill. The Amendment substitutes the words:
<q>to obtain thereon accommodation suitable to their reasonable requirements</q>
for the words:
<q>to obtain accommodation thereon</q>
and the Amendment brings the provisions of Section 18 (5) of the 1945 Act into line with Section 29 of that Act under Clause 22 (7) of the Bill as amended in Committee.</p>

<p>I would ask for some clarification before we leave this Schedule. The amended Section 24 says:
<q>Where a Minister and the appropriate Minister or the Central Land Board and the appropriate Minister propose to name an order under this subsection &#x2026;</q>
A little further up it refers to the:
<q>Secretary of State and the appropriate Minister &#x2026;</q>
That seems to be reasonable in a Scottish Measure, but what does it mean when it refers to the Minister and the appropriate Minister doing certain things. I understand that the appropriate Minister in some cases might be the Minister of Transport, but what other Minister would have a right to issue an Order under this Scottish Measure? It seems to me to be an extraordinary thing.</p>

<p>I suggest that perhaps it might be more convenient if this procedure, which I think is a good one,

were adopted again, but that the Bill should be re-committed in respect of the new Schedule at the end of the Report stage. In that event we could discuss these Amendments separately. As it is, it is rather awkward to discuss them now.</p>

These Amendments say that he shall get the same compensation as he would have got if the local authority had ordered him to do so.
