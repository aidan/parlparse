<p>His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom, as also the United States Government, have lost no opportunity of impressing upon the French authorities in North Africa the importance which they attach to the early release of all persons of whatever nationality who have been detained there on account of their sympathies with the Allied cause. It is known that many of these political

prisoners have already been released. There must, however, inevitably be a number of doubtful cases. In order to investigate these, a Mixed Commission has now been set up under the joint chairmanship of the British and United States Consuls-General at Algiers. I hope that the Commission's reports will make it possible for me to give the House fuller information about the prisoners still under detention. In the meantime, the following details have become available.<br/>
So far as can be ascertained, no British subjects are now improperly detained in Algeria or Morocco. As regards French nationals, the United States authorities were informed at the end of December that orders had been given to prison camp commanders and provincial authorities in North Africa to release all French nationals who were still detained for having helped the Allied cause. It is hoped that the Mixed Commission will be able to verify that these orders have been carried out. As regards Allied nationals, many of whom were, I understand, members of the former International Brigade, the position at the end of December was that some 200 Poles, over 100 Soviet nationals and a few Czechs and Belgians remained under detention in Algeria. Full details are not available of those detained in Morocco. Arrangements are being made however for the early release of the Poles, Czechs and Belgians. The Soviet citizens will return to their own country as soon as transport can be arranged for them, and His Majesty's Government are in touch with the Soviet Government on this question.<br/>
As regards other members of the former International Brigade and other Spanish Republican refugees, I regret that I am still without detailed information. The Mixed Commission is well aware of the necessity for finding a satisfactory solution of this particular problem at the earliest possible moment and one of its first tasks will be to investigate the situation of these people. In the meantime, it should be noted that one of its terms of reference is to obtain for them before their release as good living conditions as possible. I am not aware that any persons have been detained in North Africa solely on account of their Jewish faith.<br/>
As regards the question of anti-Jewish laws and other measures introduced by the Vichy r&#x00E9;gime since 1940, the French authorities are aware of our views and


although, as the Minister Resident recently stated, the position is not satisfactory, I trust that the necessary steps will be taken as soon as circumstances permit.</p>

When the report is received I will consider whether a further statement can be made. I am sure the House will wish to express its sympathy with the relatives of those who lost their lives.</p>

<p>The Post Office has no desire to encourage secondary school pupils to leave school prematurely against the wishes of the local education authorities, and in 1941 instructions were issued to head postmasters in Wiltshire not to recruit such pupils unless the education authorities were willing to release them.

<p>asked the Postmaster-General why, in the case of parcels sent to His Majesty's ships, including merchant vessels, there is a varying charge

<p>The postage rates for parcels addressed to His Majesty's ships in foreign waters, including merchant vessels taken up for naval or military service, are higher than those applicable to parcels for such ships in home waters because of the higher costs of transmission. Although senders should not, and probably do not, know the precise location of a ship, they are frequently in a position to judge whether a ship is at home or abroad. However, since the hon. Member raised this Question on 9th December, I have given further consideration to the subject and have decided that inland rates should be charged on parcels for His Majesty's ships whenever the sender of a parecl does not know whether the ship is abroad or not. Instructions to this effect are being issued to Post Office counter staffs and will come into force on 1st February.</p>

<p>My right hon. Friend knows that that is not a reply to my Question. I asked what are the intentions of the Government in respect of the construction of fast merchant ships.

<p>The policy of the Admiralty, as I have given it, has been consistent from the commencement of the war; and, with regard to the statement to which my hon.

<p>Expenditure on information services in respect of the Colonial Empire is spread amongst various agencies, including the Colonial Office, Ministry of Information and the B.B.C. The amount could not be computed without an undue expenditure of labour, and no figure which could be given would reflect an accurate measure of the work being done. I fully recognise the urgent necessity for informing the public in this country and elsewhere about Colonial policy.

The notices of closure which have been issued relate to the function of the creameries as redistributors of milk. The actual number which will be kept open as cheese manufacturers will depend on the cheese-manufacturing programme, which has not yet been finally settled. Those creameries which are not required for cheese-making will be regarded as redundant in order to secure the maximum


economies in the transport and manpower used in the movement of milk. The manner in which the concentrated firms will resume their activities after the war will depend on general Government policy at the time.</p>

<p>The resolution of the Deptford Borough Council to which my hon. Friend refers was passed on 2nd January. The Order did not become effective until nth January.

They added that the public should help by refusing to patronise shops where unreasonable prices are charged; and that to assist housewives to identify shops where green vegetables are being sold at less than the maximum prices, window bills are being issued by the Federation for display by the retailers concerned. I should like to express my Noble Friend's appreciation of the most helpful co-operation of the Retail Fruit Trade Federation and retailers of green vegetables generally in this matter.</p>

<p>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware of the very widespread apprehension among housewives and that the fixing of these maximum prices in advance has been tantamount to an invitation to certain sections of the trade to raise prices to the maximum? In view of the fact that this has already been reported in some districts, can he say what action he proposes to take?</p>

<p>I am aware of exactly the opposite. Before the Order came into effect it was confidently predicted that the maximum would become the fixed price, but that has not been the case. The vegetable trade have co-operated extremely well, and so far as I know in no cases have maximum prices been charged without justification.</p>

<p>I desire to raise a point of Order, Mr. Speaker, which arises from a Question that I addressed yesterday to my right hon. Friend the Minister of Production, to whom I have given such notice as in the circumstances has been possible. I asked my right hon. Friend whether he would
<q>confirm the assurance that he gave the House in previous circumstances, before Christmas, that the Minister of National Service will not remove from essential war work men and women for transfer unless the Supply Department interested in the production of the undertaking concerned has been consulted and has confirmed the view that the change is in the national interest.</q>
I believe it will be within the recollection of many hon. Members that my right hon. Friend replied:
<q>Certainly, I can give that assurance.</q>
It was an assurance which the House welcomed from all sides, as it naturally would do. The correspondent of "The Times" also correctly heard the answer which my right hon. Friend gave. My attention has been drawn by a number of my hon. Friends to the fact that in the OFFICIAL REPORT my right hon. Friend is reported as saying, not:
<q>Certainly, I can give that assurance,</q>
but:
<q>Certainly, I can give the assurance that the Supply Departments will be consulted."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 19th January, 1943; Vol. 386, cols. 40&#x2013;41.]</q>

But I asked two things: first, that the Supply Department would be consulted, and, secondly, that no men and women would be removed from vital industry until the Supply Department had confirmed the view that the change was in the national interest. I have consulted the Editors of the OFFICIAL REPORT, and I have in my hand the typewritten transcript of the reporter's notes, and there are in the typescript the words:
<q>Mr. LYTTELTON: Certainly, I can give that assurance.</q>
There are also additionally in the manuscript these words:
<q>Certainly, I can give the assurance that the Supply Departments will be consulted.</q>
I understand from the Editors of the OFFICIAL REPORT that a representative of the Minister visited the office of the Editors and asked that that alteration should be made. Let me at this stage say that I think I must completely exonerate the Official Reporters when any hon. Member states that he has been misheard or misconstrued, and I understand that it is a well understood custom of the House that where an hon. Member desires slightly to modify the weight or the grammar of any of his questions&#x2014;[HON. MEMBERS: "Not the weight."]&#x2014;that it is permissible; but, certainly, it is news to me that any hon. Member or right hon. Member may withdraw an assurance or modify the substance of an answer that he has given. Indeed, this was a vital question to war industry and not one which could be trifled with lightly. I apologise for taking up the time of the House, but I feel it is my duty to ask you, Mr. Speaker, whether you will be good enough to instruct the Editors of the OFFICIAL REPORT that a suitable alteration should be made in an approved way so that the assurance that the Minister gave should be reported in his own words. I think I ought also to ask whether you will give your powerful support in preventing any recurrence of this type of alteration, which I would respectfully submit is neither in the public interest nor in accordance with the best traditions of the House.</p>

<p>As the House is aware, there is a Rule that Ministers and other Members cannot alter substantially the meaning of anything which they have said in this House. They can merely make verbal alterations, perhaps to improve the


grammar of what has been said or to make clearer what they have intended. In this particular case the Minister was wrong in authorising any alterations in or additions to what he had said, if he did do so. I think, however, it was quite innocent. [HON. MEMBERS: "NO."] Obviously he intended to say, "I can give an assurance that this should be so," and he thought the answer as revised put it more clearly than the answer which he gave. I think he intended to clarify what he had said. I may be wrong, but that is the impression which it gives to me. As I say, however, I think he was wrong in doing so and in making this alteration, simply because it might have been open to misinterpretation, as it has been.</p>

<p>I apologise for this mistake, which I acknowledge has been made. I am afraid that my answer was inaudible, and therefore I asked that the reply which I had given should be looked at, and I say quite definitely, that, as it appears now, it is not what I said. I am very sorry that this mistake, for which I am responsible, should have occurred. On the other hand, the reply which I did give was not that which my hon. Friend meant. I said I could give a general assurance. I think hon. Members will remember that. If I may take this opportunity of clearing up the mistake, I would say that the reason I said "general assurance" is that, of course, it is the duty of the Supply Departments to represent to my right hon. Friend the Minister of Labour whether a large general withdrawal of skilled labour from a particular industry or section of industry is going to affect production, but it is not possible in particular cases for those representations to be made. That is only to try to clear up what I meant. What I said was "general assurance." I apologise for this mistake, and I completely acknowledge that the answer as given does not represent what I said.</p>

<p>The Government have given some consideration to the representations

made yesterday, and particularly to the suggestion that, possibly, the Debate on man-power should be divided into two parts, the first part to be in Secret Session and the second part in public. After careful examination I am sure that the latter proposal is quite impracticable. I think hon. Members would find themselves in a most embarrassing position in taking part, as it were, in the second stage of a Debate the first stage of which had already been held in Secret Session. Besides that, it is the intention of my right hon. Friend the Minister of Labour to give what-might be called a human budget in this Secret Session, involving a lot of figures. Hon. Members will no doubt want to ask a number of questions to which they will require replies, and, therefore, I suggest that our present arrangement suits them. If, after this Debate, we find that there is any demand for some other form of discussion on this topic or something kindred to it, then we had better consider that through the usual channels, but I must warn the House that we are beginning to pile up these Debates rather heavily.</p>

<p>Yesterday we had a kind of preliminary canter to the discussion which formally opens to-day. I think we got ourselves into rather a muddle over that, which was unfortunate. The result of the statement made by the Minister of Production at the end of Questions was really to strengthen the opinion held in all quarters of the House on the need for a public discussion of these problems. Hon. Members, a number of whom are here now, spoke to me about it in the course of yesterday's discussion. I can see the difficulty about splitting a Debate into two parts, one open and one closed, so to speak, but if there are to be two days of secret Debate, then I think the House will really wish, at an early date, for an open discussion in Parliament on the broader issues raised by the right hon. Gentleman's statement yesterday and, no doubt, other matters which will be raised in the course of the Debate now about to begin.</p>

<p>Before the right hon. Gentleman replies to that, may I say that the House as a whole will agree that in this matter of the mobilisation of labour we are discussing one of the questions which bear most closely on the domestic lives of our people? The Minister of Production yesterday said that there are to be


considerable transfers of men and women in the country. I do not know what is the experience of other hon. Members, but mine is that nothing causes more trouble than sending men and women hither and thither, and nothing causes more resentment than the fact that their grievances are hidden in Secret Sessions and that we have no opportunity at all of ventilating their difficulties in public and asking redress of their wrongs. Why is it necessary to have a two days' Debate? I am sure the secret Debate will disclose no reason for giving two whole days on this matter in secret, but if the Government insist on having two days in Secret Session, of course they must have it. I respectfully submit, however, that in that case we must insist on having a public Debate upon the implications of these transfers before the transfers are made, otherwise we shall not be able to hold the resentment of our people within reasonable bounds.</p>

<p>It is obviously impossible to discuss now, in open House, the Government's reasons for holding a Secret Session, but I would ask them to take cognisance of one fact. I think it is only courteous to warn the right hon. Gentleman and the supporters of the Government above the Gangway, that some of us, when we come to the appropriate Motion, will feel bound to raise the question of the reasons why it is necessary for the House to go into Secret Session.</p>

<p>Of course, hon. Members are fully entitled to do that. On the question of whether we are to have one day or two days' Debate, it was in order to meet the wishes of the House that the Government gave facilities for these two days. My right hon. Friend the Minister of Labour has a statement of very great importance to make, and it is my belief that the House will wish to Debate the matter for two days. If it appears that they do not wish to do so, that will be another situation. My only difference with the right hon. Gentleman opposite is on his description of yesterday's discussion as a "preliminary canter". I do not think so. I think a "parallel canter" might be a more correct definition. It may be that it will be necessary to have a further Debate, and, if so, the Minister of Production might speak in it at an early stage, but I think we should stand by the

programme to which we have already agreed.</p>

<p>I beg to move the Previous Question, "That that Question be not now put."<br/>
That is a somewhat old Motion, which is not, I believe, generally used in the House, but I understand, subject to your Ruling, Sir, that it is perfectly in Order on this occasion. I move it because, being an independent Member of the House, for many years unattached in any way to any party [<i>Interruption</i>]. May I ask for your protection, Sir? I have made a definite statement, which I can support by the fact that candidates from every party are regularly run against me at elections. Hon. Members might at any rate have the decency to withdraw lies of that sort.&#x2014;[<i>Interruption</i>]. Being an independent Member of Parliament of many years' standing and not connected in any way with any party&#x2014;I have to fight all parties in my constituency&#x2014;and not connected with any outside interest paying my expenses, it is incumbent upon me in a case of this sort to speak what appears to be the opinion of a very large section of the House, not of one party, but of all parties. The procedure in these appointments has always been as at present, but in the present instance a new factor comes in, and that is the composition of the Government, which is now a Coalition. It is an extraordinary thing that the majority party has no proper means of making its will felt <i>vis-&#x00E0;-vis</i> the Government. That is an unfortunate state of things and gives rise to a great


deal of trouble in the procedure of the House in such a case as we have before us.<br/>
We see in "The Times" this morning that it is proposed that a certain Member of this House shall be the Deputy Chairman of Committees. No sort of official intimation of any kind has been given to the various sections of Members of the House. The only means by which the majority of the House, that is, the Conservative Members, can now be properly approached is through the 1922 Committee, and I have ascertained, though the chairman is absent owing to ill-health, from leading members of that Committee that this name has never been submitted to them for their consideration or approval. I have also ascertained that another party in the House has never had the name submitted to it. Therefore, those who are responsible for putting forward the name have not had the ordinary courtesy to ascertain whether it is the name of a gentleman who is <i>persona grata</i> to the bulk of the House. That is a very important thing, because, as you, Sir, are only too well aware, it is essential that the occupant of the Chair should carry with him the good will and respect and, as has happened many times in the past, the affection of the bulk of the Members. It is not a question whether the fact of that gentleman being <i>persona grata</i> or the opposite can be attributed to any particular reason. There was a certain Dr. Fell, of whom it was written&#x2014;
<q>I do not like you, Dr. Fell,</q>
<q>The reason why, I cannot tell,</q>
<q>But this I know, and know full well,</q>
<q>I do not like you, Dr. Fell.</q>
Where a post of this sort has to be filled everyone, even those who do not agree with me on this point, will admit that the proceedings of this House, both in the House and in Committee, are very much conditioned by the personality of the occupant of the Chair, and it is very difficult for any man to occupy the Chair satisfactorily if there is a feeling in his own mind and in the minds of the House that he is not <i>persona grata</i>. I understand that the appointment of the Deputy Chairman is merely permissive. The House is under no obligation to appoint a Deputy Chairman at all, and it cannot be said that about three minutes' notice is enough. Therefore, I appeal to the Deputy Prime Minister to separate this Motion, or at any rate to withdraw it with a view to

separating it, and give the House some opportunity of understanding the position and privately expressing their opinion.<br/>
There has been a tendency which you, Sir, must have marked, as other Members have, to override the Privileges of the House. This seems to me a case where the House would be well advised, to use a vulgarism, to dig its toes in and show the Government that it is not the autocrat of this country but that the House of Commons must be consulted in these matters. Hence I do not see any reason why the Deputy Prime Minister should not accept the previous Question. I have had considerable discussion with him for many weeks upon the point [HON. MEMBERS: "Oh&#x0021;"] No official communication has been sent me or anyone else except to the Labour Party, and the other parties have not been consulted, but it is one of the duties of Members of the House to find out what is being done. When it came to my knowledge that this proposal was going to be made, I took appropriate steps, in private, to see if I could avoid this difficulty from coming before the House. I was disappointed. I did not effect my object, and the result is that I am obliged to bring forward this Motion, so that the question of these appointments shall be deferred until the House has had an opportunity of considering the matter and until there has been an opportunity of consulting the party which is in the majority.<br/>
We know perfectly well what is happening and that this is part of what is called the "spoils system." There is public money going, and the system, as in all Coalitions, is that first one party has its hands in the till and then another. It is bringing Parliament into contempt and will bring it more and more into contempt if the country sees this bargaining between side and side as to who shall get the jobs. If this is allowed to go through, the whole status of Parliament will be irretrievably lowered, and the enemies of this Constitution, whether of the extreme right or the extreme left, would rejoice to see Parliament giving up its Privileges and being lowered in the estimation of the people of the country.</p>

<p>The hon. and gallant Member is now raising a point which is an ancient constitutional point in this House. It is perfectly true that these offices in the House of Commons are held at the will and with the approval of the House, but it does fall to His Majesty's Government for the time being to initiate the discussion by bringing forward a proposed appointment, because such emoluments as there are fall upon public funds. But that is not the point. Had the hon. Member who has apparently been forcing his attentions upon the Deputy Prime Minister for some time been anxious about procedure in the method of appointment of the Chairman and the Deputy-Chairman of Ways and Means, he might have raised that point; but he does not raise that point; he raises a personal point. He does not object, nor do I, to my right

hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Hexham (Colonel Clifton Brown), who, I think, will fill the Chair with conspicuous success and with fairness to all quarters of the House.<br/>
The hon. Member goes out of his way to single out one appointment. On what grounds? Is it on grounds of public service? My hon. and gallant Friend the Member for South-East Leeds (Major Milner) has a career of public service as good as the hon. Member's. He is a man with, I suppose, 13 or 14 years' service in the House, and for seven years, I think the Deputy Prime Minister said, he has been a Temporary Chairman and has also served on Committees. He has also had a long experience of local government. What is the argument against him? The argument is that the hon. Member for Mossley (Mr. Hopkinson) does not like him. If all appointments were to be judged by personal likes and dislikes, many of us would never attain any eminence. There can be only one other reason for an Amendment of this kind&#x2014;a deferment&#x2014;which I say is a slur upon the honour of my hon. and gallant Friend. The hon. Member is not playing fair over this thing. Some years ago the hon. Member, rising in his place as an Independent, said he had looked into the faces of members of the Labour Party and added, with a bitterness that I could not possibly emulate, "and I do not like them." There we have the whole reason.</p>

If a man can serve in this House as my hon. and gallant Friend has served&#x2014;and served his country also&#x2014;for a period of years to the satisfaction of the House, however much independent individuals may dislike him, then I should have thought that the Government might be supported in the proposal which has been put forward, and I appeal to the House and its sense of honour, fairness and decency not to accept the previous Question.</p>

<p>I beg to suggest that a certain amount of unnecessary heat has been generated on what is after all a House of Commons matter, concerning the smooth working of the machinery of the House. I regret that my hon. Friend the Member for Mossley (Mr. Hopkinson) showed so much heat and personal antipathy in his speech. As far as I am concerned, I feel that this appointment has been rushed. The first intimation I had of the resignation of my right hon. Friend the Member for Watford (Sir Dennis Herbert) from the position of Chairman of Ways and Means was at about quarter past 11 yesterday morning. It may be that the Government were not advised in the Recess that the right hon. Gentleman had decided to relinquish his appointment. At any rate, I do think that in this purely House of Commons matter, in which the House of Commons should have a say and has always had some say in the selection, the House should have had time to think who should occupy this very important post.

My view, for what it is worth, is that with the composition of this House of Commons it is a good idea to divide these posts between two parties; one should be in the hands of the Conservative Party and one should be in the hands of the Labour Party. So far as I am concerned, I have found both these gentlemen efficient and impartial in the Chair, and I would be quite willing to sit under their Chairmanship when we go into Committee, but I think it would have been advisable, and it might have terminated a good deal of this discussion, if we had had a few days to think over this matter, if the Government had advised my friends below the Gangway, my friends opposite, and even a few of the Independent Members, and so prevented a good deal of waste of time.</p>

<p>The Government have not departed from precedent in any way in this matter. These appointments are always made on the nomination of the Government. When new Governments are formed, one of the first things, when the House meets, when the Sessional Orders have been arranged, is the appointment of a Chairman of Ways and Means and a Deputy-Chairman.</p>

<p>There have been occasions when Governments have been in a minority in this House. I was in two of them myself. As a matter of fact, in 1924 I think the Chairman of Ways and Means was a member of the Labour Parry, and the Deputy-Chairman was taken from another party, I think the Liberal benches. I always thought it was a good plan myself that there should be variation. That does not alter the fact


that these are Motions without notice and have generally been made immediately on the relinquishment of the office, and it has not been the custom in the past that these names should be submitted to party meetings. I have had it notified to me that it was the intention of the Government to propose Mr. So-and-so, just before the Motion was made, on a number of occasions, but I assure the House there is no question of rushing the matter, and I think we should try to live up to the traditions of the House. I was very sorry that the hon. Member should have suggested that this was something of an elaborate bargaining, and a subject for spoils. I do not know why it should be when a Labour Member is appointed.<br/>
I quite agree that a Coalition is in a different position, but this is not the first time that there has been a Government composed of more than one party, and certainly there have been occasions on which Government nominations have been made when the Government have been in a minority in the House. But this is the first occasion on which I have known objection taken on these lines. The objection taken is on some grounds of personal dislike. [HON. MEMBERS: "No."] The hon. and gallant Member has served now in the Chair as a Temporary Chairman of Committees and on the Chairman's Panel for seven years. I have not heard any complaint. He has been a member of various Committees. I think it is extremely regrettable that this line should have been taken, and I think the House would do much better to accept this Motion. I do not think it is right that there should be a lot of trouble over a matter like this, or a wrangle in war-time. I think that is far more likely to do harm to the House than anything else.</p>

<p>I have no complaint whatever to make as regards either of the names submitted. Indeed, I think that in common with most Members of this House my view would be that the services in the Chair of the hon. and gallant Member for South-East Leeds (Major Milner) have met with universal approval. What I do complain about is that this essentially House of Commons matter should have been put suddenly before the House without the House of Commons as a whole having an

opportunity to consider the names which were to be submitted to them. It is most unfortunate that this Debate should have taken place, and it will not help either of the hon. and gallant Members when they come to fulfil their task in the Chair. It seems to me quite essential that whoever occupies that Chair should be <i>persona grata</i> with everybody in the House, and that therefore the Members of the House of Commons should be consulted by the Government in any way that is possible before a name is finally submitted to them. I must say that I think that had soundings been taken relative to the proposals which the Government were going to put forward, we should not have had this Debate. It is a House of Commons appointment, not a Government appointment. The House is selecting someone to sit in the Chair and rule over it during its Debates. There is no question of personalities, and personalities would not have come into it had some consideration been shown by the Government to all parties in the House before they brought the matter forward.</p>

<p>I feel great disagreement with most of my hon. Friends opposite. Perhaps my hon. and gallant Friend would interrupt me and tell me on what occasion in the last 100 years there has been any consultation by any Government with their supporters or with anyone else as to who should be appointed Deputy-Speaker or nominated Deputy-Chairman of Committees. The whole thing has got into a completely false atmosphere. The hon. Member below the Gangway has made a speech which I can only describe as malicious. He boasted, as he constantly does, to the boredom of the House, that he is the one Member in the House who is independent and expresses independent views. On this occassion we are adopting the same course that the House has always adopted.</p>

<p>I think the House will at least acquit me of having any very strong partisan views on matters of this sort. I have on a number of occasions tried to assert the rights of the House against the Executive, but I am bound to say that hon. Members' arguments to-day leave me dumbfounded. What is suggested&#x2014;that the Government make nominations, that


names should be hawked round for days and weeks beforehand, upstairs in committees, either in our committee upstairs or the Conservative committee upstairs, so that when the nomination is made it will be made in the most unpleasant circumstances possible. The House is being consulted at the present time. The House does not exist upstairs in private committee. The House exists here. This is the only place where the House should be consulted, and the Motion before the House is a form of consulting the House itself. Any bargaining behind closed doors and secret meetings upstairs are no substitution for the consultation of the House. I suggest that a great deal of unnecessary prejudice has been imported into this matter, and I hope hon. Members will not pursue it any further.</p>

<p>I want to make it clear at the outset that I have no objection whatever to either of the two hon. and gallant Members who have been nominated to fill these offices. My objection is as to the method in which it has been done, as, differing from Crown appointments, these are House of Commons appointments. I feel that in future the procedure ought to be&#x2014;and I say it with all respect to the traditions of this House&#x2014;that the Patronage Secretary and two or three colleagues in a Coalition Government should put down, some days in advance, a Motion on the Order Paper of the House of Commons. If any groups of hon. Members or parties in the House wish to discuss the matter, they can do so in their private meetings, and if any of the persons so nominated are likely to be <i>persona non grata</i> to strong bodies of opinion, then, of course, the usual representations could be made through the usual channels. I believe that if this suggestion were adopted in future, it would entirely remove the objection to the procedure in respect of the persons whose nominations have been brought forward to-day.</p>

<p>It is the Back Bench Members who are interested in this matter. The hon. Member for Mossley (Mr. Hopkinson) undoubtedly stressed the opinion that he was independent, and straight away he said, "In the absence of the Chairman of the 1922 Committee, I wish to place the views

of that Committee"&#x2014;or words to that effect&#x2014;"before the House." Then he proceeded to say, knowing, as we all do, that he is the recipient and receiver of more gossip in the smoking room than there is at our ladies' sewing-party at my chapel, or to give the impression, that he was also spokesman for a select coterie of hon. Members who sit below the Gangway. I repudiate utterly that he is the custodian of the interests of the Labour Party, and, I deny that the hon. Member for Mossley has the right to speak on behalf of the 1922 Committee. The Deputy-Prime Minister has very properly reminded us that this House elected as Deputy-Chairman a former Member for South-West Hull, who was in opposition to the then party which is now in control of the Government. On previous occasions nominations have been made, and I well remember&#x2014;though I was not a Member of the House, being too young&#x2014;that Mr. Speaker Gully was elected Speaker of this House and that he was appointed actually with the consent of the Irish Nationalist Party, who were then in a position to give their vote and bring any party into the majority. The hon. Member for Mossley, the independent Member for Mossley, who is <i>persona grata</i> with all the Primrose dames in his constituency, comes down here, stresses his independence and that he is an incorruptible Robespierre, to speak to this House, and then he gives the show away by saying, "I object to any of the spoils being given to any one section of the House."<br/>
If there ever was a case where the Chairman or Deputy-Chairman earns whatever salary he receives, these two hon. Gentlemen, honourable in every sense of the word, earn every penny, and I wish we could give it to them tax free. I rise as one of the back bench Members who saw in the Press, at least three days before Christmas, that the right hon. and very highly respected Member for Watford (Sir D. Herbert) was laying down his office. We learned that fact. We are not going to take on the sins of "The Times" because they put a certain statement in their rag this morning, but even back bench Members have known that certain appointments were going to be made. I hope that we in this honourable House will, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Horsham (Earl Winterton) has put it, be true to our traditions and to the men who are


going to sit in that Chair when we discuss the grievances of our constituents and try to remedy them, and that we shall repudiate the Amendment standing in the name of the very independent Member for Mossley.</p>

<p>I wonder whether I might address a few observations to the House on this subject and then make an appeal to them. There has obviously been some quite genuine misunderstanding about precedents in this matter. My noble Friend the Member for Horsham and Worthing (Earl Winterton) is quite right. I have looked them up carefully, and there is absolutely no precedent for notice being given, or consultation, beforehand. I fully understood my hon. Friend's reason, but it has never, in fact, been done. On every occasion in the last century a Motion has been put down by the Government, and all the precedents I can find&#x2014;I speak subject to correction&#x2014;are that on the day when the Chairman of Ways and Means resigns or retires a new Chairman and Deputy-Chairman are appointed on that day. As a matter of fact, it was owing to the advice I gave to the Prime Minister that we did not take both things yesterday. I suggested that it would be better to have the resignation one day and appointments the next. I think that is the first time that even that has been done. I wanted to make that plain to the House, because quite obviously there has been some misunderstanding.</p>

<p>When my right hon. Friend says there is no official notice given, I know for an actual fact, from my own experience, that on every similar occasion the whole thing has been unofficially discussed and the powers that be have obtained the opinion of the House as far as they could before bringing their selection forward. As a matter of fact, the Deputy-Prime Minister told me in conversation that this particular selection had the unanmious support of the Labour Party.</p>

<p>That is exactly the position. I have been into this with great care. That is the procedure which has always been followed. Almost always appointments have been made on the first day of Parliament, so that consultations would not have been possible. Those are the precedents, and we have followed them absolutely. I do not regard ourselves as being guilty in any way or of being discourteous to the House in a matter of this kind.
