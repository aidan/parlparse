<p>The acceptance by His Majesty's Government of this generous gift will not prejudice the funds

available to the Government of Northern Rhodesia for the development of social services. In this connection I would invite my hon. Friend's attention to the reply which I gave to his Question of 11th December, 1940, in which it was stated that it had been decided to proceed in 1941 with the full programme envisaged under the five-year plan. Progress is, however, dependent not so much upon the availability of funds as upon the supply of personnel and materials. I may add that, in addition to making full provision for the five-year plan, it is estimated that by the end of the year the territory's surplus assets and the reserve fund will amount to nearly &#x00A3;1,600,000.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1941-06-25a.1024.1" colnum="1024" time="">
<p>In November last the Government Protector of Chinese noticed signs of discontent among the Chinese labourers on this estate and notified the manager who, on 21st December, of his own initiative offered an increase of 2 cents on daily task rates plus a bonus on poundage with effect from 16th December. The labourers refused this offer and at their request the Protector of Chinese met their representatives on the estate when they demanded an immediate increase of 35 cents on daily task rates, viz., from 85 cents to 1 dollar 30 cents. In discussion they reduced the demand to 1 dollar 10 cents, but threatened to cease work if this was not granted. The manager considered the request unreasonable and the strike began on 23rd December. On 27th December the strikers at a further discussion refused the appeal of the Protector of Chinese to return to work pending proper discussion of wages, but it was eventually agreed that they should take their wages and leave the estate. They accordingly went on 29th December to a nearby village where some 900 established an organised camp. Intimidation had been practised to compel workers to join the exodus from the estate, and in the camp a Defence Corps was organized, while goods were levied from shops and subscriptions collected in the village. Workers were not allowed to leave the village without permission and men on bicycles were sent into the district, threatening physical violence to labourers continuing at work.</p>

<p>It was discovered that two of the leaders were agents of a local union which had been organized by the Malayan Communist party, and that they were being assisted by adherents of the Chinese puppet government at Nanking. On 31st December the police arrested one of these leaders and one member of the Defence Corps, but were attacked on the way to the police station by 500 Chinese armed with sticks, bricks, stones and bottles. The officer in charge of the police was himself knocked down and again hit as he was getting up. After repeated attempts to persuade the rioters to disperse and an ineffective charge by the police, the order was given to fire, one Chinese being killed and two subse-


quently dying of their wounds. At the time of the firing the rioters had increased to probably 1,500, and the police numbered 85, not all of whom were armed. The finding of the magistrate was that the police were overwhelmed to such an extent that the action they took was necessary. My hon. Friend will appreciate that the riot was thus caused not by the refusal of the rubber company to increase wages, but by an attempt to rescue an arrested political agitator. On the evening of the riot at least 400 of the labourers returned to work, and by 2nd January practically all the labourers concerned had also returned. The High Commissioner has reported the average daily earnings in this district to be more than double those at the beginning of the war and the increase in the cost of living to be less than 50 per cent.</p>

<p>This matter once formed a subject of Debate, when it was explained that the facts about which these people are asked to make inquiries by other Departments, such as the Ministry of Food and the Board of Trade, can be ascertained only by expert and immediate inquiry.

The facts relate to such matters as food restrictions and their working in certain districts about which the Food Ministry want expert advice.

<p>Mental health work among children is a normal development of the mental health services and in particular of the school medical service with which child guidance clinics are associated in many areas. A number of hostels have been established for difficult children in reception areas, and it is desirable that in every Region some of these hostels should be earmarked for children requiring mental treatment and should be associated where practicable with child guidance clinics. A grant from Exchequer funds was made to the Mental Health Emergency Committee in respect of the year ended 31st March last, and application for a further grant is now under consideration.</p>

<p>I have been asked to reply. The subsidy of &#x00A3;60,000 per annum payable to this company under the contract of 31st December, 1938, was not related to particular services but was in respect of the general services scheduled to the contract as a whole, and it is therefore not possible to state how much has been paid in successive years in respect of the Western Isles Steamer Service, or to give the amounts for different purposes separately. The outbreak of war led to very considerable increases in the costs of running and to decreases in receipts, with the result that it became necesary to introduce new arrangements which will be expressed in annual contracts.

<p>The Question refers to an account, published in a Communist circular, of a speech by the hon. Member for Shettleston (Mr. McGovern), relating to conversations with Lord Beaverbrook. Lord Beaverbrook received in February, 1940, from the hon. Member for Shettleston for exclusive publication in his newspapers an account of the so-called Tavistock Peace Plan. A conversation followed on 5th March, 1940'. The hon. Member for Shettleston invited Lord Beaverbrook to support the Plan. A written statement seeking support and signed by Lord Tavistock was submitted on 6th March. Lord Beaverbrook replied on 8th March, 1940, as follows:
<q>DEAR LORD TAVISTOCK.</q>
<q>Very many thanks for your letter.</q>
<q>I have never felt any anxiety in regard to the wisdom and the certainty of continuing the war.</q>
<q>I am a supporter of Mr. Chamberlain, and I believe in his war policy. If Peace becomes a possibility, I feel sure he will do everything m his power to promote it.</q>
<q>At the same time I-am much obliged to you for writing me about your negotiations.</q>

<q><q>We understand that the above Order, having with certain modifications been approved by the Commission of Inquiry to which it was recently submitted, is now to be laid before Parliament as a confirmation Bill. The Highland Development League, which for years past has been actively concerned with measures for the improvement of living conditions in the Scottish Highlands, was, in common with many others who have the interest. of the Highlanders at heart, strongly opposed to this Measure. Ever since the publication of the draft Order last August, the Council of our League have examined it from time to time with great care and have been greatly perturbed, not only by the un-timeliness of its introduction, when most of


[The Chairman of Ways and Means.] the Highland men whose future is affected are absent from their homes on military service"&#x2014;</q>
and then come the important words:
<q> not only by the seeming irregularities in the procedure by which it has been advanced to its present Parliamentary stage, but most of all by the prejudicial effect which it will have on the future development of the Highlands. In support of our views on that point we send you the accompanying pamphlet and respectfully ask you to give careful attention to its contents.</q>
<q>Your obedient Servants, On behalf of the Highlands Development League, </q>
<q>LACHLAN GRANT, President.</q>
<q>T. M. MURCHISON, Vice-President.</q>
<q>DONALD MACKAY, Clerk and Treasurer</q>
When I read that, my mind at once turned to the expression:
<q>seeming irregularities in the procedure by which it has been advanced to its present Parliamentary stage</q>
It seemed to me probable, and it has since turned out that I was right, that these alleged '' seeming irregularities '' had reference to the conduct of the Lord Chairman in another place and the Chairman of Ways and Means of the House of Commons in referring this Order to a Scottish Commission under the Private Legislation (Scotland) Act, 1936, and also to the conduct of the two Members of the House of Commons who were two of the Commissioners who conducted this inquiry. But as I felt that there was a possibility that I might be mistaken, I thought the proper course was to write a letter, which I did in identical terms to all three signatories of that letter. I wrote them that my attention had just been called to their communication and wrote
<q>in view of those words, and in view of the apparently improper allegation contained in those words, I have to ask you before I take any other steps to write to me explaining what is intended by those words ' seeming irregularities in the procedure ' and making any further observations you may desire thereon</q>
To that I received a very long reply, which I do not think the House will want me to read, but I must read just a short part of it and tell the House the gist of the letter.
<q>We are favoured with your letter of the nth inst. addressed to each of us in identical terms, in which you refer to words used in the League's letter of 20th May to all Members of Parliament, in particular to the words ' not only by the seeming irregularities in the procedure by which it has been advanced to its present parliamentary stage.' We would respectfully assure you, Sir, that no improper

allegation is intended or contained in those words, and if the phrase in question seems to you to carry such implication, we much regret it and beg to tender our apologies</q>
If the letter had stopped there, I think&#x2014; I may have been wrong&#x2014;that I should not have troubled the House on the matter at all; but, unfortunately, the letter proceeds at very considerable length to explain that what was intended was what I had supposed, a certain reflection upon the conduct of the Lord Chairman and the Chairman of Ways and Means, and upon the conduct of the Members of the Commission, two of whom are Members of this House. They not only repeat these allegations, or rather set them out in detail, but they justify them, or attempt to justify them, and beyond that I need not perhaps make any further reference to that letter.</q>

<p>I think that is probably, if I may suggest it, a matter which, if Mr. Speaker gives the decision which I invited him to do, will be for the consideration by the Committee of Privileges. I may say that, in the first place, they misquote or incorrectly quote the Scottish Procedure Act referred to and they also show a certain ignorance in regard to other matters of law to which they refer. As I have said, this undoubtedly is a case of making somewhat serious and definite reflections upon the conduct of the Lord Chairman, who is in another place, and with whom, of course, we are not concerned, upon the Chairman of Ways and Means, as an officer of this House, and on Members of this House, sitting as Members of the Scottish Commission.<br/>
I do not place importance in this case upon the gravity, or otherwise, or, may I say, the degree of turpitude of this offence, if an offence has been committed, but the case is of very great importance as a matter of principle for this reason: This Scottish private legislation procedure is a comparatively modern innovation, and I believe this is the first time on which any question has ever arisen of reflections of this kind being made on Members of this House sitting as Members on one of these Scottish Commissions; and the House will realise at once that it would be very difficult to expect hon. Members of this House


to undertake the very responsible, and often very laborious, duties of sitting on Commissions of this kind unless they feel that they have the protection which the House always accords to its Members in the discharge of their duties. Therefore, it does appear to me that it is, as I say, a case of very great importance, which should be referred to the Committee of Privileges, in order, as I hope, that the House may establish definitely that Members sitting on these Commissions are entitled to the same protection as is given to them in other cases when carrying out their duties as Members of Parliament. I think I need add nothing more, and if you decide, Mr. Speaker, that there is a <i>prima facie</i> case, then, I will merely move the formal Motion that the matter be referred to the Committee of Privileges.</p>

<p>On a point of Order. I understand it is the contention that a <i>prima facie</i> case has been made out of a breach of Privilege. It is necessary, in my submission, before you, Mr. Speaker, give your Ruling, that the grounds upon which that is based shall be stated to the House. The only thing so far in support of what has been said has been the reading of a statement, subsequently withdrawn and apologised for. Then the Chairman of Ways and Means has directed our attention to a statement which he has not placed before the House and which therefore cannot, in my respectful submission, be given a Ruling upon until the House itself has heard it.</p>

<p>I am perfectly prepared, though I should be sorry to have to do it, to read the whole of the second letter to which I referred, but I venture most respectfully to submit to the House that, with the explanation which I have given, it is sufficient that I have read the original offending document, if I may so call it, which contains words calculated to cast reflections upon an officer and Members of this House in the performance of their Parliamentary duties, and I take the longer letter as merely amplifying the original document and giving the case of those who, if this matter goes before the Committee of Privileges, will be called upon by that Committee to justify their action.</p>

<p>Further to that point of Order. I do not want to appear to be pedantic, but it would be an extraordinary piece of Parliamentary proce-

dure if the House set up a Committee of Privileges on a matter because it is the opinion of the Chairman of Ways and Means that a breach of Privilege has in fact occurred. It is necessary for the charge to be made.</p>

<p>If I may be allowed to say so, the hon. Member is wrong. I have done nothing but submit to Mr. Speaker a question of whether there is a <i>prima facie</i> case, and I await his decision.</p>

<p>Is it not the case that the three individuals who have signed the letter have withdrawn the words of which the Chairman of Ways and Means properly complained, and consequently, having withdrawn those words, those words cannot be submitted to the Committee of Privileges? What the Chairman of Ways and Means has said is that they go on, in a subsequent letter in which they have withdrawn the words complained of, to add other words which he considers to be at least equally offensive as regards a breach of Privilege. But he has not placed those words before the House; he has not read those words which he complains are an added breach of Privilege. Consequently this House is being asked to submit to the Committee of Privileges something it has not yet heard which has been alleged to be a breach of Privilege. I put this point to the Chairman of Ways and Means. I am not discussing the Glen Affric Bill, but there is a great deal of very adverse criticism and a keen sense of uneasiness at the manner in which this Commission held its sittings. I am making no allegations against the Members of the Com mission, but the fact that its proceedings were held in secret, against most precedents &#x2014;</p>

<p>The question which I am asked to decide is whether a prima facie case has been made out that a breach of Privilege has been committed. This is a rather difficult and complicated case, but, undoubtedly, a matter of principle is involved. Members of this House have to carry out their duties, very often in difficult circumstances and on very controversial questions, and it would not be right if we took no notice whatever, when Members are persecuted by outsiders, no matter how interested those outsiders may be in the business affected. On that matter of principle, I think it only right that the House should order an inquiry. As I say, I think that Members are undoubtedly entitled to protection in the discharge of their duties. In this case, I consider that a prima facie case has been made out that a breach of Privilege has been committed.</p>
