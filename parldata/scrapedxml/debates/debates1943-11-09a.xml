<p>asked the Secretary of State for Scotland whether his Department is taking any action to have full-time education provided for the 10,787 children in Scotland who are receiving only part-time education?</p>

<p>The answer is in the affirmative. There was a decrease of 3,875 in the figures during the quarter ending September, 1943. Constant efforts are

being made to secure the release of schools whose occupation is causing half-time instruction, and alternative accommodation is being provided in certain cases where the prospect of release is remote.</p>

<p>Does not my right hon. Friend think that more pressure ought to be put upon these bodies to vacate schools so that children can receive full-time education? These children are suffering serious handicaps. Some buildings are being used for Home Guard training, and does not my right hon. Friend think that it is more important that children should be educated than that their grandfathers should become Boy Scouts?</p>

<p>I can assure my hon. Friend that constant and unremitting pressure is being put upon the authorities who are in occupancy of these schools, in the interests of the education of children. If my hon. Friend has any particular case in mind where she thinks we might assist her further, then I should be greatly obliged to hear of it.</p>

<p>asked the Secretary of State for Scotland what machinery is at his disposal to estimate the number of individual lets of furnished apartments and the number of lessee families involved in Scotland as a whole or in any particular area; whether he can state these numbers now; when such figures became available; what steps he proposes to take to keep check of any increase or decrease in the number of such lets in the future; and whether he will furnish an annual return to Parliament indicating any change which has taken place in this respect?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1943-11-09a.1058.6" speakerid="unknown" speakername="Mr. Johnston" colnum="1058" time="">
<p>No machinery is available for making estimates of the number of individual lets of furnished apartments, either in Scotland as a whole or in any particular area. The provision of an annual return to Parliament would involve a disproportionate amount of labour for already overburdened local authority staffs.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1943-11-09a.1059.0" speakerid="unknown" speakername="Mr. Stewart" colnum="1059" time="">
<p>In view of the great possibility of new rent courts being set up, which will cause hundreds if not thousands of owners of property to cease letting furnished premises, is it not vital in the interests of thousands of families that the Minister should take note of what is happening?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1943-11-09a.1059.1" speakerid="unknown" speakername="Mr. Johnston" colnum="1059" time="">

<p>I am aware that the accommodation in the camps is not being fully used. There appears to be a reluctance among parents to send their children away from home in present circumstances. I have already arranged to extend the use of some of the camps to include the reception of convalescent children for short periods, and I am considering what other arrangements can be made for using the vacant accommodation.</p>

<p>Would my right hon. Friend have a further look at this, because the reason children are not going is that there are no amenities in the camps? No advantage is being taken of the countryside. There is also the problem of dual management. Would he consider using this unique opportunity to get residential education for normal children in Scotland, as there is none at the present moment?</p>

<p>There are 57 Young Farmers' Clubs in Scotland, of which 34 are active, the remainder having suspended their activities during the war. There are no clubs attached to schools although in some cases headmasters have interested themselves in the welfare of Clubs. State grants of &#x00A3;250 per annum for the four years 1938&#x2013;1941, &#x00A3;200 for 1942, and &#x00A3;175 for 1943 have been paid to the Scottish Association of Young Farmers' Clubs.

G. had an office in Manchester; and whether he can make a full statement on this giving the names of persons involved and who made the arrangements?</p>

<p>As I have already said in reply to previous Questions, under the Trading with the Enemy Act, all relations between United Kingdom and enemy firms have been prohibited since the outbreak of war, and any agreements in existence between them have been legally frustrated. Similar legislation is in force throughout the British Empire. In addition, I. G. Farben companies carrying on business in neutral countries, including the American firm to which my hon. Friend refers, were, early in the war, specified in the black list of enemies published by my Department. I. G. Dyestuffs Ltd., Manchester, were inspected by order of the Board of Trade under Section 3 of the Trading with the Enemy Act in October, 1939. The Directors were Messrs. A. H. George, Frederick Taylor and John Dalby, all British subjects, and Mr. H. G. Kohler, a German, who resigned shortly before the outbreak of war. As there was reason to believe that the majority of the ordinary shares, held in the name of a Dutch company, were held on behalf of I. G. Farben, these shares were vested in the Custodian of Enemy Property. Imports from Germany having been cut off at the outbreak of war, I. G. Dyestuffs Ltd. went into liquidation.</p>

<p>Yes, but the difficulty is to get an Order which is both fair and enforceable.

<p>As I informed my hon. Friend the Member for The High Peak Division (Mr. Molson) on 26th October, the total amount levied on the occupied countries in Europe by the Axis Governments up to 30th September, 1943, whether by occupation costs or other charges is estimated at over &#x00A3;3,200,000,000. The amounts levied by Axis countries other than Germany have been comparatively small, and are almost certainly less than &#x00A3;50,000,000. It follows that the German share has been approximately &#x00A3;3,150,000,000. As regards the second part of the Question, it is difficult to give a precise figure, since no recent information is available in respect of Greece. My Department estimates, however, that the approximate annual sum which Germany is at present collecting from all the occupied countries is in the neighbourhood of &#x00A3;1,300,000,000. If account is taken of balance of exports received by Germany and paid for only in blocked marks, the approximate figure is &#x00A3;1,700,000,000.</p>

<p>Hitherto soldiers whose wives are in receipt of family allowance have been required to report the cessation of normal domestic relations and family allowance has been withdrawn, subject to continuance for a limited period, in suitable cases, during which the Army welfare officers endeavour to effect reconciliation. In future there will be no requirement to report the estrangement and family allowance will continue in issue to a separated (but not divorced) wife and her family provided that the soldier continues the normal qualifying allotment from his pay, that he is not under compulsion to provide for his family's maintenance by a court order, an order under Section 145 (2, <i>b</i>)

of the Army Act or a deed of separation, and that he is making no claim to dependant's allowance in addition. In cases where there is such a court order, etc., the payment, including the contribution by the soldier of a sum equal to qualifying allotment, may not exceed the amount of such order.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1943-11-09a.1072.0" colnum="1072" time="">
<p>Where separation exists already, whether pre- or post-enlistment, the issue of family allowance will be governed by a condition that the man has contributed to the maintenance of his family according to his means and will generally in pre-enlistment cases not exceed the amount of such maintenance. It is considered that when the obligation of a husband to maintain his wife has been allowed to lapse entirely the wife, if she so desires, can seek her remedy in the courts, or by appeal under Section 145 (2, <i>b</i>) of the Army Act, without undue hardship.</p>

<p>The Army procedure of attempting to secure reconciliation, which I am satisfied is in the public interest, will, except in obviously unsuitable cases, continue where normal relations cease and the soldier is not disposed voluntarily to contribute the qualifying allotment which enables family allowance to remain in issue. Further consideration is being given to measures to brdge the gap which occurs, where reconciliation fails, between the cessation of family allowance and the date on which the wife can obtain an order from the court or under the Army Act. There are substantial legal and other difficulties to be overcome, and I am not yet able to state a solution of this difficulty. The decision I have just announced will, it is anticipated, reduce the number of cases in which a gap occurs, while the system in force enabling the officer deputed under Section 145 (2, <i>b</i>) of the Army Act to make interim orders against soldiers on <i>prima facie</i> evidence already substantially reduces this gap in many of the cases where it still arises.</p>

<p>On the average, less than two months now elapses between the date of visit and the receipt by the War Office of a full report from the Protecting Power.

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1943-11-09a.1091.9" speakerid="unknown" speakername="The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Food (Mr. Mahane)" colnum="1091" time="">
<p>A White Paper has been issued to-day explaining

the Regulations which have been made to enable my Noble Friend to protect the consumer against false and misleading claims regarding the quality of foodstuffs. A part of the problem was dealt with by the Food Substitutes Order, which, in 1941, restricted the manufacture or sale of food substitutes. But it is not possible under that Order to take action in respect of products which are not food substitutes, and there has so far been no power to prevent exaggerated claims being made for products which, though harmless, have low nutritional value and which carry labels grossly misrepresenting the nature of the product. His Majesty's Government are of opinion that the consumer is entitled to protection against such misleading claims. With the reduction in the quantity and variety of food supplies available, it is necessary to provide this protection, especially in the case of products intended for mothers, children and adolescents. The powers which the new Regulations confer, with a single exception to which I will refer later, go no further than the powers which Parliament contemplated should be exercised under certain sections of the Food and Drugs Act, 1938, and the Sale of Food (Weights and Measures) Act, 1926.<br/>
Section 6 of the Food and Drugs Act forbids the advertising or labelling of food in a false or misleading way and the provisions of this Section are reproduced in substantially identical terms in Regulation 1. Similarly, Regulation 2 transfers to my Noble Friend the power at present exercised by the Minister of Health under Section 8 of the Food and Drugs Act to stipulate the manner in which various foods are to be labelled and to regulate the composition of any food. It also transfers to my Noble Friend the power of the Board of Trade under Section 9 of the Sale of Food (Weights and Measures) Act, 1926, to require any pre-packed food to be labelled with an indication of its weight or measure. The only additional power conferred by these Regulations, not previously approved by the House is included in Regulation 2. This gives power to restrict
<q>the making in advertisements of food of claims or suggestions of the presence in the food of vitamins or minerals.</q>
As the House is aware, the Government have during the war given continuous attention to nutrition. It is unfortunate


that some&#x2014;a small minority&#x2014;of manufacturers should have been tempted to exploit the national nutritional policy. Reputable food manufacturers, no less than scientists and members of the medical profession, recognise the harm that is being done by misleading advertisements of this nature and it is with the object of bringing them to an end that the new powers have been taken by Order in Council. The enforcement of any specific Orders which may be issued under these powers will be entrusted to local authorities, but they will be required, unless it is otherwise provided in the Orders my Noble Friend will make, to obtain his consent before proceedings are taken. The main purpose of this provision will be to ensure that proceedings are taken against the manufacturer who is responsible for the false description and not against a large number of retailers through whom the product reaches the public.</p>

<p>In view of the hon. Gentleman's statement that the responsibility for prosecution will largely rest with local authorities, and the fact that most of the people responsible&#x2014;the manufacturers of these spurious goods&#x2014;may be, perhaps, hundreds of miles away from the locality where the offence is discovered&#x2014;[An HON. MEMBER: "Or members of the council."]&#x2014;how does the hon. Gentleman propose to see that the matter is worked satisfactorily, and the local authority placed in a position to take proceedings against firms which may be situated many miles away from their area?</p>

local authority or the Department to undertake prosecutions.</p>

<p>Will the hon. Gentleman clear up a point which seems a little indistinct? The offence will be discovered in the area of the local authority where the food is sold.
