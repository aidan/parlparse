<p>Is the Minister aware that I have recently had the case of a young soldier who was killed in a motor cycle accident within 50 miles of Birmingham and it took more than two months for the boy's effects to be returned, which opened up an old sore for his parents? I have known cases in the past in which it has taken four, five or six months for effects to be returned from abroad. Surely the right hon. Gentleman can hurry up the process of returning effects to parents and relatives, because it causes distress and grief if there are long delays.</p>

<p>The matters are dealt with by this Section of the Act, and it is this Section on which we will rely and on which the large circuits have approached us. For the reasons I have given, there is no change in policy between what was announced by the right hon. Gentleman

<p>Does not the hon. and learned Gentleman agree that it is scandalous, because more and more of these independent cinemas may fall into this semi-monopolistic control, which debars independent producers from having guaranteed exhibition of the films they make? Since most are British quota films, is it not therefore a pro-American film policy, directed against the interests of British film producers?</p>

<p>No; on the contrary, what I have announced is likely to be in the interests of independent British producers, who require large circuits for their bookings. The hon.

In our view, the successful use of atomic energy to generate electrical power on a commercial basis is of crucial importance to the future of the national economy.<br/>
The Government also look forward to the time when the United Kingdom will be able to assist other countries not only, as now, with their research and development programmes and with training their scientists and engineers, but also be ex-porting nuclear power stations for the generation of electricity, especially in areas where generation by other means may be difficult or more expensive. Copies of the White Paper describing the provisional programme drawn up by the Government for the construction and development of nuclear power reactors over the next 10 years or so are available in the Vote Office.</p>

<p>Owing to the secrecy of much of the knowledge on which this programme is based, it was necessary for

the Government themselves to take the initiative in the matter, but they gave to the British Electricity Authority an opportunity of undertaking this programme as part of its normal activities, and I am very glad to say that it has accepted that opportunity and will do so. Therefore, we are confronted with a situation in which there will be the closest collaboration between the Atomic Energy Authority, which will be the expert body in nuclear factors in the stations, and the British Electricity Authority, which will under-take their ordering in the normal way. They will, of course, be built for the British Electricity Authority by the private enterprise companies which normally build the stations at the present time. I hope that we may look forward to a constructive period of co-operation between both public and private enterprise in this matter.</p>

<p>While congratulating my right hon. Friend on behalf of right hon. and hon. Members on this side of the House upon his extremely important statement and the bearing which it will have on our growing shortages of coal year by year, may I ask him if he will clarify two points? First, is it not a fact that no significant contribution to our coal shortages will be made by this programme of nuclear power stations until after 1960, and, second, on the 20-year basis which is generally envisaged for large-scale production of nuclear power, can he say what the resultant coal economy is estimated to be until 1975?</p>

<p>My hon. Friend is quite correct that in the early years we cannot expect a substantial contribution from nuclear power.. That is the period during which, as I have explained to the House on several occasions in fuel and power debates, we expect to get a considerable supplement to our coal resources from the use of oil in power stations which are now going ahead. This is a provisional programme, but at the end of 10 years, if all goes well, we should have 12 large nuclear power stations which should be saving coal to the tune of 5 million or 6 million tons a year. Looking ahead to the longer period, with all the reservations that are necessary and which are stated in the White Paper, the saving in 20 years' time may be in the order of 40 million tons of coal a year.</p>

<p>Can the right hon.

<p>For the first 10-year period the kilowatt output will be 1&#x00BD; million to 2 million kilowatts a year, and at the end of the second period, between 10 million and 15 million kilowatts a year. The right hon. Gentleman is quite correct in foreshadowing the kind of programme that it is. It is a programme in which one might broadly say that there are at least two different sets of stations. The earlier stations will be of a type similar perhaps to the improved Calder Hall type, and later on we will have a second series of stations. I would not like to commit myself to a technical description of these this afternoon, but they are described in some detail in the White Paper. The important difference between the two stations is this: that in the amazing technology of the nuclear age, the first series of power stations will be required to produce the special fuel which will be used in the second series of power stations.</p>

The other uses which are technically possible would not, I think, be immediately commercial.</p>

There can be no doubt that this programme will be a supplement to the mining industry, which will remain the great


fuel industry upon which, during our lives and our children's lives, our industry will depend.</p>

<p>I beg to move, That the Bill be now read a Second time.<br/>
This Bill falls into two main Parts. The purpose of Part I, the more substantial part, is to bring to an end within a measurable term of years requisitioning for housing purposes. Part II deals with the new arrangements which we propose to make to finance the cost of prefabricated temporary houses. In Clauses 16 and 17 there are also certain provisions for Scotland, and my right hon. and gallant Friend the Joint Undersecretary of State for Scotland will intervene in the course of the debate to deal with those.<br/>
It may be for the convenience of the House if I deal first with Part II of the Bill&#x2014;that is, the payments for temporary houses&#x2014;and then come back to our proposals with regard to requisitioned houses. In 1944, under the provisions of the Housing (Temporary Accommodation) Act, the Government made available 125,000 prefabricated temporary houses to the local authorities in England and Wales. It was provided that the capital issues to pay for.those houses in any one year should be repaid by 10 equal instalments of principal and interest at 2&#x00BD;per cent.<br/>
As it turned out, the cost was mainly incurred in three years. Thus, in 1945&#x2013;46, it amounted to &#x00A3;46 million; in 1946&#x2013;47, it was &#x00A3;88 million; and in 1947&#x2013;48 it was &#x00A3;57 million. Small issues for delayed payments to contractors and the cost of some replacements have continued to the current year. The effect of this financial arrangement has been to require annual repayments falling due rather like this: next financial year, &#x00A3;23,690,000; in 1956&#x2013;57, &#x00A3;18,300,000; and in 1957&#x2013;58, &#x00A3;8,190,000&#x2014;thereafter tailing off into small sums ten years hence.<br/>
I think it is clear that the great bulk of temporary housing will remain for longer than ten years. Many of these houses have proved fairly popular and have certainly proved durable, and a


great many of them will have to be used, not for ten but for twenty years or more. There is, therefore, a reasonable case for spreading the repayments over a longer period. This could have been done by extending each of the annuities by, say, five years, but that would not have been a very tidy arrangement.<br/>
What, in fact, has been done in Part II of the Bill is to consolidate all the annuities and to take a mean date for repayment. By this means the total sum outstanding, which is over &#x00A3;50 million, will be repaid in seven years by an annuity of &#x00A3;8 million. This means that the last charge will be in 1961&#x2013;62 and not in 1964&#x2013;65. In a word, one consolidated annuity replaces eleven or more.<br/>
I turn now to the first and principal Part of this Bill, in which we are seeking to make a fresh approach to this most difficult and persistent problem of requisitioned houses. As hon. Members know, this requisitioning under emergency powers has been part of our housing system since 1939. Originally, it was made necessary by the Second World War. Its perpetuation has been necessitated by post-war housing difficulties. At this distance from the end of the war, and in the light of current housing progress, the Government feel&#x2014;and, indeed, I think that this is not in dispute&#x2014;that the system cannot be allowed to continue indefinitely, to be a permanent element of our housing system.<br/>
The Government's object is thus simply stated but, because of the complexity of the problem, the methods of achieving it are not nearly so easy. The House will immediately appreciate that any solution has to reconcile two things. The first is justice for owners of requisitioned houses, and the second is the avoidance of hardship for those living in those houses now and protection of their future interests. In shaping the provisions of the Bill, which has not been easy, my right hon. Friend has had to keep both considerations in the forefront of his mind. I hope that I shall be able to convince the House that he has reconciled both the principles in Part I of the Bill.<br/>
Before I outline the Bill's provisions, it might assist hon. Members to get a rather clearer light on them if I say a few words about the background and the extent of this problem which is now confronting us. Defence Regulation 51 of 1939 was

designed to deal with families made homeless by enemy action; that is, by bombing or by evacuation. That was supplemented, first in 1943, when the powers were extended to cover the needs of inadequately housed families, and again in 1946, when local authorities were allowed to use all requisitioned properties as a pool of accommodation for this purpose.<br/>
At the end of the war 71,493 properties had been requisitioned. After that, 51,941 properties were added, although, I should mention, only 246 of those in the last four years. Since the end of the war 61,491 have been released. The figure that we are left with today&#x2014;that is, to the end of 1954&#x2014;is 62,000 holdings.</p>

<p>Could the hon. Gentleman tell us, approximately, the number of families involved?</p>

<p>I understand that 90,000 families are involved.<br/>
Even that figure&#x2014;and it has fallen by 20,000 in the last two years, from 82,000 to 62,000&#x2014;has not been achieved without great efforts and a large measure of co-operation by the local authorities concerned. This reduction of 20,000 in the last two years, I should add, is not really an accurate guide to the problem which now faces us. A high proportion of requisitioned property is now concentrated in the hands of fifty authorities. They are the hard core of the problem, and some of them face quite exceptional difficulties.<br/>
Out of these 62,000 houses, nearly 50,000 are in London. As, I think, all the London Members will know, the load bears heaviest on London, and that will not surprise anyone who knows what the war inflicted on London. We have recognised throughout that the problem of these London authorities is exceptional and deserving of special sympathy and every consideration, but it leads to this conclusion, that as things are, these authorities&#x2014;and there are one or two outside London&#x2014;can foresee no end to this problem for ten to fifteen years. Therefore, there is an overwhelming case for a fresh approach.</p>

<p>I refer to Greater London.<br/>
There is one other consideration which I should mention here. Since the inception of the system, the Government have paid the entire cost of this service. The gross cost this year was &#x00A3;15,679,000, the net cost, &#x00A3;6,290,000. In a state of emergency that is a perfectly right and proper thing, but in more normal times it is not a good principle that the Government should pay the whole of the cost of a service wholly administered by local authorities. There is no parallel in peacetime for that in the administrative field. In clearing up this situation it has seemed to us that a financial spur is indispensable, and so far it has not existed.<br/>
Now I turn to the Bill, and here I should like to say that my own task, and I think I can say the task of the House, too, has been greatly assisted because my right hon. Friend has been at pains to clothe the main provisions in the simplest style. Many people have a great deal at stake in this Bill, and as far as possible my right hon. Friend has tried to make sure that they should be able to see and understand what we are trying to do and how we intend to try to do it. For the benefit of the lawyers there is a long interpretation Clause in which the plain words of the Bill are translated into rather more complicated language. My right hon. Friend has tried to be of service both to the lawyers and to the laymen.<br/>
First, let me say one word on the future of requisitioning under emergency powers. The House will have already observed that under Clause 14 powers to requisition additional property for housing purposes are to be repealed forthwith. Last year no houses were requisitioned at all, and in 1953 only seven houses were requisitioned. Therefore, I think I may say that administratively that will not cause any particular difficulty.<br/>
Secondly, these 62,000 houses already held by the Government, and the responsibility for them, are transferred to local authorities under the terms of Clauses 1 and 2. Local authorities are given the.right to retain and use these properties for five years ending 31st March, 1960,

but no longer. The expense, as well as the properties, is being transferred to local authorities, and as the financial Clause, Clause 10, makes clear, towards this we shall pay 75 per cent, after 31st March, 1956. Until then we shall pay 100 per cent, of the cost, which, in effect, means that the present financial arrangement will continue for just over a year from now.<br/>
The House will have observed that this and other financial arrangements are based on the present housing ratio of three to one&#x2014;that is to say, three parts by the Exchequer and one part by the local authority. As far as the financial provisions of the local authorities go, that is not quite all, because from 1957 any local authority which can satisfy the Minister that the burden of even this one-quarter is putting an unreasonable load on the rates will be eligible for additional assistance.</p>

<p>Surely, in the discussions with the local


authorities, the total loss to the Exchequer has become known. The 25 per cent, which the local authorities will have to contribute under the new arrangement must be known. Therefore, the responsibility of the local authorities can be quite easily ascertained&#x2014;whether it is a 5d., 6d., 7d. or 8d. rate. Why cannot we have the figure which is considered reasonable and the figure which may be considered unreasonable?</p>

<p>Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will await what my right hon. Friend has to say about local authorities later in the debate. The short answer to the hon.

<p>I am not withholding any information which I expect my right hon. Friend to give later. I have said that we cannot give these provisions in detail, because they obviously depend on circumstances which may arise when the provisions come into operation.

<p>I was careful to say "the local government associations." Those are the bodies with which we have conducted our negotiations. We have discussed the likelihood of these provisions being needed. Perhaps I may now get on with the remaining parts of the Bill.<br/>
The remaining Clauses of Part I are concerned almost entirely with the methods of eliminating this pool of 62,000 houses before 1960 without hardship to the occupants. I think it will be accepted by anyone who studies the problem that there is no single method by which this can be achieved. Some half-a-dozen methods are being employed and I should like to say something about each one.<br/>
The first, and perhaps the most obvious, which is covered by Clause 3, is that when a house falls vacant it shall be released. Any exception to that rule must have the Minister's consent. The second, and perhaps the most important, is offered by Clause 4. It would obviously be a major contribution towards reducing this pool of 62,000 requisitioned houses if owners who did not wish to occupy or sell the houses were prepared to give the present occupants a statutory tenancy.<br/>
It is impossible accurately to compute how many there might be in this class, and I think any guess might mislead the House. A major difficulty in all this work has been that the 62,000 houses cover a great diversity of circumstances. They defy statistical analysis. I will only say


that we think this could make a major contribution, and we believe that it will. In effect, the owners will be invited to accept the present occupants as statutory tenants and to grant them rent-controlled tenancies. Where such an agreement is reached, houses will cease to be requisitioned.</p>

<p>I have not quite finished Perhaps the hon. and learned Gentleman will allow me to finish this point.<br/>
I think we should look at this, first of all, from the owner's point of view and then from the tenant's point of view to see what the precise result will be.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1955-02-15a.199.2" hansard_membership_id="12130" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/20607" speakername="Mr. Percy Shurmer" colnum="199" time="">

<p>Take it either way. Take it, first, from the tenant's point of view, if hon. Members like. The tenant will pay no more than he is paying now, for 10 years, subject to any change which a local authority may feel it proper to make in the rent&#x2014;any change such as it can now make for any council tenant. The local authority will make up the difference, and that will rank for Exchequer grant. The owner will get the rent which he is receiving now, which is compensation rental, plus the statutory repairs deduction, because he will become responsible for the repairs and maintenance of the house; and this will become the standard rent. As a result, he will lose his right to vacant possession, and for this he will be compensated.</p>

<p>If the hon. Member is fortunate enough to catch your eye, Mr. Speaker, no doubt he will develop that point later.<br/>

<p>I have given way a good deal and I should be grateful if the hon. Member would permit me to get on with my speech. A great many hon. Members want to take part in the debate.<br/>
The first of these two alternatives empowers the local authority to obtain leases of requisitioned houses for a term of ten years or so by negotiation with the owners. I think it is worth mentioning here that for this purpose local authorities will not be confined to requisitioned houses. If they need to, they can negotiate for any other house. Either way, the effect is a lease between willing parties in place of a house now held on requisition. The Exchequer will pay 75 per cent, of the cost of any annual deficit for ten years.<br/>
If neither of these methods provides enough houses to accommodate those in requisitioned houses, there is a third possibility, which is that local authorities may purchase.</p>
</speech>

<p>Since there are known to be owners who are willing to sell, compulsory purchase powers should not be needed in this instance. Again, in that case, three-quarters of any deficit will be borne by the Exchequer for twenty years.<br/>
We feel that all these methods are fair to owners and offer the fullest safeguards to tenants, whose position is assured for at least ten years. But among the owners of these requisitioned houses there are cases&#x2014;and I think that no hon. Member in any part of the House will deny this&#x2014;</p>

<p>I want to get one point clear. The hon. Gentleman has said that the position of tenants is assured for ten years. Does not this Bill deal only with five years in respect of their security?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1955-02-15a.200.5" hansard_membership_id="3299" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/14042" speakername="Mr. Deedes" colnum="200" time="">
<p>The provisions which I have just outlined cover a period of ten years&#x2014;that is, the powers and the financial provisions for a lease or for the sale of a house. If the right hon. Gentleman will look again at the Clause he will see that that is so.</p>

<p>This is an important matter. All these provisions depend upon the consent of the owner. If the owner does not consent, is riot this the position: that in 1960 the occupant, the licensee&#x2014; for he is not a tenant&#x2014;is turned out on the road without any provision whatever being made for him in the Bill?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1955-02-15a.201.1" hansard_membership_id="3299" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/14042" speakername="Mr. Deedes" colnum="201" time="">
<p>I have a little more to say about that and I think I can answer the hon. and learned Gentleman later in my remarks.<br/>
I was speaking of the owners of requisitioned houses among whom, I think it is accepted, there are some cases of very real hardship. I do not suppose that there is any hon. Member who has not at one time or another encountered one or more such cases, and I therefore need not elaborate the kind of difficult circumstances which arise for these owners, and particularly for the owner of only one house.<br/>
For these people we have thought it right that there should be two other provisions. In the first place, under Clause 5 we give the owners the same rights as those given to the owners of rent restricted houses&#x2014;rights to apply to the courts for vacant possession. That means that the courts will determine the relative hardship between owner and occupier. There will not be many of those cases and it should not be difficult for local authorities to find alternative accommodation for the few involved.<br/>
Then there are owners who do not want to live in their own houses, but are in urgent need of their capital value. We all know of cases no less deserving of sympathy in this category. A second provision is included in Clause 6, whereby the Minister can require the local authority to release or to buy a house at market value with vacant possession. I stress that this is not likely to be a large group, but within it there are known to be some extremely hard cases.<br/>
There is one other provision in Clause 7 in respect of owners. That is designed to meet the needs of those who wish to modernise or convert a house by means of an improvement grant. That provision is in the interests of property.</p>

<p>Would my hon. Friend bear this consideration in mind in relation to the procedure under Clause 6? That appears to

be a purely administrative decision. Would it not be possible to consider whether there ought to be either a right of an aggrieved applicant to go to the courts or at any rate to have a review by some non-Ministerial body, where the Minister is not prepared to accept the allegation of hardship?</p>

<p>I take the point made by my hon. Friend, which I think hon. Members would wish to consider in Committee.<br/>
I am giving an outline of the instruments which we are proposing to bring to bear on the task of restoring these 62,000 houses to normal conditions. Perhaps I might sum up what we have tried to do in Part I of the Bill.</p>

<p>I think I am right in saying that the point made by the hon. and learned Member for Kettering (Mr. Mitchison) was whether or not this depended on the consent of the owner in making the necessary arrangements with the tenant. These arrangements are triangular because the local authority is brought in as well and, of course, they are subject to consent. The whole object is to achieve tenancies by consent in place of by requisition. That is the essence of the contract.</p>

<p>May I make the point quite clear to the hon. Gentleman? All these arrangements depend on the owner's consent. Am I right in thinking that if the owner does not consent to anything the occupant would be turned out on to the street in 1960, without any provision being made by this Bill to accommodate him?</p>

<p>No. In coming to that conclusion the hon. and learned Member omits from his calculations the very great number of steps which will be taken between now and 1960, partly in a field I have not even mentioned. For example, normal provisions now being made to allocate part of every waiting list to a number of people in requisitioned houses. [HON. MEMBERS: "Oh."] By the time 1960 is reached those provisions should


have rendered the situation suggested by the hon. and learned Member quite impossible. The last resort is the purchase of the house.<br/>
We have tried to liquidate a debt incurred in the Second World War. Like many debts associated with that event, it has proved much easier to incur it than to repay it. As it stands it is a source of some hardship to owners and of much uncertainty and anxiety to a great many tenants or licensees of requisitioned houses. To do nothing more than we are doing now, by accepting palliatives&#x2014;and they are nothing more&#x2014;of current administrative action would mean that it would become harder and harder for the local authorities concerned. It would be tantamount to accepting the problem as a permanent one. That, we think, is intolerable. We cannot and ought not to regard this as a bad debt.<br/>
It is perfectly true that local authorities will incur added responsibility, but, in the long run, we think that their task will be made a great deal easier by these measures. I think they accept that. The local authority associations have been consulted throughout. My right hon. Friend can say more about that later in the debate. They have contributed to these proposals and my right hon. Friend is very grateful to them for all they have done. The main provisions of the Bill have been framed with their agreement.<br/>
Equipped with these new provisions, we shall make a new attack on this problem together. We think we can solve it. We are asking the House to approve the terms of this new partnership agreement and so enable us to repay in justice and equity something which stands at the head of the debit column of the housing account.</p>

<p>I beg to move, to leave out from "That" to the end of the Question and to add instead thereof:
<q>this House declines to give a Second Reading to a Bill which contemplates the eviction of occupants of requisitioned houses in 1960 without providing for their rehousing and, while protecting landlords from special hardship, gives no similar protection to occupiers.</q>
This, surely, is a quite unnecessary Bill. Over the greater part of the country it will not operate at all, because over the greater part of the country there are no requisitioned houses, or very few, remaining. On the other hand, where it does operate&#x2014;principally in the London area&#x2014;it will undoubtedly cause new hardships and throw new burdens on local authorities, the precise amount of which the Parliamentary Secretary has by no means clearly defined. The size of the problem the hon. Gentleman has stated to be now 62,000 houses, housing 90,000 families. Scotland is in on this and, therefore, can be included&#x2014;</p>

<p>That is my point, and I am obliged to the hon. Member for strengthening my argument.<br/>
Taking the whole country, including Scotland, out of the 62,000 remaining requisitioned houses we are told that 50,000 are in London, including Greater London. Outside London the Bill will operate principally in Birmingham, Liverpool and, I think, in Bristol. Over Great Britain as a whole there are62,000, of which 50,000 are in London and I would guess that most of the remainder are in three or four major cities of which I have named three. Therefore, over the whole of the rest of the country, including Scotland, the Bill will not operate at all. Clearly, for the rest of the country this is an unnecessary Bill.<br/>
On the other hand, where it will operate it will cause great hardship because, in the judgment of many persons with practical experience of these matters, five years is much too short a time in these very difficult areas to wind up the whole of the requisitioning arrangements.<br/>
Before coming to my general argument, I wish to make one further statistical point. After all, the position does not remain stationary from year to year. The Parliamentary Secretary has told us that in the last two years 20,000 houses have been derequisitioned. Therefore, two years ago there were 82,000 requisitioned houses. A quarter of them have been disposed of in two years, and therefore, even without the Bill, the process of derequisitioning is going forward gradually and steadily.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman shakes his head, but surely he is not saying that without the Bill there would be no further derequisitioning. Evidently, from the figures he has given, derequisitioning is going forward. What those of us who support the Amendment object to is trying to force the thing to a final and premature conclusion within five years in these difficult areas.<br/>
We should have preferred an approach in which, instead of taking a figure of five years and making it a national figure, the matter was handled on the basis of the different areas of the country according to the needs and conditions in each area. Over the greater part of the country, as I have indicated, the Government could get a legal and final end of requisitioning in much less a period than five years, in many cases within one year where requisitioning has practically gone down the wind already.<br/>
But in the areas where requisitioning is still a serious problem, it would have been much better had the Government, instead of fixing one uniform term of five years for the whole country, made arrangements whereby a different period might be fixed for different areas according to the local needs before bringing these arrangements to an end.<br/>
Many of my hon. Friends will, no doubt, speak, if they are fortunate enough to catch your eye, Mr. Speaker, of their own local experience of these problems, and I will not attempt to summarise what they may wish to say; but the Minister, who will wind up the debate, is himself a London Member and will, I am sure, listen with particular interest and sympathy to what is said about the London aspects of the problem.<br/>
The Parliamentary Secretary truly said that requisitioning is historically due to the blitz. A large number of people are in requisitioned premises because their homes became war casualties. They were under the <i>Luftwaffe</i> and they were in the track of that storm, and they should, therefore, be treated with exceptional sympathy and patience in their troubles which were no part of their responsibility.<br/>
The Amendment makes a further point, namely, that this Bill
<q>contemplates the eviction of occupants of requisitioned houses in 1960 without providing for their rehousing and, while protecting landlords from special hardship, gives no similar protection to occupiers.</q>
I think it is common ground, among all who have had experience of these hardships in their constituencies, that there is a genuine grievance on the part of the small man who owns only one house. I am not concerned with the professional landlord who lives by collecting rents from others, and much less with the large and impersonal company which does that. But the individual who owns his house is undoubtedly in many cases suffering a great grievance, which we should seek to abate and remove.<br/>
That individual may wish to get back into his house but cannot get back into it, or he may wish to change his place of residence or work and would dearly like to sell the house which is his to buy another house somewhere else. For the person who owns one house in which he himself desires to live there is great sympathy, and we shall be very happy in the further proceedings on the Bill to make sure that safeguards for him are just and adequate.<br/>
But what about the safeguards for the occupiers of these houses? Very often there is a tragic conflict of vital interests. A family living in such a house might have nowhere else to live if it is pushed out, while another person, perhaps with a family, is eager to get back the possession of his house or to get the money to buy a house nearer his work in another area.<br/>
I did not follow the Parliamentary Secretary's argument about what would happen under the Bill. I say, "under the Bill" because at the end of his speech the hon. Gentleman spoke about other provisions that might be made in some


other form somewhere else. I did not follow the hon. Gentleman's answer to my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Kettering (Mr. Mitchison), who asked whether it was not the case that under the Bill an occupant of a requisitioned house will have no assurance after 1960 that he will be able to continue to live where he is now living. I am sceptical whether many landlords will make their existing tenants in requisitioned houses statutory tenants under rent control.<br/>
I share the scepticism of my hon. Friend the Member for Sparkbrook (Mr. Shurmer). But suppose that some cases are to be dealt with in that way and by the other provisions in Clauses 5 and 6. It is still true that under the Bill there is no assurance that any tenant of a requisitioned house will not be put out on the street in 1960; I do not think that that can be denied. If that is really so, our argument appears to be very strong in support of the Amendment.<br/>
I should be very interested to hear, when the Minister replies to the debate, whether I have not correctly stated, and whether my hon. and learned Friend before me did not correctly state, the position as it will be in1960. There is no legal assurance for these people, and I would guess that a high proportion of them will be entirely without any right to continue to live anywhere in 1960.</p>

<p>The hon. Member will have heard me say that I have the greatest sympathy for the small man who has one house, and that I am eager to see him get it back again without injustice to others; but it would be a grievous injustice in

many cases if, in 1960, these families are turned out from the places which they now occupy. If the Minister can say anything which alters my interpretation of the Bill, I shall be interested to hear it.<br/>
Additional financial burdens are to be imposed on local authorities. It is said that a spur is required&#x2014;that was the phrase used&#x2014;arid that the form it will take will be that the local authorities will have to carry certain costs which in the past have been carried by the Treasury. But the Parliamentary Secretary was not at all exact or clear as to how that will work out. It has been necessary for many authorities within the Greater London area to have special assistance by way of rate relief&#x2014;I think of West Ham and East Ham and there are others&#x2014;because for a variety of reasons they are in a state of municipal poverty. They have great burdens upon them which they find it very difficult to meet.<br/>
We certainly are entitled, before consenting to the Second Reading of this Bill, to have information that is a good deal more detailed. The Parliamentary Secretary hinted that the Minister would be able to say more about this. Whatever may be the inconvenience, from the point of view of the debate, in having to wait until the end to hear what is to be done for local authorities, it is better to hear it at the end than not to hear it at all. I hope, therefore, that the Minister will be able to fill out that part of his speech rather more fully, because the Bill will be of great concern to hon. Members who represent the constituencies in question and to the communities which they represent here. Many of these are very heavily overburdened.<br/>
There is a further point about the burdens on local authorities on which I should be grateful if the Minister can say something. It relates to Clause 1 (3), in which it is laid down that
<q>Any agreement made in respect of a requisitioned house on behalf of the Minister, and in force immediately before the commencement of this Act, shall continue in force and have effect thereafter as if made on behalf of the local authority.</q>
That may be very onerous indeed on the local authority.<br/>
I should be glad if the Minister could tell us whether there are any, but there may be agreements entered into with regard to many requisitioned properties for payments at the end of the term which


would be much heavier than what the local authority would otherwise be required to pay. If there are such agreements, the least that the Minister can do is to take up any excess payments that may arise and meet them from Exchequer funds.<br/>
There is a further reference in the Bill to the purchase of houses by the local authority. We on this side of the House are generally in favour of the extension of municipal estates. We think that there are great advantages to any local authority in considerably increasing its estates and becoming the owner of rented properties in its area. That helps in many ways. It gives the local authority more elbow room and a more varied estate, with a wider range of sizes and types of houses, so that voluntary transfers between families can come about more easily.</p>

<p>The right hon. Gentleman was in the House when the 1936 Housing Act was passed, which limited the rents which could be charged by the local authority to its housing tenants, not under the operation of the Rent Restrictions Acts, but by a specific statutory provision. The right hon. Gentleman was a Minister when that statutory provision was repealed by the Housing Act, 1949, which was introduced by the right hon. Member for Ebbw Vale (Mr. Bevan).</p>

<p>These are very interesting excursions into history. I merely wanted to make sure that the chairman of the 1922 Committee was speaking with full authority when he said that it was a pity that local authority housing properties were free of any of the provisions for rent control.</p>

<p>The right hon. Gentleman must do himself justice, apart from me. I did not say anything about it being a pity. I pointed out that they were not subject to the Rent Restrictions Acts and, therefore, any extension of

local authority tenancies in that way meant the diminution of rent restriction.</p>

<p>That may well be so, but George Bernard Shaw once said that he was in favour of houses being owned by public bodies, because then as a ratepayer or taxpayer he had some voice as to what was done with the rent he paid, whereas in the case of private property he had none. That argument is still not without weight. The hon. Gentleman was a little premature in raising the point, because it is bound to lead one to wonder whether the 1922 Committee is not urging a reform of the law in this respect. Perhaps we shall hear more about that in the debate.<br/>
I was saying, when the hon. Gentleman intervened, that, in general, we are favourable to an increase in municipal housing properties, but we are not quite clear as to how that will operate under the Bill. It looks as though compulsory acquisition is not so much to be applied here by a local authority to an unwilling landlord, as by a Minister to an unwilling authority. The Financial and Explanatory Memorandum on the Bill states:
<q>The Bill provides that a requisitioned dwelling shall be released earlier than that date &#x2026;"&#x2014;</q>
That is, at the end of five years&#x2014;
<q>(<i>d</i>) When the owner is suffering severe hardship and the Minister directs the local authority to release (or alternatively to purchase) the house&#x2026;</q>
This looks as if compulsion to purchase is to be applied in some cases by the Minister to local authorities. I should like that more fully explained by the Minister when he replies to the debate.<br/>
I have tried to keep in touch with current opinion on this subject and I have had sent to me a paper called "The Surveyor and Municipal and County Engineer." It is a very reputable and authoritative paper. I should like to read to the House some comments on the Bill which appeared in the issue of 12th February. The paper states:
<q>The Bill has nothing whatever to do with the protection of the families living in requisitioned houses. It is solely concerned to secure to landlords the value of their premises with vacant possession. The cost will be considerable, and will be thrown on the rates. The Ministry state that representatives of local authority associations have been fully consulted and that the main provisions of the Bill, including its financial provisions, were framed


in agreement with those representatives. The payment of subsidies to landlords because their tenants cannot pay without severe hardship is unforgiveable. When money cannot be found for roads and other urgent public services, this payment of subsidies where no need is shown displays an irresponsible attitude to public funds, the very charge made in the Crichel Down report.</q>
I have read this passage because I am sure that the Minister will have read it too and will wish to reply to it.</p>

<p>The editor, I expect.<br/>
The references to Crichel Down are perhaps debatable, but I agree with the earlier sentences which I quoted. They seem to me a very pungent summary of the Bill. I read the passage to get it on the record and to get the Minister to reply, as I am sure he will wish to do.<br/>
It is still my hope that, when the Minister has listened to the remainder of the debate, including what I am sure will be some very well-informed comments from the point of view of the principal local authorities concerned, he will agree with what I said in my opening sentences. He will agree that this is an unnecessary Bill, that it approaches the problem in the wrong way and that it would be much better to take area by area and make special arrangements for each, including a considerably longer period than five years for the London area. I hope that in the light of our discussion the Minister will take the Bill back, think again and bring in a better Bill.</p>

<p>I rise because I think it fair to say that my constituency has more requisitioned families in it than any other in the country. The Borough of Camberwell has the second largest number of these families, Wandsworth having the largest. I feel, therefore, that I have special attachment to the subject because so many of my constituents have come to see me or have written to me about it. I welcome the Bill and the way in which it has been drafted, but I hope that Amendments will be made to it during the course of its journey through Committee. Furthermore, I hope that before the debate is over the Minister will tell us what he

means by Clause 10 (2), to which I shall refer in a moment or two.<br/>
Having read the Bill, and knowing a fair amount about the problems of both the tenant and the landlord of requisitioned houses, I consider that a fair bargain has been made to both sides. There are few tenants living in requisitioned properties in London who really want to stay there. Since they know that it is of a temporary nature and that they cannot look forward to such property being their permanent home, they want to get out of it and into a permanent house.<br/>
I would respectfully suggest that this is the right time to do something because, unless something is done by some Government at some time, this position will be perpetuated. I assure the House that large numbers of such tenants are in a continual state of trepidation, wondering what will happen to themselves and their families; and the younger the parents are the more worried they are.<br/>
The Bill enables a landlord who wishes to do so to live in his own house at the earliest possible time. The right hon. Gentleman mentioned ex-Service men. Large numbers who were called up had bought their houses with the assistance of a building society, their families were sent to the country under evacuation schemes, and their houses were taken over. Hundreds of thousands of other people were compulsorily evacuated from London to the country and as their houses became empty these also were taken over. Therefore, there are 50,000 houses in London and Greater London which were taken over by virtue of those two facts. It is with those people who wish to get their houses back in order to live in them that I am concerned.</p>

<p>I do not know the answer to that question but, speaking from my own experience, there are large numbers of them. Those who have come to see me and written to me are of that description, and I have not had any approach from landlords who own large numbers of these houses.</p>

<p>For the information of the hon. Gentleman, and for the clarification of hon. Members generally, I have in my hand a document from the owners of requisitioned houses, who put the figure of single owners at between 4,000 and 5,000.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1955-02-15a.213.1" hansard_membership_id="6948" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/30945" speakername="Mr. Jenkins" colnum="213" time="">
<p>I am obliged to the hon. Gentleman for that information.<br/>
Now may I turn to another angle. The transfer to local authorities by the Government of the right to determine all points with regard to requisitioned property in the future is important. Up to now, many local authorities have been backward in releasing property in cases of great hardship, although they could have done so. Camber well Borough Council is one of those. Even in proved cases of hardship, the council has been backward in this respect, and only by constant pressure have any properties been released.<br/>
This was because until a year or two ago it was the policy of the council not to release to owners any properties whatever. Therefore, the transfer of the powers not only of management, but of responsibility for the property, is not only a good safeguard from the point of view of property owners and tenants but it is also of great advantage to the taxpayer.<br/>
Although the problem occurs principally in Greater London, it is a national problem, and always has been since requisitioning started, so it should be a national charge. The right hon. Member for Bishop Auckland (Mr. Dalton) said that the people of London and Greater London and of the big cities were bombed during the war, whereas the rest of the country was not bombed, so the cost of maintaining these people in requisitioned property as the result of their homes being bombed should be a national charge. Yet, some time or other, this must cease and the question is, when? The Government have specified a limit of 1960 and this is wise because, unless local authorities are forced to do something, in a large number of cases nothing will be done.<br/>
When the war was over the Government of the day continued to give powers to local authorities to requisition and those powers were withdrawn only a short time ago. It is now certain that no more

properties will be requisitioned. I want to answer one point made by the right hon. Gentleman about the five years. There is provision in the Bill, though perhaps indirectly, for specific powers to be given to local authorities, particularly as regards London and Greater London, to take three certain steps. I will not bore the House with these because no doubt other hon. Members will deal with them in detail. The House must realise that five years is not a long time having regard to one fact. Here I am not attempting to make a party point, although it may appear so.<br/>
During the last three and a quarter years nearly 1 million people have been rehoused in new permanent housing whereas, if the maximum figure for building had remained at 200,000 houses a year, they would never have been provided with new permanent houses. I am not suggesting that if the right hon. Gentleman and his friends had been in power three and a quarter years ago they would not have exceeded 200,000 houses a year, but I am saying that if the maximum of 200,000 houses had not been relaxed there would have been 1 million fewer people in permanent houses today. [HON. MEMBERS: "Why?"] I will not weary the House with the way it is worked out, but it can be shown in simple figures.<br/>
If that be so, then at the present rate of building there will probably -be 1&#x00A3;million more people in permanent houses in the next five years than there would have been if the ceiling had remained at 200,000. The effect of this will be that with the increase of building throughout the country, and with perhaps even a progressive rate, five years will be about the right time to give the local authorities in which to hand back to the owners these requisitioned houses, because the additional new permanent housing available will take up the slack represented by these requisitioned houses.<br/>
One further comment on that point. Hon. Members perhaps do not appreciate that to derequisition a house does not reduce the family unit at all Somebody goes into the house out of which somebody comes and, therefore, there is no reduction in the number of family units, but only a transfer of one family unit to another place.</p>

<p>The hon. Member was

<p>I am obliged to the hon. Member. That brings me to my last two points and I will deal with that one first.<br/>
Because of the grave circumstances in my own constituency&#x2014;and I know that other hon. Members are concerned with the very great problems in Birmingham and West Ham&#x2014;I ask the Minister to make some special provision for those areas with the largest number of requisitioned properties and with very little land upon which to build. Special attention should be given to these areas which were the most heavily bombed during the war and which should now have the most pleasant and agreeable treatment. I have no doubt whatever that the general outline of the Bill is the correct one, but some concessions should be made to those places most hardly hit in the war.</p>

<p>I thank my hon. Friend for his intervention. I am aware of that, but I still maintain that it does not follow that the people from the most badly bombed areas will find accommodation in the new towns. As and when the Minister has the opportunity to think about certain proposals that may be made to him when the Bill is dealt with in Committee, I hope that he will pay special attention to these areas.<br/>
I should like to call the Minister's attention to Clause 10 (2), which says:
<q>If the Minister is satisfied in the case of any local authority that the additional burden placed on their rates in consequence of the provisions of this Part of this Act &#x2026; is greater than is reasonable, he may, with the consent of the Treasury, make to them a special grant in respect of that year of such amount as he may &#x2026;</q>

I want to give one instance of the effect of the Bill, if local authorities for four years have to pay the 25 per cent, of the total amount. The Borough of Camber-well's deficiency for 1953&#x2013;54 in respect of this service, and for which it got a total reimbursement, was &#x00A3;181,500 gross. The net amount was &#x00A3;163,000. The 25 per cent, which it will be called upon to pay the year after next will amount to &#x00A3;41,000, which is approximately equivalent to a 6d. rate.<br/>
I make this plea to the Minister, who is not only the Minister of Housing, but also the Minister of Local Government. At present, rates are soaring and local authorities are hard put to it to get enough money to pay for the services which they should render to their ratepayers. This additional burden of 6d. on one borough &#x2014;it may be much more in other London boroughs&#x2014;is an unconscionable burden which my own borough should not be called upon to pay.<br/>
The Minister should relieve the minds of local authorities, who will have to administer this Act, by telling the House at the earliest possible moment what amount of money he is prepared to accept in respect of this 25 per cent. If25 per cent, is not reasonable in Clause 10 (2), if it represents a 6d. rate, or a 6d. rate, what formula will he adopt? What is in his mind? Is he considering a rate-poundage basis, or a hereditament basis, or what? It would be very advantageous to the many thousands of local authorities involved in this, if they knew in advance, today if possible, what, in fact, was their liability.<br/>
Notwithstanding some of the suggestions I have made this afternoon from the experience I have accumulated in my own division, and which, with the utmost respect, I ask the Minister to consider, I welcome the Bill and hope that the Minister may be able to make some concessions in the debates in Committee.</p>

<p>As the hon. Member is more likely to get a reply than we are, and as he has spoken feelingly about the fact that this problem was created by the war, does he not believe that, since this is a national problem created by the war, the whole of the burden should be carried by the Treasury? If so, what need is there for the Bill?</p>

<p>I did not want to detain the House by dealing with that point.<br/>
Requisitioning has to end some time. Local authorities are only the agents of the Minister at the moment, managers on behalf of the Minister. They are to have the authority handed back to them and it is an obvious principle of government in its relation to local authorities that the local authorities, if they have the responsibility, should pay for it. Unless they have the incentive, the local authorities would not be sure to carry out the terms of the Bill. It is for that reason that I think that the local authorities should pay and, in fact, they have agreed to pay 25 per cent.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Dulwich (Mr. Robert Jenkins) would probably have been assisted if he could have secured from the Parliamentary Secretary some indication of the point at which the Minister would regard the expenditure of local authorities as unreasonable. I am sure that, if he had not been satisfied with that, we should probably have found him with us in the Division Lobby tonight.<br/>
I can quite understand him generalising about the situation and saying that he feels that his own local authority of Camberwell does not always apply its mind to a reasonable interpretation of the necessities of handing back requisitioned houses. I want to turn this debate away from that sort of generalisation and deal with realities. It is all very well talking about 50,000 or 60,000 houses, or 82,000 units. I want to express the problem in terms of the day-to-day existence of people in the boroughs which were bombed.<br/>
I rise to oppose the Bill and to support the Amendment. My main opposition to the Bill is that it seeks to pass on to local authorities a problem which manifestly belongs to the national Government. It is a matter for the central Government to attempt to repair the ravages of war; it should not pass the responsibility on "to the local authority.<br/>
I cannot conceive of a more vicious and atrocious proposal than that contained in the Bill. I am not arguing that my constituency had bigger bombs than any other; those days have gone, and

we have ceased to talk about the people who suffered during the war. However, in this proposal we can see the Government's mind working. Here we are dealing with people who have suffered misery, had their homes destroyed, and lost what were termed their "chattels," which means, in effect, the things which they had built around themselves in the course of their lives, and which had become very dear to them.<br/>
We are now telling those people that, because of new zoning arrangements and new standards of housing, rows and rows of houses in industrial and dock areas and areas interspersed with commerce which were destroyed, can never again be replaced in such numbers in those areas. We are telling them that not only must they suffer as a consequence of the bombing but that they are now to be tortured further.<br/>
I have been the chairman of a housing committee for a number of years. We have often heard the argument that if we wished to take over the railways we should remember the poor woman sitting burning the midnight oil to keep the accounts of her husband who was engaged in transport or some other industry. The same sort of arguments are being advanced in this case.<br/>
What we have to consider are the facts of the situation. In my borough at the moment there are 3,370 requisitioned properties. At the monthly meetings of the housing committee we consider requests from ex-owner-occupiers who plead that it is a greater hardship to keep them out of their property than it is to turn the licensees out. The 14 persons on the committee are ordinary, humane individuals who understand the circumstances, and they try to do what is best in the interests of everybody concerned.<br/>
The number of applications received at the monthly meeting ranges between three and six; throughout the years that I have been connected with the committee I have never known a greater number. Therefore, to base the Bill upon the argument that the owners of requisitioned property today are, in the main, people who possess only one house is absolute nonsense.<br/>
I wish to give some figures relating to my local authority. I do not want it to be felt that I am basing my arguments solely upon the circumstances in my


borough, but surely we cannot understand the problem as a whole unless we appreciate the points which arise in various areas. Of 43,600 residential hereditaments in my borough, nearly 27,000 were damaged by bombing, many of them several times. Four thousand of them were either so badly damaged that they had to be demolished or were totally destroyed; they were, therefore, entirely demolished as a consequence of the war. This meant a loss in rateable value between 1939 and 1945 of &#x00A3;109,000.<br/>
Arising out of that loss of houses and rateable value, the right hon. Gentleman now brings in a Bill which imposes a further obligation upon us. That loss was a result of war. Surely we do not pay for wars by "passing the buck" to the most luckless section of the community. On the contrary, we say that in a period of emergency, danger, trial, and tribulation help should come from the whole of the community to lighten and lessen the burdens of those who suffered.<br/>
It is sometimes said that we remember nice things and fortunately forget bad. There is a danger in forgetting the bad things, because we are apt to forget the responsibility which falls upon us in connection with them. Hon. Members who were connected with Civil Defence during the war&#x2014;I was a chief warden&#x2014;will know that we operated a mutual aid scheme. On Government instructions, dangerous areas were evacuated, and people were often housed by neighbouring boroughs which had habitable property left by owners. When my borough was attacked, inhabitants were at times housed in other Metropolitan boroughs under this scheme. However, on balance my borough took in more people than it sent out.<br/>
We had a classic example of something approaching social equality being achieved. A man was bombed out of a little slum dwelling at Hackney Wick. We managed to get him a flat at Dolphin Square. That did not last long. Suddenly the Ministry discovered where Dolphin Square was and said that the man had better return to the salubrious district of Hackney Wick.<br/>
The fact that we assisted other boroughs under the mutual aid system brings to light and heightens the financial inequali-

ties implicit in the provisions of the Bill, for we shall have to pay more money because we took more people in.<br/>
When considering the proposition before the House, we should ask our selves whether the hard hit local authorities have attempted to meet their responsibilities in relation to the derequisitioning of the property which was made available. I believe that there is no basis for the charge which has been levelled against local authorities. I have had something to do with successive Ministries on these matters. Since 1947, my borough has derequisitioned more than 700 units of accommodation, which is about 100 per annum, but the Bill means that we shall now have to release units at the rate of 700 per annum. How is that possible?<br/>
This is at a time&#x2014;I want to give the facts so that the situation can be under stood&#x2014;when we are faced with the appeal from the right hon. Gentleman's predecessor to enter upon "Operation Rescue." My borough has 2,660 unfit houses to be dealt with during the next 15 to 20 years. We have 489 slum properties earmarked by the medical officer of health to be dealt with in the next five years. We have 8,000 basement dwellings, a large number of which were, and are, totally unfit for habitation.<br/>
These figures are in front of the Minister of Housing and Local Government, but we are told to release our requisitioned properties. We have 6,000 families waiting for accommodation, and of them 2,380 are in category A. The right hon. Gentleman intervened to say that we had the new towns. Since 1952, my borough has had the advantage of securing about 200 tenancies in the new towns and we still have a waiting list of over 6,000 families. That is the position in one London borough.<br/>
I assure hon. Gentlemen opposite that my local authority has been as energetic in tackling its housing programme under the present Government as it was under the Labour Government. We take the view that this is not a matter of party politics. Our view is that we must pro vide accommodation for our people. We believe that the Tory Party has hampered us by what it has done. There have been many points of disagreement with the proposals put before us. Nevertheless, we have accepted our responsibility as a housing authority and gone ahead


with our job. Since the end of the war we have managed to build 1,800 houses.<br/>
As well as the arithmetical problem, there is also a great human problem. I am sure that the Minister is not quite heartless, but I imagine that he approaches the problem with very little knowledge of local government activities. However, that is not necessarily something which detracts from his general usefulness.<br/>
The Minister has produced a Bill. What does it say, when we sum it up? We can apply to it the term, "Chuck 'em out." It says that we must buy the properties or get the landlords to accept the occupants as statutory tenants. On the question of purchase, I would inform the Minister that we have been in negotiation with his Ministry for eight months about the purchase of five specimen properties under the Housing Act, 1936. It has taken us eight months to get a decision from his Ministry.<br/>
The Minister has utilised the time of expensive town clerks, borough treasurers, and other officials of the local authority, who have been trying to ascertain from him the basis on which he will assist us so that we can buy the houses and fix rents which are within the financial capacity of those who are badly in need. It has taken us eight months to get a decision on those five houses. Even then, the decision is unsatisfactory. I am sure that it will not meet the requirements of our population. We are told that we can purchase. Then, while this "speedy" rate of acquisition is proceeding, any properties falling vacant cannot be re-occupied until we get the sanction of the Ministry.<br/>
Apparently the Minister does not know what happens. The local authority is continually seeking to utilise to the full requisitioned property and any municipal property which it had. It often removes people from under-accommodated property so that it can house people from overcrowded property. However, the Bill says that when property becomes vacant the Minister is to authorise the local authority. From our knowledge of the Minister and his predecessor, Molotov has nothing on them when it comes to saying "No." Whatever suggestion we have submitted in connection with requisitioned property, the answer has been "No."<br/>
It is a fact that licensees are removed for a variety of reasons, and that, in accordance with the appeal of the Ministers, we have utilised the accommodation to the full. To me Clause 4 is a "peach." It represents the height of super-optimism. Apparently the news has not yet reached Whitehall that everywhere property owners are keeping houses empty so that they can sell at enhanced prices.<br/>
Anyone who has had to deal with requisitioned property knows that owners often go to the county court judge and apply for possession of part of a house on the ground that the licensee is a nuisance. The judge has to decide whether it is a greater hardship to leave the occupant in possession or to turn the property over to the owner. As soon as possession is secured, the owner offers it for sale with vacant possession, yet the Minister says that we should appeal to the owners to accept the licensees as statutory tenants. I do not know how far he thinks he should go.<br/>
I am grateful for having had the opportunity to contribute to the debate. It appears to me that the Parliamentary Secretary rested his case&#x2014;and I rather fancy that the Minister will add to it&#x2014;on the fact that the Bill has come before the House after consultation and agreement with the local authorities. Sometimes it is difficult to define, what is agreement. If, for example, a local authority association is called into consultation and asked for its observations, usually the observations are submitted, and eventually the Minister says, "Unless you take this you will get nothing" or "If you take this, will you do that?" It is a question of negotiation. I should like the Minister to tell us exactly how the negotiations were conducted.<br/>
It is computed by the borough treasurer of Hackney that under the formula laid down in the Bill we shall lose about &#x00A3;30,500, which is equivalent to a 5d. rate. This is a bad Bill, which ought never to have been brought before the House. As the Amendment says, it gives protection and extra rents to land lords, and no protection to the tenants.<br/>
My final words to the Minister are that he should remember that he is the Minister of Housing and Local Government and that he is neither the agent


of the Property Owners' Protection Association nor of the requisitioned property owners. I hope that he will have enough sense to realise that the interests of the citizens of this country are bound up with the retention of this property until such time as there is a reasonable chance of the occupants being reasonably housed elsewhere.</p>

<p>Naturally I have some sympathy with what has been said by the hon. Member for Hackney, South (Mr. H. Butler), be cause he represents part of the Borough of Hackney, and I represented another part in this House for 21 years&#x2014;from 1924 to 1945&#x2014;including the time when bombing was taking place. Therefore, I can confirm the accuracy of what he said about the difficulties that our people had there at that time.<br/>
I want to speak now of the Borough of Lewisham, part of which I have represented for some years. I understand that there are there 3,471 families in requisitioned properties. That number is a little higher than the figure for the Borough of Hackney, though there is not a great deal of difference.<br/>
As has been said by previous speakers, these houses were taken over as a war emergency measure. In Lewisham, I have found that many of the. properties quite unsuitable for the purposes for which they are being used. That is particularly apparent in that part of London. There are a number of rather large houses in the Black heath area&#x2014;not necessarily in the Black heath ward&#x2014;which were meant for one family and which now have a number of families living in them. These properties are large, cold, damp, and badly lighted. Most of them have deplorable sanitary arrangements.<br/>
I have had two sorts of complaints from my constituents, about one of which we have not heard much during this debate. It comes from tenants in the type of house I have just described who are unable to obtain other accommodation, because they are told that there are others who are in more difficult circumstances than they are; that if the number of rooms are counted&#x2014;and so on&#x2014;their accommodation may be considered to be suit able. Yet the house is usually very old-fashioned and most inconvenient.<br/>
I have also had a number of complaints from the owners of houses who wish to get their properties back. There appear to be four chief reasons. Sometimes the complainant is a person who is retired and wishes to get his house back in order to settle down in his retirement. Another complaint comes from people who wish to live near their work.<br/>
At present I am concerned with the case of a schoolmaster who is actually living in the ground floor of his own house. The top floor is requisitioned. The property is close to his school. He has a grown-up son coming back from the university, and he has no room to accommodate him, so that he now wishes to obtain complete possession of his own property. There are also cases of young people whose families are increasing and have outgrown the accommodation pro vided for them; and there are cases of families in which the children are growing up, where separate bedroom accommodation is now necessary for the boys and girls. Such cases in all London Metropolitan boroughs are dealt with perfectly fairly by a committee, but I am afraid that usually such people meet with a refusal.<br/>
To the best of my knowledge, I have had no representations for a Bill of this kind from big property owners, such as housing trusts or the Churches. I should like to give one rather amusing instance, because I have been attacked before now when I have said that property owners are very often owners on a small scale. When the Housing Repairs and Rents Act had been passed, I thought that I should have an enormous number of complaints from tenants. As a matter of fact, I have received no complaints from tenants to date.<br/>
But I did have a complaint from two owners, a husband and a wife, who were old-age pensioners. When they left me, the man said, "Thank you very much, but my tenants are awfully nice people, and I do not think that I shall do anything about it at all." I thought that, on the whole, they represented the best kind of landlord. I hope that as a result of this speech I shall not receive an influx of complaints about that Act.<br/>
I am rather surprised to see the reasoned Amendment on the Order Paper. As I understand it, the Bill was agreed to by the Metropolitan Boroughs


Standing Joint Committee, which has a Labour majority. Two days ago, the Lewisham representative, who is a Conservative, told me that the committee had agreed to it, and I confirmed that last night when I saw the leader of the council. I asked him if it were the fact that that committee had agreed, and he told me that that was so.</p>

<p>The hon. Member is correct in saying that the Metropolitan Boroughs Standing Joint Committee agreed in principle to the proposals.

<p>The hon. and learned Member for West Ham, South (Mr. Elwyn Jones) complained that the rate in his area would be excessive. But in the London County Council area we operate the rate equalisation system, so that rate-payers should not be much worse off.<br/>
Most of the complaints voiced by hon. Members opposite seemed to be about the finances of this Bill&#x2014;the 25 per cent, as against the 75 per cent. Most hon. Members opposite have said that their boroughs would experience difficulty in finding the money. But the leaders of the party opposite thought so little of that argument that they have not even put it in their reasoned Amendment.<br/>
I cannot believe that the Metropolitan Boroughs Standing Joint Committee, with its big Labour majority, would pay no heed to the needs of the tenants, I think that when it gave general approval to this Bill it felt that the needs of the tenants were amply covered. If the Bill had intended that the tenant should have no such protection all that was needed was Clause 1, because all the other Clauses are directed to ensuring that the tenants obtain a fair deal. I am now of course referring to Part 1 of the Bill.<br/>
My own experience is that the majority of tenants long to get premises of their own which are less overcrowded than their present accommodation, and more comfortable. Incidentally, I think that they would have a much better chance&#x2014; we cannot debate this now but we shall have to do so sooner or later&#x2014;were not so many council houses occupied by tenants who are must better off than the people for whom they were originally built, and who would otherwise be able to occupy them. That matter is being discussed by the London County Council and by many borough councils&#x2014; [<i>Interruption.</i>] There are many borough councils with Labour majorities who operate this differential rate: it is by no means a Tory idea&#x2014;and all the authorities appreciate that it is a very difficult question.<br/>
The present system of derequisitioning is to earmark council houses. This idea of earmarking council houses for dispossessed people is not a new one, and it is a method which will have to be stepped up. Again, owners are to be asked to accept the present tenants as rent-controlled tenants. I do not agree that no one will do that. In many cases I think that owners will do so. I have heard of cases where houses in parts of Marylebone and Kensington have been requisitioned and the owners do not want them derequisitioned. They are only too delighted to keep on the tenants as statutory tenants, if the property is being used properly. They also receive compensation of a kind, 75 per cent, being paid by the Treasury as a kind of sop to them for giving up vacant possession, and if they have subsidised the rents, 75 per cent, of the subsidy is to be made to the owner.</p>

<p>The hon. Member is mixing up the Treasury contributions to local authorities for leases and purchases with compensation paid to owners, which is quite different.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1955-02-15a.226.1" hansard_membership_id="6403" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/28836" speakername="Sir A. Hudson" colnum="226" time="">
<p>If the hon. Member reads the Clause he will see that compensation is to be given, and that 75 per cent, will come by way of Treasury grant.<br/>
Clause 11 deals with the renting or buying of suitable property by the local council; it need not be the same requisitioned property. If the council rents it, it can keep it for 10 years, during which


time it will receive the same contribution of 75 per cent. If it buys the property, compensation is paid for 20 years. That seems to be fair.<br/>
Again and again the Bill says that if tenants cannot be removed from requisitioned houses without suffering hardship the Minister must be consulted. I am sure that no hon. Member is going to pass any Bill which will turn somebody out into the street. I have never seen it done in my 30 years in Parliament, and I do not expect to see it now.<br/>
I believe that the provisions of the Bill will solve the problems of the tenants. If, a year before 1960, it is found that the intentions of the Bill are not working out, I have little doubt that a deputation composed of hon. Members on both sides of the House whose constituents are suffering hardship will ask the Minister to take action before anything drastic happens.<br/>
We, must remember that many owners are only property owners in a small way. Four Clauses deal with owners. Houses that fall vacant become derequisitioned. That is sensible. No hardship is caused to the tenant; some family will go into the vacant property, and that family will leave a vacant house for somebody else. Clause 5 deals with hardship, and maintains the position which exists in regard to rent-controlled property. If an owner can show greater hardship than his tenant he can get back his house if he takes the matter to a county court.<br/>
Clause 6 deals with cases of severe hardship, and I am not so sure about that one. The matter is obviously one of those which will have to be discussed during the Committee stage. When I read the Clause, I thought that it referred to persons who were going bankrupt. The question of severe hardship must be an awfully difficult one for anybody to decide, and I hope that the question will be fully discussed during the Committee stage.<br/>
I commend Clause 7. If the owner agrees to take back the house for modernisation and conversion he can have it at once, but he must let it to tenants approved by the local authority. They will be the same kind of people as those who vacate the premises. I have seen properties of that kind which could be made comfortable for many families but

which, at the moment, are requisitioned, are deteriorating very rapidly, and will fall down if something is not done to them.</p>

<p>Some of these big houses are almost impossible to repair. They require rebuilding. They are enormous places, with very high ceilings, and they have no electricity, no proper sanitation, and no heating. If we do not have a Bill of this kind I do not know how we shall be able to deal with that form of property. We cannot go on for ever under a system of requisitioning, and we are trying to build a sufficient number of houses to cater for the people who have to leave the derequisitioned houses.</p>

<p>The hon. Member has spoken very optimistically of what will happen when houses become vacant. Has he any idea what is already happening every day to London properties which become available with vacant possession? Will he say something about that, because it would be nice to have some view ex pressed by an hon. Member opposite as to the desirability of some degree of compulsion being placed upon landlords. He would help to satisfy the inquiries which have been made, without result, by some of my hon. Friends to the Minister. What is the opinion of hon. Members opposite upon the exercising of pressure upon landlords to agree to the offers made to them?</p>

<p>It is entirely up to the landlord, but if he likes to sell the house to another family why should he not do so?<br/>
Why should the family have to be nominated by the local authority? It is not as if the house is to be left empty. If the house was to be pulled down there would be something in the argument of hon. Members opposite, but, as it is, somebody is going to live in it. I suggest that the people who have to leave should be put into a house in one of the large housing estates, outside which we see large, shiny, black cars. So long as someone moves into the house the position is satisfactory. In my view the Bill is a fair one. As far as I know it is


agreed to by the Metropolitan boroughs, and I hope that we shall press on with it, and thus deal with another very difficult problem.</p>

<p>I promise to speak for only a few minutes, because I think that it is up to all hon. Members who take part in this debate to be as brief as possible in order to give an opportunity to their colleagues&#x2014;especially those representing affected areas&#x2014; to speak about what I regard as a most unfair and unjust Bill. For that reason my comments will be of a general and not particular character.<br/>
The Bill imposes burdens and hard ships upon the ratepayers of many highly-rated properties; upon the licensees of many requisitioned houses and, most of all, upon those badly and inadequately housed folk who have been on local authority waiting lists for a very long time. The Bill places an additional burden of 25 per cent, upon the rates, but I regard this work as a national responsibility. The requisitioning of houses was a wartime necessity&#x2014;an essential part of the work which had to be done and financed for the proper carrying out of the national effort. The areas most affected were those which were heavily bombed, or those nearby, to which many of the de-housed people had to be transferred. This was a general aspect of war activity. It was a national service and, as such, it should be nationally financed.<br/>
What justification can there be for saying, in effect, to the ratepayers of the affected areas, "You suffered most during the war; your rateable value has been greatly reduced by war destruction. You have the most serious problems of re construction, which will fall very heavily upon your local rates. Now, instead of trying to find ways of giving you greater assistance, we propose to curry favour with the people living in the largely unaffected areas&#x2014;the greater and luckier body of taxpayers&#x2014;and we seek now, because we have got a view of the future, to get their support at the forthcoming election by transferring to your local rates 25 per cent, of what should still be a national responsibility."<br/>
In areas like my own, the rate increase will be 5d., 6d. or 7d. in the &#x00A3;. It is all very well for hon. Gentlemen opposite to

talk about the Metropolitan Boroughs Standing Joint Committee and the local borough councils accepting the proposals in the Bill. Let me be quite frank. A very large number had never seen the Bill, and did not know what was in it, and quite a number of those engaged in the negotiations were very nicely led up the garden by the Minister and his representatives.<br/>
They started with the idea that they would have a very heavy burden to bear &#x2014;60 per cent., I am told, was the first offer. That meant 40 per cent, from the Ministry and 60 per cent, from the local rates. That was the first suggestion which was made. Next, it was switched the other way round&#x2014;60 per cent, from the Ministry and 40 per cent, from the local rates.<br/>
When, ultimately, it became only 25 per cent, from the local rates, they were so overcome by the improvement which had been made that they were prepared to give their approval to the suggestion. That is the suggestion, as far as local authorities in the London area are concerned, and I have full authority from my own people to say that they hate this Bill and that they hope the House will throw it out.<br/>
What of the licensees who are now living in the requisitioned houses? Some of them will be rehoused by 1960, but a very large number will not. My own area has the idea of devoting 50 per cent, of all available housing accommodation to the purpose of derequisitioning these houses, and, if it allocates that 50 per cent., three-quarters of the present houses will have to remain requisitioned after 1960.<br/>
What is to happen to the licensees in those cases? The licensees remaining in these requisitioned houses in 1960 will automatically become trespassers and liable to eviction, because the houses will have passed from the local authority to the private landlord. It is true that some of the landlords may be willing to accept them as tenants, but the terms upon which they will allow them to remain have to be determined by the landlords.</p>

<p>If the hon. Gentleman him self reads the Bill he will see that in 1960 these people can be charged any exorbitant rent that the landlord chooses to impose. Many of us are only too familiar with some of the tricks of landlords with regard to tenancies under their control. For example, we know of those who put in a few pieces of quite inferior furniture and let the houses at very high rents as furnished premises. None of the houses that are handed over, except those that come under Clause 4, will come under the Rent Restrictions Acts.</p>

<p>Let us suppose that one of these rent-restricted houses becomes vacant, that the landlord takes it over with vacant possession and accepts a tenant to occupy it. The rent is fixed for that house today, and the incoming tenant automatically becomes a statutory tenant. Therefore, I put it to the right hon. Gentleman that, unless the Bill says other than that, then precisely the same position comes into operation after 1960, because the statutory tenancy will still exist.</p>

<p>No, I do not accept that as an interpretation of the Bill at all. I think that the exact opposite of that is really true, particularly as far as tenants who are left in requisitioned houses after 1960 are concerned. Nothing whatever is provided for them in this Bill.<br/>
Lastly, I want to say a word or two about the people remaining on local council housing lists, because, in my opinion, they will be the worst affected by this Bill. I refer to couples living apart, one with one relative and one with another; a man, his wife and two or three children living in one single room; ex-Service men just coming back into civil life; and newly-married couples just starting out on family life.<br/>
These are the people who are likely to suffer most, because if the local authorities try to carry out what this Bill requires them to do, there will not be available the necessary accommodation with which to provide all the people on their waiting lists with houses. If areas such as my own provide as much as 50 per cent, of the available accommodation, they will still have left three-quarters of the requisitioned houses, and, if local authorities are to deal adequately and properly with this problem, then the whole of the new accommodation must be reserved for that purpose.<br/>
I say that we have no right to impose upon local authorities an obligation such as that, which is an injustice to the people they represent and to the people whom they are there to serve, and I therefore hope that the Bill will be rejected.</p>

<p>I imagine that tomorrow some of the colleagues of the right hon. Member for Poplar (Mr. Key) on the Metropolitan Boroughs Standing Joint Committee will read his remarks in this debate. I do not know whether they will be more annoyed to read that he has accused them of allowing themselves to be hoodwinked and bamboozled, or more astonished at the ignorance which he revealed of the working of the Rent Restrictions Acts.<br/>
In his speech, the right hon. Gentleman, like the hon. Member for Hackney, South (Mr. H. Butler), laid great stress upon the fact that this problem originated in the circumstances of the late war. It would be a mistake, however, to suppose that now, in 1955, the licensee occupants of a great proportion of these requisitioned houses are the direct victims of war circumstances.<br/>
The House heard my hon. Friend who moved the Second Reading of the Bill point out that after the end of the war,


when the bombs had ceased to fall, a very large number of additional houses&#x2014; many included in those with which we are dealing&#x2014;were requisitioned. We are now simply concerned with a part of the housing pool available to local authorities, which they quite consciously, deliberately and rightly use and administer as part of their housing resources. To suggest that, ten or fifteen years after the end of the war, this part of the housing pool should be treated for historical reasons as different, financially and in other ways, from the rest, is an argument which falls to the ground.<br/>
The mover of the Amendment said that the Bill was unnecessary. If by that word he means a Bill which will not apply to every local authority&#x2014;if the word "unnecssary" is used in that peculiar sense&#x2014;we must admit that the Bill is unnecessary. It is unnecessary in no other sense. The right hon. Member for Bishop Auckland (Mr. Dalton) admitted that himself. He said he wanted to see owners of requisitioned property whose hardship was the greater given the same rights as they would have if they were the owners of rent-restricted property. How does he imagine that that could be achieved without legislation? Therefore, in the view of the right hon. Member for Bishop Auckland Clause 5 is entirely unnecessary.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman is not in the House at the moment, but no doubt his hon. and right hon. Friends will speak for him. We did not clearly get from him whether steps ought or ought not now to be taken to bring requisitioning to an end. He said that it ought to be dealt with in a different way in different parts of the country: different periods ought to be prescribed for different parts of the country. But he did not tell us what periods he thought ought to be prescribed, or how, without legislation, those periods could be finally laid down and the matter cleared up.<br/>
Before we turn to the allegations of the Amendment about what will happen in 1960, the House ought to get an estimate of the proportions which the problem will be likely to have five years from now. This is bound to be guesswork. We are trying to ascertain how many properties will still be requisitioned in 1960, taking account of any factors attributable to the provisions of the Bill and to other changes

in the meantime. Because an estimate is necessary and because we cannot give the number with certainty, that does not discharge the House from attempting to form some idea of the dimensions of the problem at the time.<br/>
For our purpose we can fairly take London as a basis, for it is admitted on both sides that the problem is severest in London. If we can satisfy ourselves of the proportions in London, we can deal with the problem elsewhere <i>a fortiori.</i> I have taken two or three samples in the County of London, to see the present rate of derequisitioning, and what might be expected to be the effect of the Bill.<br/>
Take, for example, the Borough of Lewisham. The amount of requisitioning in Lewisham is about typical for the County of London as a whole. It has 17 families in requisitioned houses for every 1,000 of its population. Lewisham's figure is approximately in the middle between boroughs which are better off, with eight or nine families per 1,000, and those which are worse off, with 26 or 27 families. In the last quarter of 1954, 80 requisitioned premises were derequisitioned by the Lewisham Borough Council. During that quarter it took, on its own initiative, further decisions designed to increase the rate of derequisitioning, but it had already attained a rate of derequisitioning well in excess of 300 houses per annum.<br/>
We must now address ourselves to the question, what will be the effect of the provisions of the Bill upon the rate of derequisitioning? Obviously, some contribution will be made by Clauses 5 and 6. Cases of hardship will succeed under Clauses 5 and 6, but they cannot be numerically very great. We can expect from Clause 4, however, rather more than has been anticipated by some hon. Members who have spoken. I do not imagine that it will mostly be the owner of the individual house to which Clause 4 will appeal; but the owners, whether they be companies or individuals, of a consider able number of requisitioned houses will find the terms of Clause 4 by no means unattractive.<br/>
After all, they will get the compensation rental, plus the statutory deduction. They will get compensation for loss of vacant possession. They will also get at once the terminal compensation under the 1939 Act, instead of having to wait until the Greek Kalends for de-requisitioning.<br/>
For a company or owner possessing a number of houses, which, in any case, they will continue to let for income, these terms are not at all unattractive, especially as my hon. Friend the Member for Lewisham, North (Sir A. Hudson) reminded the House that many owners of requisitioned premises have been unwilling to see them derequisitioned because they find even the compensation rental alone a tolerable return on their capital. Therefore, a considerable value ought to be attributed to Clause 4 in accelerating the rate of derequisitioning. We may add to that that, in the next 12 months, while financial responsibility still lies wholly with the Government, local authorities will have a strong incentive to maximise the number of cases in which they can bring derequisitioning about.<br/>
Taking all these factors together and summing them up as the effect of the Bill, I think it is not unfair and not over-optimistic to expect from the Bill some thing like a 50 per cent, increase in the rate of derequisitioning. The effect in Lewisham&#x2014;to revert to the example which we were examining&#x2014;will be that the 3,500 families at present housed in requisitioned premises will have fallen to well under 1,000 by 1960, something in the region of 800. They will have been reduced to about a quarter of their present number, assuming only a 50 per cent, increase in the present rate of derequisitioning&#x2014;</p>

<p>Is not the hon. Member ignoring the fact that Lewisham, like many other London boroughs, has no further sites to build on and therefore will have to go in for slum clearance? This means that it cannot rehouse the requisitioned tenants while it has people waiting on its housing list.</p>

<p>I am merely applying what Lewisham is doing already 10 throw light on the consequences of the Bill, and to arrive at an estimate of the size of the problem in 1960. Let me take another borough in which the problem is almost as severe as it is in Poplar, from which the right hon. Gentleman who has just spoken comes.<br/>
In Westminster, there are 17 families in requisitioned accommodation for every 1,000 of the population. This is prac-

tically the same as in Poplar, where the number is 19 per 1,000. In the first nine months of 1954, 250 families living in requisitioned premises were re-accommodated by the Westminster City Council. If that rate, increased only by 50 per cent., goes on, there will be no requisitioned premises at all in Westminster some time before 1960.</p>

<p>It may be proved that the problem in 1960 is not as exaggerated as hon. Members opposite have tried to argue, but that is far from suggesting that there will be no problem to be dealt with in 1960, and far from suggesting that a modest acceleration in the rate of derequisitioning over the next five years is either uncalled for or impracticable.</p>

<p>I do not have to give the right hon. Gentleman the number of families in the borough. He would not know this, of course, but the formula happens not to be the number of families in requisitioned accommodation compared with the number of families in the borough. The formula which was adopted by the Working Party on Requisitioned Premises, and which is now universally treated as a fair formula for gauging the intensity of this problem is to compare the number of families in requisitioned property with the population of the borough.<br/>
The number of families in requisitioned property in Poplar on 30th September, 1954&#x2014;this was in HANSARD yesterday&#x2014; was 1,258 and the population of Poplar is approximately 73,000; so the right hon. Gentleman will be able to satisfy himself that there are approximately 18 to 19 families per 1,000 of population in requisitioned premises in Poplar. Therefore, the two cases which I have investigated &#x2014;the Borough of Lewisham where the figure is 15 and the City of Westminster where the figure is 17&#x2014;are not very different from that of his own borough.<br/>
I am not claiming that there are no extreme cases and that there are no boroughs where the rate of derequisitioning is far lower or where the number of families per 1,000 of population is much higher.</p>

<p>The hon. Member has told us what will happen on the basis of these representative boroughs if the rate of derequisitioning increased by 50 per cent. If he looks at the figures for London as a whole, and makes the same calculation at the end of five years, he will see that there will still be some 25,000 families, about half the present number, left unprovided for.</p>

<p>The hon. Member has anticipated the conclusion at which I was about to arrive. If the present rate of derequisitioning is accelerated, as I have argued, and if the hon. Member will accept my estimate for this purpose, by 50 per cent., we shall be left with under 20,000, about 18,000, families in 10,000 houses in the County of London. If the hon. Gentleman had not risen to make that intervention, that was precisely the deduction which I was about to draw and to buttress with the few cases which I have mentioned.<br/>
So the size of the problem in the County of London is likely to be that we shall have something under 20,000 families in 1960. Some hon. Members may think that below, some may think it above, the probable figure; but, at any rate, there will be about 20,000 families still in requisitioned premises in 1960.</p>

<p>That is the next question &#x2014;what is to happen? The Amendment says that the occupants of the requisitioned houses are to be evicted. That is what the Amendment thinks will happen to the families still in requisitioned premises in 1960. I have noticed that, in their speeches hon. Members opposite,

often take a very low view of the intelligence, competence and sense of duty of local authorities. They are asking the House to believe that local authorities which have the power to purchase these premises, or other premises in substitution for them, will deliberately neglect to do so, that over the five coming years they will make no preparations whatsoever for this eventuality, and that they will, in complete disregard of their statutory housing obligations, leave these people to become trespassers in 1960.<br/>
They have the powers to deal with it. They have additional powers conferred by the Bill. They have been given by this Bill the same financial assistance that they have in all their other housing operations. Yet hon. Members opposite are asking the House and the country to believe that the local authorities concerned will fall down on this part of their job.</p>

<p>Yes, that is undoubtedly the case under this Bill. What I also say is equally undoubtedly the case, that no local authority in London or elsewhere will allow that situation to arise when they have the power, as a last resort, to purchase these properties or other properties in lieu, and thus give people security of tenure, as great a security of tenure as has any other council tenant.</p>

<p>I certainly did not hear my hon. Friend say any such thing, but we can consult the record when it is available. The hon. Gentleman says, "Where will the premises be for acquisition." Well, here they are: they are the very premises in which these families will be accommodated in 1960. It has always seemed to me to be a very unsatisfactory situation for tenants that thousands of families should be housed by local authorities in premises for which the local authorities have no financial responsi-


bility, and which the local authorities have therefore, no incentive to put into a proper condition for lengthy occupation.</p>

<p>The power, as I am sure the hon. and learned Member will recollect, exists in Part V of the Housing Act, 1936, and the reference to action taken under that Act qualifying for Exchequer contributions will be found in Clause 9 (2) of the Bill.<br/>
I repeat that the burden of this Amendment is, in effect, an attack upon the

competence and the sense of duty of the local authorities concerned. This is an attack which all who know the way in which local housing authorities act will immediately repudiate. It is said that those housing authorities will so neglect to perform their duties, will so neglect their residual powers of compulsory acquisition that the tenants for whose housing they are responsible will be left stranded in 1960.<br/>
Hon. Members opposite may believe that, but few others will. Certainly, the Labour Party, which has a majority on the Metropolitan Boroughs Standing Joint Committee, did not take that view. Unless we take the low view of them held by the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Poplar they did, knowing what they were doing, welcome these as sound proposals, with sound financial conditions attached and recommended them.<br/>
This Bill ends a situation which every one really feels to be unsatisfactory. It will convert what always was a make-shift, one way or another, into the provision of permanent homes for the people who are at present in requisitioned property. The right hon. Gentleman the Member for Bishop Auckland said that it was impossible to wind up requisitioning in the next five years in the way which the Bill envisages. I have heard that word "impossible" "before. I remember the right hon. Gentleman and hon. Members opposite saying that it was impossible to build more than 200,000 houses a year. It is just because it has been possible to do so, that we have every confidence that this problem also will be dealt with&#x2014;and dealt with satisfactorily to the tenants as well as to the country&#x2014;in the next five years.</p>

In the opinion of myself and many others, the housing problem of today was brought about by neglect in the inter-war years as well as by wartime bombing. Another cause of the trouble is the planning of


the Labour Government in the first five years after the war, which has brought about continued full employment and enabled more people to get married. As long as houses are standing idle and thousands of people require them, those houses should be requisitioned for people to live in.</p>

When the Parliamentary Secretary opened this debate&#x2014;and I take this opportunity to thank him very much for allowing so many of us to interrupt him; he was very good about that&#x2014;he spoke of owners being prepared to allow a sitting tenant to become the tenant of the house under rent control. Either he glossed over the fact, or knows little about it, because in many large cities at present&#x2014;and certainly in Birmingham&#x2014;owners who, through derequisitioning, can get possession of their houses, and owners of other houses, are even offering money to tenants to get them out so that the houses can be sold at very high prices. The hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West would be astounded were I to tell him some of the ways and means which owners of property are using to get people out of the houses for that purpose.<br/>
I agree that London is the most seriously affected city, but Birmingham, too, is affected. It was bombed very badly during the war. I think it is second in the list of heavily bombed cities outside London. There are still more than 1,900 families living in requisitioned houses in Birmingham, even though we are de requisitioning about 200 houses a year. If this Measure is passed it will greatly aggravate Birmingham's housing problem

and will also slow up slum clearance. Like some of the other great cities, we are also getting to the end of our tether in house building. We cannot find sites. We shall probably be meeting the Minister about that quite soon. The Minister, who visited Birmingham not long ago, was able to see the house-building difficulties.<br/>
Birmingham has at present over 60,000 people on its housing register. A great proportion are still living in rooms, and the number of families affected grows every month. An hon. Member opposite said that this Government had never done anything to turn people into the street. This Government did nothing to help people when the Housing Repairs and Rents Bill was going through Parliament. They ignored our pleas for protection to be given to people living in rooms, who are being turned out and the judge can do nothing but give possession.<br/>
Compulsory derequisitioning will in crease the difficulties of the housing authorities. As has been said by my right hon. Friend the Member for Poplar (Mr. Key), the chances of people who have been on the housing register for as long as five, six and seven years will be reduced. On their due date they will find that there has been either an eviction or a derequisitioning. That will increase the number of people for whom houses must be found, and those on the register who were due for a house will lose their place in the housing queue.<br/>
It may be agreed that it still costs the Exchequer &#x00A3;4 or &#x00A3;5 million to subsidise these houses, but we should not and can not measure the lives and happiness of people in terms of a few pounds, shillings and pence. The Bill provides for local authorities to purchase houses when the owners so desire. I appreciate that there may be cases where the local authority may feel it undesirable to purchase property, but I wonder whether the Exchequer will make a grant towards the purchase of this property when local authorities wish to purchase it.<br/>
I believe that this Bill will do harm. It will interfere with the work of the housing authorities in dealing with cases which are already on the local authorities' registers, and many houses which are de requisitioned will be left vacant for considerable periods. In my constituency, the former Minister of Housing and Local Government did not direct that there


should be compulsory derequisitioning but he requested the local authority to derequisition.<br/>
I can show the present Minister a number of houses which, having been derequisitioned, have been vacant for six, nine, and in some cases twelve months, and they used to house two families and, in some cases, three families. Today, they are vacant and are waiting for someone to purchase them at the highest price. That is wrong. Just imagine that situation in a city where 60,000 people are on the housing list. The families from those houses had to jump the queue and take municipal houses in advance of people who were already on the register.<br/>
I do not wish to detain the House much longer; some hon. Members have already taken up too much time by interruption. I hope the Minister will have second thoughts. I hope he will recognise the damage that he is doing, will accept the Amendment, and will take the Bill back. I feel confident that local authorities would thank him for helping them by taking the Bill back. I am sure that my local authority has not agreed to the Bill. I believe that the Minister has had a deputation from the City of Birmingham on the subject of derequisitioning; if not, he is to have. I can show him the head lines of a Birmingham newspaper&#x2014;and not a Labour newspaper&#x2014;condemning de requisitioning because of the difficulty it would cause the housing management committee in that city.</p>

<p>I want to make only a very brief and modest contribution to this debate. But I do want to try to do two things. First, I want to welcome the Bill in general. It has been rightly called a "bare measure of tardy justice." That is the phrase used by "The Times." Hon. Members opposite may prefer the editorial columns of "The Surveyor" just at present, but I feel that in this case "The Times" has hit the nail on the head.<br/>
We have to recognise that the requisitioning of property and the continuance of property in a requisitioned state is a temporary and undesirable state of affairs. It cannot go on for ever. If we contemplate its going on for ever, or even for a very long time with no determined effort to check it, we accept the revolutionary doctrine that the central Government should be a housing authority.<br/>
Secondly, I want to address my attention to the astonishing Amendment which I find on the Order Paper. It refers to the Bill as
<q>a Bill which contemplates the eviction of occupants of requisitioned houses in 1960 without providing for their rehousing &#x2026;</q>
Now, I bring to this Bill a mind unencumbered by the experience which encumbers the minds of other hon. Members, many of whom have made notable contributions to this debate, and it struck me that, on the face of it, there were two quite astonishing things about the juxtaposition of this Bill and this Amendment. It seemed to me surprising that this Amendment should completely ignore the provisions in the Bill for ensuring that those people who are now in requisitioned premises should not be homeless in 1960.<br/>
It seems to me that there is a provision in Clause 4 whereby owners might offer tenancies to tenants at restricted rents. It seems to me, secondly, that in Clause 11 there is a provision whereby local authorities might themselves take leases of the houses and let them to tenants of whom they approve. It seems to me, thirdly, that in Clause 11 there is a provision whereby a local authority might itself purchase houses at vacant possession prices and accommodate therein the tenants who had been occupying those houses when requisitioned.<br/>
It may be debatable whether or not these Clauses are well conceived, but what


cannot be open to debate is the fact that they are in the Bill. Therefore, it is astonishing to find on the Order Paper an Amendment in the name of right hon. and hon. Members opposite, who have presumably read the Bill, saying that this Bill
<q>contemplates the eviction of occupants&#x2026;without providing for their rehousing.</q>
What astonishes me even more is this. If hon. Members opposite do, in fact, recognise that there are these provisions in the Bill, what they are saying is this, "We know there are provisions in the Bill which put certain responsibilities on the local authorities, but we do not believe the local authorities will carry them out." If the Bill does provide for the rehousing of tenants at present in requisitioned properties, then the Amendment is an insult to the capacity, integrity and humanity of local authorities throughout the kingdom.<br/>
It is on these two grounds that I want to draw attention to the patent <i>prima facie</i> absurdity of this Amendment. I do not know whether it is more deplorable that it should have escaped the attention of hon. Members opposite that there are these provisions, or that they should think that local authorities are unfit to carry them out. Not only does this Bill put upon local authorities certain responsibilities but it appeals for its effectiveness to the ultimate sanction, which is public opinion, which, in turn, is responsible for the election of local authorities. I therefore submit that this Amendment is mischievous, insulting and ill-conceived, and I hope that my right hon. Friend will be heartened by the encouragement which we give him on this side of the House to proceed with a timely and well-conceived Measure.</p>

<p>I was drawing the hon. Member's attention and that of the House to Part V of the Housing Act, 1936, which, in terms, gave local authorities power to acquire existing houses for carrying out their housing functions. As my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Powell) emphasised, they can do so compulsorily; that is a power here and now.</p>

<p>I am sorry, but as far as I recall the 1936 Housing Act there are two powers&#x2014;power to acquire land compulsorily for the purposes of building new houses and power to buy houses by negotiation.

<p>I have already studied both of these Acts. I think the hon. Member will recollect that when we discussed the Housing Repairs and Rents Act we minutely examined the provisions of both the 1936 and the 1949 Act. I persist in saying that there is no such pro vision for compulsory purchase. Certainly, if there is, it is never exercised, and I should have thought that was sufficient proof. All that this Bill does is


to enable local authorities to invite the landlord to sell. There is nothing in the Bill which suggests compulsory powers. If such a right were to be given, presumably it would be specifically mentioned, and it is not.<br/>
My hon. and learned Friend the Member for Kettering (Mr. Mitchison) specifically asked this question: if the land lord does not consent to one of these courses of action, what will happen to the tenant in 1960? The answer is that he will be a trespasser and can be turned out. It is true that the local authority can then make provision for him out of its pool of houses and, as a consequence, he as an individual will not suffer, but people who are waiting on the housing lists will suffer.</p>

<p>I thank the hon. Member for giving way so courteously and I am sorry to interrupt him after he has given way several times. He was commenting on the point which I made in my speech. He said, quite rightly, that the provision for allowing the tenancies to continue depended on the landlord's consent, but I submit to the House that he has overlooked the point which I made with reference to Clause 11 in which it is laid down that local authorities may, in the open market at vacant possession prices, purchase other houses wherein they may accommodate tenants who have been turned out.<br/>
It is necessary to have the three stages in mind whereby these arrangements can be made&#x2014;first, to persuade an owner to accept a tenant; secondly, to obtain a lease and accommodate tenants in a leased house; and, thirdly, to buy a house on the open market. If local authorities apply all three stages they are bound at some time to reach a satisfactory conclusion.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1955-02-15a.247.1" hansard_membership_id="12149" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/20650" speakername="Mr. Silverman" colnum="247" time="">
<p>What the hon. Gentle man has just said amounts to a complete withdrawal of his argument. He now adds that it is possible for a local authority to buy other houses. Of course it is; that has always been so, if the authority is prepared to buy at the ridiculous scarcity values existing at present. Of course authorities can buy houses at prices which give enormous profits to owners. That has always been possible. But that will not solve the problem of these tenants.<br/>
I want the House to consider what the position will be in such a city as Birmingham. The problem in Birmingham may not be as bad as that in London but perhaps I may show how bad it is likely to be. There are now almost 1,900 requisitioned houses in Birmingham. It means that under the provisions of the Bill they will have to be derequisitioned at a rate of 400 per annum.<br/>
At present, about 3,000 municipal houses a year are being built in Birmingham. Of these, about 2,000 are required for slum clearance, for other priority considerations such as evictions or tuberculosis cases, demolitions or such special cases as that; which means that the general pool for lettings of houses, together with re-lets, will be about 1,500 per annum.<br/>
Thus, almost one out of every four of the inadequate number of houses at present being provided for tenants on the register&#x2014;60,000 in all, with more than 30,000 lodger applicants, with families-will be taken for the purposes of providing accommodation for tenants of derequisitioned houses.<br/>
This is an extremely serious problem for a city like Birmingham, with an in creasing population and with a steadily diminishing area of land available for building&#x2014;an area which will have disappeared completely within the next three or four years. It means that many of the applicants on Birmingham's housing register will have to wait many more years because of this piece of legislation.<br/>
I think that the terms of the Amendment are entirely justified. This is entirely a landlords' Measure which provides in every respect for the needs of the land lord. It provides no security whatever for the tenant and it makes no provision not only for the present tenants of these houses but also for the inflated registers of many of the large cities, containing the names of thousands of people who are waiting for houses and at whose expense this Bill will be carried out.</p>

<p>I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Erdington (Mr. J. Silverman) will forgive me if I do not follow him in his argument and that my English colleagues will forgive me if I take up six or seven minutes to deal specifically with


Clause 16, which concerns itself with the proposals of the Government for Scotland.<br/>
Since the Joint Under-Secretary of State for Scotland is here, I wish to ask him the reason for the insertion of this Clause in the Bill. I may be told that the Public Accounts Committee recommended to the Treasury that Government advances to the Scottish Special Housing Association should be subject to statutory limitation so that Parliament could exercise control. But I think I would be right in asserting that in making that recommendation the Committee did not lay down any specific period to which the statutory limitation referred.<br/>
If the answer is that the Government has been guided by the recommendation of the Public Accounts Committee, I want to be assured that this Clause has not been inserted with some other motive. Perhaps I might not be very short of the mark if I suggested that one of the reasons for the inclusion of the Clause is a desire on the part of the present Government to lessen, if not entirely to abolish, the activities of the Scottish Special Housing Association.<br/>
The right hon. and gallant Gentleman will remember that at the beginning of last year he received representations from the Scottish National Building Trades Federation and the Federation of Civil Engineering Contractors, Scottish Section, who expressed a desire that the activities of this Government-sponsored body, with its direct labour department, should be considerably reduced. In answering Questions in this House in April last year, the right hon. and gallant Gentleman indicated quite clearly that he was cognisant of those representations and assured us that there would be no lessening of the activities of the Scottish Special Housing Association.<br/>
I want to give one or two figures which would appear to indicate that there has been a considerable lessening of the activities of this Government-sponsored body. Since 1952, the number of houses under construction has decreased each year. In the direct labour department the number of houses under construction has decreased in the last three years. The number of employees in the employment of that department has gone down from a little over 2,000 to about 1,300. The proposals in the Bill seek to limit the financial advances made by the Secretary

of State for Scotland to the Scottish Special Housing Association to a sum not exceeding &#x00A3;75 million.<br/>
I ask the Joint Under-Secretary what period had he in mind when he included that sum in the present Bill? Was it to cover a period of three, four, five, or seven years? From an analysis I have made from the annual report of that body I find that the total capital expenditure, which fairly represents the total advances made by the Government, in 1953 stood at &#x00A3;42 million. In 1954, it went up to &#x00A3;50 million and it is safe to assume from those figures that next month the total capital expenditure will exceed &#x00A3;60 million. Those figures reveal that in a period of less than two years we shall have reached the figure of &#x00A3;75 million. What, therefore, is the purpose of including a provision of this kind in this Bill?<br/>
If the Scottish Special Housing Association is to plan properly ahead it will have to be given some assurance, probably at the end of next year, that a further sum is to be guaranteed to it. Do I understand that the right hon. and gallant Gentleman will be coming to Parliament next year and asking for an additional &#x00A3;25 million for this organisation? If that is the purpose he has in mind it would seem to be a stupid procedure and a waste of Parliamentary time. Surely he could have included a provision in the Bill which would have carried the Association over the next six, seven, or eight years instead of placing it almost on an annual basis.<br/>
Has the Joint Under-Secretary included this figure in the Bill to placate the building trade employers and civil engineers who made those representations to him? Incidentally, those representations were made through the Tory Central Office. The employers' organisations desire very much that this Government-sponsored body should go out of existence altogether. I hope that the right hon. and gallant Gentleman will always remember the words he used in a letter to the Tory Central Office. They were:
<q>It is essential that the Government should have some independent means of checking prices such as is provided by the Scottish Special Housing Association which worked in the closest co-operation with my Department. It will be appreciated that Scotland derives great advantage from the Scottish Special Housing Association in that it provides houses


for the local authorities in hard hit areas with out any charge on local rates. A widespread attitude of hostility by the employers in Scot land to the Association might well result in the loss of this additional Exchequer help to Scotland, a prospect which is not to be con templated lightly.</q>
I hope that the right hon. and gallant Gentleman will very adequately and fully explain why he has taken the opportunity of this Bill to make the provision instead of in other Scottish housing Bills which already have been dealt with. The Public Accounts Committee recommendation was made as far back as 1953. This proposal could have been included in at least two Scottish housing Bills since then. I am told that the right hon. and gallant Gentleman did not want to include it because those Bills were of a controversial nature&#x2014;as if this Bill is not of a controversial nature.<br/>
Quite sincerely, I wonder what is the purpose of taking the opportunity of including a Clause of this kind, which has absolutely no connection with requisitioning and things of that kind, in this Bill. It seems a very sudden move on the part of the Government to lose the Clause, as it were, in the complexities and intricacies of the Bill as a whole. I hope that the right hon. and gallant Gentleman will be honest and tell us precisely what he had in mind when he included the Clause in the Bill.</p>

<p>Perhaps it would be for the convenience of the House if I intervened at this stage to deal briefly with the Scottish aspect of this Bill, and also with the observations of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Central (Mr. McInnes) when I deal with Clause 16.<br/>
In opening the debate this afternoon, my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Housing and Local Government explained that the main purpose of the Bill was to provide for the transfer of requisitioned houses to local authorities for a limited period of five years, after which their right to hold these houses would cease. The provision effecting this transfer and making other related arrangements are contained in Part I of the Bill. The House will have noted from Clause

20 that Part I, with the exception of Clause 14, does not apply to Scotland. The reason is that the number of houses now under requisition in Scotland no longer presents a problem of any magnitude.<br/>
In the immediate post-war years considerable use was made of powers under Defence Regulation 51 to take possession of properties for housing purposes. The peak of requisitioning was reached in 1949, when 2,354 properties, containing 3,565 separate dwellings, were under requisition. In that year, the then Secretary of State for Scotland, who at that time was the right hon. Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. Woodburn), in view of the powers which had been conferred on local authorities by the Housing (Scotland) Act, 1949, decided not to authorise further requisitioning for housing purposes, except in the most exceptional circumstances, and also that the process of unwinding the requisitioning scheme should be begun by the return of properties to owners.<br/>
Since then, no properties have been requisitioned for housing purposes, and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has been pressing local authorities to release to owners properties which they have held on requisition. The result is that the problem has practically disappeared. At the moment, only 74 houses in Scotland are under requisition, and I expect that by the autumn of this year all but a mere handful of this residue will have been released. In these circum stances, my right hon. Friend felt that it was unnecessary to apply to Scotland the new powers contained in Clauses 1 to 14 of the Bill.<br/>
I do not want, however, to disguise the fact that there may be a small number of houses in remote areas, where alternative accommodation is difficult to come by, which will remain under requisition after the date when the Bill reaches the Statute Book. Until that small hard core has also been released, which, I hope, may be possible by the end of this year or early in 1956, the power of the Secretary of State under Defence Regulation 51 to hold requisitioned properties for housing purposes must be preserved. That is achieved in Clause 14 (2) of the Bill.<br/>
I should like to take this opportunity of thanking the local authorities for the very effective co-operation which they have given to my Department in an effort to


solve this difficult problem. When building materials were scarce and the number of new houses which could be built was, therefore, limited, the Department of Health for Scotland made special allocations of houses to some of the local authorities to assist them to rehouse families who were occupying requisitioned premises. Apart from that, how ever, the local authorities by themselves have made very special efforts to hasten the return of requisitioned houses to their owners, and it is right that I should acknowledge that in this House.<br/>
The other provisions in the Bill which apply to Scotland are contained in Part II, in Clauses 15,16, and 17. My hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary referred to the object of Clause 15, which deals with the period of the repayment of sums issued from the Consolidated Fund to meet the cost of the temporary housing scheme under the 1944 Act. The Clause, in effect, deals with a purely accounting technicality, and I want to make it abundantly clear that the change relates solely to the central arrangements for repayment of the sums which have been issued from the Consolidated Fund to meet the cost of the manufacture and erection of the temporary houses. The existing financial arrangements between the Exchequer and the local authorities in connection with the temporary housing scheme remain unaltered by the Clause.<br/>
Now, I come to Clause 16, with which the hon. Member for Glasgow, Central, was concerned. As the hon. Member said, the Clause imposes a statutory limitation on the amount of the advances made from the Consolidated Fund to the Scottish Special Housing Association. I assure the hon. Member that the limitation is included in the Bill following the recommendations contained in the Report of the Public Accounts Committee.<br/>
The Scottsh Special Housing Association's operations have all along been subject to effective administrative control by my Department, which has to determine the size of the building programme and the areas where the houses are to be built. The cost of the houses which are to be built on any site has been subject to the Department's approval in the same way as the cost of local authority houses.<br/>
In its Report for 1952&#x2013;53, the Public Accounts Committee drew attention to the absence of any statutory limit to the

advances which could be made to the Association out of the Consolidated Fund, and recommended that a limit should be imposed so that, as the hon. Member rightly said, there might be Parliamentary, as distinct from Depart mental, control over the Association's operations. The limit imposed by the Clause is &#x00A3;75 million, which covers the advances which have been made hitherto, amounting to &#x00A3;52 million. When the balance of &#x00A3;23 million which remains is approaching exhaustion, I have no doubt that Parliament will be asked to consider the extent to which the limit should be raised to permit the Association to continue with its work.</p>

<p>That may be so, but does not the Clause put it in such a difficult form that a new Act of Parliament will be needed to increase the amount? Would it not have been sufficient to make provision for it to be done by Statutory Instrument, so that it would come before Parliament in that way and not as a Bill, for which it might be difficult to find time? It would have been better to do it administratively and to get the consent of Parliament to alter the sum in the same way as is done under many other Acts of Parliament.</p>

<p>The right hon. and gallant Gentleman said that he will consider the point made by my right hon. Friend, but if we pass the Money Resolution tonight will it not be too late to give further thought to it if an alteration is necessary to provide for the kind of arrangement which my right hon.

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1955-02-15a.254.3" speakerid="unknown" speakername="Commander Galbraith" colnum="254" time="">
<p>It may be that the hon. Member is right&#x2014;I am not commenting upon that; but surely, opportunities will be found for doing as I have suggested, so that Parliament is invited to consider the extent to which the limit which is now imposed should be raised.<br/>
I know that hon. Members on both sides of the House are very interested in the contribution which the Scottish Special Housing Association has made


to the solution of the housing problem in Scotland, and I am glad to tell the House that since the war the Association has provided some 30,000 houses. These have been built in the areas of greatest need. In addition, many thousand houses have been provided to meet the needs of miners who have been transferred from dying to expanding coalfields.<br/>
I want to make it perfectly clear that what is proposed in Clause 16 is not to be interpreted as involving a limitation of the Scottish Special Housing Association's housing programme, which will continue at its present level in the meantime. The hon. Member for Glasgow, Central drew my attention to a number of facts which seemed to him to indicate that there was an intention to reduce the Association's activities. The simple explanation is that the reduction in the number of men employed from 2,000 to 1,500 on the direct labour side arises through the cessation of traditional building and the turnover by the Association to the building of the no-fines types of house, with all the mechanical equipment which that involves, which has resulted in fewer people being required to be employed on the job.<br/>
Clause 17 provides for the extension to schools and other educational buildings of the power to relax building regulations. This gives effect to a recommendation of the Select Committee on Estimates in its Report for 1952&#x2013;53. Educational building work in England and Wales has long had statutory ex emption from the local by-laws, and in Scotland the Secretary of State has had powers for many years to relax the building regulations in the case of housing. These regulations include not only local building by-laws, which I am glad to say are in most towns in Scotland drawn in accordance with modern ideas, but also statutory provisions which go back as far as 1892. It is these provisions which are found to be acting as a very serious obstruction to the introduction of modern ideas and methods.<br/>
The need to comply with these regulations makes the development of some new methods of school construction virtually impossible at present, or so costly as to make it difficult for education authorities to provide schools by these new methods at reasonable cost. The Guest Committee

on Building Legislation is examining the whole question of bringing these statutory provisions up to date, but the completion of the Committee's Report and the passing of any legislation that may follow will necessarily take considerable time. The substantial expansion of the school-building programme which is now in progress means that we must make some interim measure of relief available.<br/>
The Clause will not give overall exemption from by-laws with regard to all new schools, nor does it in any way compel education authorities to reduce their standards of construction. It will, how ever, enable education authorities to adopt methods of construction which it would have been difficult or impossible to use under existing regulations. I assure the House that approval will not be given to any proposals which do not fully safe guard educational standards and, what is more important, the safety and health of the pupils and staffs.</p>

<p>Surely Clause 17 is de signed for the specific purpose which the right hon. and gallant Gentleman says he is attempting to avoid, that is, to reduce standards. That is what has been holding up approval by his own Department and education authorities. After hearing the right hon. and gallant Gentleman, I am more convinced than ever that Clauses 16 and 17 ought to form part of another Bill.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1955-02-15a.256.1" speakerid="unknown" speakername="Commander Galbraith" colnum="256" time="">
<p>The hon. Member is of a very suspicious turn of mind. I can only explain the truth and the facts. If he is so suspicious and he cannot accept that, there is nothing I can do about it. The fact is that Clause 17 is introduced into the Bill because it is essential that we should get on with school building. In that connection, I remind the hon. Member that the programme is very nearly twice as big in value as it was last year.<br/>
It is quite obvious that Scotland's interest in the Bill is considerably less than that of England and Wales, but the pro visions as they apply to Scotland are useful provisions. I hope, therefore, that the House will approve them. I commend them to the House.</p>

<p>I find it a somewhat sombre thought that, whereas in the whole of Scotland there are only 73 requisitioned


premises, in my unfortunate constituency of West Ham there are 2,300. Nevertheless, I shall try not to make the amount of time I shall take equally disproportionate. We have heard from the Government benches about four or five speeches. None of them has left us on this side of the House one jot happier about the fate of the licensees of requisitioned houses as from 1st April, 1960. We want some specific answers from the Government Front Bench to some specific questions.<br/>
Are they saying, as some hon. Gentle men opposite have said, that the Government propose to encourage local authorities to use compulsory powers as from 1st April, 1960, to acquire houses, if it be necessary even requisitioned houses? That is a specific question to which we want a direct answer. There is a great deal of doubt among the lawyers as to what are the precise powers of local authorities under the various Acts to which references have been made. What is clear from the Bill, at any rate, is that it certainly gives no compulsory power to the local authority.<br/>
Clause 4 is perfectly clear. It states:
<q>Any local authority, shall, if so required by the Minister, serve on the owners of such requisitioned dwellings as he may specify &#x2026; a notice inviting those owners to accord to the licensees of the dwellings the status of statutory tenants &#x2026;</q>
That is how it stands. How different are the provisions of Clause 4 from the pro visions of Clause 6, where it is said that
<q>If the Minister is satisfied, on representations made to him by the owner of any requisitioned house &#x2026; that the owner will suffer severe hardship unless he is enabled either to obtain vacant possession of the house or to dispose of his interest therein &#x2026; the Minister may give directions to the local authority requiring them &#x2026; to release the house to the owner &#x2026;</q>
The contrast is all too vivid.<br/>
If the answer is that we do not need to put in this Bill the fact that local authorities have all the necessary compulsory powers and we shall authorise and en courage them to use those compulsory powers, let it be said from the Front Bench opposite. I noticed that the Parliamentary Secretary was extremely non committal about it. If he cares to answer that specific question now I am willing to sit down, but I expect that he will not happily accept that invitation. He is a new Minister and, if I may say so, a most

competent one, and I do not want to harass him about this matter, but we shall wait with great interest the words of the Minister on this subject at the end of the debate.<br/>
There is another big imponderable which has put the House in great difficulty in discussing the Bill at all. It is the question of financial provisions. It is no use saying to West Ham, "You have powers already under other Acts to acquire houses compulsorily." There are two difficulties. The first is the simple physical fact that there are no houses to acquire, a physical fact which escaped all the intellectual ingenuity of the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Powell). There is also the simple financial fact that there is not the money in the "kitty," if I may use a non-Parliamentary expression. It is no use putting a series of 25 per cent, obligations on an impoverished community like West Ham which has one of the highest rates in the country. It cannot be done.<br/>
It is not a question of our suggesting that local authorities are lacking in humanity. It is nothing of the kind. Of course they are not. The local councillors have these desperate problems on their doorsteps every day of their lives and we unfortunate Members of Parliament get the backwash of them every time we go to our constituencies.<br/>
West Ham is admittedly exceptional and I am not seeking to draw a general picture from its problem, but it is more general than the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West has con ceded. Nevertheless, I am concerned with the fact that to the specific area of West Ham the all-important question is: what formula will be applied by the Minister in interpreting Clause 10 (2), which states:
<q>If the Minister is satisfied in the case of any local authority that the additional burden placed on their rates in consequence of the provisions of this Part of this Act &#x2026; is greater than is reasonable, he may &#x2026; make to them a special grant &#x2026;"?</q>
What is the test?<br/>
Is the test the size of the problem? Is it the impoverishment of the local authority? We really should not have been left in the dark about this in the course of the debate. We all observed it and I must make this comment&#x2014;that it was most unsatisfactory for the Minister to be appearing to encourage the Parliamentary Secretary to avoid dealing with this pro-


blem by saying, "I will deal with all this at the end of the debate." That was of no assistance to us in considering this matter and so we are in the dark as to what is financially involved. What I suspect it will involve is a wholly inadequate financial provision for these unfortunate blitzed areas, which will once more be left to "hold the baby"&#x2014;again I am using an unparliamentary expression.<br/>
During the war, blitzed areas such as West Ham had the great privilege of visits by the Prime Minister. They were the most vital areas as far as the morale of the people of Britain was concerned. They were hailed as heroes of the resistance of the people of Britain&#x2014;they were the personification of it. If their morale had cracked we should have been in dangerous straits as a little island.<br/>
These areas, which we represent in the House in this debate and whose cause we are seeking to advocate, if we were to have another war, would be the blitzed areas again. They are the key centres of the economic and industrial life of Britain. And how shabbily they have been treated since the war. From time to time the West Ham authority has been given special grants, but those grants are coming to an end, the last one is being made this year. And, unless the interpretation of Clause 10 (2) is to be generous, once more the nation will be passing on to a little local community of hard-pressed people responsibilities which the nation, through the Exchequer, ought to carry.<br/>
I say, further, that the effect of this Bill on an area like West Ham will be merely to perpetuate the slums. For what is the local authority to do? First, it has no means to acquire an unlimited number of houses; secondly, there are not the houses there. So what is it to do with these 2,300 families, a large proportion of whom will still be on their hands as licensees on 1st April, 1960? In my submission, the optimism of the hon. Gentleman the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West about the high percentage of those now in requisitioned premises who will have acquired the status of statutory tenants by 1960, is greatly exaggerated.<br/>
In my view, there is no foundation for it and, therefore, it means that if the West Ham authority by 1st April, 1960, has to house these thousands of families

living in requisitioned premises the first to suffer will be those now on the priority list. There are about 13,000 families on the West Ham priority list at present and there are thousands and thousands of others on the general list with no hope of being rehoused. Many are in squalid, miserable homes, breeding disease and ill-health and being denied all that we have sought to achieve in this House in the last fifteen years in the way of bringing decent social conditions to our people.<br/>
Those problems will be accentuated by this Bill, not relieved. What is used to rehouse the inhabitants of the requisitioned premises must be denied to those who are living in slum conditions. What are the Government going to do to help these people? How does this Bill help the areas most affected? It will make a great political demonstration in Bourne mouth and Sussex. This will be yet another blow struck for the freedom of the property owner. The Tory Party has been described as the party of landlords and the landladies and this Bill is, in deed, a manifestation of that old and, we were hoping, somewhat qualified tradition; but here it comes once again.<br/>
If the Bill is intended to deal with the question of requisitioning where it is most acute, then it does not tackle it, and I ask the Government to look at it again unless they are to be accused of the most appalling cynicism when they call for a crusade to clear the slums. Do they really mean that, because this Bill will perpetuate the slums in areas where the biggest concentration of them exists?</p>

<p>The hon. and learned Gentleman the Member for West Ham, South (Mr. Elwyn Jones) referred to an area where this problem is admittedly most acute, but he did not refer to Clause 3 (2) of the Bill, which was presumably inserted specially for that type of area. By that provision, the Minister has power, upon representations made to him before the five years are up, to retain under requisition houses in any area. So if there be an area where the local authority cannot deal with the situation within five years, it can be dealt with by retaining requisition, which only goes to show that the Bill covers all possible cases.</p>

<p>Is not the hon. and learned Gentleman aware of the fact that even before this Bill is passed the Minister&#x2014; in the case of West Ham, which my hon. and learned Friend was quoting&#x2014;will not even now grant requisitioning powers? So if he will not do it now, how does the hon. Member think it will be done in five years from now?</p>

<p>It is not a question of granting new powers but of retaining premises already requisitioned. The hon. Gentleman need not be so worried about the feelings of the Minister, who is well capable of looking after West Ham&#x2014;and East Ham as well.<br/>
This Bill is welcome because, unfortunately, if requisitioning were allowed to go on for too long a period it might become part of our national existence, which would be a bad principle. It is now 10 years since the end of the war and since the houses of these people were taken, contrary to their wishes&#x2014;often causing great hardship to people who had saved up to buy those houses&#x2014;and they were denied all access to their own property. Is it to be said that the extension of that practice is to be encouraged by the House? I think not.<br/>
Requisitioning may have been vitally necessary in 1945 when there was no building going on, when a great deal of property had been destroyed, and when the problem was probably more acute than it had ever been in this country. But those days are over, and this Bill must be read in conjunction with the building progress that has been made since the war and, may I add, particularly since 1951. There are still five years to go before the guillotine falls and in that time there cannot be fewer than l&#x00BD; million new dwellings built.</p>

<p>I am sorry that hon. Gentlemen opposite are so disappointed at seeing so many houses being built. I can well understand their disappointment, owing to their failure to build houses themselves.<br/>
The Bill will ease a great hardship for many people. If one looks at the provisions made for those at present in occupation of other people's property by reason of reacquisition, one sees that they are considerable. I have examined them carefully. I see that there is power to negotiate with the owners of that property to accept the occupiers as tenants under a statutory tenancy. Whether that will be a success remains to be seen. As long as we continue to subsidise people in other people's houses by making the landlords charge what are really only pre war rents, it is not likely that the Clause will have very wide application.<br/>
The Clause which deals with the purchase of houses at present occupied is the crux of the Bill. It is all wrong that for 10 years people's property should be occupied by others against the owners' will. It is right that those who continue to live in that property should negotiate with the owners for its sale on the basis of vacant occupation&#x2014;not at any inflated value but at a fair market value. If that is done, and there are five years in which to do it, it will be the proper way to settle the problem.<br/>
I should like the Minister, when he replies, to deal fully with that aspect, and say how he proposes that these negotiations should be carried out. Will it be done by ordinary notice to treat, or will the matter go to arbitration in order that


a settlement is arrived at as to what is a fair market value for the freehold of the property? If that were done tomorrow in regard to these houses the question would be solved. If these occupiers desire to remain in the houses, and the local councils desire them to remain there, that is an end to the whole question. That, as I say, is the real crux of the whole Bill.<br/>
I am surprised to see that an Amendment has been put down for the rejection of this very excellent Bill, which personally I commend to the House. It says:
<q>That this House declines to give a Second Reading to a Bill which contemplates the eviction of occupants of requisitioned houses in 1960 without providing for their rehousing and, while protecting landlords from special hard ship, gives no similar protection to occupiers.</q>
The Amendment is entirely incorrect and untrue.</p>

<p>While I do not consider that the financial provisions of this Bill are its most important part, I must refer again to the vagueness of Clause 10 (2) and press this point on the Minister, because as a member of two local authorities I am not entirely unaware of the negotiations that have been taking place. As I understand the representatives of the local authority associations suggested to the Minister that the discretionary grants payable by the Minister should not be left entirely to his discretion but should be based on a formula. The Associations

have sent proposals for such a formula, and the Minister stated that, whilst he could not give any undertaking about the Government's administration of an Act which had not been presented to Parliament, nevertheless he considered that the proposals were not unreasonable.<br/>
It is extraordinary that local authorities cannot be told about a formula because it has not been put before Parliament, and Parliament cannot be told about it because it has not been communicated to the local authorities. We are in a most extraordinary position, and I hope that before this debate concludes this will be cleared up. It would have been for the convenience of the House if information about the formula had been given to us at the beginning of our discussions today.<br/>
I promised to be very brief, but I must say I think the hon. and learned Gentle man the Member for Surrey, East (Mr. Doughty) must get a little clearer his facts about the sad story of the owner-occupier. Those are the cases which always get the maximum publicity and which, of course, appeal to the feelings of us all. But the Requisitioned Property Owners' Association does not claim that more than 10 per cent, of the people who own requisitioned property fall into this category. By far the largest number are not owned by people who are willing to live in them themselves. The local authority with which I have long been connected has taken a most sympathetic and helpful attitude wherever possible about de requisitioning in cases of genuine hardship of an owner who wants to take over possession himself. The fact that 61,000 properties have been derequisitioned suggests that local authorities have not been unreasonable.<br/>
The difficulty in central London is far more with the owner of streets and streets of houses, with the speculator and with the investment trust. We have some experience of what happens when houses are derequisitioned. We have heard some very rosy prophecies from hon. Members opposite about the kindness and good ness with which landlords will consider the needs of tenants when this Bill be comes law. In my experience&#x2014;and may I be forgiven for saying that I have been chairman of a housing committee in St. Pancras and am a member of the housing committee of the London County Council&#x2014;what happens when places are derequisitioned falls under two heads.<br/>
We have derequisitioned several houses where the Minister has told us that we could not spend the money which we thought was necessary for repairs. He said, "You cannot spend this public money on repairs, you must derequisition the house." We have done that, and I could take hon. Members opposite round St. Pancras and show them these houses still standing empty and unrepaired. I, for one, would like the powers of requisitioning not brought to an end but extended and strengthened, because it is a bitter injustice to the people of this country, particularly to the people of London, that there should be empty properties while there is such human misery in homelessness.<br/>
The second result of derequisitioning has been not that the poor war widow or the wounded ex-Service man about whom we have heard so much, enters rightly into the occupation of his or her own hearth and home, but that the speculators, who own the majority of this property, put a piece of lino and a table and a chair in each of the rooms and let these houses not as units of accommodation but room by room as furnished accommodation for two or three guineas a week. That is what we are to encourage even further. That is what this Bill enables owners of hundreds and hundreds of houses in London to do.<br/>
Why hon. Members opposite should imagine that, instead of letting these houses with bits of furniture at the rate of two or three guineas per room per week, the landlords are to keep on the council tenants as statutory tenants at controlled rents I simply cannot under stand. It must be due to their lack of experience of landlords in London.<br/>
Then there is the matter of going to court on this subject, and we shall have to ask the Minister to consult his colleagues in the Government on the question of legal aid for these people. At present, there is no legal aid in the county courts and the police courts, which means that the tenants, who are usually the poorer people, in these circumstances are at a disadvantage.<br/>
What is also not clear in Clause 6 is what is to happen to the tenant when the court has to give possession to the landlord. Is there a statutory duty on the local authority to rehouse, or is it just a question of the local authority in

its kindness and goodness trying to put these people somewhere at the expense of another desperate family? We must have a clear answer to that and I would recommend the Minister to see his right hon. Friend the Minister of Pensions and National Insurance about these cases, because there will be a need for vast increases in Part III accommodation under the National Assistance Act.<br/>
Many of us have been rather local in our speeches and I hope that the House will forgive any parochialism that is creeping into this debate, but I feel that it is our duty to put the cases of our constituencies even at the risk of seeming repetitious to hon. Members opposite. Perhaps I may for a moment mention Holborn, which I have the honour to represent.<br/>
During the war, at least 650 homes were lost in the little Borough of Holborn. Since the war, 266 have been built. We have not yet come near to making good the losses of the war. Now we are told that we must derequisition 924 units which are an essential part of our housing accommodation. Some hon. Members opposite have said that there is all this wonderful new building going on. May I tell the House to how many new dwellings the Minister has consented in Holborn? He has approved the erection of 14 new flats in Holborn.</p>

<p>That is not true, certainly not of past or present Ministers. We are hoping that there will be further development in this area, but we must ask the Minister for special consideration. Sites are running out and there is very little land and we cannot, faced with this derequisitioning Bill, possibly build accommodation for 924 families.<br/>
The answer comes from the other side, "What about the new towns and out county housing estates?" I know there is no lack of courage opposite and per-


haps if I went with the Minister, he would agree to go to Covent Garden and tell some of the Covent Garden porters who live in Holborn that they should live in Boreham Wood, or Harlow. We have to recognise that many people are tied to central London, to these boroughs about which we have been talking, by their jobs and by the vital contribution they make through their work to the community. That makes it impossible for these other remedies to take effect.<br/>
In St. Pancras we have been a little more fortunate in that we have by now just about overtaken our war damage, but we are left with 7,000 desperate applications in our housing list. We have tried to acquire some requisitioned houses, but it takes at least six months in each case, or even more, and 1 hope that if the Minister wants local authorities to be encouraged in this activity, he will try to speed up the machinery to do it.<br/>
What the Bill really says to us is that for years and years there must be a stand still on our waiting lists. We have got to turn all our new accommodation to meeting this problem. We are put in a position where we will never be able to get people out of damp basements, often where we have children coming into dangerous con tact with tuberculosis. All we get is a Bill which is completely a landlord's Bill. If one reads it carefully, and I have tried to read very carefully, always it is a question of whether or not the landlord agrees to keeping the tenant, agrees to sell his house, agrees to leave his house. The local authority, with the best will in the world, has no powers of compulsion and will certainly not be able to deal with the problem.<br/>
We are throwing back on to the families involved our own bankruptcy in dealing with the problem. The Bill is a completely unnecessary Bill, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Bishop Auckland (Mr. Dalton) made clear. Two years ago we had a Working Party Report in which it was recommended that local authorities which had more than two families per 1,000 of the population in requisitioned premises should be asked to make the maximum possible reductions year by year.<br/>
The fact that 61,000 premises have been de-requisitioned shows that local authorities were trying to carry out the

spirit of that recommendation. I am sure that if we could have carried on in that way, with local authorities being helpful in cases of genuine hardship, we would have dealt with the problem in a much more humane, fair and just manner.</p>

<p>I am sure that the House will have listened with care to the very persuasive and effective speech which has just been made by the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South (Mrs. L. Jeger). I thought that she was not quite right when she said that a large housing programme would not have its effect on the boroughs in London and in outer London. There is bound to be movement. While it is true that a number of people are tied to their jobs there will be movement of children to different areas as they grow up, and there they will follow their occupations.<br/>
Certainly there must be a greater movement to the expanded towns and the new towns which are being constructed for that very purpose. A difference will be made by the fact that by the time the guillotine falls by 1960 there should be another 1&#x00BE; million new houses, and there is bound to be a movement in our population which will be wholly helpful.</p>

<p>I am glad the hon. Gentleman mentioned that, because it will be the whole purport of my speech later, if he will bide his time and wait in patience.<br/>
I rather hope that we shall hear from the benches opposite the extent of the housing programme which they would undertake. Are they still wedded to their 200,000 houses a year, which was their maximum at the last General Election, or do they now recognise the fact that we can, under a Conservative Government, get 350,000 new houses each year? By 1960 that will make a difference of &#x00BE; million new houses. Under the Conservative programme, we shall get 1&#x00BE; million and under the Socialist programme only 1 million, according to the programme the party opposite put forward at the last Election. That must make a very big difference to the movement of the population.<br/>
I represent a borough which has some very special problems: I am sure that is so in many of the boroughs in Greater London. During the war the Borough of Hendon was a reception area, and many people moved into that borough during these serious times. We now have more than 800 requisitioned houses. The difficulty of the borough in honouring the provisions of the Bill is that it has obligations first and foremost to the very long queue of Hendonians who are waiting to be rehoused in Hendon.<br/>
There are more than 4,000 Hendon people who have been waiting, the great majority since before the war, for houses in Hendon. There are an additional 800 in requisitioned property, and more than 90 per cent, of those 800 are not Hendonians. They came to the Hendon reception area from other boroughs, the majority from south-east London. There is a real difficulty there, and I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will give some attention to this matter, because not only must we house the people in our own queue, but also the people from the requisitioned property. But we in Hendon are surrounded by the Green Belt, and, therefore, we are woefully short of land on which to carry out this programme.</p>

<p>I have also lived near there for some time. Surely the hon. Gentleman does not think it would be right to build on parks or open spaces which the Abercrombie Plan reserved for recreation and other purposes. We should be letting down future generations if we built on these valuable open spaces.<br/>
We are also deterred by the fact&#x2014;I do not complain, but it is an additional problem&#x2014;that we have an L.C.C. housing estate right in the middle of Hendon, and the L.C.C. has decided that it cannot house the sons and daughters of tenants on its estates. We have the Burnt Oak Estate, with some 12,000 electors, an estate which was built in the period between 1929 and 1933. It thus happens that the sons and daughters of the tenants are reaching the age when they marry and have children, and they want houses of their own. That is an additional demand on the small amount of housing space in the Borough of Hendon.<br/>
I hope that the Minister will examine these problems most sympathetically, particularly the cases of boroughs which are prevented from building out because of the Green Belt, and which are beset with the following four factors in this tremendous problem. They have long waiting lists; and a large number of requisitioned houses; L.C.C. out-county estates for which they have to accept responsibility; and a number of Regular Service men coming out of married quarters in depots in the area and joining the queue for houses.<br/>
I believe that this Bill is a step in the right direction. I have always found in my monthly "surgeries" that on the whole people living in requisitioned property take a very objective view of this matter and realise that the time has to come when the property has to be returned to its owners. We need to pay special attention to their difficulties because, in many cases, the land is just not there to meet the needs of such boroughs as Hendon.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Hendon, North (Mr. C. I. Orr-Ewing) said one thing with which I heartily agree. He did not want to see a situation arising in his borough in which the parks and open spaces were built over in order to provide sites for houses. The reason why I agree with the hon. Gentleman is that in Deptford we have no parks or open spaces that are worthy of consideration as building sites.<br/>
In fact, in the whole of the borough we have no full-sized football pitch on which young men, or even children, can play a proper game of football. We are a typical south-east London riverside constituency which has particular problems, with which I want to deal tonight, following the example of many hon. Members who have made constituency speeches in this debate.</p>

<p>I do not live in the borough.<br/>
There were 2,000 houses completely destroyed in Deptford as a result of enemy action, and of the remaining 14,000 houses scarcely one remained unscathed. About &#x00A3;4&#x00BC; million has been spent on war damage repairs to these


14,000 houses. That should be an argument for believing that there are vacant spaces in Deptford, but there are not. The pre-war density of 50 houses to the acre has gone, and we are now down to half that figure&#x2014;27 per acre.<br/>
Having suffered that frightful holocaust, what has the borough done? It has built 516 houses and flats since the war. It has some 450 huts and factory-manufactured houses, and, in addition, it has 1,382 requisitioned premises of one kind and another, housing about 2,000 families. It has nearly 3,000 applicants on its waiting list.<br/>
There is no room at all in the borough for any big housing expansion. In fact, if all the housing sites that are likely to be available in Deptford between now and 1960 were used solely for the purpose of rehousing the people who live in requisitioned property, provision would be found for about 500 people. Yet we have 3,000 on our waiting list, 2,000 families in requisitioned houses, and 450 people living in squalid huts and pre-fabricated houses, to which, I am sorry to say, the Parliamentary Secretary gave a testimonial. I should like to see those huts and prefabs pulled down long before 1960.<br/>
The problem is clear. Many of our larger requisitioned houses, have as many as four families living in them, while in one I think there are eight. Yet the Bill ensures that no owner will have to take back, against his will, only part of his house, so that, if we are to derequisition one house, we have to find accommodation not for one family, but, in cases such as I have described, for four families. Trying to deal with that situation in the conditions I have mentioned is like trying to fill a colander full of water. It just cannot be done; it is an impossibility.<br/>
Every time that we in Deptford try to build new blocks of flats, we have to rehouse more people than are supplied by the units of accommodation that we build. There is a big housing estate scheme in Clyde Street, where, in order to house 40 families in the flats now being built there, we have to find alternative accommodation for 48 families before we start. The result is that it is an almost impossible situation in which to try to

obtain a significant accretion of new houses for the people in the borough.<br/>
Deptford has already had its own policy of derequisitioning. From what we have heard from some hon. Members opposite, it would appear that borough councils have been tardy in dealing with derequisitioning. It is not so at all in Deptford. In recent years, we have released about 82 dwelling houses containing 140 families. It is not an easy job to do that when there are 3,000 families knocking on the door of the housing officer every week, every month, every quarter, and every year, asking for the accommodation which they are seeking.<br/>
We did not start this business of requisitioning in Deptford. We did not seek to do it. It was the Coalition Government which came along and said that it was necessary, in the interests of the war effort, that we should do it. I am not denying that Deptford Borough Council were enthusiastic about it, because they were looking for accommodation for many of their people. Nor was accommodation difficult to find, because, at that time, there was a queue of landlords and estate agents at the town hall, begging to have their properties requisitioned.<br/>
I am satisfied, from all the correspondence I receive and from talking to the people who come to see me, that today the overwhelming majority of people in Deptford whose property is requisitioned are perfectly happy to leave the situation where it is. The people who are the clamorous and vocal minority, who threaten to put up independent Conservative candidates in some of the marginal Tory constituencies in south London are those who want to secure vacant possession of their houses and to sell them on the market at a high valuation.<br/>
Other hon. Members have dealt with the question of cost. Boroughs which, like mine, have suffered desperately from enemy action are now being asked to accept a burden which places like Black-pool, Bournemouth, Berwick-on-Tweed, and Warwick are not called upon to bear. The areas which suffered the most war damage will find that their burdens are the greatest. Let me look at the cost to Deptford.<br/>
In the year ended 31st March, 1954, our requisitioned houses were cost-


ing roughly &#x00A3;51,000 a year. For the period ending 31st March this year the cost will be about &#x00A3;35,000, and it is estimated that the cost next year will be about &#x00A3;32,000. That is a drop of about &#x00A3;19,000. We increased the rents at the urgent request of the Minister as the result of the Working Party's Report, although it was not a popular thing to do, politically, in Deptford. The borough council did it, and the Exchequer will benefit by a saving of &#x00A3;19,000, up to the time that it washes its hands of the matter.<br/>
I am not saying that the borough council will not get benefit as from 1st April, 1957, but we are already putting quite a burden on the people of Deptford. When the terms of the Bill are implemented, 25 per cent, of the cost will be borne by the borough council. We shall have to find &#x00A3;8,000 a year, which is equivalent to a 3&#x2153;d. rate. That is not all. Some hon. Members have talked as if that is the maximum cost to a borough, but it does not include leasing, purchasing, or paying compensation to owners. The very minimum that it will cost is 3&#x2153;d.<br/>
We have heard rumours that there is to be a formula which will ensure that some borough councils will not have to pay more than a few coppers, but what is 3&#x2153;d. but a few coppers? What could be appreciably smaller than those few coppers. This is a very dangerous matter, and I recommend to the representatives of local authorities, when they go into the jungle with this Government, not to be misled. The formula will say that the Minister shall decide, in his discretion, whether there is likely to be an unbearable burden upon any local authority. On this side of the House we are not prepared to give that discretion to the Minister, because we do not trust his discretion.<br/>
If he wants, and must have a formula why does he not go back to the formula of what we know as the Addison Act of 1919? Houses were then built on the basis that the Government provided the whole annual loss on the houses with the exception of a 1d. rate. I do not know whether that would work now, but it is far more equitable. A borough knows what is to happen. It is better than hinting that there will be a formula which will only cost a few coppers and then saying, "We shall have a formula at some other time."<br/>
On the basis of the 1954 figures, Dept-ford would have to levy a 5&#x00BC;d. rate. This and other comparative figures are subject to alteration but as a comparative guide it would cost St. Marylebone a 1&#x215B;d. rate and Westminster a 1&#x215B;d. rate.<br/>
Finally, I would ask the Minister whether Clause 3 (2) really means, as was suggested by some hon. Members on the benches opposite, that the Minister may permit authorities to continue with requisitioning after the Bill comes into force, and after 1960? I am not saying that it does. There was an hon. Member on the Government benches who took a belated interest in the Bill, although he had only been in the House for about an hour, and who said that the Bill made it clear that requisitioning could be carried on. If it is true that requisitioning is to continue, what did the Parliamentary Secretary mean when he said that the Bill was to bring requisitioning to an end? If it does mean that what have we been arguing about all today? If it does not mean that, as I suspect it does not, would it not be a good idea,, instead of giving a brief at the last moment to hon. Gentlemen who have not been very prominent in their attendance, for the Parliamentary Secretary to see that his supporters are given some easy guides to the Bills which the Government produce? Those hon. Members would then not add more confusion to that which the Government supply.</p>

<p>Nobody will criticise hon. Members, and particularly hon. Members on the Opposition side, for calling attention to the problems of the areas which they represent, but it is right that one should take also a broad view of the whole problem with which the Bill seeks to deal. I make no secret of the fact that the requisitioning of property is not a problem in my constituency. I live under the shadow of an authority about which a great deal has been said earlier in the debate. It is the Birmingham City Council, about whose area I shall have a few remarks to make.<br/>
It often happens in a debate like this that hon. Members criticise a Bill and ask for more details about it without saying what they would do if they had the responsibility of introducing a Measure to deal with the problem. Even the Amendment gives no hint of what the Opposition would do if they were in power.


That is a question which we are entitled to ask them to answer. The Amendment criticises the Bill for protecting landlords while not protecting occupiers and that is all. We are entitled to have some elucidation on this point. Are we to understand that the Opposition, if they had had responsibility, would have introduced a Measure somewhat similar in terms to the present Bill, but with greater protection to occupiers and licensees of requisitioned property? If the Opposition would do that, there is not very much separating us from them.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Powell) said that we have confidence in the local authorities, although many of them are Socialist-controlled, that they will do their job. Hon. Members on the Opposition side believe that they will not do it. That is the only difference between us.</p>

<p>I am sure that the hon. Member does not want to misrepresent the desire of local authorities to co-operate in the derequisitioning of these dwellings.

<p>That intervention is like all the hon. Member's interventions, a very thoughtful one, but it does not help me to find out what hon. Members opposite would do about this problem, if it is different from what we are suggesting in the Bill. If they would keep things as they are, it makes nonsense of some of the criticisms which hon. Members have made.<br/>
They talk about insecurity, and about those who are now licensees becoming insecure in their tenure as a result of this Bill. On that basis they are at the moment as precarious and as insecure as it is possible for them to be. If we do not trust the local authorities, then they have exactly the same security as a lodger, and no more. They can be pitched out without even the formality of a notice to quit. Is that the situation which hon. Members opposite seek to perpetuate, or would they perhaps arrive at some other solution? If so, what is that solution? They ought to tell us.</p>

<p>The two things which would clearly be done by a Government

that faced up to this problem fairly would be, first, to allow a longer time for local authorities to deal with this problem, and to arrange that time in relation to the size of.the problem for each year, and, secondly, to see that the financial burden was not placed unfairly on the local authorities for what, after all, is a national problem.</p>

<p>I am sure that my right hon. Friend, who is to wind up the debate, will be grateful for that intervention. It does not bear much relation to the Amendment and I hope that the hon. Member will compose his differences with his right hon. Friends before his right hon. Friend winds up for the Opposition. If it is not that they seek to perpetuate the insecurity of the licensees who now occupy requisitioned premises, perhaps they will bear in mind the premises themselves.<br/>
Surely, of all the properties in the country which are neglected, and which have been neglected in times past, these properties are the very ones where the explanation stands out for all to see. These properties are, to borrow a metaphor from an hon. Member opposite, "nobody's baby." These houses, at the moment, are ones on which we cannot expect the local authorities to spend money for repairs and improvements. No one would say that so long as they remain requisitioned the owners ought to improve and repair them. It is neither in the interests of the occupiers of these premises nor in the interests of the premises them-selves that the present state of affairs should continue. Nor is it really in the interests of good government.<br/>
I thought we had reached something approaching agreement that as time goes on we ought, subject by subject, so to dispose matters that where necessary temporary legislation was replaced by permanent legislation, or done away with. I do not think that anybody has quarrelled with that general principle. War-time emergency legislation ought to go, and where there is a case for any pro-vision to go on perpetually, then it ought to foe set out in an honest-to-goodness statute. That, after all, is precisely what this Bill does with regard to requisitioning.<br/>
It does no more and no less. It merely says that the wartime expedient of requisitioning ought to go; that the local authority ought to make up its mind


either to make a permanent compulsory order for the purchase of the property, and keep it on a permanent basis, or give it up. That is the choice which the local authority is given, and that is the choice which, in many respects, my right hon. Friends in different Departments have been endeavouring to make in the past three years with their emergency legislation.<br/>
The hands of the local authority, in making up its mind and carrying its decision into effect, are helped in more than one way by the provisions of this Bill. For instance, it is true that one can say that there is no compulsion upon the owner who, under Clause 4, is approached by the local authority to take on the licensee who is now living in his requisitioned house as a tenant, or that the local authority should step out and the owner should become the landlord again, and the licensee should become the tenant on a protective basis.<br/>
It can be said that few owners will accept such a bargain. They all want, on taking possession, to sell and make a profit. But the local authorities can give the owner a very strong hint. They can say, "We offer you an opportunity of taking on the licensee as your tenant and of having your property back, but we would remind you that we have the power of compulsory purchase. Of course, you can, if you like, say 'No,' but then you may lose your property." That is a very strong argument to use.

<p>I am not saying that it is anything other than a provision in the Bill. I am only pointing out what is in the Bill. Whether the hon. Gentleman likes to say that it is incidental, I do not know, but under the Bill one can offer the owner the opportunity of having his house back and of taking on the licensee as tenant. I think that under the Housing Act, 1936, that point has already been dealt with. The local authority has power to requisition. I have not heard any suggestion that we should repeal the 1936 Act. If the hon. Gentleman cares to suggest it, no doubt it will be considered.</p>

<p>A good deal has been said about the rights and interests of those who are occupying these houses at present, and a good deal has been said about what is to happen to them. I do not dissociate myself in any way at all from the interests of people who, in times of difficulty, had to accept accommodation which probably they did not want. They would probably much rather have had other accommodation if it had been available. But that can be carried too far.<br/>
At least in the case of Birmingham, and my constituency is adjacent to that city, people are by no means reluctant to accept accommodation in the adjoining country areas. It may be true to say of some London boroughs that there are people living in requisitioned accommodation in those boroughs to whom it would be a hardship if they were offered houses in the out-of-town estates or new towns. These are the special problems of London, about which I am not particularly qualified to speak.<br/>
I can, however, say from my own experience that when one analyses the housing lists of the three local authorities in my constituency, one finds among them, either openly or to some extent concealed, a large proportion of people who are rightly the housing problem of Birmingham itself. There is no unwilling-ness on the part of the citizens of Birmingham to live even in disused bus bodies in my constituency.<br/>
Let us be quite clear about this. It may be, if a house is derequisitioned, that the occupier now living in the house may have to leave if the local authority decide compulsorily to purchase. But that house has become available for somebody else when the family which is now in it leaves, and it is not necessarily true to say, as hon. Members opposite have suggested, that all these houses are snapped up for sale with vacant possession. The hon. Member for Sparkbrook (Mr. Shurmer) and another hon. Member made the point that these houses were empty when they were derequisitioned. Hon. Members opposite cannot have it both ways. They cannot say, on the one hand, that there is a queue of people waiting to buy houses with vacant possession and, on the other, that the houses are standing empty.</p>

<p>Local authorities can acquire them at the market value. They will never have to pay more than that, and they will have the best evidence in the world that the market value is exceedingly low.<br/>
If housing authorities really want to acquire properties on a permanent and fair basis and make proper houses of them as part of a long-term housing plan, this Bill will provide another opportunity. One has to consider the Bill, not in isolation but in conjunction with, say, Part I of the Housing Repairs and Rent Act, under which slum schemes are being worked out by every local authority.<br/>
There is another aspect of the Bill as it affects the owner. It may be that hon. Members opposite would like a good deal more property to be publicly owned, but I believe that even they, in their wildest moments of Leftism, would never say that the houses and their owners should be chosen by chance. I have heard a number of proposals put forward for the nationalisation of land and property, but never a suggestion that it should be done by ballot. That is what happens here if the present situation is perpetuated. The owners of houses now requisitioned were not chosen by any means which had regard to the desirability of the property, or the desirability of its being publicly owned, but simply by lot or accident during the war, when conditions upset any sort of planning.</p>

<p>No, in many cases the houses were chosen because they happened to be empty at the time&#x2014;and in many cases they were empty because the owner was serving with the Armed Forces.<br/>
If we are to have property taken into public ownership&#x2014;and I hope we shall

hear a little more about that from hon. Members opposite&#x2014;let it at least be done by some fair method and not just by accident or chance. It is just to avoid that kind of thing being perpetuated that this Bill rightly forces upon local authorities the decision either to continue permanently that public ownership of a house by making a compulsory purchase order &#x2014;and justifying that order&#x2014;or to de-requisition the house and allow it to return to the owner, who has the best right to it.</p>

<p>If the Minister wants to have any self-confidence left at all when replying to the debate I can well understand his prudence in absenting himself from the Chamber during nearly all the debate.<br/>
Some of us on this side have listened with careful attention to the speeches made from the back benches opposite, because we need some assurance that there are people who believe in the principles which appear to be embodied in this Bill. This is a wanton, unnecessary and cynical Bill. It seems so bad that it cannot be true. It is like the Housing Repairs and Rent Act. Nobody believed that that Measure could be as bad as it seemed. We had to wait twelve months to learn by experience that it was, in fact, increasing the prosperity of the wealthier landlords, and doing nothing to help the poorer landlords to meet such difficulties as exist in my constituency.<br/>
There was a moment during the Parliamentary Secretary's speech when I thought he was about to speak about something other than the rights of land-lords. His voice became almost reverent for a moment when he said that the object of the Bill was to liquidate the debt incurred in the Second World War. I thought, "Surely this means the 8,000 people in my constituency who live in requisitioned property because their homes were destroyed." But no&#x2014;it did not mean that.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman went on to explain that he was protecting the rights of the owners. There was not a reference to those other people. It is not the fault of those 8,000 people that they are living in requisitioned houses. It is not their fault that the number of properties destroyed


around Paddington Station is equal to the number requisitioned. But because Paddington Station is there, it is a national responsibility and we all owe a home to those people.<br/>
Various consoling arguments have been advanced by hon. Members opposite. They say, "Do not worry. As people move out of these properties others will move in. Those properties will not be wasted. The local authority can always acquire them if it raises the money. You are making a lot of trouble about nothing." We have not heard from those hon. Members any suggestion that there is any social responsibility at all attached to housing. I say that there is a 100 per cent, over-riding responsibility on the shoulders of the nation to rehouse those who lost their homes as a result of the war. We believe that that responsibility extends very much further. The hon. Member for Bromsgrove (Mr. Higgs) ex-pressed the hope that some of us might say so, and I say it now. That is the difference between us in approach&#x2014;an absolute, irreconcilable difference.<br/>
As hon. Gentlemen opposite very kindly and nicely expounded their views the criterion always came down to "what can you pay?"; "pay a fair market price"; "buy with vacant possession." No further priority was mentioned. We completely disagree with hon. Members opposite about the spirit of the Bill.<br/>
The Parliamentary Secretary used another phrase. He said that it is necessary to give a financial spur to local authorities. That is what is running through the minds of hon. Members opposite all the time&#x2014;that we must have a spur for local authorities. What am I to say to railway men from Paddington? Am I to say, "The view of Her Majesty's Government is that you have to have a financial spur, so you had better either go on strike or take on a job less socially useful so that you can pay the price of furnished accommodation in Paddington"?<br/>
What is the financial spur to the local authority? Does it really help the Borough of Paddington to be faced with a Measure like this, which will double its housing rates next year? To what does that spur authorities, except to spur on those who have to pay most of the rates to carry on the "chuck 'em out" process

which has already been described as the purpose of the Bill?<br/>
A spur would be a financial incentive &#x2014;a reward&#x2014;an inducement to make or save some money. What is the spur in having to do something which will cost more money? In Paddington, a great deal has been spent on requisitioned houses. There are about 2,400 families and nearly 700 requisitioned properties, and the total number of units of accommodation controlled by the council at present is very small indeed. It is only between one-quarter and one-third of the accommodation occupied by the number of families in requisitioned properties.<br/>
This is a problem which a borough like Paddington can hardly face at all in the circumstances created by this Bill. It has done its best to reduce the numbers; it has reduced them from 2,800 to 2,400, and I do not apologise for repeating the circumstances of my own borough. Every hon. Member who speaks for London will give slightly different figures, but they add up to the same pattern and problem. The cost of these requisitioned proper ties in Paddington is equal to 2s. 8&#x00BD;d. in the &#x00A3; on the rates; 25 per cent, of that would double the expenditure on housing next year. That is not an incentive. It is not a financial spur.<br/>
We have a waiting list of 4,000 now, but we can only complete between 200 and 300 units of accommodation each year. So we can throw away the waiting list and devote the next ten years to rehousing those people from requisitioned properties, provided we can find some more sites. At present, we can only find sites for a dozen or so at a time. If any messages do get to the Minister before he returns to the Chamber, I should like to know whether he will tell us if there is any information about the subject of the high flats which it was proposed to build in Paddington, and about the decision on the question of high density, on which the borough council has been kept waiting for months.<br/>
Without slum clearance we cannot get sites, and we must have sites if we are to build these high flats. We must be allowed to get on with the programme and not be bedevilled by a sudden crisis precipitated by a Bill of this kind which will double our expenditure on the rates


and which will make it impossible to reduce the waiting lists.<br/>
The hon. Member for Bromsgrove asked presumably the next speaker from these benches to say what we would do. Of course, the answer is to acquire these properties. They should have been acquired a long time ago. There are no other properties to acquire in a place like Paddington. We must secure possession of those which we have got. We must extend the principle of municipal ownership, as we believe in extending that principle in the case of housing to let.<br/>
We demand an answer tonight from the Minister which, if it is to satisfy the problem of the London boroughs, can only be one answer. It must be an answer which will admit that if the Minister intends to give this property back to the owners and enable them to have their share of the reward, as has happened with the rest of the landlords, the road hauliers and so on, it must be done from the Chancellor's fund and not from the rate fund.<br/>
Therefore, the Minister should tell us that he accepts responsibility, that he will do all the things which his back benchers have been saying on his behalf during his absence, that it will be easy to acquire properties, that there will be a considerable Treasury grant and that it will all be made completely painless.<br/>
It is too much to expect that the Minister will come back from wherever he has been to in the mood of a good Samaritan. I do not expect him to do exactly what the good Samaritan did, but he might get near it. He might say, "Give us a couple of coppers,
<q>and whatsoever thou spendest more, when I came again, I will repay thee.</q>
In other words, the Minister should give us tonight an assurance of the smallest possible token contribution from the boroughs; he should tell us what is really meant by "a financial spur" and give the boroughs a chance to expand their control over housing in order to speed up their own housing programmes, instead of being dismayed by the introduction of this Bill.</p>

It is high time we recognised that the major principle behind this Bill is to stop new requisitioning in the first place.

<p>Thank you, Mr. Deputy-Speaker, for safeguarding my privileges.<br/>
The second important point in the Bill is to end requisitioning, by and large, within five years. I am convinced that the majority of thought in the country is in favour of that. The average Englishman, Welshman, Scot, Northern Irishman, has a very great sense of justice, and it is manifestly unjust that, ten or fifteen years after the war, there should be this difference between one kind of property and another.

<p>Of course I will, Mr. Deputy-Speaker.<br/>
I would remind the House that the second point in the Bill is to end the major part of requisitioning by 31st March, 1960. The exceptions to that are given in Clause 3 (2), which I think covers most of the difficult situations which hon. Members have mentioned in their constituency speeches. In the exceptional cases about which we have heard, Clause 3 (2) can be invoked, and the position then is that the Minister, in consultation with the local authority, has a discretion.</p>

<p>I go further on this point and say that I am quite certain that any impartial Member of the House would agree that the Bill is overdue. Some of us have very few requisitioning problems in our constituencies and others have a great many. The probability is that had the party opposite been returned to power at the last election, it would have had to bring in a Bill like this to meet this very point. Indeed, the hon. Member for Islington, South-West (Mr. A. Evans) agrees that his party would have produced a Bill of this kind. He gave two changes from the present Bill&#x2014;


first, that the time would have been lengthened, possibly by another five years, and, secondly, that there would have been amendments to the financial conditions. I think I am quoting him correctly.</p>

<p>If hon. Members would let me get on with my speech instead of interrupting me so much, I might be able to meet all their requirements.<br/>
May I turn from the main Clauses, with which I am in hearty agreement, to the terms of the Amendment? In the many years during which I have been interested in politics and the many years during which I have been in the House, I have never seen such a misleading Amendment on the Order Paper of the House as that which appears today.</p>

<p>The Amendment reads:
<q>That this House declines to give a Second Reading to a Bill which contemplates the eviction of occupants of requisitioned houses in 1960 without providing for their rehousing and, while protecting landlords from special hardship, gives no similar protection to occupiers.</q>
Everyone knows that that is just a farrago of nonsense. It does not tie up

with the majority of the speeches which have been made by hon. Members opposite and it does not even tie up with the two points which I have established and with which hon. Members have agreed&#x2014; first, that derequisitioning is essential and, secondly, that there should be no more requisitioning in the future.<br/>
Yet the Opposition have put down an Amendment which entirely ignores the terrific pace at which new houses are being built under the present Government. I could sympathise with the Opposition if we were building only 200,000 houses a year, but we are building 350,000 a year. Since the war 2 million houses have been built and in the course of the next few years 3 million will have been built.<br/>
That is the majestic march of events under this Government, which the Opposition will not recognise. It is not the greatest thing we have done, but surely one of the most magnificent achievements of this Government is the success of its housing programme. Everyone must admit that we have not only achieved the target of 300,000 houses a year which we set at the last General Election, but have gone beyond it to 350,000. We have astonished ourselves and I think that the whole country is delighted by what we have been able to achieve.<br/>
Had the party opposite been in power we might well have achieved only 200,000 houses a year and that with incredible difficulty. We might not yet have been thinking of hospitals and schools, but be limping along in that crippled, half-active Socialist State which the party opposite was trying to achieve. Instead, we have let the builders get on with the job and have given them every encouragement&#x2014;</p>

<p>Thank you, Mr. Deputy-Speaker. I realise where I have been in error and I will not offend again. 1 will keep to the part of the Amendment dealing with housing.<br/>
I am sorry that the hon. Member for Acton (Mr. Sparks) is temporarily absent. Earlier in the debate he made a point, in an interruption, that in constituencies such as his the problem of providing for new housing was almost impossible because they have no vacant areas. We sympathise with him, but we are doing more than just expressing sympathy. As hon. Members know, it was the Government of the party opposite that began work on the problem of the new towns and extended towns. I do not think that any hon. Member opposite would object when I say that this Government have carried on the programme hon. Members opposite initiated with great verve and skill. No one can grumble at the development of new towns which is going on today.<br/>
The hon. Member for Acton said that it was impossible to master this problem in his constituency. In the last three and a half years my constituency has taken 400 families from the hon. Member's constituency and rehoused them 50 miles away. In these difficult London areas, which were overbuilt a generation ago, the problem is not so much that of rehousing within the boroughs concerned but of decanting to the new towns and extended towns. The new towns and the extended towns have been a great success. I look foward to an acceleration of that programme in the future.<br/>
I apologise for unnecessarily being the means of calling you to your feet earlier, Mr. Deputy-Speaker, but if I was led astray it was through provocation by the party opposite. I hope hon. Members opposite will not disagree that this is a good Bill, a Bill they would have introduced, because something had to be done about this problem. It is sheer dishonesty to put down an Amendment such as they have put down and then vote for it.</p>

<p>I want at once to tell the hon. and gallant Member for Buckingham (Sir F. Markham) that I think this is a rotten Bill and that I am opposed to it in every respect. The Bill is unfair to the tenant, nobody wants it, nobody has asked for it, and it passes on to the local authorities a big financial

burden which at the moment the Treasury is bearing. From my point of view, therefore, everything in the Bill is wrong.<br/>
The hon. Member for Lewisham, North (Sir A. Hudson) was at pains to explain who, he thought, was in favour of the Bill. He said that none of the large property owners had asked for it, because they were doing very well on their present rents from the Treasury. Certainly none of the tenants have asked for the Bill. None of the borough councils have asked for it. Therefore, why are we having it?<br/>
I suspect that the birthplace of the Bill is the Treasury, in Whitehall. For years past, the Treasury has been struggling to get what it calls the burden&#x2014;now &#x00A3;4&#x00BD; million&#x2014;of the cost of requisitioned premises pushed off its own shoulders, in the hope that some of it will come off the shoulders also of the well-to-do and will find its way on to the shoulders of the poorer people. That is all wrong. It is bad finance in any case, and it is especially wrong when the whole reason for the requisitioning problem is that we tried to do something for the people during the war and we are still in difficulties because of the war.<br/>
Hon. Members opposite forget that London had 80,000 houses completely destroyed during the war, and that we are only just catching up with that loss. In the meantime, many more houses have fallen into decay and have become slums. We are a long way from solving the housing problem, not only in the London boroughs, but in Birmingham and other places also.<br/>
The properties which were requisitioned have been extremely useful to local authorities in easing some of the most difficult and painful housing tragedies with which they have had to deal. The fact that, in spite of the efforts which have been made during the last 18 months to derequisition a large number of these houses, 30,000 of them are still requisitioned in London, housing 53,000 families, is a sign of the intensity of the housing problem, which hon. Members opposite seem completely to forget. They are much more concerned about the interests of the owners of properties than about the human problems that we all deal with when we meet our constituents, and which we hear about when people come to us about housing problems.<br/>
The London County Council still has a waiting list of about 160,000 families, over 50,000 of whom are in the A category, which is the category of worst-hit families, who ought to be rehoused tomorrow, if only we could find the houses. The "Evening News" tonight is perfectly correct when it says, in an article headed "Housing Crisis in London," that if the London County Council is able to build every house it wants to build and can build under its organisation up to 1960, we shall still be 10,000 houses short in respect of families in London, ignoring altogether the 30,667 requisitioned houses.<br/>
What is the sense of saying that the Bill is an attempt to solve the housing problem? It is nothing of the sort. It will intensify the problem in the London area, and I am very sorry that the Minister has brought it forward. I know that in the borough which I have the honour partially to represent, the right hon. Gentleman has made some inquiries. In Wandsworth, we have the worst problem of requisitioned houses, not merely in the whole of London, but in the whole country. The Minister represents a part of that area. Some of the requisitioned houses are in his constituency. I hope that the tenants who will be thrown out will remember it.<br/>
In Wandsworth we had 6,780 requisitioned units, as they are called, 18 months ago. I want to make this point because the political control of the council happens to be one with which I disagree. The council has made a valiant effort to get rid of requisitioned premises. How far has it succeeded? At the beginning of this year the council sent to 2,031 owners invitations to take over houses in accordance with the terms of this Bill. I do not know whether the council had any pre-knowledge of the provisions of the Bill.<br/>
The council invited the owners to take over the houses and accept the sitting tenants as statutory tenants. Not a single one of those owners replied to say that he agreed. There have been a few cases where the owner and the licensee have got together and made an agreement for the licensee to pay an increased rent. The council has derequisitioned such houses. But where, as the Bill lays down, the borough council invited owners of these properties to take them back and

receive the compensation which is now laid down in the Bill, taking the tenant as a statutory tenant paying the same rent, but with the difference between the licensee rent and the proper rent under the Rent Restrictions Acts guaranteed, not one of the house owners accepted the offer of the borough council.<br/>
What is the sense, therefore, of trying to tell the House and the country that if we pass the Bill quickly, to provide that between now and 1960 borough councils can make arrangements for the landlords to take over the houses and accept the tenants as statutory tenants, everything in the garden will be lovely? The owners do not want that. Two houses in my constituency have stood empty for 12 months since they were derequisitioned. The landlords do not want them because it would cost more to make them fit to live in than anybody is prepared to spend. The only reason why the borough council does not pull them down is that the houses on either side might become unsafe if that were done.<br/>
It is against all experience as well as common sense to expect that these tens of thousands of houses which have been requisitioned since the war will be taken over under the terms of the Bill. The experience of my own borough council during the last week or two has proved that. Therefore, that part of the Bill, just as much as the financial Clauses, is absolute nonsense.<br/>
Why should the borough council pay 25 per cent, of the financial deficit? At present the whole financial loss is borne by the State, because the emergency was a national emergency. It was one for which none of us was responsible or could avoid, as I know. Seventy "doodle-bugs" dropped within half a mile of the house in which I lived. Hon. Members have asked what we on this side of the House have done. We had a working party which made certain proposals, under which there has been a slow but steady derequisitioning. There is no doubt that but for the extreme housing conditions in London we should have got rid of more derequisitioned houses than we have been able to do.<br/>
We want properties for rental to be owned by the local authorities. Hon. Gentlemen opposite tried to make a fuss about what we on this side of the House stand for. We have shouted from the


housetops that if we win the next Election we shall give local authorities power to buy up vast areas of local property and to extend the principle of public ownership. We propose to do, in fact, what the London County Council has been doing in the last few months on a voluntary basis. It has bought three or four very large estates belonging to people like the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, and this week it has announced an ambitious and imaginative scheme for re-development. Birmingham has done the same sort of thing in its area.<br/>
I say, therefore, that we do not need this pettifogging, rather mean Bill to enable local authorities to get on with the housing of their people and to get rid of the slums. Derequisitioning must be done slowly, and there must be no injustice to the sitting tenant. No one on the other side of the House has replied to the point made earlier in the debate as to what is to happen after 31st March, 1960.<br/>
The Bill is quite clear. It says that no requisitioning shall be allowed after that date; and, presumably, the inevitable is bound to happen. Thousands of tenants still in requisitioned properties will then be illegally in those houses, and will be turned out. They will be without the benefits of the Rent Restrictions Acts. I hope that the Minister will say something about that aspect, because it is going to be a tremendous bone of contention in the next few months, particularly in London.<br/>
I do not want to use up all the time that is left, but I urge the Minister to do something about the Clause which deals with excessive expenditure, and tell us on what formula he is going to discuss it. I find that in the Borough of Wandsworth, as the Bill stands at the moment, the cost will be a 4&#x00BD;d. rate. I am sure that the local ratepayers' association in Streatham will have something to say about the Minister of Housing and Local Government imposing an extra rate charge on them, because they are already grumbling about the level of their rates.<br/>
It is proposed that we in Wandsworth should pay 4&#x00BD;d. in the &#x00A3; extra, but for what purpose? It is to relieve the Treasury of part of a charge. In Lambeth, I understand, it will mean a 4d. rate, and already in that borough the burden is reaching breaking point. One hon. Member told us how, in Camberwell,

it will mean a 6d. rate, and Poplar is grumbling about the inevitable increase in the rate charged for housing purposes. Before the Bill becomes law, the borough councils are entitled to know clearly and categorically on what basis the calculations are to be made in connection with heavy expenditure which would justify the Minister making additional grants.<br/>
It would be much better, however, if the Minister took the Bill back and buried it. Let us have another look at the proposals of the Working Party on Requisitioned Houses and see if we cannot get, in consultation with the boroughs which have the worst problem, some organised plan for getting rid of this issue without punishing the tenants and without adding the problem to the already heavy burden on the shoulders of the local ratepayers, who in the main are people in the back streets.<br/>
Unfortunately, owing to the way in which the Government Whip acted on Friday, I did not have a chance to say anything about the rate burden throughout the country. It is clear that there is a growing volume of opinion, not only among the people in the ordinary weekly-rented property, but among shopkeepers and businessmen of all kinds, protesting against the burden of the rates and against being saddled with a heavy charge merely because industry is excused 75 per cent, of its rate charges.<br/>
Now, apparently, they are to be charged another 4d., 5d., or 6d. in the &#x00A3; rate, merely to enable the Treasury to dodge a charge which is properly a Treasury charge, and which was justified by the national circumstances at the time. But those circumstances do not entitle the Government to come along with this proposition for the purpose of passing over to the ratepayers 25 per cent, of the cost of the derequisitioned houses. This Bill is not wanted, it has not been asked for, and, so far as I can see, nobody will give it a blessing.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Clapham (Mr. Gibson) began by calling this a rotten Bill. In my view, it is a fine and courageous Bill and I have already written to my right hon. Friend to tell him so. It is another example, of which we have seen many during the past three years, of the way in which this Government have taken hold of knotty problems,


however difficult and unpopular it might have been to do so. [An HON. MEMBER: "Class legislation."] I am glad to learn that the Urban District Councils' Association and the Metropolitan Boroughs Standing Joint Committee have both agreed at least to accept and operate the Bill.

<p>He has no rights whatever.<br/>
If hon. Gentlemen opposite care to take a walk up Ludgate Hill, and then take the first turning on the left, they will find, surmounting a building known as the Old Bailey, the figure of Justice, holding a pair of scales. If they examine the pair of scales they will find that the pans are level. That is justice, and what this Bill does, is to try to hold the scales of justice level as between the tenant and the owner of requisitioned properties. It must not be forgotten that until now only the tenant has received justice, but the landlord is just as much entitled to it as the tenant. That is what this Bill, among other things, seeks to achieve.<br/>
This Bill is overdue. The requisitioning of private property was agreed to during the war, but it is an infringement upon personal liberty which should be countenanced in this country only during time of war. It is wrong that it should be perpetuated in time of peace one day longer than is absolutely necessary, and it has lasted too long already although, of course, there are special problems in certain areas, about which I shall say a word in a moment.<br/>
It has been said during the course of the debate that we are concerned only with the landlords in the sense that we are concerned with the owners of large blocks of properties, but that is not true. We are concerned with those landlords who intended to be owner-occupiers, but had their houses taken away from them during the war for various reasons, and who now want them back. It has been argued that these people can have their houses back by application to the local authorities and I have heard hon. Gentlemen opposite

say that local authorities administer that power wisely. Hon. Gentlemen opposite are as much entitled to their opinion as I am to mine, but I beg to differ. I am a member of a local authority with a Conservative majority but, nevertheless, I often find cause to quarrel with its attitude towards applications for the derequisitioning of properties owned by people who want to live in them and who, in my contention, have the right to do so. It is high time that this right was restored.</p>

<p>That is always a condition upon which local authorities now insist. There is nothing new in that.<br/>
Another point which I wish to make is that the application of the powers of derequisitioning as at present administered by local authorities is uneven. Different local authorities take different attitudes and that is wrong. Whatever policy is adopted, it should be even and equal throughout the country&#x2014;and let us not forget that the Bill applies to the whole country and not just to London. The owners of requisitioned properties should not be at the mercy of inequality of justice which is being inflicted upon them at the moment.</p>

<p>It has many times been implied by hon. Members opposite that every family now living in a requisitioned property will have to be evicted during the next five years. That is just not true. If it were, I agree that the problem would then be insuperable. The Bill contains provisions for families now living in requisitioned properties to remain in those requisitioned properties on certain conditions. It cannot be necessary for me, at this time of night, to detail those conditions.<br/>
I hope that hon. Members will not mind if I make a point which has been made already. It is that during the next five years there will be provided 750,000 houses over and above the number being provided during the administration of the late Government. It needs less than 10


per cent. of those additional houses to accommodate all the families now living in requisitioned properties. The trouble is, of course, that they are not in the right places and I will come to that point in a moment. I deliberately leave it until the end.<br/>
There are one or two points in the Bill which need clarification and I should like to put them to the Minister. The first comes in Clause 4 (4), which deals with the position where the owner of requisitioned property agrees to take over a sitting licensee as his tenant. It says that the tenant shall continue to pay the same contribution that he had been paying to the local authority and that the local authority should make up to the owner the difference between that and the statutory rent, but only for the period up to April, 1965. What happens after that is left undefined and I suggest that we ought to have some guidance. What happens at the end of that period? Does the tenant have to pay his statutory rent, or is the position dealt with in some other way?<br/>
The second point is the position, to which reference has not yet been made, of leasehold property which has been under requisition. Many of these properties have been under requisition for 14 or 15 years. Leasehold properties which had leases with only twenty-five to thirty years to run at the beginning of that period now have leases with only ten or fifteen years to run and have considerably depreciated in value. I hope that my right hon. Friend will realise that this is a different problem from that concerning the owners of freehold properties. The owner of leasehold property is entitled to some compensation for the loss of value of his leasehold interest.<br/>
My last point is that hon. Members sitting for London constituencies have referred to the particular problems of London and as a Member for Lewisham I appreciate their difficulty. Lewisham has nearly 3,500 families in requisitioned premises. If they are all to be rehoused in other properties in the next five years, that is a rate of 700 families a year; a quite impossible task. I know that that is not the problem for I believe that the majority will remain where they are, but that makes no difference to my point.<br/>
I think it is quite wrong that this problem, and the housing problem generally in London, should continue to be dealt

with on a borough council basis. In my view, it is quite incapable of solution in that way. I do not believe that the housing lists in London have any relevance at all at the moment. I, like many other hon. Members, have a surgery on Saturday morning, and I can say that three out of four families who come to see me about housing are on both the borough council and the L.C.C. housing lists.<br/>
Therefore, throughout London, we have this duplication of function, and I suggest that it is wrong, uneconomic, unwise and inefficient. I have suggested before, and I repeat it now, that the responsibility for housing in London should be handled by one body; if necessary, by a special body set up for the purpose, or, perhaps, an existing body could be used. This duplication of function should not be continued any longer. One body should be responsible for housing throughout London, for the expanded towns, the new towns and also for dealing with this problem of rehousing those families who will be as it were dehoused as a result of this Bill. I am quite sure that the Bill will work well. I welcome it, and I wish that I had the time to say more about it.</p>

<p>I am sure that hon. Members on all sides of the House have listened with sympathy to the cases of hardship suffered by owners of property who have had their property requisitioned&#x2014;some of them for many years&#x2014;and of which they are not yet in occupation.<br/>
It is clear from what has been said, and from what the Parliamentary Secretary told us, that the number of such persons, in relation to the whole number of persons who had their property requisitioned, is very small indeed, and that such persons who desire to go back to their property or who desire to sell it are obviously, in most cases, now accommodated by the local authority, or, as the Parliamentary Secretary anticipates, will be accommodated under Clauses 5 and 6 of the Bill.<br/>
Therefore, it is clear that if one takes out what may be termed the hardship cases&#x2014;the cases of the owner-occupiers who desire to go back or sell their property&#x2014;we are left with the majority of the owners of requisitioned property. I


suggest that they probably number about 50,000 persons out of a total of, approximately, 55,000 owners of requisitioned property.<br/>
Various computations have been made as to how many houses will remain requisitioned on 1st April, 1960. The hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Powell), by a series of calculations, some of which, I thought, were based on the imponderables, came to the conclusion that, on 1st April, 1960, the best we could hope for was that 20,000 families would still be in requisitioned property. Let us take that as being right. The interests of those 20,000 families on 1st April, 1960, have to be balanced against the interests of the owners of those 20,000 houses, or a rather less number of houses.<br/>
I am quite sure that, if the Minister or his Parliamentary Secretary were to balance the rights of those two classes of persons as at that date, they would clearly come to the conclusion that the interests of the persons who were about to be evicted from the property were much greater than those of the landlords. One is a right of property; the other is a human right&#x2014;the right to have a roof over one's head. I am sure, when I say that the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary would take that view, that it would also be the view of hon. Members on all sides of the House.<br/>
I am sure that no hon. Members on the Government side would care, as individuals, to cause persons with no other place to live to be thrust out of their houses, in order that the owners of the houses, who, <i>ex hypothesi,</i> have no interest in the property other than a money interest, should profit from the freeing of occupancy.<br/>
That being so, what is the justification for the Bill? If the figure which I am accepting from the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West is right, an enormous problem will arise on 1st April, 1960. The hon. Member suggested that the problem would be solved by compulsory purchase under, Part V of the 1936 Act, and that any local authority in possession of requisitioned property on 1st April, 1960, and continuing to require that property, would purchase it under that Act.<br/>
I would ask the Minister whether that is his policy. Is the hon. Member for

Wolverhampton, South-West, right in thinking that that is the policy of Her Majesty's Government? We know that the hon. Member is a great force in the hierarchy of the Conservative Party, and that he thinks much and gives vent to many pamphlets. I regret that he is not here at the moment to hear the high praise that I am paying him.<br/>
I take it from what the hon. Member said that Government policy is that Part V of the 1936 Act is to be used from 1st April, 1960. If that is so, of course, it resolves the problem. If that is the way in which the problem is to be resolved at that date, would it not be easier to resolve it now, and to proceed under Part V powers from this date? The Minister could recoup local authorities, under the special powers which he would require to take for all his purposes under Part V.<br/>
Perhaps that is not the policy of the Government, and the Minister does not intend to proceed under Part V at all. If compulsory purchase powers are not to be used on 1st April, 1960, what is the answer? Some hon. Members have suggested that so many houses will be built between now and April, 1960, that there will be no problem. There are two answers to that suggestion. The first is that the computation of 20,000 which I have just given was made on the assumption that the present rate of house-building is at least maintained, if not increased substantially, between now and that date. The second answer is that in many boroughs, as has been made abundantly clear by many London Members, there is simply no room for any more houses. The only way in which persons who are now in requisitioned property can be housed is in that requisitioned property.<br/>
The Minister is unwise to put forward this terminal date of 1st April, 1960. In all probability he will have to come to the House and ask for an extension of it. The Minister will be able to say after the passage of the Bill, "The responsibility is not mine. I am no longer responsible for requisitioned property, beyond paying a certain percentage of the cost. That responsibility is on the local authority." At least one reason for the Bill is to do away with the odium which is on those in the Minister's party who hold requisitioned property, and to pass


that odium on to the local authorities. Indeed, I suggest that the Short Title of the Bill might be amended to read, "Requisitioned houses; the passing of the buck"; or "The transfer of owner-occupier odium." That is a terminal situation, but what is the situation going to be in the meantime?<br/>
As I understood the Parliamentary Secretary, he was well satisfied with all the steps which the local authorities had taken so far to house those persons who are now housed in requisitioned property. If that is so, then what is the excuse for the gradual reduction of the grants made in respect of requisitioned property?<br/>
It seems to me&#x2014;and I think that it has been suggested by two hon. Members, one on each side of the House&#x2014; that the purpose of this reduction is to squeeze the local authorities, to cause them to give up the houses sooner than they would otherwise do. If that is so, would it not be more honest for the Minister to say so, to say that he was dissatisfied with the local authorities, rather than to have the financial scheme provided in the Bill?<br/>
I suggest that these financial provisions are altogether wrong. It has been said repeatedly from both sides of the House that the only reason for requisitioning was the blitz. That is exemplified by the fact that the major number of requisitioned houses are in London, which suffered so severely, whereas there are so few in Scotland, which suffered very little war damage at all.<br/>
If that is so&#x2014;and I think no one can deny it&#x2014;then is it not clear that the liability is a national one and that it should be met from national resources, rather than from the local authority? Various hon. Members have shown how hard it will bear upon individual local authorities. The hardness with which it will bear depends very much upon the local authority. One local authority will suffer perhaps a 1d. increase in its rates, whereas others will suffer 5d. or 6d., and, as one hon. Member said, that sounds very little until one looks at the existing local rate.<br/>
I suggest that this provision needs to be looked at very carefully indeed, and that it should be departed from altogether. I suggest that so long as requisitioning is necessary, and so long as it

arises from a national emergency, it should be met as a national emergency from the Exchequer. After all, when we say, as was said by one hon. Member, that this is a restoration of freedom, it is only a restoration of one small freedom. There is a great deal of requisitioning still going on.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman in his previous office as Minister of Supply had power of requisitioning. He had power to use it in his atomic energy work. The War Department still uses it, and several other Departments use it. All that requisitioning is paid for from the central Exchequer on the ground that the requisitioning is due to national need. I suggest that the housing of these people arises as much from national need as from anything else.<br/>
Clause 10 (2), which has been mentioned on numerous occasions, provides that the Minister may vary the contribution according to the means of the local authority. It might be said that the equity is measured by the Ministerial foot. That is inadvisable for two reasons. From the local authorities' point of view it is inadvisable because they do not know what they should do, they do not know what they are to get, they do not know their liability.<br/>
It is inadvisable from Parliament's point of view because Parliament is giving power to the Minister, apparently, to be generous or to be mean. Parliament should make up its mind how much it is to compel the Government to contribute. A formula should be adopted to cover Clause 10 (2). I understand that formulas have been discussed and that discussions have gone a good way, so it should be possible for the Minister to arrive at a suitable formula.<br/>
May I turn for a moment or two to a closer examination of the Bill? Clause 1 (3) requires a good deal of examination because it does an extraordinary thing; it transfers the whole liability of agreements made between the Minister, or his predecessor, and the owner of the property. Let me give an example of the sort of difficulty that may arise. A mansion house of which I have personal knowledge was requisitioned, first, I think, by the Admiralty. It passed from the Admiralty to the War Office, from the War Office to certain Departments and ultimately


was derequisitioned. At one period during, I think, the Admiralty's occupation an agreement had been made between the Admiralty and the owners for reinstatement of the building. That agreement was not known to any of the subsequent Departments who held it and, under this provision, such an agreement would be referred to the local authority.<br/>
I am aware that in Clause 18 the terminal compensation is wide enough for compensation to be reimbursed to the local authority even if it is not made under the Compensation (Defence) Act, but that sort of thing might happen. Local authorities would be well advised, if this Bill goes through&#x2014;or before it goes through&#x2014;to get a clear undertaking from the Minister that such points are covered.<br/>
I think that Clause 3 is misguided. It provides that if a dwelling house falls vacant at any time, then, unless the Minister gives power, the requisition flies off. What will happen is that local authorities who are afraid that the Minister will not give power to continue the requisition will keep the people in the house rather than pass them on, as is usual, to a new house when one is available. As a result one will have the occupants remaining in the house until the very last day rather than getting a new house in their ordinary turn.<br/>
Clause 4 (1) contains the extraordinary provision that the local authority may be required by the Minister to make representations to the owner for the acceptance of the licensee as statutory tenant. If the local authority does that, it will only be recouped in part for any loss which it incurs. Therefore, the situation is this, that the local authority has to "carry the can" while the Minister wields the whip.<br/>
It is clear from what has been said that no one is very happy about this Bill. The hard cases could have been met by some simple little Bill incorporating Clauses 5 and 6. The other derequisitioning is merely being done so that the owners of property may reap the benefit of being owners of property. As "The Surveyor" said, what is happening is that owners of property will now be in a position to sell their property with vacant possession not later than 1st April, 1960. It must be remembered that many of those owners of property, and particularly the large landlords, were very glad indeed when, during

the blitz in 1940 and 1941, the local authorities took the property off their hands and provided them with a rent. I am sure the right hon. Gentleman will agree.<br/>
I suggest that in those circumstances, the wise thing for the Minister to do would be to say that he will withdraw this Bill and that he will bring in a simple little Bill incorporating Clauses 5 and 6. If he were to do so, we would not proceed with our Amendment. Failing such an assurance from the Minister, we must press our Amendment to a Division.</p>

<p>Some of the things the hon. Gentleman said were somewhat mistaken. However, I will refer to the hon. Member's speech in a few moments.<br/>
Two main criticisms have been levelled at the Bill during this debate. The first is that it will place an unfair burden on the local authorities and on the rates; the second is that it will lead to whole sale evictions in 1960. One hon. Member said that this Bill can be summed up in


three words&#x2014;"Chuck 'em out." All I can say is that both these criticisms are based upon a complete misconception. Listening to the debate, I began to wonder how many hon. Members opposite had, in fact, read the Bill. The hon. Member for Hackney, South (Mr. H. Butler) likened me to Molotov. I could not quite make out what the connection was.</p>

<p>Malenkov? I do not know.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman proceeded to say that he intended to stick to the facts. He very strongly criticised the decision to transfer responsibility to local authorities under the Bill, and he said&#x2014;these were his words, as far as I could take them down: "It is for the Government to repair the ravages of war. It is for the Government to look after the people who were bombed out."<br/>
We can all agree on that, and I believe that we are doing our best to do so by the Bill. But the hon. Member who wished to stick to the facts should be reminded of the facts. My hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary told the House earlier that at the end of the war about 70,000 properties were held under requisition for housing purposes. Since the war, to help meet the housing shortage, 50,000 other properties have been requisitioned.<br/>
In fact, it was only last year, for the first time, that the number of requisitioned houses fell below the number held at the end of the war. In a number of areas, more houses have been requisitioned since the war than were requisitioned during the war. I am meeting the hon. Member's point about looking after those who were bombed out. Such figures as are available seem to suggest that a very high proportion of those who today are living in requisitioned houses are people who have moved into them since the end of the war.</p>

<p>I am not saying that they were improperly taken over. I am saying that this is not primarily a war-time problem with which we are dealing.<br/>
All this shows quite clearly, I maintain &#x2014;and I do not think there is any dispute among local authorities about it &#x2014;that requisitioned houses have become part and parcel of the ordinary pool of local authority housing accommodation. The only difference is that, instead of being owned by the local authorities, they are owned by private citizens and are compulsorily rented by the State; and instead of being partly paid for by local authorities they are entirely paid for by the Exchequer.</p>

<p>Those are the main differences. We consider that both these features are objectionable and must not be allowed to continue indefinitely. The use of war-time powers for peace-time purposes is something which must be brought to an end as quickly as possible.<br/>
The right hon. Member for Bishop Auckland (Mr. Dalton) said several times that the period of five years was too short, and the hon. Member for Hackney, South said the Bill amounted to "chucking them out." Let us be quite clear about what we are trying to do. We want to bring these war-time arrangements to an end; we want to release these houses and return them to their owners as quickly as possible. I ask the House to recognise that this is the basis of the Bill.<br/>
In so far as these houses cannot be released between now and 1960 without causing hardship to the occupants their retention must be regularised by agreement with the owners. That is what we are setting out to do.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Clapham (Mr. Gibson), who, like myself, represents a part of Wandsworth, said that the State should continue to pay 100 per cent, of the net cost. We do not


agree. We consider, having regard to the fact that these houses have become part of the general pool of housing accommodation&#x2014;[An HON. MEMBER: "Not at all."]&#x2014;that local authorities should bear some share of the cost of these requisitioned dwellings in the same way as they do for council houses. Only in that way will they have a direct interest in keeping down the expenditure.<br/>
That, broadly, is what the Bill tries to do. In view of some of the things which have been said during the course of the debate, I should like to emphasise two things which the Bill does not do. The first is that it does not place an unfair burden on local authorities&#x2014;[HON. MEMBERS: "Oh."] Is that denied?</p>

<p>The right hon. Member for Bishop Auckland said that it would place an undue financial burden on local authorities. We were told in the course of the debate that it might involve an increase of 4&#x00BD;d. in the rates in Wands-worth&#x2014;a matter of great interest to me&#x2014; of 5d. in Hackney, and 10d. in Camberwell.<br/>
The right hon. Member for Bishop Auckland and the hon. Member for Clapham particularly asked for some information about the formula for the operation of the discretionary grant in Clause 10. I should like to give this information to the House. The local authority associations with whom I have worked out these proposals suggested the following formula, which I will read to the House. They suggested that provided the Minister is satisfied with the progress made in carrying out the Bill in a particular local authority area, a local authority whose net expenditure under the Bill
<q>exceeds the equivalent of a 2d. rate should be eligible for a discretionary additional grant&#x2026;</q>
and&#x2014;[An HON. MEMBER: "Is that a ceiling?"] I think an absolutely firm ceiling would be a great mistake because it would provide no incentive at all. This is what the local authorities associations proposed to me:

<q>Over and above the first 2d. rate the next 4d. should attract a grant of 75 per cent., the next 6d. a grant of 90 per cent. and. bevond that, 100 per cent.</q>
That is what they proposed to me as the formula for the operation of this discretionary grant. Whilst I am not in a position finally to commit myself on this point, I am prepared to say to the House tonight that I consider this formula quite reasonable and does not differ very substantially from what the Government have in mind. Therefore, local authorities can assume that something on these sort of lines will be the formula which we shall adopt. I hope that will go some way to meet the views which have been expressed.</p>

<p>It will be implemented by good faith. [HON. MEMBERS: "Oh."] As the right hon. Member for Bishop Auckland knows, when a Minister makes a statement such as I have just made, it amounts to almost the same thing as putting it into the Bill. I am certainly prepared to consider whether it would be desirable to put it in the Bill, but I do not think that a formula for a discretionary grant should necessarily go into the Bill. If it did, it would have to be worded rather more fully than I have given it this evening. But I certainly do not reject that possibility.</p>

<p>I must get on. Several hon. Members have referred to my negotiations with the local authority associations. Some Members have suggested that these consultations were extremely perfunctory. It may interest the House to know that we had no fewer than five meetings, extending over three months, and altogether these meetings lasted for 16 hours. That should dispose of the suggestion that there was insufficient consultation. The right hon. Member for Poplar(Mr. Key) said that I had treated the local authorities roughly and that I had led them up the garden path. All I can say is that that is hardly borne out by the letters of appreciation which I have received from each of the local authority associations since the publication of the Bill.<br/>
This is to a large extent a London problem and a good deal has naturally been said about the views of the Metropolitan Boroughs Joint Standing Committee, whose attitude is of particular interest because, as my hon. Friend the Member for Lewisham, North (Sir A. Hudson) pointed out, it is governed by a large Labour majority. It would, therefore, be of interest if I read a passage from the conclusions of this circular, which has gone out to every local authority in London. It is public property, I think, by now.</p>

<p>No. I took the trouble to ask whether this was a document which I might quote to the House. This is what it says, in its concluding paragraphs:
<q>The new Bill has been drafted after close consultation with the representatives of the local authorities, during which the Minister has paid regard to the observations and views which have been submitted by the Committee's representatives and by representatives of other local authority associations. We consider that the proposals provide a reasonable and workable scheme for bringing the emergency requisitioning procedure to an end with due respect to the housing obligations of the borough councils.</q>
The second thing which the Bill does not do is to put anybody's rent up or to make anybody homeless. That last one is the main accusation which has been made against us by the party opposite.</p>

<p>Very well; I add that. It will not make anybody homeless in 1960 or thereafter. The Amendment alleges that this is
<q>a Bill which contemplates the eviction of occupants of requisitioned houses in 1960 without providing for their rehousing &#x2026;</q>

I cannot conceive of a more reckless disregard for accuracy than that statement. I can only assume that when the Amendment was placed on the Order Paper the right hon. Member for Bishop Auckland and his colleagues had not had time to read the Bill. Judging from some

of the speeches which have been made today, that omission had not been made good before the debate started.<br/>
I am as keenly aware as any other hon. Member of the practical impossibility of releasing requisitioned houses without making provision for the accommodation of the occupants. The right hon. Member for Bishop Auckland reminded me that I was a London Member, if that was necessary; but not only am I a London Member, I represent the Borough of Wandsworth.</p>

<p>A very good part of it. The Council of the Borough of Wandsworth holds more requisitioned houses than any other local authority in the whole country. In framing the Bill, to which I have devoted many hours, I set myself the task of winding up requisitioning in such a way that not one single family would be rendered homeless. I sincerely believe that anyone who understands this problem and has read the Bill will be satisfied on that score.<br/>
However, in view of the fact that the Opposition have thought fit to place the Amendment on the Order Paper, I must ask the House to go through the Bill with me in some detail, to see just how the occupants of requisitioned houses will be affected. Between now and 1960 a proportion of these occupants, in the ordinary course of events, will move out of requisitioned dwellings into council houses or other homes which they have found for themselves. That is the normal process which is going on all the time. I think that the party opposite will agree that the allegation in their Amendment clearly does not apply to those people and I need not discuss them.</p>

<p>I will go right through the provisions if hon. Members will give me time and not interrupt.<br/>
Then there is the occupant whose landlord applies to the courts under Clause 5 for release of his house for his own occupation. I am glad to say that the right hon. Member for Bishop Auckland and other hon. Members have expressed sympathy with the position of these people. The right hon. Member said to me, "Why was it necessary to have compulsion?" I


have with me, but have not the time to read them, a whole list of hardship cases of this kind, some of which have been submitted to me by hon. Members opposite. They are cases where the local authority has refused to release the house.<br/>
One hon. Member opposite wrote:
<q>If the Ministry has any powers of compulsion so as to secure the derequisitioning of this house, I shall be grateful for their being used as rigorously as possible.</q>
These applications will only be granted by the court if it is proved that the hardship caused to the owner by being excluded from his house is greater than the hardship caused to the occupants by having to move out. Clearly, therefore, there is no case of injustice. Moreover, the local authority will provide the occupants with alternative accommodation.</p>

<p>Let me explain. If the number of owners who want their houses back to live in were numerous the rehousing of the occupants might present great difficulties. But, as we know quite well from the inquiries which we have made and the number of applications which we have received, they are not at all numerous. This fact has been confirmed during today's debate by the hon. and gallant Member for Brixton (Lieut-Colonel Lipton) by the hon. Member for Islington, South-West (Mr. A. Evans) and by the hon. Member for Hackney, South (Mr. H. Butler). Even at a time when these houses were requisitioned only a very small proportion belonged to owner-occupiers, and in the ten or fifteen years which have elapsed since then the majority of these people have gone somewhere else to live and do not now any longer want to move. Some of them, of course, have died.<br/>
Apart from any council houses which may be available, other requisitioned dwellings are constantly falling vacant. Requisitioned dwellings which become vacant will normally be released, but local authorities who need some of them to rehouse occupants who have been moved as a result of a decision of a court will be authorised to retain them under Clause 3 of the Bill, to which reference has been made.<br/>
There should, therefore, be little or no difficulty at all in providing alterna-

tive suitable accommodation for the very small number of families who are going to be involved, and this will usually be done without any resort whatever to the use of council houses. It is quite absurd for the hon. Member for Sparkbrook and others to say that the Bill will block the prospects of people on the housing list and slow down slum clearance.<br/>
Incidentally, the hon. Member referred to the criticism in the "Birmingham Mail." I have looked up the leading article, but I have not time now to read it to the House. However, I can say that it ends up in a way most flattering to the Bill.</p>

<p>I was concerned with what the "Birmingham Mail" said.<br/>
There were other types of hardship cases where the owner suffers financial hardship and urgently needs to sell his house and he cannot get a good and reasonable price unless he gets vacant possession. In such cases the Minister is empowered, under Clause 6, to require the local authority to release the house. However, if it is not possible to provide other suitable accommodation for the occupant, then the local authority may purchase the house instead of releasing it.</p>

<p>He may be required by the Minister to purchase the house instead of releasing it. It was precisely to protect the occupants in such cases that we provided this alternative in Clause 6 The right hon. Member for Bishop Auckland will, I think, agree that, here again, there is no justification for the allegation which he has made.<br/>
We are left with the case of occupants of requisitioned houses who, by 1960, have not found alternative accommodation elsewhere and whose landlords have not been willing to accept them as statutory tenants. I cannot say how many cases there will be. In many parts of the country there may be no such cases at all. But in framing this Bill we have assumed that in some cases the number will be quite considerable. In such areas the local authorities will be advised to try and rent the houses they need to retain after 1960. Our information is that many


owners will be perfectly willing to let their houses to local authorities for a further period of 10 or 15 years and will regard this as a very sound investment.<br/>
The occupants of houses which have been rented in this way will, naturally, continue as tenants of the local authority, and I ask the right hon. Gentleman does he not agree that their security of tenure would remain precisely the same as it is today. There, again, is another category of occupants who will not be evicted in 1960, as the Amendment suggests.<br/>
Next, I take the case of the occupant whose landlord agrees to convert the requisition into a statutory rent-controlled tenancy. How will he be placed in 1960? So far as his rent is concerned, his position will be exactly the same as it is now. He will pay just as much as the local authority considers reasonable. If that is less than the standard rent then the local authority will make up the difference. As for his security of tenure, it will, of course, be greatly increased: he will have the protection of all the safeguards provided by the Rent Acts. Again, I ask the right hon. Gentleman, does he not agree that occupants in that category will not be evicted in 1960?<br/>
In most places it should be possible to accommodate all the occupants of requisitioned houses by one or other of the methods to which I have referred. We realise, however, that there will be areas, particularly in London, where there will still remain a number of occupants who cannot be accommodated in council houses, in rented houses or by means of statutory tenancies. In those areas local authorities will have to buy&#x2014;and I wish to make this point clear&#x2014;whatever houses are necessary to provide accommodation for the residents.</p>

<p>Under the Housing Act, 1936, local authorities possess powers of compulsory purchase, and in the event of their being unable to purchase sufficient houses by agreement, they will have to use those powers. According to our policy, however, they will use them in the last resort, and in the last resort only. From all the inquiries we have made we know that there will be an ample number of owners who will be prepared freely to offer their houses for sale at a proper price, and we are quite confident that the use of those compulsory powers will not be necessary. I say again to the right hon. Gentleman that those people will not be evicted in 1960.</p>

<p>I believe I have covered every conceivable eventuality, and I submit that the allegations contained in the Amendment are unfounded and unjustified. I will not press the point any further at this late stage, though I think that the right hon. Gentleman might well withdraw his charge, because neither he nor his hon. Friends have sustained this allegation in their speeches throughout this debate. Although the criticism which has been put forward has been all too easy to dispose of, I regret it, because it has tended to conceal the fact that there is no dispute between us about the objective. The objective of this Bill is to return these houses to their owners as quickly as possible consistent with the avoidance of hardship to the present occupiers. The Bill will, I am confident, achieve that objective.</p>

<p>I was hoping that we might have a word of explanation from the Financial Secretary to the Treasury about this Money Resolution, which is obviously long and complicated. There are many questions on which the Committee would wish to be satisfied before accepting the Motion in its present form.<br/>
There does not appear to be any Treasury representative on the Government Front Bench, with the exception of the Patronage Secretary. Perhaps he will deal with this Motion. There are many financial points of the greatest possible importance to local authorities on which we require satisfactory assurances. In the absence of the Financial Secretary I imagine that the Minister of Housing and Local Government, or the Prime Minister, will deal with the matter. Therefore, I will address my remarks to them.<br/>
During the last few minutes of the Minister's speech in the debate on the Second Reading we heard two very important announcements. The right hon. Gentleman attempted to clear up two matters which had been the subject of great speculation on both sides of the House about the powers of local authorities to acquire property, in view of what will almost certainly happen in many areas in 1960. It will then become necessary for some local authorities to purchase houses so as to complete the technique of derequisitioning. I would ask the Minister whether this Resolution is, in its present form, sufficiently wide to enable Amendments to be put down in the Committee on the Bill to ensure that the cost which will fall upon local authorities who have to purchase houses will be fully subsidised by the Government.<br/>
I am sure that the Minister fully appreciates this point. He conceded, in his winding-up speech, that there would be many cases in which the Bill could be implemented only by local authorities exercising their powers of compulsory purchase under the 1936 Act.</p>

<p>The Minister shakes his head, but I think we may take it that there will be, as the right hon. Gentleman himself has said, a number of cases, particularly in densely populated areas like Islington, where the provisions of the Bill will mean that if the local authorities are to derequisition all the requisitioned houses and are to provide alternative accommodation for the tenants of them, they will have to fall back on the powers of purchase. That will inevitably happen. If, in 1960, local authorities are driven to purchase houses, they will presumably have to do so on the assumption that vacant possession will be given. Therefore, the owner will get the full market price.<br/>
If that happens, a great burden will fall upon the local authorities, particularly those of boroughs like Islington, Deptford and West Ham, unless provision is made in the Bill for them to be fully indemnified by the Treasury for the cost which will fall upon them as a direct consequence of the Bill.<br/>
It seems to me&#x2014;and I have done my best to understand it&#x2014;that in its present form the Money Resolution is not wide enough to cover the Amendments which those of us on these benches who represent local authorities will wish to put down in Committee in an effort to ensure that local authorities are not penalised by the Bill. I think it very unfortunate that we have not had a word of explanation from the Minister or from the Parliamentary Secretary, and that the Committee has not been treated with the courtesy of the presence of a Treasury representative.<br/>
I am reminded that the Patronage Secretary is present, but we have not the presence of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Financial Secretary or the Economic Secretary. I have no doubt that, before we conclude the Committee stage, we shall have the presence of one or other of those right hon. and hon. Gentlemen. In the meantime, I have no doubt that the Patronage Secretary will do his best to understand what this is all about, and will deal with the matter.<br/>
My second question, which is an important one, is this: can the Minister


elaborate the explanation which he gave in his speech on Second Reading by telling me whether or not I am right in assuming that, in cases where local authorities will be driven to purchase houses in order to complete the operation of derequisitioning, they will have to purchase those houses on the footing that there is a protected tenant under the Rent Acts in them, or whether they will have to purchase them on the footing that, in 1960, that protected tenant will become a trespasser, and, after a period of time. liable to eviction?<br/>
The Minister will realise that the cost to local authorities will vary considerably, and that there will be a large number of boroughs on whom the Bill will throw a very heavy and unfair burden unless something is done about it at this stage. I hope that, in view of the extremely vague and narrow form in which the Money Resolution is drafted, we shall have an opportunity, if we so desire in Committee, to put down the necessary Amendments.<br/>
It may well be that the Minister does not know the answer to this problem, in which event I think that the appropriate course would be for the Committee stage of this Resolution to be adjourned, because I think that the matter which I am now raising is of such importance that the Committee would not wish to part with it unless we get a categorical answer from the Treasury about it. The Resolution is thoroughly unsatisfactory, and in its present form I should not be prepared to support it. I hope that we shall have an answer to this, and to other points which, I have no doubt, will be raised by my hon. Friends before we part with the Bill.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1955-02-15a.323.0" hansard_membership_id="12613" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/20838" speakername="Mr. J. A. Sparks" colnum="323" time="">
<p>I, too, would like to protest at the Financial Secretary not being present to give the Committee the reasons for this Money Resolution. The Bill is very complicated and the least the Government could have done would have been to have arranged for either the Financial Secretary or the Minister himself to give the Committee a brief out line of its main points.<br/>
Under Clause 4, where an arrangement is come to between the local authority and the owner that the owner will take over the licensee as a statutory

tenant, the local authority is under an obligation to pay compensation to that owner. There are, roughly, three categories of compensation. First, there is compensation for the loss of vacant possession value. Secondly, provision is made for compensation to be paid if the licensee pays a rent lower than the compensation rent paid to the owner under requisitioning arrangements. Thirdly, there is terminal compensation. It is upon vacant possession value and terminal compensation that I wish to ask the right hon. Gentleman one or two questions.<br/>
Since requisitioning, quite a large number of these houses have had very considerable sums of public money spent upon them for conversion and adaptation for the families who have gone to live in them. Many of these houses have been converted almost into self-contained flats. As a result, their vacant possession value is today very much higher than would otherwise have been the case. I should like an assurance from the Minister that he will not give to that class of owners a vacant possession value which has been created by this public expenditure.<br/>
The basis of terminal compensation is that at the end of requisitioning, when the house is handed back to the owner, any compensation due to him should be offset by the amount of public money spent on improving the property. This Money Resolution does not say that that will, in fact, take place. I therefore ask the right hon. Gentleman to give an assurance that the large sums that have been spent in improving this property and increasing its vacant possession value will be offset against the compensation paid to the owner at the end of requisitioning. We should have that cleared up, because very large sums of public money are involved. In his speech just now the Minister made very little reference to the financial provisions, and that, among other matters, needs to be made clear.<br/>
My second point arises from Clause 11, which provides for "Contributions to cost of lease or purchase." I am not quite clear&#x2014;and the Minister left the House in a state of confusion on this point&#x2014; whether the local authorities will be required before 31st March, 1960, to acquire by agreement or compulsorily all the remaining requisitioned dwellings that will


not have been otherwise disposed of by other Clauses in the Bill.<br/>
Does the right hon. Gentleman agree that these powers of acquisition by agreement or by compulsory purchase are limited to the next five years, terminating on 31st March, 1960;or, when the houses become derequisitioned and when the owner receives back possession and the occupants then become trespassers and are liable to be put out, does the Money Resolution allow local authorities after that date to acquire such houses by compulsory purchase or by agreement?<br/>
If they do acquire such houses by agreement or by compulsory purchase after 31st March, 1960, will they then receive the benefit of Treasury contribution, namely, 75 per cent, of the deficit involved in the transaction, or will they, as they now have to do if they desire to buy a vacant house or even a house that is occupied, have to buy it at its market value with no contribution from the Treasury whatsoever?<br/>
That is a very important point, particularly for the local authorities. I assume that the Money Resolution is designed to tie up these points which we have put forward tonight. It is important that the right hon. Gentleman should shed some light on this question of compensation to be paid to owners of property. In the light of the large sums of public money that have already been spent to improve and increase the vacant possession value of property, are they allowed to get away with the advantage that would be created by the expenditure of public money? If not, how does the right hon. Gentleman propose to offset that expenditure of public money against the compensation that is being paid?<br/>
Finally, there is the point about the date 31st March, 1960. Are local authorities to be allowed to acquire compulsorily any houses then being derequisitioned but which are occupied by the licensees? May they acquire them by agreement or by compulsory power, and may they enjoy the Treasury contribution of 75 percent, which they would have enjoyed had they purchased the house prior to the date that I have mentioned? The Committee is entitled to an explanation on those points, and I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will give it to us before we agree to the Money Resolution.</p>

<p>I feel that the Committee is entitled to better treatment from the Government Front Bench on this very important Money Resolution. The debate on the Bill took a remarkable course, with the Minister keeping under his hat until the last minute some of the more important financial provisions of the Bill, namely, the formula for the grant. It was a most extraordinary procedure. It was as if the Minister had retained something of news value for himself, depriving the House of the benefit of that information, to which the House was entitled at an early stage.<br/>
On this important Resolution, there is no Chancellor of the Exchequer to assist the Committee, no Financial Secretary to the Treasury, no Economic Secretary to the Treasury, not even a Lords Commissioner sitting on the Government Front Bench. In view of the enormous amount of public money which may be involved in the passage of the Resolution, we are entitled to better treatment.<br/>
At the end of the Second Reading debate the Minister referred to the fact that in certain circumstances certain local authorities might be obliged to engage in very substantial purchases of houses to accommodate those who are licensees in requisitioned premises. I want to know whether provision is made for that contingency in the Money Resolution. Is the answer that provision is made under the 1936 Act? I do not know and I should like information on the subject, because I assure the right hon. Gentleman that that part of his proposals will give rise to considerable debate in Committee.<br/>
We are in the dark about what will be involved in compensation to the owners of houses which are so to be acquired by local authorities and we are entitled to know where, in the Resolution, reference is made to the Government's proposal. How many millions of pounds of national money or local authority money may be involved in carrying out this proposal? These are important matters, and I protest against the Treasury's conduct in leaving the Minister to his own devices and leaving the Committee to guess on highly technical matters of economics.</p>

<p>The theme running through most of today's speeches has been the impoverish-


ment of local authorities. Hardly a month passes without the House of Commons placing heavy burdens, either in administration or in finance, upon local authorities.<br/>
I want the Minister to give an assurance that the allocation to be laid down will be reconsidered when the Bill is in Committee. The requisitioning of houses was introduced because of national circumstances and the responsibility and the cost should therefore be a national charge. I want an assurance from the Minister that the charge will be entirely a national charge and not a charge falling on the already impoverished local authorities. If he will give an assurance that the matter will be reconsidered in Committee, some of us will be satisfied.</p>

<p>Even at this late hour, the Committee should not allow this important Money Resolution to pass on the nod. I saw the Patronage Secretary moving about in his seat when my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, East (Mr. E. Fletcher) rose to say a word on the Resolution, but we should not allow a Resolution involving such large sums of money to pass without some consideration. We know that a lot of money is involved. We know that the cost to the Treasury over the years since the war has been heavy. Both parties have regretted that high cost.<br/>
I also agree that something should be done to reduce as much as possible the amount of expenditure on requisitioned houses, with due fairness to the interested parties. To that extent, I welcome the Resolution, though I must make some reservations about it. It places rather too heavy a financial burden upon some local authorities. Some authorities are not very much affected. Others who have large numbers of requisitioned premises are very much involved.<br/>
I know that the Minister is not only taking powers to pay a75 per cent, contribution towards the net deficit of the local authorities, but also special powers to give special grants. The Resolution refers to
<q>special grants to such authorities payable at the discretion of the said Minister, with the consent of the Treasury, and of such amounts as he may, with the like consent, determine,&#x2026;</q>

The Minister, at whose discretion these grants are to be made, said something today about the formula which had been discussed and upon which he would base the special grants.<br/>
The Minister should have enlightened us earlier on this rather important aspect of the Money Resolution. At the close of the Second Reading debate, the right hon. Gentleman gave us some figures which he and the local authority representatives had discussed. Presumably, the formula had not been finalised. I understood the right hon. Gentleman to say on Second Reading that he would consider whether he could insert the formula in the Money Resolution.</p>

<p>The right hon. Gentleman certainly seemed to suggest that he would consider whether he could make a specific statement about the formula at some stage in our discussion of the Bill. I hope that at some stage we shall have the final formula from the Minister. It may be that when my hon. and right hon. Friends have decided that the Resolution has been sufficiently discussed, the right hon. Gentleman will be able to give us the formula in detail. It is very important to the "hard core" authorities. Undoubtedly they will be heavily burdened by the operation of the Bill.<br/>
The Bill provides that the owners of requisitioned property are to receive compensation payments in lieu of their right to vacate possession. I hope that the Minister will give us the basis upon which compensation payment is to be made. This is very important, because public money is involved. Many owners will, I suspect, receive a rather nice capital gain out of their houses, free of tax, when these compensation payments are made. I think that the Committee is entitled to ask, before this Resolution is allowed to go through, on what basis the compensation payments in lieu of the right to vacate possession will be made.</p>

<p>I do not know whether the Minister intends to reply, but I can assure him that on this side of the Committee we have no intention, if we can help it, of allowing him to sit there dumb, making no comment whatever on what, after all, is a very long and complicated Money Resolution. It runs to one and a half pages, and, having


had some small experience of Money Resolutions when I sat on that side, I find it hard to charge my memory with any instance when a Money Resolution so long and so complicated was expected to go through, as it were, on the nod.<br/>
The Government which preceded this one were only too eager to give the Committee all the explanation the Committee needed; in fact, they would go out of their way, frequently at a very late hour, to explain carefully and fully just what was involved in any particular Resolution of this sort which was moved from that Bench. I take it that hon. Gentlemen on that side find nothing unusual, nothing wrong, in a Resolution of this kind going through apparently without comment. I cannot understand their attitude. I can only assume that they can trust their Front Bench, and I can tell them that is more than we do.<br/>
Within the last day or two we have had a woeful exhibition of the fact that the Government are not even to be trusted to deal with cheese&#x2014;much less money of the volume which is indicated by this Resolution.</p>

<p>The Minister left until the very end of the Second Reading debate any indication of what the financial commitments in the Bill were, and now apparently we are to wait until the end of this debate on the Money Resolution before we get any inkling whatever of what are the amounts involved. We have not the faintest notion what the total amounts indicated in this Resolution may be, and I think we are entitled to know, within limits, just how much is involved.<br/>
As my hon. Friends have indicated, the local authorities are heavily involved in this Bill, and I think that for their sake, and certainly for those who will have to find a great deal of money, it is our duty, as an Opposition, to insist on the Minister giving us some explanation of just what these various provisions mean. I therefore rise only for the purpose of assuring the right hon. Gentleman that we are not just being factious in our opposition. We really do feel it is our duty to get him to indicate this; we do not mind how long he stands at the Box. We are willing to stay all night if necessary.<br/>
We think that not only this Committee but the country at large is entitled to know what this long and complicated Resolution means, and how much it will involve the taxpayer, the ratepayer and the local authorities, who will come under the provisions of the Bill, the Second Reading of which we have just completed. I can see that the Minister is anxious to get up, and now that the Parliamentary Secretary has, I think, finished his visits to the officials under the gallery I have no doubt that the right hon. Gentleman is now fully armed with the answers to the questions put by my hon. Friends.<br/>
Without more ado I will sit down, in the full hope that we shall now get a complete explanation, such as we should have, of this very long and involved Resolution.</p>

<p>I shall try not to keep the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Colne Valley (Mr. Glenvil Hall) up all night, although he seems anxious to stay up. First of all, let me say there is nothing unusual about the framing of this Money Resolution. The right hon. Gentleman said that he had some experience of framing such Resolutions, and that was no doubt when he was Financial Secretary to the Treasury. If he casts his mind back he will remember that Money Resolutions on housing Measures of all kinds, which involve the expenditure of substantial sums of Government money, are always framed in this lengthy and detailed fashion. We followed the normal precedent adopted by the right hon. Gentleman and his colleagues when they were responsible for the finances of the country.<br/>
Various points have been raised, and I think I can briefly and clearly reply to them. The hon. Member for Acton (Mr. Sparks) asked what would happen in a case where a house had been improved and then, later, was derequisitioned in the ordinary way. Judging by most of the houses that I have seen, I am afraid that the majority have not been improved at all, and anything that has happened has been in the other direction.</p>

<p>That is not an answer.</p>

<p>I was prefacing my answer with that remark.<br/>
I think they would be rare cases, but in a case where that occurs I am able to assure the hon. Gentleman that any increased value which accrues as a result of improvements made and works done while the property was held under requisition will be taken into account and offset in calculating the terminal compensation for dilapidations which will be due to be paid at the end of the requisitioning. There is nothing new in that. It is not a provision of the Bill, nor is it our intention to depart from what is actual practice.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1955-02-15a.331.0" hansard_membership_id="12613" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/20838" speakername="Mr. Sparks" colnum="331" time="">
<p>On that point, may I ask the right hon. Gentleman a question? He says that this amount will be offset against the compensation due for dilapidations, but my point is that the vacant possession value of such premises would be greatly enhanced by such expenditure of public funds and my query is whether that expenditure would be offset against that enhanced vacant possession value, as well as dilapidations, which may be lower than the increased value accruing to the house?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1955-02-15a.331.1" hansard_membership_id="6684" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/29185" speakername="Mr. Sandys" colnum="331" time="">
<p>I am not conversant with that particular point, but I do not think it will ever arise, because in a case where a house is being bought there will still be compensation to be paid. These houses, for the most part, had been requisitioned for 10 or 15 years already, and it may be another five years when this happens. So, for the best part of a generation, they will have been held by the Government, and I think it will be very rare to find that the improvements that have been done are of greater value than the dilapidations which have taken place. But I will certainly watch that point, though I do not think it is one of great significance in the financial considerations.<br/>
I would point out to the hon. Member that this is already provided. We are not beginning anything new in the matter of compensation. There is nothing new about purchasing houses when they are requisitioned. That is all provided for in the Compensation (Defence) Act, 1939, and in Clause 2 of the Bill these provisions are specifically retained in respect of houses which are no longer held by the Government and which are transferred under the Bill to the local authority. I am sorry if I am not familiar with all the details of that very compli-

cated Act, but I can say that it will continue to apply under the provisions of this Bill in exactly the same way as it has applied during all those years.<br/>
I was asked about the price in the event of these houses being purchased. As I explained earlier, I do not expect that it will be necessary to use compulsory powers because I think there will be sufficient houses whose owners are willing either to lease or to sell them. But in the event of a house being bought compulsorily, the price to be paid is defined and governed by the Town and Country Planning Act, 1954. In most cases this provides for market value with vacant possession.<br/>
There are circumstances in which the price will be less than the market value with vacant possession&#x2014;that is to say, in cases where the property has some special development value other than for its existing use. If, however, the owner asks for more than the price which it would be permissible to pay if the house were compulsorily purchased&#x2014;I am talking now about a purchase which is made voluntarily&#x2014;in practice the purchase will not take place.</p>

<p>No, I do not expect that the owner will ask for more than he would get if he had the house released and sold it on the open market. There is no reason why he should.</p>

<p>But the scarcity value creates the market value to some extent. The value is determined in the first in stance by the district valuer. Again we are not laying down any new procedure; this is the normal procedure. If these houses are compulsorily purchased they will be purchased for precisely the same price as they would be if this Bill did not exist. There is nothing new about that, and there is no problem with which we have to concern ourselves tonight in that respect.</p>

<p>But would not the owner also have, in addition, the certain knowledge that the house would not only be his with vacant possession, but in a proper state of repair, whereas very often houses which come into the market in that way, although there is vacant possession, are not in a perfect state of repair?</p>

<p>It does not much matter whether he sells it with an allowance for the assumption that it is in a proper state of repair or whether he gets terminal compensation for dilapidations from the Government. In point of fact, as the law stands, he will sell the house for what it is worth as it stands in its present state of repair. In addition, he is entitled, under the 1939 Act, to terminal compensation for dilapidations, and that will make up the difference.</p>

<p>That is governed by the Bill. It is over 20 years. Clause 11, which <i>is</i> entitled "Contributions to cost of lease or purchase," gives all the information that the hon. Gentleman requires.<br/>
I was asked about compensation for vacant possession under Clause 4. That is the Clause under which the owner is invited to grant a tenancy to the occupant. The amount that is payable there will, as the Bill provides, be reckoned as part of the net annual deficit which the local authority can reckon for grant; that is to say, the local authority will get the 75 per cent, and, if necessary, the additional discretionary grant in the case of a local authority which has a severe problem.<br/>
In general, all these points and the financial provisions of the Bill have been discussed and agreed with the local authority associations, so that there need be no anxiety that an undue burden will be placed on local authorities or on their rates. Then, we have this additional safeguard to which I referred earlier&#x2014; this discretionary grant, which enables us to relieve the burden on local authorities where that burden might be excessive.</p>

<p>Might I put one further point to the Minister? He has just referred me to Clause 11 which, as he says, provides the contribution by the Exchequer towards the cost of purchase. That contribution by the Exchequer for purchase by a local authority is limited to 75 per cent, of the net annual deficit. What I wish to ask is this: when we reach the Committee stage, several of my hon. Friends and myself will be anxious

to put down Amendments to Clause 11 to try to increase the Exchequer contribution to a local authority, and I am not at all certain whether this Money Resolution, in its present form, is sufficiently wide for me to put down such an Amendment. May I have an assurance from the Minister that this Resolution is sufficiently wide for such an Amendment, if put down, to be in order?</p>

<p>Really. At the last moment we now learn that it will be impossible, within the framework of this Resolution, for an Amendment, which I think several of my hon. Friends think must be put down in order that justice may be done, to be put down. This is a most extraordinary situation. We have been denied the presence of any representative of the Treasury here tonight, and it is almost an insult to the Committee that that is so. This is the first time, at least within my experience, that, when the Committee is considering a Money Resolution, it has not had the benefit of the presence of a representative of the Treasury.<br/>
Now, however, we know the reason for this absence. This Resolution is so tightly drawn that we are unable to put down Amendments in order to increase the Exchequer contribution. There has been the greatest secrecy about what formula has been devised, and I cannot believe that it is acceptable to any local authority that the Exchequer contribution should be limited as it is limited under the definition in Clause 11. It is quite certainly not acceptable to the local authority at Islington nor, I suggest, to those in other parts of London. I feel that we are entitled to ask that this Money Resolution be taken back and redrafted so that it may be extended and widened in order that we may consider such an Amendment in Committee.</p>

<p>A very serious situation has arisen. The core of the Bill is financial, and deals with local authorities. Now the right hon. Gentleman has risen and blandly assured us, to the great delight of hon. Members opposite&#x2014;that during the Committee stage we shall not be able to do anything on a matter which vital. 1 do not know why they should dislike local authorities so much; so far as I know, local authorities have done them no harm; local authorities are doing a wonderful job of work in this direction and will suffer great financial loss and find it difficult to make ends meet, as we have been told in this debate. That will turn the Committee stage into a farce.<br/>
I must add my plea to that made by my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, East (Mr. E. Fletcher). If no sums are mentioned in the Money Resolution, and we have not been told what the total cost is to be, why should the Minister put in a percentage of this kind which goes to the root of the main provision of the Bill? We must ask the right hon. Gentleman why he did this. It has undoubtedly hamstrung further proceedings on the Bill.<br/>
Today we have been treated in a very shabby fashion. The right hon. Gentleman did not speak until the end of the debate, and even then left to the fag-end of what he had to say any reference whatever to the formula of the financial provisions which underlie this Measure. 1 was not quarrelling with the length of the Money Resolution. The right hon. Gentleman seemed to think that that was my objection. My objection is that we got no explanation from the Government Front Bench and had to drag the right hon. Gentleman to his feet, and then got an inadequate explanation.<br/>
We cannot leave the matter where it is. The Opposition have been treated in far too cavalier a fashion. We owe a duty to the nation to demand that this matter shall be tackled with more seriousness than has been shown by the Minister. I

want to ask him if he will rise in his place and assure us that he is willing to take back this Resolution to leave the percentage at large, so that we can at any rate discuss this with some reality when we reach the Committee stage.</p>

<p>I did not clearly understand the answer which the Minister gave to me concerning the point I made about Clause 11. Am I to understand that the provisions included in Clause 11, which are financial provisions, apply only to purchases by local authorities of requisitioned dwellings before 31st March, 1960? I ask that because, in winding up the debate, the Minister frankly admitted that at that date there would still be a number of houses containing licensees not otherwise accommodated. He hoped that on that date, when the houses became derequisitioned and the licensees became trespassers, that the local authority would be able to persuade the owner either to take over the existing tenants, or trespassers, or that the local authority might arrange a tenancy with the owner, or take such a house on a lease for a period, or probably even purchase the house, to give security to the families already in it.<br/>
My point is whether the financial provisions of Clause 11 apply to cases where local authorities, after 31st March, 1960, take out leases, or buy houses, to accommodate families who will then be trespassers. I see no reason why these financial provisions should not be extended for a period, if the right hon. Gentleman wishes, after 31st March, 1960, because he has admitted that at that date there will still be a problem outstanding. It would be satisfactory if he could give an asurance that these provisions will apply to such cases. If his answer is in the negative, he will be making it far more difficult for these families who will be left to avoid the risk of being placed on the street. Therefore, I would beg the Minister to answer in the affirmative.</p>

<p>Perhaps I might answer the points raised. The right hon. Member for Colne Valley said that the party opposite might wish to increase the percentage of the grants in respect of purchases of houses by local authorities. He said we were denying his party the right to protect the interests of the local authorities. As I have explained, I think local authorities are able to protect themselves without assistance. We have had long discussions. There has been considerable consultation. These arrangements are satisfactory to both sides.<br/>
The local authorities attached great importance to one point. That was that the percentage grants in respect of these various transactions under the Bill relating to requisitioned houses should be on the same basis as the existing grants and subsidies for normal houses, which is 75 per cent., or three to one. That is the basis we have followed. It seems to me eminently reasonable, and there is a principle which is well-established to justify it. That is why we have adopted this formula.<br/>
The hon. Member for Acton asked me about a point which I would like to clear up. That was, whether purchases of houses after 31st March, 1960, rank for grant. I think it is unlikely that local authorities will wish to purchase houses after that date. I hope that any purchases they have to make will be made before that date because of the difficulty that the houses will be legally released on 1st April. Therefore it would be remiss of them if they left that over until then. But, should they do so, the Bill does, in fact, enable them to claim grants for the purchase of houses made after 1960, provided that those purchases are for the purposes of this Bill.</p>

<p>I beg to move,
<q>That an humble Address be presented to Her Majesty, praying that the Central Land Board Payments Regulations, 1954 (S.I., 1954, No. 1599), dated 1st December, 1954, a copy of which was laid before this House on 6th December, be annulled.</q>
In the short time available for this subject to be considered, I desire to draw attention to certain features of these Regulations&#x2014;and of the other Regulations also mentioned on the Order Paper, relating to the Town and Country Planning (Compensation) Regulations, 1954&#x2014; which we think are open to serious objection. These Regulations deal with applications to the Central Land Board for payment under Part I of the 1954 Act. We, on this side of the House, are opposed to the policy contained in that Act. We have fought that battle and it is over, and now, although we do not approve or like the policy adopted, we are anxious to see it administered fairly, reasonably, and equitably.<br/>
We do not think that these Regulations provide for reasonable and equitable administration. We do not want to see bureaucracy and red tape being allowed &#x2014;in the fashion they are being allowed by these Regulations&#x2014;to create unfairnesses between the parties and to give rise to unnecessary confusion. Of course, to the extent that we on this side approve a greater degree of State intervention in affairs, to that extent we have a special interest to ensure that, wherever possible. the administration is made efficient and sound.<br/>
With these considerations in mind, I would ask the House to glance at the proviso to Regulation 5. It is one of the most shockingly arbitrary things that I have ever read, even in a Statutory Instrument. Here we are dealing with the machinery of applying for payments, the particulars which must be entered on the form, and the particulars additional to those for which the form provides which may be required by the Central Land Board. The proviso reads:
<q>Provided that where the applicant has failed to furnish any particulars or evidence required by the Board under the last preceding


regulation the Board may defer the determination of the application until after such particulars and evidence have been duly furnished, or if they at any time think fit may determine the application notwithstanding such failure, and in so doing may disregard any particulars already supplied by the applicant to which such requirement had reference.</q>
That is bureaucracy gone rampant.<br/>
An applicant may offer in his application certain particulars, the accuracy and correctness of which may not be questioned by the Central Land Board at any time&#x2014;particulars about which the Board may feel the need to make further inquiries but which are not inaccurate in themselves. The Board is invited in certain situations to disregard the particulars which have been submitted even though they may be accurate and correct.<br/>
The point is that if a free vote were taken in the House upon the merits of this proviso, it would be disapproved by an overwhelming majority. The Departments are taking advantage of the exigencies of our Parliamentary system, as they take advantage of everything else, in order to extend their powers. But I am bound to say that it would have been a most shameful thing if this kind of proviso got through without adverse comment from the House.</p>

<p>Surely the hon. Member will bear in mind that there is an appeal allowed to the Lands Tribunal, and if the hon. Gentleman suggests that this procedure is a gross abuse, surely the Lands Tribunal will so decide.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1955-02-15a.339.1" hansard_membership_id="6551" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/16552" speakername="Mr. Irvine" colnum="339" time="">
<p>There may or may not be something in that, but it is highly unsatisfactory to incorporate such a provision in the Regulations. It is not good enough to defend an obvious abuse on the ground that it can be appealed against, or to defend sin on the ground that one can afterwards be penitent.<br/>
The proviso, taken by itself, is, I should have thought, plainly unsatisfactory. The House will observe the arbitrariness of the first sub-paragraph of this Regulation, which enables the Board to consider any particulars supplied and to take such steps
<q>as they may deem requisite for a proper determination of the application, and shall thereafter determine the amount&#x2026;</q>

The Board may take any steps that it may deem requisite for the purpose of making its determination without any kind of safeguard or limit whatsoever. One might expect a proviso following a provision of that kind to be a limiting proviso. Instead, it has the characteristics which I have just pointed out, of extending and underlining the arbitrary powers of the Board in this connection. I feel, therefore, that these Regulations are in this respect thoroughly unsatisfactory.<br/>
I desire to draw attention also to Regulation 6 (3) which deals with a point which received some consideration in the Standing Committee. That Regulation provides that a person
<q>who establishes that he is entitled to an interest in land which is substantially affected by that apportionment</q>
may take the matter to the Lands Tribunal. We were told that what was ambiguous in the Act would be made plain in the Regulations. But the contrary has occurred, and it remains entirely in doubt where a person goes in order to determine whether he has
<q>an interest in land which is substantially affected &#x2026;</q>
He may be a person who has not received a notification from the Central Land Board. He may think that his interest is substantially affected, without any notification or without the matter having been brought to his attention by any civil servant. He may look at the Regulation and see that if he has an interest in land which is substantially affected he has a right of appeal, but he receives not the slightest guidance or indication as to which tribunal he should approach in order that the question whether or not he has an interest which is substantially affected&#x2014;in other words, whether he is eligible to appeal&#x2014;may be determined.<br/>
The Regulation also deals with the method of making the application upon the prescribed form. It insists that the prescribed form and no other shall be used. In my view, it does so entirely arbitrarily. In the other Regulations mentioned on the Order Paper, Statutory Instrument No. 1600, to which I referred at the beginning of my speech, express provision is made that an application must be made upon the prescribed form or "substantially in the form"; that reasonable provision also appears in the Regulations covering appeals to the


Lands Tribunal. Why has the Department taken it upon itself in this Regulation to require the use of the prescribed form and no other?<br/>
I would add a word about the time factor. Bearing in mind the complexities of the matter, the amount of research which has to be done and the difficulties involved in the making of a claim, how ludicrous it is, I suggest, that only four months from the commencement of the Act should be available for completing this process.<br/>
I am afraid that I have occupied a disproportionate amount of the time available for this debate but I have sought to draw attention to what I conceive to be manifold objections to the Regulations because of their arbitrary, bureaucratic and inequitable character. I feel that the liberty of the subject is affected&#x2014;a matter of significance and importance to both sides of the House.</p>

<p>I beg to second the Motion.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Edge Hill (Mr. A. J. Irvine) has drawn attention to important points reflecting on the way in which these Regulations are drawn. They are points of particular importance, because the Regulations strengthen the hands of the bureaucracy in dealing with the rights of citizens. This is the sort of thing which is always apt to happen unless we have a Minister who is completely on top of the job and who deals personally with the Regulations when they are in course of preparation.<br/>
It is no use waiting for the Regulations to come before the House and then putting up a fight in their defence. What is essential in this case is that there should be personal investigation by the political heads of the Department into the form of these Regulations, otherwise this kind of thing is bound to occur.<br/>
The matters to which my hon. Friend drew attention were contained in the proviso to Regulation 5 (1). I must say that this strikes me as rather an odd provision. Where the applicant fails to provide particulars required by the Board, then the Board is at liberty to disregard any particulars which he has already provided. This is not a Regulation for the punishment of citizens. The Board is supposed to be instigating a

<i>bona fide</i> investigation, in accordance with its duties, into the matters before it. Why is it to be at liberty to disregard the particulars which have already been provided? What is the point?<br/>
I have a great respect for the hon. Member for Oldham, East (Sir I. Horobin), who intervened a little while ago. He and I dealt with each other over a period of many weeks in the course of the Committee stage of the Act. But I cannot understand his point about an appeal to the Lands Tribunal. If there is some danger of a gross miscarriage of justice</p>

<p>There is no question of a "grim miscarriage of justice." If the claimant disputes the use made of the machinery he can automatically use the next part of this Regulation. The Lands Tribunal will protect him. This is purely machinery to make a speedy determination.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1955-02-15a.342.1" hansard_membership_id="10381" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/21639" speakername="Sir L. Ungoed-Thomas" colnum="342" time="">
<p>&#x2014;I understood from the hon. Member that that was to be rectified somehow by an appeal to the Tribunal.<br/>
Why should we not have a regulation in the form that there should be no provision at all for discretion to disregard the particulars which have already been given? I understand that there may be some special circumstances in which the particulars already provided may be affected by the information that might be forthcoming in answer to the inquiries which the Board puts to the applicant. I can understand that.<br/>
If there are cases of that kind they should be hedged about and particularised in the Regulations themselves. We should not leave a wide open discretion to the Board itself, in all cases, to disregard any particulars which have been supplied, with no other requirement than simply the applicant's failure to furnish particulars for which the Board has asked. That will not do. It is an arbitrary provision which simply should not be permitted.<br/>
It is very unfortunate that we should have coming before the House Regulations which are already in operation before we can pray against them, which are not subject to amendment, which are dealt with at this late hour and which contain provisions affecting the rights of citizens. It therefore makes it all the more incumbent upon political heads of these


Departments, before any Prayer is placed on the Order Paper against the Regulations, to take care, while they are actually in process of being formed, to see that there are no objectionable provisions in them.<br/>
There is also the other provision to which my hon. Friend the Member for Edge Hill referred. I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will be able to provide a reply which will be rather more reassuring than would appear on the face of the Regulations.</p>

<p>I am sorry that owing to a combination of circumstances the debate which was initiated by the hon. Member for Edge Hill (Mr. A. J. Irvine) has not had as much time for discussion as I quite appreciate should be given to this subject.<br/>
I want to take up what was said by the hon. and learned Member for Leicester, North-East (Sir L. Ungoed-Thomas) about care in the preparation of the Regulations. In my short time at the Ministry two or three sets of Regulations have been brought before the House. These Regulations are not prepared in the manner which the hon. and learned Member seemed to suggest. They are treated with very considerable care.<br/>
I assure him that after the care which was exercised in getting through the House both Acts of Parliament, nothing was left to chance. I am not like the hon. and learned Gentleman, a lawyer, but I assure him that the greatest care has been taken, generally speaking, in the framing of the Regulations. Perhaps I can make a start at least to answer the points which were raised by the hon. Member for Edge Hill.</p>

<p>After the wide-ranging debate today, in which the Parliamentary Secretary has been fully occupied from Question time until 11.30 p.m., I feel almost a sense of contrition in bringing to your notice, Mr. Speaker, and to his notice, yet another matter which impinges on his Ministry. But I do this knowing full well that I am obeying one of the great traditions of Parliament, which is that if any citizen of Her Majesty has a grievance, he can call on his Member to express that grievance in the House of Commons, and initiate a debate on the subject.<br/>
It is with that great tradition in mind that I raise tonight the question of the treatment of Mr. Mark Williamson, of Pitstone, Bucks. Mr. Williamson is a well-respected farmer, a member of a farming family who have lived for generations in that neighbourhood. The village of Pitstone, in which he lives, in my constituency, lies at the foot of the Chiltern Hills, and has immediately around it some of the finest agricultural land in the country.<br/>
This village is in the Wing Rural District Council area, and in the last few years the rural district council has been faced with the problem of catching up with arrears in housing. May I add that I have not been behindhand in pressing them to face up to those grave responsibilities which have been thrust on them, because, in addition to the ordinary shortage of housing, the council had to face in these post-war years a formidable squatter problem, of families invading the old airfields and Army camps and staying in the Army and Air Force huts.<br/>
The Wing Rural District Council has been trying to meet this problem by arranging to build blocks of houses in various villages throughout the rural district council area. I do not wish to make any criticism of the Wing Rural District Council, for it has had


tremendous difficulties, and I should like to think that it is within measurable distance of meeting those difficulties now, after making so much effort in the last few years.<br/>
In the process of carrying out its policy it became evident that in addition to existing demands, the Cement Tunnel Company of Pitstone wanted more houses for its workers. The company might have thought that as it had large areas of land in Pitstone it should provide an area of its own land and perhaps build its own houses. For some reason or other that policy was not followed, and the Wing Rural District Council decided to go ahead with the building of a dozen houses, and for this purpose, in conjunction with the Ministry, investigated several alternative sites.<br/>
From my point of view, I would say that the wrong site was chosen, and I speak now without any reference to Mr. Williamson. I know the village well, and it was not unknown to me in my boyhood days. The 1&#x00BD; acres site that has now been chosen is, first, at the wrong end of the village, that is to say, while the main village lies to the south of the Luton-Dunstable road this new housing estate is to the north of that road. Not only is it at the wrong end of the village, but it is almost a mile from the school, the church, and all the normal activities that go with the village, including, of course, one of the "locals." Children in this new small housing estate will, therefore, have to go nearly a mile to school or church.<br/>
In addition to that the land is first-class agricultural land and capable of becoming really good market gardening land. There is also what can only be described as very definite tendency towards bogginess, and I am quite sure that houses built on this site will not stand as well as houses built where the land is less boggy, that is, on one of the other sites which could have been selected.<br/>
Moreover the land is at least 50 yards from the nearest sewer, and this may add point to my appeal that public opinion in the village, whether voiced by the vicar, parish and other local councillors, or the local representatives of the National Farmers' Union, states that this is not the best site. I am sure the Minister has a map before him, and if he looks at it he will see on it Nos. 3 and 4 sites and,

knowing these various sites I would say that either of these is preferable to the one chosen. Another site, No. 5, which was not seen by the Ministry's inspector when he went down, is probably better still.<br/>
I come now to Mr. Mark Williamson. Although he and his family had been farmers in this neighbourhood for generations, it was only in November, 1953, that he acquired this land. At that time there was no compulsory purchase order on it, and as far as I am aware there was no thought of one. He bought the land hoping to be able to develop it as orchards and for market gardening. Two months later, as it were out of the blue, came this order to dispossess him of 1&#x00BD; acres of the best of that land. I know the Ministry has met him to a small degree by altering the shape of the land that it wants to take, but the point is it is taking 1&#x00BD; acres out of 50 acres, which is severe punishment.<br/>
My point is that the Ministry have not only taken a site unsuitable in several ways but, secondly, they have taken a site the loss of which inflicts undue hardship on the owner. I do not think the Ministry, when investigating this through its inspector, gave full effect to the harm likely to be done to this small farm.<br/>
The sequence of events was this. I have already mentioned that Mr. Williamson bought the land in November, 1953. The first indication he had that a compulsory purchase order was likely to be served was in January, 1954, two months later. It may be said that that was unfortunate for Mr. Williamson. It was distinctly unfortunate. An objection was lodged by him on 20th January, 1954. In April, a public inquiry was held. The objection was overruled and the order was again served, on 6th July, and a Press notice was published on 17th August. There was some delay there which has never been satisfactorily explained.<br/>
I know that it means that Mr. Williamson has got the use of the land, possibly for a year or six months longer than he would have done. But the point is that the Press notice and order should have occurred as near together as possible, and this was not done. Matters have gone on. Mr. Williamson has made every conceivable protest without any effect. He is not a wealthy man, but he


has gone to the expense of consulting solicitors and even counsel, on the point. He is up against that most extraordinary situation which we in this House deplore, that is, when citizens find themselves up against a Ministry which is at once counsel for the prosecution and judge and jury. That is the situation here.<br/>
Mr. Williamson was aggrieved by this decision. I have already said that he asked for a public inquiry. But the public inquiry is conducted by the Ministry whose decision he is opposing, by the Ministry's own officials, and when it comes to the final decision, it is the Ministry of the Crown against which the little man is protesting which is the last court of appeal. And there is left only the traditional right of raising in this House the case of the little man against the Ministry.<br/>
The Minister must have read these documents, of which there have been many. I have a great portfolio of letters dealing with the case. Frankly, I should have raised it long before in the House but for the fact that I was told by the Minister of Agriculture that as it was <i>sub judice</i> nothing could be done. That was in February, 1954. And from many points of view it might still be regarded as <i>sub judice,</i> because the district valuers have not yet come to an agreement, and there is still the question of the final decision of the Lands Tribunal.<br/>
The point I want to make tonight is that when a man who is not a wealthy man is up against a Ministry, then everything is in favour of the Ministry and against the little man. The very men who are sent down to investigate these cases are officials of the Ministry concerned, and I do not like that. I think it is one of the less likeable things about the system under which matters like this are dealt with in this country.<br/>
Therefore I appeal to the Minister, who has shown so much brilliance and pertinacity in the few weeks that he has been in office, not to give me the cut-and-dried answer tonight that this is going through the usual channels. I want my hon. Friend to look into this matter personally, to take it up as he would if he were an independent judge&#x2014;to go into this case root and branch. I ask him to do two things. The first is to quash this compulsory purchase order.

The Minister himself did this with the Bletchley Compulsory Purchase Order that I opposed only a few months ago. Strong as the arguments were that the order should be quashed in the case of Bletchley, there is a stronger case for the quashing of this order on the land of Mr. Mark Williamson in Pitstone.<br/>
Secondly, if because of the law my hon. Friend finds that he is prevented from doing that, then let him see to it that this small farmer, my constituent, gets adequate compensation. One of the greatest grievances of farmers, when land is taken from them by compulsory purchase, is that the compensation paid is a mere pittance compared with what the land would have fetched had it been freely sold as potential building land. The position then is that, in the first place, the man does not get justice when he is up against a great Ministry and, secondly, when the Ministry has exercised its rights and expropriated him, he does not get adequate compensation.<br/>
That is my case regarding Mr. Mark Williamson at Pitstone, a small man up against a tremendous Ministry, with all its ramifications. I ask that justice be done so that this man shall have a fair hearing by an independent tribunal, and not be judged by the same Ministry which has taken his land from him.</p>

<p>Since last midsummer, when this order for the land held by Mr. Mark Williamson was approved by the Minister, my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Buckingham (Sir F. Markham) has shown close interest&#x2014; I might almost say vigilance&#x2014;over this case. I can assure him that I fully appreciate his motives, and I have no quarrel with them. Certainly his constituents will not have, for they will have reason to be grateful to him. I can assure him that my answer will not be a cut-and-dried one because I have read all the available documents on this case and I can now claim to know almost as much about them as my hon. and gallant Friend.<br/>
It is inevitable that a great many orders of this kind are necessary for public housing. I do not accept the strictures on the system made by my


hon. and gallant Friend. The fact is that all these orders receive careful and conscientious scrutiny&#x2014;much more than many people are inclined to believe. However it is not a bad thing that from time to time one of them, such as this, should be hauled up into the light of day and subjected to very searching criticisms to which answers have to be found.<br/>
It is a very good thing. I welcome the opportunity, and I will try to find the answer. It is thirteen months since Wing Rural District Council made a compulsory purchase order on about 1acres of arable land in the parish of Pitstone, on land which was the property of the Williamson Brothers. Both Mr. Mark Williamson and his brother Humphrey, objected to the order, and there was a public hearing on 1st April, 1954. In June the order was confirmed by the then Minister, with a small modification.<br/>
My hon. Friend raised one other small point, which was that in July last year, notice of appeal was given in the High Court on the ground that the order was invalid because the acquiring authority had failed to observe the Statutory Rule of advertising in a newspaper. But this notice of appeal was withdrawn by the owners, and I do not think there is need for me to make any further comment on that.<br/>
After the Minister had confirmed the order, Mr. Williamson felt that a great injustice had been done to him, and both he, and my hon. and gallant Friend, have written to the Minister on more than one occasion. I have no dispute with most of what my hon. and gallant Friend has said, and I should like to enumerate some of the facts. Wing Rural District Council had, when the count was made last June, 260 applicants for housing, and Pitstone has at present 22 on the waiting list. The council made the order with the object of building 12 houses on the site, which is the subject of the dispute, and I should like first to say something about the alternative sites, about which much was said at the inquiry, and which my hon. Friend has mentioned.<br/>
Pitstone is a fairly open village with no definite centre, extending perhaps a mile between Pitstone and Pitstone Green, and rather less between the rail-

way station and Ivinghoe. The council had been in search of a site since October, 1952, and decided on this one only after much deliberation. It had considered four alternatives and what happened to those was as follows; one was ruled out because of the possible future new by-pass; planning authority was refused for housing. Two were turned down on grounds that they were too near the cement works, and on the fourth, which was church land&#x2014;and that has no immediate bearing on this matter &#x2014;'the cost of sewer connection would have been more expensive than 12 houses warranted.<br/>
None, I might add, were put to the test of a compulsory purchase order, and therefore, we do not know if there were any significant objections by owners; but there may have been. All this may be arguable, but I mention it because it does indicate that the council did give great thought to the matter, and it was all gone over when the inspector held his inquiry.<br/>
My hon. Friend then mentioned the distance of this site from the local school which is, in fact, nine-tenths of a mile. It is a highly controversial question nowadays as to how far juniors should be expected to walk to and from school, and I am not entering into that aspect of the matter; but I must say that if nine-tenths of a mile distance from a school ruled out a council estate, then many which have been built would not have been built, and many in course of erection would not have been started. Then there is the statement that the children have to cross the Luton&#x2014;Aylesbury road. But there is another estate on that same road &#x2014;on the same side as this proposed site&#x2014; and I have no evidence of any accidents having occurred.<br/>
A third point&#x2014;it is a difficult one&#x2014;was the question of dust from the cement factory. The site was said to be within the dust belt spread by the Pitstone Cement Works. To some extent the whole village suffers, and some administrative action is being taken to reduce that nuisance. When the inspector saw the site on 1st April, 1954, there was very little trace of dust.<br/>
There is a feeling, which Mr. Williamson expressed in a letter which he wrote to the Minister, that these houses will be used for cement factory workers.


He felt that the cement company should build its own houses on its own land. There are three answers to that. The first is that the company is in fact already building. The second is that there is a need for houses in Pitstone apart from the need of the cement workers. Thirdly, the Council could not have insisted that the cement company should build houses for its own people.<br/>
Now I come to what the hon. and gallant Member said was the most important part of all, which is Mr. Williamson's position, because he is the aggrieved party. He feels a great injustice is being done, and certainly feels, in fact he has suggested it, that the inquiry was biased. That certainly was not the case. I have read the whole proceedings, and the inspector has obviously done his job fairly and with marked objectivity. These inquiries are held in a manner prescribed by law, and everyone is entitled to feel that the provisions are adequate, or otherwise. I will not argue that point. But any suggestion that there has been an avoidable miscarriage of justice must be faced squarely. I can assure my hon. Friend that there has been nothing of the kind.<br/>
Mr. Williamson also has natural feelings about the ground belonging to his family 100 years ago and being bought back in only November, 1953. The answer to that briefly is that the owners were aware of the council's intention before they completed their repurchase.<br/>
My right hon. Friend's predecessor, who had to consider this order, at once noted a point made by Mr. Williamson at the inquiry, namely the difficulty

created for ploughing by the shape of the site covered by the order. As a result of his action&#x2014;and I stress that, because when I say these orders are looked at, I mean that they really are&#x2014;the order was changed to cut off a corner and make the field an easier shape to plough. That answers one point, urged by my hon. and gallant Friend, which is that small affairs of small men are not given sufficient consideration. Another result was that only the poorest part of the land was taken.<br/>
My hon. and gallant Friend will realise that the taking of any site in a small village is always unpopular and always a very difficult business. All kinds of considerations have to be weighed&#x2014;agricultural land, alternatives, hardship, and so on. The result is seldom approved by all, least of all by the owner. I understand that the compensation has not yet been settled, but there is really no reason to suppose it will be unjust. I think that it will be found that the compensation in this case will be competently and sympathetically worked out. I do not want to prejudge it, because it is still under discussion. What we have to decide in this case, as indeed in the case of all orders, is whether the balance is fair and sensible, not whether the decision is popular.<br/>
I hope that what I have said tonight will go some way towards satisfying my hon. and gallant Friend that a good deal of trouble was taken over this matter, and that, on balance, what was done was fair and sensible.</p>
