<p>From July, 1940, when Defence Regulation 38A came into force, to the end of 1943, 4,927 persons, including 1,505 children and young persons had been prosecuted for looting under this Regulation, of whom 3,281, including 1,421 children and young persons, were found guilty. The highest penalties imposed during the years 1942 and 1943 were sentences of seven and five years' penal servitude respectively. I have no information as to the lowest penalties imposed, but I have no doubt that there will have been some cases that were dealt with by fines or by binding over under the Probation of Offenders Act.

<p>There has been no general decision of this character. On the contrary, there are still very large numbers of evacuated staffs in the provinces. Such limited returns as have been sanctioned during the last two or three years have been necessitated either by

<p>These figures represent the deaths of both sexes and at all ages from tuberculosis per 1,000 total population up to September, 1939, and per 1,000 of the civilian population after that date. They do not indicate the trend of tuberculosis mortality in London because, (1) great changes have occurred since 1939 in the sex and age proportions of London's population and (2) medical selection for the Services leaves behind the bulk of tuberculosis persons in the civilian population. Death-rates for separate sex-age groups, which alone can indicate the real trend of mortality, cannot be calculated for local areas for years since 1939 because the requisite populations are not known in detail of sex and age.</p>

<p>Treatment for taxation purposes would depend upon the facts of the particular case and it rests with the assessing authorities and the Commissioners on appeal if necessary to determine the liability by reference to these facts.

<p>His Majesty's Government have frequently emphasised their wish to see the establishment of a Greek Government which would be fully representative of all patriotic opinion in Greece. In May last an agreement was reached at a Conference of Greek Delegates in the Lebanon, which was subscribed to by the duly authorised representatives of all the principal Greek political parties, including E.A.M. and the other Left Wing parties. The Lebanon Agreement held out every promise that such a Government would be formed and M. Papandreou has since made every effort to put the Lebanon Agreement into effect. In this task he has received and will continue to receive the full support of His Majesty's Government.<br/>
The leaders of E.A.M. in Greece have, however, declined to ratify the signatures of their representatives at the Lebanon Conference or to appoint Ministers to the posts in the Government which it was agreed should be reserved for them. Instead they have put forward fresh and unreasonable demands, the effect of which would be to give them control over all the guerilla forces in Greece and over the Greek Army abroad and a representation in the Greek Government out of all proportion to their actual strength. His Majesty's Government do not consider that at the present time any Greek political party which has the interests of Greece sincerely at heart can justify a refusal to join a National Government or to make conditions of the nature put forward by E.A.M.<br/>
Moreover, information received leaves His Majesty's Government in no doubt that an overwhelming majority of the Greek people welcomed the Lebanon Agreement and support M. Papandreou in his efforts to form a democratic and representative Government. His Majesty's Government are also satisfied that a large proportion of the members of E.A.M. are opposed to the obstructive and intransigent


attitude adopted by certain of their leaders. His Majesty's Government still hope that, even at this late hour, E.A.M. will join the Greek Government on the basis of the Lebanon Agreement and thus give effect to the desire for unity which they have so often proclaimed. If they persist in their refusal to do so, they must be held responsible for the failure to achieve unity of Greek policy and arms at this, the supreme moment of the common struggle.<br/>
I wish to add a few words about the courts-martial now being held in Egypt to try those concerned in the Greek mutinies of last April. It has been suggested that these courts-martial form a serious bar to unity. It was, however, agreed at the Lebanon Conference by the representatives of all parties that courts-martial should be set up and the Greek Government were therefore under an obligation to do so. The trials are still in progress and, although a number of death sentences have been passed, none have been executed. No final decision can be reached until all the trials have been completed, but His Majesty's Government have advised the Greek Government that in their view the achievement of Greek unity should be the paramount consideration. I am confident that the Greek Government share this view, for M. Papandreou himself has made every possible effort to achieve unity and this continues to be the basis of his policy.</p>

<p>The Government have decided to submit to the House without any delay a Bill of Indemnity. I do not

propose at this moment to discuss the legal position, but after consulting my right hon. and learned Friend the Attorney-General, I am clear that on general and constitutional grounds the course which I have stated is the proper one. It is in my view right that Parliament should be given a proper opportunity of dealing with the matter on a Parliamentary Bill.</p>

<p>Yes, Sir.<br/>
Tuesday, 1st August&#x2014;We shall, as a result of the statement which my right hon. Friend has just made and as a matter of urgency, ask the House to agree to pass


a Bill of Indemnity relating to the Fire Service Regulations, through all its stages, so that it may be sent to another place and receive the Royal Assent before the Adjournment. The House will understand that the Government desire to deal with this matter urgently and as rapidly as possible.<br/>
Afterwards, we shall take the Second Reading of the Housing (Temporary Accommodation) Bill and the Committee stage of the necessary Money Resolution, as well as the Motion to approve the Electoral Registration Regulations, which we are anxious to proceed with also.<br/>
Wednesday, 2nd August&#x2014;Committee and Third Reading of the Consolidated Fund Bill when, as I have already announced, the Prime Minister will make a statement on the war situation, upon which a Debate will arise.<br/>
Thursday, 3rd August&#x2014;The House will adjourn for the Summer Recess. I ought to add that to-morrow we shall ask the House to take the Motion for an Address relating to the Pensions (Increase) Act (Extension) Order.</p>

<p>Is the right hon. Gentleman aware that this first Bill of the Home Secretary's may take up a considerable length of time, and that even with an extension of an hour or two the other matter, which is no less important&#x2014;it is terribly important&#x2014;cannot be dealt with properly? A question affecting the housing of the people ought not to be taken at a time when it cannot properly be dealt with, and I would ask the right hon. Gentleman, before he decides to proceed or not to proceed with the Housing Bill, to see how far the Home Secretary's Bill progresses. It would not be fair to have an extension if the Home Secretary's Bill occupied until a late hour. Before the right hon. Gentleman commits himself about going on with this Housing Bill on Tuesday, will he see how Tuesday's Business proceeds?</p>

<p>I am, of course, conscious of the importance of the Housing Bill. One cannot pronounce now, but I did have some hopes that my right hon. Friend's Bill would not take a long time. We shall see how we proceed. I do not want to ask the House for anything unreasonable, but at the same time I would like to get both items of Business disposed of if I can.</p>

<p>I would ask the right hon. Gentleman not to take the Housing Bill at a late hour. It is not fair to start a discussion on one of the most important Bills before the House late in the day. Do not treat housing as a very second-rate issue compared with other matters.</p>

<p>Reverting to the question raised by the hon.

I should like to have the Government's view on that. I am asking that in view of the fact that yesterday it was stated that this House had indicated that they did not want to have any such open Debate. I have been very careful to go through all the reports, and I find that the House made no such decision. On the contrary they said that there should not be a Secret Debate on the flying bomb.</p>

<p>I want to ask your Ruling, Mr. Speaker, on a point of procedure. I understand, having looked at the rules and regulations of this House, that one is unable to repeat a Debate in the same Session.

<p>I beg to move, "That this House doth disagree with the Lords in the said Amendment."<br/>
I have put a Motion to this effect on the Order Paper, and I think it behoves me to give one or two arguments in support of it. Naturally the Government have considered very carefully the issue raised in this Amendment. The Amendment requires that the Minister of Education shall make appointments to his Advisory Councils after consultation with two of his colleagues in the Government. The first difficulty in the way of accepting this Amendment, on which the Government view was clearly stated in another place, is that if I were to pick out two

of my colleagues for the purpose of consultation many of my other colleagues who are very much interested in education might feel aggrieved that I had not also taken them into consultation. The Minister of Labour and the Minister of Home Security are very closely concerned with the children and young people of this country, and there are several matters upon which they have very strong views, and I should not like to think that any of my colleagues should feel that a slur had been cast on them if they were not consulted. The matter is made even more complicated by the fact that the Minister of Agriculture and I have set up a special committee to deal with agricultural education. Therefore it seems otiose that I should be obliged to consult my colleagues before setting up Advisory Councils. In fact, without saying too much, this doctrine of setting down in a Bill that I should consult two of my colleagues is not, in the Government's opinion, the proper view to take of Government responsibility as a whole.<br/>
I should, however, say to hon. Members and other persons outside who are interested in this subject that the Motion to disagree with the Lords in this Amendment does not mean that the Government are not very much interested in technical education. The object of the mover of the Amendment in another place was to ensure that the Councils had upon them people interested in the technical aspect of education. It is the intention of the Government to put upon these Councils persons interested in technical matters and to consult such bodies or persons as are interested in order that technical education may be given every support. I go further by saying that this Bill will not operate properly unless we stress the importance of technical education. It is only if we can get our industries going properly&#x2014;our export trade and everything else&#x2014;that we shall be able to find the funds to finance these Measures, and without technical education we should be nowhere. I therefore repeat what I said during the Committee stage and have said on other occasions, that it is our desire that technical education should be given every possible opportunity to develop under this Bill, and that I shall consult persons in the country and take all possible care to ensure that these Advisory Councils are properly constituted.

<p>I beg to move, "That this House doth agree with the Lords in the said Amendment."<br/>
It has been felt by the Government that the introduction of this word "spiritual" is the best method to adopt of meeting those who feel that the definition in Clause 7 does not include a reference to the various portions of the Bill which deal with religious education. "Spiritual" is the most satisfactory word, and the word which has received the most general support.</p>

<p>I hope that this House will not agree with the Lords on this matter. The word "spiritual" is either quite innocuous and meaningless or it has a definite meaning. If it is innocuous there is no need to insert it, and if it has a meaning at all it is a meaning that a large part of the community would object to see expressed in an Act of Parliament. We have heard a lot of talk about the balance which the President of the Board of Education has managed to achieve among the different sections of the community, and to insert the word "spiritual," the most numinous word one could possibly find, into an Act of Parliament will entirely upset any understanding dependent on that balance. I would explain what I mean by that.<br/>
There are large sections of the religious community in this country who believe that the schools should teach the people religion. They are generally either Catholics or Anglicans. We have made provision for them; they have their own voluntary schools and we have met them very generously in this matter and have provided means by which they can follow the dictates of their own conscience. But there is also a very large section of the religious population of the country, Non-conformists and people not attached to any Church, who object to the very idea that the State, and especially the local education authorities, should be put in charge of the spiritual teaching of the country. I hope that what I regard as an

injustice, and even an impertinence, to these people will not be allowed, and I think we should disagree with the Lords in this matter. Before I sit down I should like to say that there is a popular <i>clich&#x00E9;</i> of thought going round among the very same people who at the end of the last war were all for licence and irreligion. Now they are all hot and bothered about religion. They are no more religious now than they were then.</p>

<p>I should like to say a word or two on this Amendment. The President has sent out some notes on this matter and I have tried to study them and to find out what is the difference between "auxiliary" and "voluntary." I also came across the word "pejorative." I did not know the meaning of it and so I consulted a dictionary. I am satisfied that the change proposed will be helpful, and though I have no feeling for the Lords at all, and think the House of Lords ought to be non-existent, as a little sop to them I shall take no objection to this Amendment which they have proposed.</p>

<p>I am sorry that the President has not given us a little more light on this matter, because during the discussion in another place the Minister in charge of the Bill there, when first this Amendment was moved to substitute another word for the word in the Bill, said the word "auxiliary" had been before the country far many months, that no objection had been taken to it and that there was no reason for making the change. It was obvious that there was a considerable difference of opinion over the word that should be substituted for it. The phrase "non-county" school was suggested, and also the word "managerial" and the word "founded." I think there is objection to the word "founded" in that it might be said there is good reason to think that in certain cases where there are groups of schools of the same foundation they might be called "confounded" schools. We must agree that we want no names for these schools that would cast any slur upon them, no name which should not be honourable; I am not sure, however, that the word "voluntary" is the most suitable word, because although in 1870 when that word was, I believe, first used in an Act of Parliament, it did express the nature of a great number of the schools then in existence, the schools now are less voluntary in a financial sense than they were in 1870. Their character has altered to that extent. We want to secure the utmost good will towards their

progress and development, but I think it is a pity that a word should be chosen to designate them which is felt by many to be untruthful. I am sorry, therefore, that the President should not have taken the view which his representative in another place took when the word "auxiliary" was first called into question. It would be interesting to hear why the Government have altered their mind.</p>

<p>Before I actually move that we agree with this Amendment, I should like your permission, Mr. Speaker, to suggest a small manuscript Amendment, as I understand it is necessary to give notice of any Amendment now before moving "That this House doth agree with the Lords in the said Amendment." I have the Amendment with me here, and I suggest that we should, in Clause 9, page 6, line 35&#x2014;in the new Clause, line 13&#x2014;after the word "school," insert the word "premises." My reason, Mr. Speaker, for suggesting the insertion of the word "premises" after the word "school" in the proviso in line 13 of the new Clause will become apparent in a moment.<br/>
This new Clause is to take the place of Sub-section (7) of the old Clause 9. It deals with the question of the building Regulations and is described as requirements as to school premises. We found that the old Sub-section (7) was too narrow as it stood. It required all maintained schools, existing as well as future, to conform to some absolutely rigid standards. On examining the Bill in another place we found we were in the position where there was a school which had a hall which was perfectly suitable, though it was two or three feet short of the standards laid down in the regulation. We, therefore, felt it necessary to have some more elasticity in the Clause. Otherwise we might have been landed into making alterations unnecessarily to a perfectly good school. We have suggested, therefore, that the Clause be redrafted in this manner, but I should like to give an assurance that there is nothing in this Clause which indicates that the Government propose to lower their building standards whatsoever. We have simply included the proviso for the purpose of making it possible for the Minister to make an exception when there are special circumstances.<br/>
The reason for my suggesting the small manuscript Amendment, which I have had to put in early before listening to the Debate, under our Rules of Order, is that, on considering the proviso carefully, it seemed to me that the words "or to other special circumstances affecting the school" in the proviso might lead hon. Members to think that there might be imported into the Minister's consideration of the matter some question as to the

character of the school, whether it was a voluntary school or a county school, or same question quite apart from those of school premises. If we insert the word "premises" after the word "school," that limits very much the discretion of the Minister and makes him apply his mind solely to circumstances affecting the premises. Other circumstances could not be taken into consideration. Thus by these Amendments we should be able to insist on definite building standards while at the same time securing the necessary elasticity.</p>

<p>I do not think anybody in the House will object to our giving to the Minister power to modify the stringency of the Regulations, given a proper case, nor will the House object to the Minister having power to make an addition to the building Regulations for different kinds of schools. I imagine that the Regulations for primary schools will be different from those for secondary schools, but I would like an assurance that the addition to this Clause does not enable the Minister, or any of his successors, to make special Regulations for aided schools as compared with controlled schools or council schools. In other words, we do not want to find ourselves in a position of accepting, with regard to same types of schools, a lower standard than for other types. If there is no danger of that kind of thing, then I welcome the addition.</p>

<p>I support the addition proposed by my right hon. Friend, but I would like to point out that the education authorities connected with the municipal corporations were rather afraid that the words "or to other special circumstances affecting the school" might give the Minister power to give directions on grounds of financial resources, and the Minister, having regard to the financial resources, might make a direction that the building need not comply with the building standards. I understand that appears to be a very general interpretation of the Minis-


ter's intention with regard to the manuscript Amendment, so that if he can give us an assurance on this point I think it would be a great comfort to the local education authorities.</p>

<p>The House will find, by reference to the original Sub-section (7) which we are deleting, that it was very narrowly drawn and might, on a strict interpretation, have involved us in applying the same standard of requirements to secondary schools as to nursery schools. Quite obviously that would have been absurd, and it is desirable that we should have power to prescribe appropriate Regulations for secondary, primary, infant and nursery schools, and that is what we understand by the phrase "description of school." It does not refer to the denominational or undenominational character of the school, and I hope that explanation meets the points raised by my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Carmarthen (Mr. M. Hughes). I think by inserting the word "premises" we have made it clear that the special circumstances are to have relation to an existing building. There are many existing schools that are of quite a high standard for the present time, but which might just fail to conform with the new Regulations, and it would really be absurd if we were, for instance, to insist on some elaborate and expensive reconstruction taking place in a school hall that was some 10 or 12 square feet short of the actual requirements. We should probably ruin the architecture of the hall and we might involve ourselves in a great many difficulties. The word has been inserted to ensure that it shall be the special circumstances of the school premises and not of the school managers or governors that will be the determining factor when we have to deal with the matter. I am pleased to give my hon. Friend the Member for Faversham (Sir A. Maitland) and my hon. Friend for the Moseley Division of Birmingham (Sir P. Hannon) the assurances they asked for.

<p>I beg to move, "That this House doth agree with the Lords in the said Amendment."<br/>
There is a consequential Amendment to which I shall refer later. Clause 12, as it left the Commons, did not make it clear that there are two distinct stages in the establishment of the school, and the effect of this Amendment, which defines the procedure more clearly than the original Clause 12, is that Sub-sections (1) to (5) relate to the first stage and Subsections (6) to (8) to the second stage. The first stage is the publication of


notices of the essential particulars of the proposed school, such as its location, its denominational or educational character, and so forth. It is at this stage of publication that objections by interested persons can be made. The second stage arises when the Minister has approved the proposal, with or without modification, and at that stage plans and specifications of the school are submitted to the Minister by the promoters. Our object, therefore, in submitting this redraft is to make those two stages clearer and, in fact, to clarify the position and make the Bill a better Bill.<br/>
Under the new Sub-section (7), which is a long one, when the proposals or specifications and plans are approved it becomes the duty of the authorities to give effect to the proposals. In the case of voluntary schools the plans will normally include particulars of the playing fields, and rooms for medical treatment and the provision of meals and milk. The intention of the Bill, as shown in the Clauses which the House considered before, Clause 51 (1), Clause 46 (5) and Clause 47, is that the playing fields and rooms provided solely for medical inspection and treatment and school meals should be provided by the local education authority.

<p>I hope the House will not agree to this Amendment. As I read it, the net effect of the new Sub-section (7) will be this. It will be possible for persons who seek to set up an aided school to submit their plans for the approval of the Minister. These will consist, on the one side, of nothing but a collection of class-rooms and, on the other, of another building containing a large hall which will be labelled "For playing purposes," some rooms upstairs which will be labelled "For purposes of medical inspection," the usual adjuncts for playing field purposes, dressing rooms and so forth and, in fact, a far bigger and more imposing building than the actual collection of classrooms. For the collection of classrooms, the denomination will have to provide 50 per cent. of the capital costs; but, if this provision is accepted, the whole cost of the playing fields and of the far more important building will be borne entirely by public funds.<br/>
The Minister has argued that the intention to provide this additional bonus to the denominational schools was manifest in the Bill as it left this House. I have looked at those provisions again. I have well in mind what transpired during the passage of the Bill through this House. If it was the intention, it certainly does not seem to come to light in the provisions of the Bill as they are studied, it does not come to light in any of the provisions referred to by my right hon. Friend, and it certainly was not mentioned during the passage of the Bill through this House. It is true that the Bill contains provision whereby, when the local authority directs the special provision of facilities for meals or for other purposes, the local authority has to pay. That is the position when something additional has to be provided to an existing building.<br/>
The House accepted that principle, but it never accepted the principle that, when approving plans for a new school, in which provision is to be made for meals or for doctors' visits, a proportion should be borne out of local funds. If it had been, we should have heard from that Box during the Committee stage, time and again, in emphasis of the generosity with which the denominations were to be treated, that it was not 50 per cent. that they were being asked to pay, as the plans would include these dining rooms and other extra rooms for which they would have to pay nothing. The Minister would have said, "No denomination will ever have to pay 50 per cent., because these facilities are to be paid for out of public funds." Never, during the discussions on the Bill or on the White Paper, was any suggestion made that the assistance to the denominations would exceed 50 per cent. This is not a provision to carry out, as the Minister said, the intention of this House. It is another side method of providing more than 50 per cent. We have gone far enough. Those of us who do not believe in denominational schools accepted the basic principle of the White Paper, the 50 per cent. During the passage of the Bill through this House we went further, and accepted the principle of easy money, at low rates of interest, to enable the denominations to build schools. We never accepted the principle that a large proportion of the buildings necessary for these services should be paid for by


public funds. I hope that this House will reject this Amendment from their Lordships' House.</p>

<p>I find it difficult to understand why my hon. and learned Friend has worked himself into such a passion over this matter. He seemed to be worried because this Amendment had come upon him as a surprise, but he did not appear to argue that we should reject the Amendment on the good ground that it is undesirable. I cannot find anything denominational in dining rooms or playing fields, or rooms where doctors examine the children. What I am concerned with is that these facilities should be as good as possible; and if this Amendment will make them better, I welcome it, as I think, on public grounds, we all would.<br/>

<p>With respect, I suggest that my right hon. Friend should elucidate this Amendment a little further. Does it mean that if only part of a school is exclusively used for the purposes mentioned that is excluded? Secondly, what is the effect of the provision that the building or part of the building must be used only for that purpose? Suppose, as happens in many schools nowadays, the central hall of the school is used at midday as a dining room. Does that mean that that central hall can attract full Government grant, or that the interpretation will be that that is its main purpose or object? On those two matters the House would be grateful for some elucidation.</p>

<p>The words of the Amendment are:
<q>required only for affording facilities &#x2026;</q>
Therefore, if the hall is used both as an assembly hall&#x2014;what my hon. and learned


Friend called a central hall&#x2014;and as a dining room, the local education authority are not responsible for providing it. The school, under the building regulations, will have to have an assembly hall, but if, in addition to an assembly hall, there is, as it is sometimes felt advisable that there should be, a separate dining hall, and a room is provided which is required only for dining purposes, that is part of the local education authority's responsibility, and they will have to provide it. It is only those parts of the building which are required only for these purposes, which become the liability of the local education authority. I should have thought, in view of the way in which education is administered in the country, that is the reasonable line of division.<br/>
Let us take an area where the local education authority provide medical inspection and treatment at clinics away from the schools, where all the children from the various schools go to the clinics. Would it not be absurd that the managers of the voluntary school, in such circumstances, should not be relieved of the responsibility of financing medical inspection? Where the local education authority prefer what I regard as the better way, having the medical inspection on the school premises, they must be responsible for making the provision. I should have thought that the fairest thing is to say that school meals, medical inspection, and things of that description, should be the responsibility of the local education authority where the building or part of the building, provided is required only for that purpose. That is the effect of the Amendment. It was always inherent in the Bill, in the words of Clause 46 (5), which says, in dealing with medical inspection and treatment, that
<q>the managers or governors of any auxiliary school"&#x2014;</q>
now "voluntary school"&#x2014;
<q> &#x2026; shall not be required by any such direction to incur expenditure.</q>
It would, I suggest, have been quite absurd to relieve the managers or governors of existing schools of such liability, and to impose it on managers or governors of schools which will be in course of erection in future. What we have done only carries out the obvious intention of those two Clauses, and places it beyond doubt.</p>

<p>I beg to move, "That this House doth agree with the Lords in the said Amendment."<br/>
I think it would be convenient if we could consider this and other Lords Amendments, to line 2 in page 14, as they are all consequential upon this. This is purely a technical Amendment. When the Clause left this House, it would have been possible for the Minister to authorise the replacement of an existing school by one new school but not by more than one. But there may well be cases where an existing school should be replaced by more than one school and to enable that to be done is the object of these Amendments. It might create alarm in the minds of some Members, because they might imagine that it would lead to the creation of a whole series of new schools providing much more accommodation than the existing one.<br/>
That possibility is, however, safeguarded in the Clause as re-drafted, with these Amendments in it, by the fact that the Minister has to determine that the new school or schools are in substitution for the old one. In fact, if hon. Members will apply their minds to the matter, they will see that it is no more alarming for the Minister to satisfy himself where there are two schools in substitution for one than if he had one school with more pupils than in the old one. The fact that there are two schools, instead of one, is merely put in for convenience, and not with the idea of increasing the ambit of the clause by giving the Minister new and unheard-of powers.</p>

<p>May I ask two questions on that point? Supposing you had a migration of population, with the re-housing of an area, say from Poplar to


Dagenham. Suppose that originally it was proposed to have one new school in Dagenham in place of one in Poplar, but, as part of the re-housing proposals, the population being rather more scattered it was felt desirable to have two, or even three, new schools in place of the one previously existing. Would that mean that the same number of pupils would be covered and that they might be rather small schools? Suppose the denomination concerned decided to take advantage of the opportunity to build a larger school, more than the numbers would justify? In that case, if they felt that this would attract into this school other population round about, who were not transferred, would it be the case that for any building providing for more than the number of pupils originally covered, the denomination would have to put up its share of the extra funds, and the Minister would only consider the number of pupils transferred, as being genuinely transferred for this purpose? I would like an assurance on that point.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend's suggestion is the correct one. The substituted school will be for the same number of pupils as the existing school. If a school is divided&#x2014;and, with some of the big barrack schools we have known in the past, there might well be a division&#x2014;there will be a total number of pupils, and there will have to be some method by which they can be identified. If they cannot be identified, the question of substitution does not arise. It will not be possible, in this, to secure the financing of three schools equal to the size of the original school. It may well be that the original school may be split up between two or three new schools, and I think that that might be a great advantage.</p>

<p>I beg to move, "That this House doth agree with the Lords in the said Amendment."<br/>
I think it would be convenient if we could, at the same time, consider the following Lords Amendments:<br/>
In line 47, leave out "on Sundays and."<br/>
In page 18, line 5, at end, insert:
<q>and the foundation managers or foundation governors shall be entitled to determine the use to which the school premises or any part thereof shall be put on Sundays, but save as aforesaid the local education authority may give such directions as to the occupation and use of the school premises of a controlled school as they think fit.</q>
In line 10, leave out "require" and insert "direct."<br/>
In line 15, leave out "required" and insert "directed."<br/>
In line 16, at end, insert:
<q>(3) Subject to any directions given by a local education authority under the foregoing provisions of this section and to the requirements of any enactment other than this Act or the regulations made thereunder, the occupation and use of the school premises of any voluntary school shall be under the control of the managers or governors thereof.</q>
In line 34, leave out "auxiliary" and insert "voluntary."<br/>
All the Amendments affect Clause 21, which deals with the powers of the local education authority and the use and care of the premises of auxiliary schools. If I could summarise the effect of these Amendments in one short statement, it would indicate how the new Clause 21 differs from the old Clause. The Amendments do not affect the position of aided and special agreement schools, which are referred to in the Clause in the terms of the original Clause 10. They affect only controlled schools.<br/>
What do these Amendments do? The foundation managers or governors are given the right to determine the use of the premises of controlled schools on Sundays. In the first place the foundation managers or governors are closely concerned with the use of the premises on Sundays, and it was thought that they should have a right to determine that use. Secondly, the whole body of managers or governors are given the right to determine the use of the premises on Saturdays when not required by the local education authority for youth welfare purposes. Thirdly, the whole body of managers or


governors are given the right to determine the use of the premises from Monday to Friday, subject to any direction as to their use which the local authority may think fit to give. Really, all that this Amendment does is that, instead of the managers or governors feeling that, at any moment, the local authority might reserve the right to use their school, leaving them in uncertainty, the managers or governors now have the certainty that they have the right to use the school when they have no direction from the authority. While leaving the balance the same as before, this introduces more certainty into the picture between Monday and Friday, because the managers or governors of a controlled school can feel that they have certainty that the local authority will give them directions when they want the premises. These Amendments are improvements, and indicate, I think, that we have made the Clause better than it was before.</p>

<p>Will the Minister say what is in his mind about the period of time during which the direction is to be given? What notice will the local authority have to give to the managers of the school that they require the school for their own purposes? They might say, "Well, we ought to have at least seven days' notice from the local education authority," but the latter might easily think that 48 hours, or even 24 hours, would be sufficient notice. There does not appear to me to be anything in the Clause to indicate the time, and there might easily be dispute between the parties as to the period of time in which notice should be given, regarding the requirements of the local authority in respect of these buildings.</p>

<p>With the broad lines of what is suggested, the House will be in complete agreement, but the Amendment in regard to Sunday requires closer examination. We are dealing here with the controlled school. It is not an aided school, but a controlled school, and that means that the managers or governors will consist, as to one-third, of the denomination representatives, and, as to two-thirds, of those representing the local education authority. It is right and proper that a denomination which founded the school should have the first claim on the premises of the school on a Sunday. There will be many of these controlled

schools, however, which will never be used on Sunday at all, and many more where, judging from one's experience, the use that will be made of them on Sundays will only be for the holding of a Sunday school. It often happens that other denominations may want facilities on a Sunday&#x2014;educational, perhaps. I have known cases in Wales where, while the chapel was being rebuilt, the services were held in the schools, and, generally, there was no difficulty where it was a county school. Now, if the new school in an area is a controlled school, financed, managed and run by the public under the protection of a trust, the two foundation managers can deny the use of that school to anybody else, though they are not using it for any purpose themselves. Is it not possible for us to have some assurance that the powers now being placed by this Amendment in the hands of foundation managers or governors shall not be abused?</p>

<p>With regard to the point raised by the hon. Member for West Walthamstow (Mr. McEntee), I think that, in the first place, difficulties are not likely to arise, because the directions will generally be that the authority wants the school for an evening institute, and the terms during which these institutes run are well-known, but, if the demand is unreasonable, or the length of notice given is unreasonable, the managers have the right of appeal to the Minister against the direction or requirement of the local education authority under Clause D set out on page II of the Paper we are considering to-day, so there will be ample protection against unreasonable decisions. Concerning the point raised by the hon. and learned Member for Carmarthen (Mr. Hughes), let us realise that other denominations than that responsible for the foundation of the school have hitherto had no claim on these schools during any period of the week, and if, therefore, in some Welsh village, while the chapel is being repaired, the managers of a voluntary school have allowed the school to be used for church services, it has been as an act of grace and denominational good feeling in which, I am quite sure, we should rejoice.<br/>
I recollect once going to Wales and seeing a church school being conducted in a Nonconformist chapel because the building had become unusable, and a


Roman Catholic school had been grafted on to it during the evacuation. That seemed to me to be getting as near as possible to what we would desire. Here, and not merely with regard to the use by the Nonconformist denomination of the church school, but with regard to the use of the building for educational purposes on Sunday, if consent is unreasonably withheld, any person who is aggrieved has, under the new Clause D, the right of appeal to the Minister, because he will allege that the power conferred by the Bill is being exercised unreasonably. That is a position that has not existed in the past and it does very considerably protect the position of other people in the village against managers who might try to exclude them from what is very often the only building available for social purposes in the village or hamlet. The new Amendment, coupled with the new Clause D on the Paper, amply safeguards the position mentioned both by my hon. Friend the Member for West Waltham-stow (Mr. McEntee) and my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Carmarthen (Mr. M. Hughes).</p>

<p>I beg to move, as an Amendment to the Lords Amend-


ment, in Sub-section (2) of the proposed new Clause, to leave out:
<q>upon the recommendation of any conference convened in accordance with the provisions of the said Schedule.</q>
For the convenience of the House I should remind them that I shall ask them shortly to agree with the Lords in the said Amendment but I must draw attention to certain Government Amendments to this Clause which are on the Order Paper.<br/>
In Sub-section {2) of the proposed new Clause we wish to leave out the words which I have just indicated; and in Subsection {3) of the proposed new Clause, we propose to leave out from the first "authority" to the end of the Sub-section and to put in a new Sub-section (4), which is on the Order Paper, and which says:
<q>A local education authority shall have regard to any unanimous recommendations which may be made to them by any conference convened in accordance with the provisions of the said Seventh Schedule with respect to the expediency of constituting such an advisory council as aforesaid or with respect to the method by which or the terms and conditions upon which members of any such Council should be appointed.</q>
We shall then consider the Lords Amendment, as amended in the sense suggested by the Government.<br/>
First I will tell the House the reason for amendment. It was thought better to hang the reference to the Seventh Schedule in the Bill we are considering, which deals with the method of establishing and drawing up an agreed syllabus, solely on a definition. We have therefore to hang that Schedule on a proper Clause of its own and we have brought in the question of the standing advisory committee. Those who are familiar with local government know that a local authority has, under existing local government law, the power to set up such an advisory committee if it desires. The object of our Amendments is to say, as we have done in the new Sub-section (4) which I have read, that the local education authority shall have regard to any unanimous recommendations which may be made to them by any conference. The conference referred to in the Amendment is the one to which more detailed reference is made in the Seventh Schedule.<br/>
The value of the Amendments which the Government are making is that they

draw the attention of the local education authority to the need for having regard to any unanimous recommendation which the conference might make. The value of that is obvious to the House, namely, that the matter shall proceed upon agreement with the interested parties and to which the local authority shall have regard. Under the old Bill, when it left this House it might have been thought that the conference would disappear, but the value of this Amendment, as amended by the Government, is not only that it is possible to set up an advisory council under the Bill, quite apart from what the local authority might have done under its own powers, but also that the local authority have to pay attention to a unanimous recommendation of the conference. In the circumstances, I think that the Amendment made in another place and the Amendments suggested to it now by the Government are improvements upon the original Bill.</p>

<p>Will the Minister say why he is so insistent on the word "unanimous" in the conferences? Frequently, in conferences of any kind, you get someone who will not allow a unanimous decision on anything. I have attended so many conferences that I rather sense the possibility of such an individual getting into this conference and preventing a very good decision being taken because he is of the type of mind that would never allow a unanimous decision to take place upon anything.</p>

<p>Unanimity in this particular case means unanimity between the four distinct groups of people. The conference is composed of persons representing the education authority, teachers, the Church of England, and other religious denominations. There might not be unanimity on the part of everyone, but that does not prejudice an agreed issue being reached. If one of the panels by a majority dissents from the other three, then agreement is not readied. Agreed syllabuses are being drawn up all over the country on that basis. The procedure is very well known and one cantankerous individual is not able to upset the proceedings. But if one of the panels&#x2014;I use that word for want of a better&#x2014;dissents, then the position is not unanimous. That is the basis upon which this has always been drawn up, and the insistence on the word


"unanimous" is to ensure that anything that is called "agreed" is in fact agreed to by the four parties.</p>

<p>I beg to draw attention to the words in the last line but one on page 6:" Methods of teaching." It is proposed here that this council should advise teachers upon methods of teaching. I think this must surely be a new departure altogether in education. I do not suppose it was meant that methods of teaching in the usual sense should be considered, for they cannot be within the purview of a lay body of this sort. Now that teachers are to be trained for this particular purpose, and universities, etc., are setting up departments for training in religious teaching, surely they would not wish a lay body to advise them on methods of teaching? Perhaps the Minister will say something about that?</p>

<p>I can only speak again with the permission of the House. If that is given me, I would only say that I have had the opportunity of discussing this with the teachers' representatives and I do not think they entertain the doubts of the hon. Gentleman. I think he can set his mind at rest, that it does not entail

any interference with the general attitude adopted either by the Board or the local authorities, towards their teachers. That is certainly not the case. This is purely an Advisory Council, and the words "methods of teaching" are very broad. Even we at the Board issue what have been described as "suggestions," and we do not dare to go any further than that. I do not suppose the Advisory Council will wish to be "more Royalist than the King," and I anticipate that the Advisory Councils will simply give advice and that teachers will be only too glad to cooperate with such councils if the advice is given in the right way. If they gave advice in the wrong way, teachers would be the first to feel that the councils were not fulfilling a useful function. I hope I have assured my hon. Friend that the words "methods of teaching" do not mean to introduce any departure from the general principle adopted by the Board or local authorities.</p>

<p>I beg to move, "That this House doth agree with the Lords in the said Amendment."<br/>
I think it would be convenient if I were to deal at the same time with the following one&#x2014;in line 41 to leave out from the second "school" to "or" in line 42. They deal with the proviso as it originally stood to Clause 28 which was thought


to be unsatisfactory, and was, in fact, capable of certain misinterpretations, one of which was that it would have been possible to say under it that teachers in aided schools, and reserved teachers in controlled and special agreement schools, should receive less emoluments or be disqualified from promotion because they actually went to church. The Government thought it was wiser to amend the proviso, and we have therefore done so in the way indicated. The Amendments get rid of this, and similar misinterpretations of the Clause. They give certain protection to reserved teachers and teachers in aided schools, namely, against receiving any less emoluments or being disqualified from promotion, but they leave it open to such teachers to be appointed upon the basis of their religious beliefs, which is continuing the present practice in such schools, and to have required religious instruction. Therefore, by this redrafting, which is rather longer than the old draft, we make the position clearer in respect of different sorts of teachers, and do not impose any liability or fresh danger or difficulty upon the teaching profession by the words we are using.</p>

<p>I beg to move, "That this House doth agree with the Lords in the said Amendment."<br/>
The advantage of this Amendment and the one next to it, with which the Government recommend the House to agree, is that we are substantially altering the present law in regard to the statutory distance within which it is necessary for a child to be if it is obliged to walk. If the House will look at the Amendment to page 31, line 15 it will be seen that this is an improvement on the present law in this respect, that it causes children under the age of eight years to be obliged statutorily to walk less than they are obliged to walk now. This matter has

been under consideration for some time, and we gave some small attention to it in the course of the passage of this Bill through the House. I think it would be wise for the House to accept this Amendment because I believe that that distance is quite far enough for children of that age to have to walk, and in that respect the law will be improved. It is also interesting to note that a number of local education authorities&#x2014;and not only what I would call the more enlightened authorities&#x2014;prescribe a shorter distance than the present three mile limit in their by-laws. I have a list of them here and they differentiate in a number of cases far the younger children. There are some 16 out of 62 county authorities which make such a differentiation in their by-laws at present. If the House accepts this Amendment, we shall have altered the law in respect of children under eight years of age to the extent mentioned in the Amendment.</p>

<p>I think we welcome the Amendment so far as it goes but I would like the President to reassure me on one point. I gather that the arrangement which was made under the 1938 Rules by the Lord Chancellor, the "Juvenile Courts (Assignment) Rules," aimed at a certain procedure in respect to cases of prosecution for the truancy of children. It was then the intention, I think, that all cases should be referred to the Juvenile Courts both in respect to any prosecution which might be thought desirable in the case of the parents and also any action as to the treatment of


the children concerned. Reference to the Juvenile Court is the most appropriate method of handling the case from the point of view of the child. I believe the intention of the Amendment before us is to avoid the double procedure, of the case being heard in the ordinary court as well as in the Juvenile Court. The ordinary court may now refer the case to the Juvenile Court so far as the child is concerned but presumably, under the Amendment, the ordinary court will still deal with the parents.<br/>
I think it is generally admitted that the procedure inaugurated by the Lord Chancellor in 1938 went a long way to meeting this class of difficulty, by the Juvenile Court having before it both the parents and the child. The procedure became very general so that all such cases were dealt with by the Juvenile Court and not by the ordinary court at all. I would like to be assured that the procedure as laid down by the Lord Chancellor in 1938 is not now going to be modified by the Amendment. I am concerned to know if my interpretation of the Lords Amendment is a correct one. It seems to me to fall short of the intention of 1938 and goes back on the excellent experience which has been gained in the Juvenile Courts since the Rules of 1938 were made. I would like to be reassured that it is the intention to follow the single procedure of referring both parent and child to the Juvenile Court instead of having two courts dealing with the same offence.</p>

There are similar Amendments in subsequent Clauses of the Bill to alter the title of these colleges. I think that I myself should regret the demise of the term "young people's colleges" to which I have always been attached. Nevertheless, I suggest that the House should accept the new designation of the colleges as inserted in another place. I think that only a few words from me are necessary. No task has been more difficult than the nomenclature in this Bill and if I receive good advice I am always ready to accept it. If it is felt by a majority that "county colleges" is a right description I shall be the first to recommend the House that they should accept it. In any case it is the spirit which animates these schools which matters. They will tend to be called by the district in which they are situated, and their reputation will be based on their achievements rather than on their name. I suggest, therefore, that we agree with the Lords in the said Amendment.</p>

<p>I beg to move, as an Amendment to the Lords Amendment, in line 1, after "camps," to insert "community centres."<br/>
This Amendment is identical with one moved in another place, and although the Minister in charge expressed sympathy with the idea of community centres, his objection to accepting it there was that


the Government had a sub-committee considering the question of community centres, which had not yet reported, and it might be that local authorities rather than local education authorities would be empowered or encouraged to assist community centres, or that both would be so empowered. I think that ought not to prevent Parliament from expressing, in this Bill, its desire that local education authorities should be empowered, with the consent of the Minister, to give this assistance. The Minister would have a check against any unreasonable use of the powers; it would not prevent the Government later, if they felt it desirable, from empowering the local authorities, as well as local education. authorities, to give such assistance. Surely it is important at this stage, when local education authorities are making their plans, that they should make them as promptly as possible and that they should take account of the possibility of educational uses of community centres. Plans are being made at this moment for new areas, for the replacement of devastated areas and for the creation of large suburbs of houses where communal centres may be of the utmost importance. In connection with the development of adult education, the right use of the community centre is also a matter that we must consider. It is an issue of such importance that I hope the President will be willing to reconsider the attitude which was taken up by the Minister who represented him in another place. There is no difference in any quarter of the House as to the value of community centres, and in our desire to see them encouraged. The educational use of a community centre is of great importance. We do not want those who go to the community centre merely to have opportunities for good fellowship and for dances, whist drives and gatherings of that kind. At the heart of it should be educational work. Therefore, the local education authority ought to be able to assist in the establishment, maintenance and management of community centres, and I hope the Government will be willing to accept the Amendment.</p>

<p>I beg to second the Amendment to the Lords Amendment.<br/>
I am governor of a college which is known to the Minister and he is probably aware that the county are now in the process of taking over a very fine building for a community centre. I, with other gover-

nors, was rather concerned as to the use to which this new centre might be put. If should be very sorry if it developed into a place merely for the holding of darts competitions, dances, whist drives and things of that kind, although I have no objection to these functions in themselves. I would like to see community centres as places where classes could be held. This Amendment seeks to give the local education authority an opportunity to make grants to a community centre for purely educational purposes. I do not know what objection there can be to that course, but if it could be done I am satisfied that it would achieve a very good purpose and would enable community centres, which will grow in importance and in number, to carry on educational work for young people and also for adults who might take part in their general work.</p>

As the Clause stands, the purpose which my hon. Friend has in mind is mare satisfactorily provided for than would be the case if this Amendment was adopted. There is included in this catalogue of places and things to which a local education authority may give their support, places at which facilities for recreation, for training and so on may be provided. I should have thought that it would be much better to leave the Clause as it stands, because as the Clause stands it is possible for the local education authority to provide the place for the community centre. It is the place that matters. If we insert the expression, "community centre," it will be necessary to insert somewhere in the Bill a definition of a community centre. It may not be easy to define a community centre. That being so, I hope that the Minister will


resist the Amendment, and that my hon. Friend will feel satisfied that as the Clause stands it provides in a more effective way for the purpose which he has in mind.</p>

<p>The Government are thoroughly in sympathy with the idea put forward by my hon. Friend the Member for the Combined English Universities (Mr. Harvey), and those who have supported him, but we take the view which has been pertly expressed by my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Ilford (Mr. Hutchinson). There is ample power in the Bill as it is drafted to do all that my hon. Friends desire. In fact, there is power to aid an educational effort in institutions such as that to which my hon. Friend the Member for West Waltham-stow (Mr. McEntee) has alluded. It is enjoined as a duty on local education authorities, in this Bill, to arrange for the further education of the people of their areas, and where a community centre exists it will probably be a very convenient place at which to hold classes. I hope we shall not have quite so many classes for further education taking place in school premises in future, because some of the young people we desire to get back for further education rather resent going back to the old place which they thought they had finished with, and which did not appear to show any great appreciation of their efforts when they were attending it.<br/>
This Clause does not prevent a local education authority from erecting a community centre and it avoids the difficulty which was pointed out by my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Ilford, because it calls it "another place." Where a local education authority desires to erect the kind of building which we know as a community centre, those words will amply cover them when they try to put their wish into effect. Therefore, I hope my hon. Friend will not press his Amendment. We are in accord with his desire, but we have not yet decided who are the appropriate people to erect a community centre. We are in the difficulty of finding an exact definition of a community centre. We welcome my hon. Friend's idea; we believe that the Bill is ample to ensure that every encouragement will be given to local education authorities actively to pursue their powers in these matters.</p>

<p>The Lords Amendment in page 42, line 3, almost appears to take out words and put them back again, but that is necessary to enable us to do two or three things. We want to make it clear that some amenities, including playing fields, can be provided by an authority for the use of a single school if necessary. Certain other amenities can be provided by an authority if they are not appropriated to a particular school, and many amenities which can be provided, but are not so appropriated, are playgrounds other than ordinary school playgrounds. The Clause as originally drafted appears to be rather obscure and as amended we believe it will be clear and will enable these separate things to be done.</p>

This and the next Amendment deal with the retention of part of the Physical Training and Recreation Act. As the Bill left the House, the first three Sections of the Act would have disappeared. Representations were made to us by the National Playing Fields Association and the Standing Joint Committee of Metropolitan Boroughs, led by my hon. Friend the Member for Bow and Bromley (Mr. Key), with regard to some grants which have been promised under the Act. The Act established a very elaborate machinery, including the National Fitness Council and Area Fitness Councils throughout the country, upon whose recommendations the grants have to be made. The effect of the Amendments that we are making is to retain the grants but to remove the over elaborate machinery that had been constructed. What this means is that the power to make the grant will remain, and we shall set up an appropriate advisory committee to help us in considering claims for grants, and in that way the work that was commenced by the Physical Training and Recreation Act will be continued less cumbrously than it was being conducted prior to the war.</p>

<p>I was pointing out that under this new Clause the Minister


has extensive powers, if he is satisfied that a local authority or other person has acted unreasonably in the exercise of statutory powers conferred upon them, to give directions the effect of which is to override the decision of the local authority. I am not going to suggest that there may not be cases in which it is desirable that powers of this nature should be exercised by the Minister. This new Clause does represent, however, a departure from what has been the normal constitutional practice of Parliament. The House will probably agree that there may be cases, particularly under a Bill of this character, where a far-reaching power of this sort is necessary.<br/>
If, however, we give such drastic power to the Minister, we ought to impose adequate safeguards upon the exercise of that power which will ensure that its exercise by the Minister shall operate in a manner which is satisfactory to the authorities whose decision he over-rides: Therefore, I have put down this Amendment to the Clause which provides that it a local education authority is aggrieved by any directions which are given by the Minister, over-riding their decision under the provisions of this Clause, it shall be open to them to require that those directions should be laid before Parliament and that there should be an opportunity for Parliament, if it sees fit, to pray that the directions be annulled.<br/>
I submit that the Amendment provides a satisfactory and effective safeguard to the exercise of this power. It is not necessary for me to say that in the case of my right hon. Friend there is not likely to be any unreasonable exercise of the power. But we have to look at this matter apart from personal questions of that nature and to ask ourselves whether, as a matter of principle, it is right that we should vest in a Minister this far-reaching power of over-riding decisions which Parliament has said should, in the first instance, be taken by public authorities, such as local education authorities.<br/>
My right hon. Friend may say in reply to the Amendment that if it is adopted he will be exposed to frivolous objections to his directions being brought before Parliament. If what the Amendment proposed was that the right to bring these directions before Parliament should be extended to every individual who had

made a complaint, or indeed to any body of managers whose decision was to be varied, then it might well be that we should have brought to Parliament complaints of a frivolous character. When, however, we are dealing with a local authority like a local education authority, we must assume that they will act reasonably. All we are asking is that my right hon. Friend will agree that, if he comes to the conclusion that the authority has acted unreasonably in the exercise of its statutory powers, it should have the opportunity of bringing his directions to Parliament for a final decision.<br/>
When we are dealing with a public authority we have to consider their position as a statutory body, and it is a serious thing for it to be said that a Minister of the Crown is satisfied that a statutory body have exercised their power unreasonably. No doubt it will be an exceptional thing, and I submit, therefore, that if the Minister seriously comes to the conclusion that a local education authority have acted unreasonably in the exercise of powers which Parliament has made contingent upon their discretion, they should have an opportunity, if they feel aggrieved, of causing those directions to be laid before this House so that Parliament may be the final judge between them and the Minister. I hope that my right hon. Friend, who has throughout the progress of this Bill acted with so much consideration for the local education authorities, will be able to meet us in this final matter and agree that there should be this safeguard for which we ask. It will enable this House to be the final judge on matters which may arise between him and them in the execution of the powers which Parliament has vested in them under this Bill and of the powers which Parliament has given under them other enactments relating to education.</p>

<p>I beg to second the Amendment to the Lords Amendment.


I understand that the new Clause is in substitution for Clause 93, Sub-section (2) of the Bill, which a Lords Amendment is designed to delete later on. The new Clause is much stronger than that Subsection, which says:
<q>Where the performance of any duty imposed by or for the purposes of this Act on a local education authority or on the managers or governors of any county school or auxiliary school is thereby made contingent upon, the opinion of the authority or of the managers or governors, the Minister may nevertheless require the authority managers or governors to perform that duty if in his opinion the circumstances are such as to require the performance thereof.</q>
That requires them to perform a duty. Under the proposed new Clause, I respectfully suggest, the Minister's powers are very much stronger, because he may give directions as to the exercise of the power or the performance of the duty, as may appear to him to be expedient. He can not only tell local authorities that they have to perform a duty which has been imposed upon them; he can go further. He can tell them how they are to do it. The meaning of the words:
<q>give such directions as to the exercise of the power or the performance of the duty as appear to him to be expedient,</q>
would enable him to tell them not only to do a job but also the manner in which they are to do it.<br/>
Therefore, I hope very much that my right hon. Friend will consider very seriously accepting the Amendment. The proposed new Clause, being much stronger than the provision which this House had approved in the Bill, does, I think, make it necessary for us to scrutinise very carefully the Minister's powers. If this House entrusts local authorities with certain powers surely it can only be right that, if the Minister seeks then to override those powers, the local authorities concerned should have the right to come to this House and to challenge the Minister's action. That is all we are asking. If the local authority feel that the Minister has acted in a way that is unfair to the exercise of their discretion, they should be able to come to this House, which has given them the powers, and to say: "Is it right or is it not right that the Minister should take away from us now, in this particular case, the powers with which we have been entrusted?"</p>

<p>I hope that the Minister will not accept the Amendment. All I can see in it is a possibility of very long delay and I do not see that there is anything to be said in its favour, Anybody who has served upon a local education authority, as I have for many years, will agree that in dealing with the Board of Education we have not found them unreasonable. Occasionally, we may have differed from the Board, but we have always found them willing to listen to any reasons that we put forward, and to consider any suggestions we had to make. What does the Lords Amendment propose to do? It proposes, if a dispute arises between some local body and the local authority, or between some person and the local authority, that if the person or local body represents to the Minister that a decision of the local authority is unreasonable he shall have a right to appeal to the Minister against the decision of the local authority. That is a perfectly sound thing to have and I am glad that individual citizens or local bodies who cannot come to an agreement with their local education authority should have the right to go to the Minister and ask him to act as arbitrator.<br/>
In a case like that I am sure that the local authority would not have reason to fear the decision of the Minister. I cannot see any possibility of it. It is suggested, in the Amendment by the hon. and learned Member for Ilford (Mr. Hutchinson) that the matter shall lie on the Table of the House for 40 days, but it may have to lie there for much longer than 40 days, because Parliament may have adjourned for some purpose for more than four days. If Parliament adjourned for any period more than four days, that period has to be taken into consideration and has not to be reckoned in the 40 days. Thus, it might go on for a couple of months while something of very great importance to the local authority is held up. It does not follow that Parliament will agree to the matter in question or will consider it, because it might be a very long time before the Leader of the House can find an opportunity for Parliament to give any consideration to the matter in order to clear up what, after all, may be only a very small dispute. I feel that we cannot afford to introduce new machinery to deal with disputes between the local persons or body and


the local education authority, and therefore I hope that the Minister will not accept the proposed new procedure, which will hold up the ordinary business of the local education authority perhaps for a very long period. The more I examine the Amendment the less I find myself in agreement with it.</p>

<p>This is a very attractive Amendment and makes an appeal to anybody, on its face value. When you suggest to a democrat that, before anything is agreed to, it must come before the House of Commons, he is inclined to agree; but in this case we have to ask ourselves whether the proposals now being made will cause delay. Local authorities may think they have a chance to lay complaints before the Minister but to let a matter lie on the Table for 40 days causes a big delay. We have had so much delay over the Education Bill altogether that we do not care to cause more delay and make it more difficult for the Minister to get through his work. I felt there was a lot to be said for the Amendment to the proposed new Clause and for the arguments of the hon. and learned Member who moved it, until I considered the matter carefully. The result is that I have come down on the side of the Minister and I hope that he will try to persuade the hon. and learned Member not to press his Amendment.</p>

<p>I so often find myself in agreement with the hon. Member for Leigh (Mr. Tinker) that I am sorry to differ from him this time. The question at issue is not delay but whether the delay is unreasonable or undue in the light of the issues at stake. I believe that time would be found for any big question to be discussed in Parliament which, upon a big matter, ought to have the final word. On the other hand, I cannot believe that in a small, petty matter the Minister would go so far as to override the local authority.

<p>My answer is "Yes." I have had a letter from the Secretary of the Association of Education Committees asking me to support the Amendment which is sponsored and approved by the Association of Municipal Corporations. I think my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Ilford (Mr. Hutchinson) is recognised as one who can express the views in this House of responsible local authorities. My hon. Friend can take it for granted that there is strong feeling among local authorities on this matter because they feel that their rights are in question. They have been given certain powers, and if there is any question that they are not using their powers properly or are abusing them, that issue ought to be determined by Parliament.<br/>
I am surprised that anybody should suggest that Parliament should refuse to maintain its proper role as the watchdog of the Executive. Some of us are very concerned at the power which the Executive are increasingly taking to themselves at, the expense of other authorities, and that makes it all the more necessary for Parliament to act. I therefore hope that my right hon. Friend will turn a kindly eye on the Amendment. The local authorities were not enamoured of the Clause but they are not asking that the proposed new Clause might not be accepted. They ask, as I think they are justified in asking, that Parliament should ultimately have the last word.</p>

<p>I fully realise the reasons which animated my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Ilford (Mr. Hutchinson) and the hon. Baronet the Member for Tamworth (Sir J. Mellor) in moving and seconding the Amendment to the proposed new Clause. If I put the matter in its proper perspective the House may get a rather different idea of the Clause from that which it has had from the speeches which have been made, and I hope that my hon. and learned Friend will not press the matter. The Clause is of importance to the operation, and to the judicial and fair working, of the Bill as a whole. My hon. Friend the Member for Tamworth drew the attention of the House to Clause 93 (2) of the Bill, as it originally left the Commons.<br/>
He made out that the new Clause which hon. Members have been asked to consider is, in fact, more drastic and, so to speak, less fair to the authority and the individual than the Clause which was originally passed by this House in the Bill as sent to another place. Every shred of evidence I have had, including the best legal advice I could obtain, is to the contrary. Our idea in redrafting this Clause is to make it more fair, more just and less draconian than the original Subsection to Clause 93. We have made two definite changes in the new Clause which is to be substituted for Clause 93 (2). The new Clause D says:
<q>If the Minister is satisfied, either on complaint by any person or otherwise, &#x2026;</q>
thus introducing the question of a complaint by any person, or otherwise, that any local education authority or managers or governors of any county or auxiliary school are doing this or that. It must be first proved by complaint. We have also brought into the new Clause the words "proposing to act unreasonably &#x2026;"It has been thought, according to all the best advice we have been able to get, that by these two Amendments we have made this Clause less drastic than that originally passed by this House. That is the legal interpretation of the Clause as put before the House to-day. We are faced with a Clause which, in my view, is phrased in more equitable and just terms than the original Clause. Yet hon. Members are desirous of amending this Clause, which is in fairer terms than that which they have previously agreed to.</p>

<p>Is it correct to say that whereas Clause 93 (2) merely empowered the Minister to give directions to the local authority to perform a duty the new Clause empowers him to go further, and to tell them how they are to perform the duty?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1944-07-27a.964.1" hansard_membership_id="1961" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/32686" speakername="Mr. Butler" colnum="964" time="">
<p>I am advised that the original wording requiring the managers or governors to perform a duty was equally strict, and that the hon. Member's apprehensions are not as powerful as he would imagine. I think the new wording is more equitable than the old in both respects, in regard to the complaint and in regard to the word "unreasonably." We are faced with the provision in the Bill to which the hon. and learned Member for Ilford wishes to make, an Amendment, which is to the effect that any directions made by the Minister, if they aggrieve an authority, shall be put before Parliament, and left, as the hon. Member for West Walthamstow (Mr. McEntee) said, to lie for what may be many more than 40 days. Let us examine that position. In my view the hon. and learned Member for Ilford's position has that main weakness. This Clause is being sought by the Government, and we are asking the House to agree with the Amendment brought from another place, because we consider it necessary in the last resort to have the power in the Bill in the hands of some person, we suggest the Minister, to deal with the small questions of disagreement which may arise between an authority and a person. I fail to see, in the first place, why my hon. and learned Friend should insist that only if the authorities were aggrieved should the matter be brought before Parliament. This Clause is inserted as a protection for the citizen and the ordinary person. If he is to be fair he must insist that the aggrieved person shall have his case in every matter, small or large, brought before the attention of Parliament. This Clause gives the opportunity to the Minister to intervene and settle small questions of friction which may arise between an authority and a person in the operation of this Bill. I claim it would be utterly unjust if only when one side, the authority, was aggrieved, should the matter be brought before Parliament, and that when a citizen was aggrieved, it should not. That is the main difficulty I see in my hon. and learned Friend's Amendment.</p>

<p>Why it should be frivolous I fail to see. It will be the Minister's duty to keep the balance fairly between the authority and the person. I could not accept an Amendment to the hon. and learned Member's Amendment on the lines just suggested for the reasons which I am about to indicate in the second part of my speech.<br/>
Let us examine the type of cases which this Clause may affect. I think it permissible to take one or two minutes on this, because it obviously interests the House, and my hon. and learned Friend has evinced every sign of sincerity and interest. Cases I might mention are very simple. Under Clause 32, to take one Clause at random&#x2014;I ought to know the Bill fairly thoroughly by now&#x2014;an authority, after notice served on any parent, may require that parent to submit his child for examination by the medical officer. If there is an unreasonable exercise of function in that particular matter it should come to the attention of the Minister, and the Minister could quite rightly decide in a fair and just manner the issue as between the parties concerned, the authority and the person. I claim that an issue like that is quite unsuitable to be laid before Parliament, especially for an indefinite number of days, perhaps as long as three months.<br/>
To take another instance, Clause 48 deals with the provision of board and lodging otherwise than at boarding schools or colleges and hon. Members will remember that, in the course of our deliberations, we inserted an Amendment in Committee that as far as practicable effect should be given by the authority to the wishes of the parents of the child or to the wishes of the young person, as the case may be, in respect of the religious denomination of the person with whom he will reside. That is to say if a child is sent away from home we want the authority, if possible, to put it in a home of which the occupants are of the same denomination as the child. We inserted that on purpose, to ease the situation for children who may have to leave their homes. It is quite possible

that in a matter like that there might be a small dispute. In that case, surely it is better to give an ordinary citizen a right of appeal to the Minister. Surely it is unreasonable to ask that it should be brought before Parliament and laid for what might be a considerable number of days.<br/>
In the Seventh Schedule&#x2014;I could mention many other examples where friction might arise&#x2014;it is laid down that associations of teachers shall be brought into the conferences which have to be set up under that Schedule for the purpose of preparing an agreed syllabus. Suppose there was a slight difference of opinion as to which associations of teachers should be brought in in a particular area, and the conference were held up, surely it would be unreasonable to bring a matter like that before Parliament for 40 days, and involve Members in issues with which they could not have time to deal. Hon. Members will see there is no analogy between the directions which would be given under this Clause and regulations. Under this new Clause individual cases would be dealt with. Regulations, on the other hand, are of general application. This is where my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Ilford has on a very rare occasion in his life fallen into error. I think he has confounded the situation. He imagines that here we are dealing with a provision to override the discretion which Parliament has given to authorities. That is not the case at all.<br/>
As I envisage the matter this is a reserved power which any constitutionalist would really prefer not to have but is necessary for the smooth working of the Bill. It is, in fact, a judicial power reserved by the Minister in cases of friction in small matters which have been dealt with "unreasonably." It is not analogous with the case of a Regulation in which Parliament has given the main direction which the Minister is deliberately flouting by administrative action. It has nothing to do with the argument coming into fashion in Parliament today. Also I would add that it might be dangerous to ask me to lay more Regulations before Parliament. I might forget them and get into difficulties such as arose at Question Time to-day.<br/>
I am not deliberately seeking this Clause, but I think it necessary for the smooth operation of the Bill and as a sort


of reserve power. As I have also said, the issues involved are not suitable in my view for laying before Parliament. I will say that I do not believe in delegated legislation and as one who believes in the control of Parliament I still think I am perfectly right in recommending this Clause to the House for the reasons I have given. The Minister of Education is one to whom I think such quasi judicial functions can be given in connection with this sort of thing. We have special functions to carry out at the Board in connection with our charitable trusts and other matters. The Bill reserves these functions to the Minister and in that it has met with approval. I give an undertaking that the Clause will be operated in the proper spirit and not in the wrong spirit in the future.</p>

<p>I rise to oppose the Amendment to the proposed new Clause and support the Minister in the statement he has made. I regard the Amendment which has come from another place as a very wholesome one. When yearly reports come forward showing how this magnificent Bill is working in the country, if we adopt the Lords Amendment we shall be able to say to the Minister, "Why have you not intervened in the case of such and such a thing? Why has it not been carried out according to the tenets of the Bill?" We should not have the delaying action suggested in the Amendment of the hon. and learned Member for Ilford (Mr. Hutchinson) but should throw on to the Minister of Education the direct responsibility of seeing that all these authorities are not held up in any programme they may have before them and in a way described here as unreasonable. I look forward to the time when the Minister of Education&#x2014;as we are now to call him&#x2014;will be able to say in any difficulty on which agreement cannot be reached: "Here is your court of appeal." I cannot imagine that any Minister of Education, either now or in the future, would not give reasonable consideration to any dispute that arises. Therefore, I should like to raise my voice against the hon. and learned Member's Amendment and in favour of the Amendment that has come from another place.</p>

<p>I beg to move, as an Amendment to the Lords Amendment, in line 4, to leave out from "inspection," to "authority," in line 6, and insert:
<q>except by one of His Majesty's Inspectors or by a person ordi-


narily employed for the purpose of inspecting secular instruction either as an additional inspector appointed by the Minister or as an officer in the whole-time employment of a local education.</q>
The Clause when it left this House had a definite reference to a minister of religion being excluded from inspecting syllabus religious instruction. It has been thought, and representations have been made, that this unduly discriminated against a minister of religion, who naturally may be said to have a great interest in this question. The Government, therefore, had in mind to amend the Clause as it left this House and so to phrase matters that no discrimination would seem to be made against a minister of religion. That was the reason why an Amendment was originally made in this Clause. It does not mean that the Government have departed from their original view that in general inspection of denominational religious instruction should be carried out by someone from the diocese or by someone in whom the managers have an interest, and syllabus instruction should be inspected by His Majesty's inspectors. That is the position which the Government have always taken up. It is a position which I have taken up in this Bill and it is a position which this new draft Amendment retains. This is a matter to which many interests outside this House attach great importance and the effect of the new draft is that any person inspecting the syllabus instruction must be one of His Majesty's inspectors or a person employed for the purpose of inspecting secular instruction ordinarily employed, say, an additional inspector appointed by the Minister or an officer in the whole time employment of the local education authority. Therefore, the Amendment does maintain the position taken up by the Government throughout, and is agreeable to the interests concerned, to the denominations and to tie teachers themselves.<br/>
On the question of the entry of an incumbent into a school, the position, as I see it, is that the practice in various parts of the country, whereby a Minister of a religious denomination is invited into a school in an advisory capacity to advise the head teacher or a member of his staff in the giving of religious instruction, can and certainly should go on. It is a practice which is very much welcomed by certain teachers and is very successful

in many schools, and it is one to which the denominations attach great importance. There is nothing in this Clause, as amended, to prevent the acceptance by a minister of a religious denomination of an invitation from the head teacher to enter the school in an advisory capacity. The denominations, I have reason to believe, attach great importance to this, but the fact that a visit in an advisory capacity is permitted by the Clause as amended does not alter the rule as to inspection.</p>

This is an old friend, in which the House has interested itself before, in rather a dramatic manner. This is the Clause dealing with the method of settling the scales of salaries of teachers. There is nothing particularly remarkable in the redrafting. The original draft was open to the objection that the ultimate responsibility for drafting the scales of salaries would rest with the Minister. Such an arrangement would have been at

variance with the present position, whereby the Burnham Committees frame the scales and the Minister accepts or rejects them for the purpose of grant. This new Sub-section retains that principle intact. The value of this is that we hope to continue the traditions of the Burnham Committee and its great record in the same manner as before. Sub-section (2) maintains the practice, whereby the Burnham Committees appoint as their chairmen persons nominated by the Board. This enables us to continue as before the operation of the Burnham machinery.</p>

When the Bill was previously before us, my hon. Friend the Member for the Park Division of Sheffield (Mr. Burden) brought before the Committee the case of an officer of a county council who might be damaged by the passing of this Bill, through people being brought in by the Part III authorities, who might take his job. A series of Amendments to the Clause that we are now considering, to which we ask the House to agree, provides that if a person is so damaged he shall be entitled to the usual compensation.

such pupils to be provided by the managers or governors of the school.</q></p>

<p>I beg to move "That this House doth agree with the Lords in the said Amendment."<br/>
I think I should say a word about this new Clause, which gives power to the Minister to authorise local authorities to provide temporary assistance for auxiliary schools, and, if hon. Members will look at the terms of the Clause, they will see that the Minister has to be satisfied that, by reason of difficulties arising out of war conditions or conditions occasioned by the coming into operation of Part II of this Act, temporary accommodation ought to be provided. The fact is that we have been having to undertake certain temporary assistance to our voluntary schools under Section 23 of the Education Act, 1921. As the Bill stands, local authorities would not be able to continue such emergency temporary assistance to voluntary schools, unless we put this in the Clause. I say "temporary," because there is no question of permanent assistance being given under this new Clause. Otherwise, the whole balance of the Bill would be upset. Hon. Members have asked about temporary assistance in some cases, for reasons at present arising out of war conditions. It may be necessary to set up huts or some such temporary accommodation, and we have been glad to have the powers under the Section of the Education Act which I mentioned to deal with these emergency matters.<br/>
The other emergency situation arises after the introduction of Part II of this Act, and will mostly arise on the raising of the age. It would be very wrong if there were no emergency provision to tide over managers or governors of a voluntary school during the period of the raising of the age, although this Clause will not permit of such assistance being given permanently. In these circumstances, it seems wise to insert the Clause, but it does not affect the permanent operation of the long-term provision for bringing up the standards of voluntary schools. It is necessary under war conditions and in the emergency which may arise on bringing the Act into operation.</p>

<p>Will the Minister say if there is any provision in the Bill to deal with a situation such as we frequently meet now in regard to temporary buildings and the licensing of temporary buildings?


What we find in practice is that, if we license some factory or perhaps a church or other building in an emergency for a temporary purpose, that building is put up and there is the greatest difficulty in the world for years afterwards in getting the person, to whom the temporary licence has been issued, to erect a permanent building. We find that plans for all kinds of premises are sent to local authorities, and that the people say "If you are willing to give us a licence for this temporary building, we hope to be in a position in a very short time to remove this not very pretty thing, which is purely temporary," but, once it gets up, like the houses built during the last war, which we were told were purely provisional and temporary, but are still there, it is very difficult to remove. In this case, I agree entirely that circumstances may arise during and after the war which make this necessary, but I think local authorities should be given very strict powers.</p>

<p>This Bill deals with no other buildings than educational buildings, but some schools have been erected in the past as temporary schools which have long outlived their usefulness and frequently become great hindrances. In this Bill, this provision is safeguarded by the development plan, and the local authority will have to show how it proposes to develop the various schools in its area. Immediately after the war, in areas where considerable damage has been done, it may be essential that temporary provision should be made, but the development plan ought to indicate a date at which it will be proposed to erect a permanent school to take the place of the temporary one, and when the development plan is confirmed by the education order, this provision becomes mandatory upon the local education authority.</p>

This is a redefinition which was thought advisable in order to meet certain representations made in regard to the constitution of the body of managers.

It has been represented that 12 months is an insufficient time in which to prepare an agreed syllabus, and that might well be the case. The agreed syllabuses now in use have taken longer than 12 months to prepare, and the Government are accordingly in favour of giving a longer time.

<p>It is obvious that the Amendment proposed by the Minister is a great improvement because there might be real difficulty in getting a syllabus satisfactorily arranged within one year.

<p>I beg to move, in page 1, line 23, to leave out paragraph <i>(c).</i><br/>
In moving this Amendment, I feel I ought to disclose my interest in the matter by saying that as a landowner I may possibly be affected at some time by the Bill. I move this Amendment with a certain amount of diffidence because I know that this Bill has come from another place, and has been fully considered by a number of capable people. In fact,


when I saw the names of those who had debated it, in the OFFICIAL REPORT. I felt a very small David with a very inadequate and smooth stone. Further, this Clause was meant to be a present to the agricultural industry. One does not like looking a gift horse in the mouth, but at the same time one knows the embarrassment of receiving a very large present one has not room for, so that it would have been better in some ways not to have received it at all. I feel that this may be a larger present than the industry really wants.<br/>
The Clause as it stands is rather 100 comprehensive. I understand that under Sections 23 and 25 of the Agricultural Holdings Act any lease that has been made for the duration of the war, and which has been run for upwards of two years, will be terminable only by due notice and after an interval of 13 months. The Clause says not less than one year or more than two. Probably, in practice, it will run to the nearest quarter day or to Michaelmas, the usually accepted end of the agricultural year, and if the date decided upon by Order in Council for the end of the war was 1st February it might be a year from the following Michaelmas before the lease was terminated. I feel that that might be an onerous condition in many cases, particularly in connection with leases entered into during the war period. My hon. Friend the Member for Thirsk and Malton Turton), in speaking on this matter on the Second Reading, quoted an instance which I beg leave to repeat. It may be that a farmer has had part of his farm, including the homestead, taken over by some authority like the War Department, and that the holding is unworkable because the buildings are not usable. In order to prevent as much land as possible going out of cultivation he gets a neighbour to take it over and cultivate it, probably at a considerably lower rent than is normally paid because there are no buildings with it. As soon as the war comes to an end, and the War Department hands the farmer back his farmstead, he naturally wants to start farming as quickly as possible. He would not want to wait 13 months or 20 months or more if the war officially ended in December. Under Section 23 it appears to be impossible to contract out, to be able to make any conditions whereby it should be varied. It was suggested on

the Second Reading that the question of compensation might come in, but I do not think that that is the case. Only Sections 23 and 25 of the Act are referred to.<br/>
I feel that this Clause would not altogether have the effect intended, particularly as regards the intention of the parties when the agreement was entered into. The converse case is that of a man who takes over an allotment or smallholding to produce food during the war, either for his family or as part of his war effort for the community. He would probably not want to carry that on for a long time, and it might be economically impossible, after the emergency was over. It was never the intention that he should do so. If the intention was in either case that this should be an ordinary year to year lease I think it would have been made out in the ordinary form and then, of course, the Agricultural Holdings Act is designed to control the running of leases of that sort. But these are exceptions and for these reasons I ask that this Clause be omitted or, better, that other words be inserted which will cover a number of cases it is intended to cover, but will also cover the possible hardships I have referred to.</p>

<p>I desire to support the Amendment, although not on quite the same grounds, of my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for East Grinstead (Colonel Clarke). It seems to me that in one respect paragraph <i>(c)</i> is unnecessary, and that if it remains in the Bill its operation will be obscure. I express the opinion on the paragraph as it stands with a great deal of diffidence as it was introduced by a Noble Lord of great legal eminence in another place. If I understand the decision in Lace v. Chandler correctly that decision applies to agricultural holdings in a rather remarkable way. It appears to me that the lease of an agricultural holding for the duration of the war, under that decision, would take effect as a tenancy at will. Its operation as a tenancy at will is affected by the Agricultural Holdings Act, and without anything being put into the bill it appears to me that 12 months' notice, would, in view of the provisions of that Act, be required to terminate this tenancy so that agricultural holdings, having the protection of that Statute, appear to come into


a quite different category from any other form of tenancies for the duration of the war or hostilities.<br/>
I think it is unnecessary to provide for having one month's notice on top of that. This paragraph says:
<q> &#x2026; this Subsection shall apply to that agreement subject to the provisions of Sections twenty-three and twenty-five of the said Act.</q>
That seems a little obscure. Does it mean that 12 months' notice under the Agricultural Holdings Act will suffice, or mean that you have to give 13 months' notice under that Section of the Agricultural Holdings Act and not Sub-section (1) of this Clause? I should have thought that all you would have required to state in regard to this was that instead of a month's notice there must be the same notice as you get under the Agricultural Holdings Act.</p>

<p>I hope the Attorney-General will reject this Amendment. Although I speak with some diffidence, as I have not the same contacts with the land and its tenancies as the hon, and gallant Member for East Grinstead (Colonel Clarke) and the hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Manningham-Buller), I want to point out that the idea that paragraph <i>(c)</i> involves an addition to the ordinary agricultural notice is entirely misconceived. The term "subject to" is common enough in legislation and cannot be read as "in addition to." "Subject to" means that the ordinary terms for notice in agricultural tenancies will apply, and this provision was inserted for the protection of those who have taken tenancies of this kind. There can be no greater upset to anyone involved in the working of the land than to have his tenancy determined in between the seasons. The whole object of agricultural leases and terms for notice, and the period at which they may be brought to an end, is that you can have a change-over from one occupier to another at a time that fits in with the working of the land. This Sub-section, which it is now desired, for reasons that I cannot appreciate, to remove, is designed in order that, whenever a tenancy is determined, it shall be at a time which suits those working the soil.</p>

<p>To some extent my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry (Mr. Manningham-Buller) answered my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for East Grinstead (Colonel Clarke). This

Sub-section is not in any sense intended as a special gift to the agricultural interests. It was inserted in accordance with the general principle of the Bill, which is that agreements for the duration of the war should have the effect which they would have had if they had not been held to be invalid in form under the decision of the Court of Appeal. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry that, if there had been an agricultural lease for the duration of the war&#x2014;I very much doubt if there are any such&#x2014;the provisions of Sections 23 and 25 of the Agricultural Holdings Act would have applied and that there was to be 12 months' notice taking effect at the end of the tenancy. We inserted this Clause because under an earlier part of the Section we had made a statutory provision for a month's notice. When that was put in we had in mind the ordinary residential lease, and not the agricultural lease, but we thought there was a definite danger of someone saying, "As the Statute provides for a month's notice, that overrides the statutory provisions of the Agricultural Holdings Act with regard to notice for agricultural leases." We, therefore, thought it right to make it clear that the provision as to one month's notice shall not have that effect and that agricultural leases for the duration of the war shall take effect subject to those two Sections, as they undoubtedly would have done if it had been a valid agreement <i>ab initio.</i> Therefore, I think the Committee would be unwise to accept this Amendment. It really restores the status quo on the basis that the agreement is invalidated. Once the point was taken and it was pointed out that this one month's notice might create a difficulty, we thought it right to make an express provision to this effect.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 3, line 34, after "war," to insert "or."<br/>
This and the next two Amendments are designed to meet a point raised on the Second Reading by hon. Members for Carmarthen (Mr. Hughes), Ashford (Mr. Smith) and Aylesbury (Sir S. Reed). The point was that under the Bill as originally introduced there was a provision that, if you found these words, the presumption was that it meant the whole war, including the war with Japan. That presumption could be rebutted by anything in the agreement or any evidence admissible under the ordinary rules but that was the presumption. It was pointed out with considerable force that probably, though not in all cases, in agreements entered into, at any rate before Pearl Harbour, the parties had in mind the European war, and we have accepted that view in this Amendment. We have also, under the third Amendment, widened the discretion of the court as to the evidence that is to be produced and we have said:
<q>The court by whom any such agreement is construed may admit any evidence which in the opinion of the court may throw light on the intentions of the parties as to the meaning of the said expression.</q>
It may well be that this Amendment, which alters the presumption in the case of agreements made before a certain date, does not really make a great change. It may well be that without this Amendment parties would have been able to go to the court and say, "This expression 'the duration of the war is ambiguous. Look at the date when we made our agreement. What was the war then?" It is possible that that would have been rebutting evidence but, on the whole, we

accept the view put forward in the Second Reading Debate and we think it better to make that the presumption. Of course, as I said on Second Reading, we shall not please everybody in the result, because so many different intentions and circumstances may have entered into people's minds, but we have thought it right slightly to widen the rule as to the admissibility of evidence so that the court, if it thinks proper, could allow in the special case what it might not otherwise consider admissible, such as some correspondence or negotiations between the parties, which made it clear that it was the whole war, or the period of service, or whatever it might be. I hope the Committee will feel that in this matter we have given careful consideration to the views which were expressed and that the Amendments which I am moving meet the points which were put by hon. Members.</p>

<p>I want to thank the Attorney-General for these Amendments. As one who pressed very hard for an Amendment on these lines, I feel deeply grateful. I regret that my hon. Friend the Member for Aylesbury (Sir S. Reed) who supported me is not here. He feels as I do about the matter and would have liked to say a few words, but unfortunately he has been detained. I think that it will be much simpler now for people who made agreements to know whether they apply only to the European war. This Bill was meant among other things to relieve hardship and injustice, and was the result of the recent decision in the Court of Appeal, and these Amendments will definitely be beneficial to those who entered into agreements in the earlier part of the war before the war with Japan began. They will not now have to bring in extraneous evidence to support their contentions. Like many other hon. Members, I am greatly obliged to my right hon. and learned Friend.</p>

<p>I was more concerned in the Debate on Second Reading to press for the general Amendment with regard to the admissibility of evidence than the point with which my hon. Friend the Member for Southampton (Dr. Thomas) is concerned. I ventured to agree with the Solicitor-General that in all probability most courts would have regarded the date on which the agreement was entered into as being a relevant and, in most cases, a determining factor in


deciding whether the whole war or the war with Germany was meant. I was particularly concerned with the general question of the intention of the parties and the rather strict rules of evidence which bound the courts in the methods by which they might ascertain that intention. Under the terms of these Amendments the court is left with a wide discretion as to the evidence which they may look to in order to ascertain the true intention of the parties. This is as wide as I could have hoped for, and as wide as I would have drafted it myself if I were seeking to put an Amendment on the Paper. I am, therefore, grateful to the Attorney-General for having moved the Amendment.<br/>

<p>I beg to move, in page 4, line 21, to leave out paragraph <i>(b).</i><br/>
The purpose of the paragraph is to permit those parties to agreements who gave notice before 13th June to terminate agreements to escape from the scope of the Bill. The 13th June was the date upon which the Attorney-General announced in the House that the Government would legislate in consequence of the decision of the Court of Appeal in the case of Lace and Chandler, which was given last February. I am moving to leave out the paragraph because, although we do not like retrospective legislation and do not want to make it more retrospective than we can help, I do not see why we should go out of our way

to help parties who have broken their agreements to escape from the scope of the Bill. They may have been legally entitled to give notice, but, in my submission, they none the less broke agreements made in honour even if the notices which they gave were legally effective. It was not the fault of the victims of the decision in Lace v. Chandler that the Government delayed making any announcement till 13th June. Therefore, I do not think that the parties who received notice before that date to terminate agreements should be penalised in consequence of the Government's delay.</p>

<p>I am rather taken by surprise to hear that my Amendment would be in Order if it were differently phrased. I will not deal with that point at the moment but will state the reason behind my Amendment even if it be incorrectly phrased. The object of the Bill is to give effect to the intentions of the parties when they entered into an agreement which has since been properly held by the Court of Appeal to be invalid. What appears to me to be the


case is that since the date of that decision many people may have jumped at the opportunity of getting out of obligations which they willingly entered into. I have had cases brought to my notice of landlords, on the one hand, giving notices which they could not have given prior to that decision, and, on the other hand, of tenants doing the same thing. The difficulty is to draw the line as to where we are to make the effect of this Bill retrospective. The Bill proposes that it should be retrospective to 13th June. As I see it, that has the effect that, if either a landlord or a tenant gave notice before 13th June, a notice which may be taking effect in December this year, it would still be effective and operative in spite of the Bill. It does not seem to me possible to put the parties back in a condition in which they were if, between the date of the Court of Appeal decision and 13th June, the possession of the premises subject to the agreement was given up; but it does seem to me possible for this House to provide that, where such a notice has been given and has not taken effect by 13th June, and where neither party entered into any form of legal obligation consequent upon the giving of that notice, that the notice should be treated as of no effect, the tenancy continuing as if the decision in Lace v. Chandler had not been arrived at.<br/>
I have not read the wording of my Amendment since I handed it in, but the intention of it is to provide that if the landlord had agreed to sell or to let the premises forming the subject of the original tenancy, the notice to quit would be effective. Similarly, if the tenant who received the notice to quit or had given it and, in the belief that the notice to quit given in the interval was valid, had entered into an agreement to rent or buy other premises, the notice to quit in those circumstances should be effective. It seems very hard indeed, particularly in the case of some officers. I have had brought to my notice the case of a colonel serving in the Army who has had notice from his landlord in respect of a lease which he thought was good for the duration of the war, and he now has to find other accommodation for his family. It is very hard that we should not be able to make the Bill retrospective, not only to 13th June but also to the extent that it

will invalidate all notices to quit which have not taken effect and where the parties to the original tenancy agreement have not entered into any agreement either in regard to the premises demised or for obtaining other premises.
Sir J. Mellor: If my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry (Mr. Manningham-Buller) would agree to alter his Amendment so that, instead of "line 33, at end, insert" he would put "line 33, after 'relationship,' insert"; and if he would also substitute "June" for "July," it would bring his Amendment very closely into line with my own, and it would then have my cordial support.</p>

<p>The position is difficult. We did our best to consider it before I, on behalf of the Government, gave my answer on 13th June. We have considered it very carefully since. I am bound to say that I feel a difficulty in accepting either of the Amendments and I will explain why. The Amendment of my hon. Friend the Member for Tamworth (Sir J. Mellor) goes further than that of my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry (Mr. Manningham-Buller). It is rather a strong order to go back and say that although, before the Government announced their intentions, a man gave a perfectly valid notice under the law, he is now to find it treated as an invalid notice and instrument. The difficulties are illustrated by the Amendment of my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry. He is willing to cut out the case in which a landlord has entered into a new legal obligation to let or sell premises, or in which the tenant has entered into any new legal obligation to rent or purchase other premises.<br/>
Let me take a case which is just worthy of consideration. Suppose a landlord, the Court of Appeal having told him that he can get possession of his premises&#x2014;being premises to which the Rent Restrictions Acts do not give protection to the tenant&#x2014;in August, September or December and, on the strength of that, he gives up premises which he himself had had to take when he entered into the agreement with his tenant; if we accept the Amendment, he would be left unable to get possession of his own property, having already given up the property which he had taken to provide for himself or his business while the lease continued. Par-


liament would get itself into the greatest difficulty if it passed a provision which had that result.<br/>
There are other things which might have been done and expenses which might have been incurred, on the faith of this matter, other than entering into agreements for premises or giving notice to give up premises. A man might have moved his business commitments in anticipation that he would be able to get possession of new premises. I quite agree that the most important ones would be covered in the Amendment, nevertheless we should be launching this legislation in a territory in which we could not say confidently what hardship we should be inflicting upon people and what expenditure and profit we might not be rendering abortive, although at the time they incurred the expense, the parties were entitled to believe that the law would not be altered.<br/>
I have dealt very simply with cases which, I have no doubt, both my hon. Friends have had in mind, and I have also made it clear that I have no particular sympathy with anybody who sought to get out of a bargain made for the duration of the war because the Court of Appeal has said he could; but, on the general principle, the House must be vigilant m regard to retrospective legislation. If we sought to go beyond 13th June, we might inflict real hardship to an extent which it would be very difficult to justify. With some regret, therefore, I ask the Committee to support us in the decision which I originally gave on 13th June, which was to the effect that while the legislation would be retrospective to that date we did not think it right to validate notices given before that date.</p>

<p>The right hon. and learned Gentleman has said that he has rejected the Amendment with regret. I must confess that I would be prepared to support him more strongly if he had not mentioned that matter. This House has always been very jealous about retrospective legislation. It would be a very great temptation in times to come, when this country may be governed by Administrations with reforming zeal, if we gave them the precedent of retrospective legislation, particularly on a question of control over economic and industrial activities.<br/>
It would be a great temptation but I think it would be very wrong to do so. Simply the position is, I would remind the Committee, that the Court of Appeal decides that all leases of this order for the duration are invalid. There is the law of the land, and every citizen is entitled to rely upon the law. It is not the moment to say there has been a matter of intention, definite agreement or whatever it may be. Every citizen is entitled to rely upon the law of the land.</p>

<p>I welcome that interruption. I agree that it is to this High Court that citizens look for the adjustment of an injustice, but in the meantime the position is that from the time the Court of Appeal declared that the citizen's rights were thus, the citizen was entitled to act upon that. Now the Attorney-General did not say so in terms, but in fact there is a good deal of retrospective legislation in this very Bill, and that is the extent to which this High Court of Parliament is prepared to go. It goes retrospectively to the point at which the Government hive declared they propose to act. That is quite fair to everyone, but up to the time when the Government, through the mouth of their leading Law Officer, declare that they intend to act, the citizens of this country are entitled to rely upon the law as it is declared in the Courts. We may find hard cases and argue on the basis that what was intended to be a gentleman's agreement shall be carried out, but the only basis on which the rule of law can he founded is to have respect for it, and give people the right to operate it and to support them in operating it. We here in this House can alter the law, but as long as people are operating under the law as it is laid down, there is no reason why we should condemn them for having done so.</p>

<p>I apologise, Major Milner, for having strayed outside the terms of the Amendment. I was dealing rather with the general principle embodied in this Amendment.

<p>The hon. and learned Member for Carmarthen (Mr. Hughes) has justified this Measure being retrospective to the date when the Government announced the decision to legislate, but he takes the view that it would be wrong to make it further retrospective than that. Arising out of that, I want to ask the Attorney-General if he will give an explanation as to why there was such a long delay after the decision of the Court of Appeal in February before announcing the decision to legislate in June, because it is arising out of that delay that the injustice, or I would say, hardship, has arisen for those people who received notice before 13th June. I feel that the responsibility is on the Government for that.</p>

<p>I am grateful to my hon. Friend for raising that point. He raised it on Second Reading, and I had intended to say a word or two on it on the Amendment. The position is this. As I pointed out in my Second Reading speech, a lease for the duration of the war is something which anybody can make, and has been able to make, in valid form, which is by making an agreement for a certain number of years, subject to the right to give notice at the end of the war. When the decision in Lace v. Chandler was published I remember thinking, "I wonder whether there are many cases, or any appreciable number of cases, in which people have failed, as did the parties here, to adopt a valid form to effect this result?" Because after all, if there have been practically no cases where an invalid form had been effected I do not think the House would have thought it right to legislate. The fact that we got practically no representations from anybody for a substantial period with regard to this decision rather led one to think there were very few cases which needed a Bill of this kind.<br/>
However, one had inquiries made into it at a fairly early stage and it turned out

that there were in our view quite enough cases&#x2014;and the experience of Members in all parts of the Committee supports this&#x2014;to make this a problem with which we had to deal. I am bound to say one or two people whose letters I have had complaining, and who are business people, I think might have helped us by writing rather sooner, and not waiting until after my announcement and have said, "We have a lease of this sort. Will you treat this as a matter of urgency?" We got substantially no representations until we set our own inquiries on foot. That is why prompt action was not taken. I quite agree that my hon. Friend is entitled to say that we should have moved a little more quickly, but everyone has a number of other things to deal with in these days. I think that some of the business companies and others who undoubtedly were affected by this might have assisted by bringing their cases before us so that we should have had evidence and we should not ourselves have to seek it out.</p>

<p>With the general observations of the hon. and learned Member for Carmarthen (Mr. Hughes) on the retrospective effect of legislation I am in complete agreement, but the question here is not whether the Bill should be retrospective or not. The question raised by the Amendment is whether the retrospective effect to 13th June shall be really effective or not, and it seems to me we are not doing very much to put the position right if we are to allow a notice given before 13th June, which may operate in December, still to be valid although neither party may have done anything under the notice whatsoever. I think that a case has been made out by the Attorney-General for retrospective legislation in this connection.<br/>
Lace v. Chandler made no new law. The law was known right from the start. Perhaps owing to war circumstances these leases and agreements were not properly drawn. I have little sympathy with people who have discovered they have entered into an agreement which should be binding on their conscience even if it is not binding in law and take advantage of that fact. If the Attorney-General could on reconsideration put in words which not only referred to the two categories I thought of but also to the third one he thought of and I did not, it seems to me we should put this matter right to


a very great extent. It may be there are other cases we cannot think of and certain other hardships. I for one feel quite satisfied that if that could be provided for these three categories then the retrospective effect of this Bill to the 13th June would be most effective. If that is not so provided it seems to me that as the people who want to get out of obligations had ample opportunity to do so between the decision and 13th June, this Bill may in fact prove of very little effect. I would ask the Attorney-General to reconsider the matter.</p>

<p>In answer to a Parliamentary Question which I addressed to him, the Home Secretary used these words:
<q>I ought to say that, according to my information, the number of such cases is extremely small."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 13th July; Vol. 40r, C. 1870.]</q>
I entirely disagree with my right hon. Friend. This institution of Parliament stands to protect the interests of the minority, as well as of the majority, and I rather regretted that my right hon. Friend, who is such a great Parliamentarian, should have used those words as an argument against the case that I was making. Let me give the background of the story which I am raising to-day on the Adjournment. As I understand, the position at present is that if a girl in the Services serving abroad has an illegitimate baby, even if it is proved that the father is a British subject, the child is not entitled to any nationality. Everyone with whom


I have discussed this position feels that it really is a most regrettable situation. I realise that I should at once run up against the rules of Order if I tried to discuss the law in this connection, but I want to ask my right hon. Friend if he cannot find some way, within the present law, to meet this quite intolerable position. I am certain that no one would like the unfortunate child to be the sufferer. The procedure is that when a girl has a baby she is subsequently sent home with her child, and then discharged. My right hon. Friend seemed to think that, as the child, or the parent of the child, could apply for its naturalisation at the age of 16, no real harm would be imposed on the child as a result of the present decision. I find myself in conflict with the Home Secretary on that point.<br/>
There are really two aspects of the situation. The first is that, by the time the child reaches the age of 16, the parent may have completely lost sight of the fact that the child has no nationality. That would be very easy to understand. Therefore, it is frightfully important that we should protect the interests of the child. One can well understand the position arising when, at the age of 16, or, if no naturalisation has been applied for, when the child reaches the age of 18 or 19, it might want to emigrate, or to take out an ordinary British passport to travel abroad. It might seek a livelihood by getting attached to a firm which had export interests, and the boy or girl might wish to go abroad. Then it would certainly discover that it had no nationality. I do not think we are justified in relying upon the parents to see that, at the age of 16, application is made to the Home Secretary for naturalisation.<br/>
My right hon. Friend took the view that no great harm would come to the child before the age of 16, but am I not right in raising this particular point? I do not know that this is true in regard to the whole of the Civil Service&#x2014;I think it is&#x2014;but I do know that, if, for instance, you want to enter the Post Office, you have to be the child of British parents. I am sure I am right in drawing attention to the fact that, if a child has no nationality and desires to sit for a Civil Service examination and enter the Post Office, it will not be permitted to do so. There is another point. There are certain educa-

tional advantages which might accrue to the child. It might sit for a scholarship, but one of the conditions often laid down is that the child must be of British parentage, and, therefore, I do not think the Minister is entitled to argue that a child will not be at any disadvantage until the age of 16.<br/>
The Home Secretary argued that I had no right&#x2014;he did it very nicely and semihumourously&#x2014;to enlist the War Office on my side. I am only too delighted to have the opportunity to enlist the sympathy of the War Office on my side, but let me put it this way. I happened to come across this specific fact about an illegitimate child when I was abroad, and it was raised by me with the Army authorities. Of course, when I was outside the boundaries of this island, I was not subject to the control of any Minister, whether the Secretary of State for War or the Home Secretary, but I realise that I put the Home Secretary in a difficult position when I raised the point. I am glad I was able to do so, because you have got to make use of everything and pit your wits against the Minister. It is a fact that those people who are responsible for Service girls were very perturbed about this position, and I naturally thought to myself, "Well, when I get home I shall only have to raise the matter with the Home Secretary to get his complete support." When I realised that I was not going to get his support, I very naturally, having confirmed in certain quarters that the War Office takes my view and not the Home Secretary's view, thought that here was a wonderful opportunity of bringing pressure to bear on the Home Secretary by quoting an important Government Department such as the War Office.<br/>
That is the whole story I have to tell. I am certain that no one in this country would like an innocent child to suffer, and I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will be able to find some way whereby he can assure the protection of the position of the child. With all the ability and brains in the Home Office, I cannot believe that we have to leave the regularisation of the position of a child, or its naturalisation, until the age of 16, having regard to all the unfortunate happenings that can come upon humanity unless their position is well safeguarded and protected. All I want to ask the Minister


is to see if there is some way to meet this position so that a child shall not suffer before reaching the age of 16, and to ensure that, when it is 16, automatically, application will be made for naturalisation.</p>

<p>The hon. Lady has raised this matter in a modest and charming way, if I may say so, and I am glad that her journey to China enabled her to enlist the support of the military authorities in the Middle East, if not the War Office, upon her side in this matter. The case which my hon. Friend puts is that of a very small number of illegitimate children who have been born to women members of His Majesty's Forces serving overseas. It is perfectly clear that, under the law of British nationality, which is contained in the Act of 1914, children born in these circumstances outside British territory are not British subjects. The first question one asks in relation to British citizenship is, "Where was this person born?" That is the guiding factor in the great majority of cases, and children born abroad are not, in the ordinary way, British subjects by birth. They are so if they are born of British parents and if they are the first generation born overseas, but an illegitimate child, in the eyes of the law, has no father, and therefore, in the eyes of the law, as laid down in the Statute, such a child born abroad cannot be a British subject by birth.<br/>
My right hon. Friend, obviously, cannot alter the law, nor would it be appropriate to discuss an alteration of the law on the Motion for the Adjournment; so we are bound to abandon that aspect of the case in this discussion. My hon. Friend asks, "Is there nothing which the Home Secretary can do in the administrative sphere?" I have looked into this matter with the greatest care, because these are cases which excite natural sympathy. In addition to defining who are British subjects by birth, the Act deals with the subject of naturalisation. The law as to naturalisation is contained in Part II of the Act, and the important Sections for the purpose we are discussing to-day are Sections 2 and 5. When Parliament passed the principal Act in 1914, they showed great faith in the Home Secretary, because they gave to the Secretary of State a very wide discretion, in

these terms. Section 5, Sub-section (2) says:
<q>The Secretary of State may, in his absolute discretion in any special case in which he thinks fit, grant a certificate of naturalisaton to any minor, whether or not the conditions required by this Act have been complied with.</q>
That is a very wide discretion which rests in the Home Secretary, but if hon. Members will consider the terms of Section 2, they will see the snag in Section 5. Section 2, Sub-section (4) says:
<q>A certificate of naturalisation shall not take effect until the applicant has taken the oath of allegiance.</q>
That is to say, you obtain your certificate from the Home Secretary, but it is of no legal effect until you have taken the Oath of Allegiance. Hon. Members will at once see that it is very difficult for a child of tender years to take the Oath of Allegiance, because, in the eyes of the law, a child of tender years is not capable of understanding the nature of an oath or of having an oath administered to it.</p>

<p>I am coming to that point. My right hon. Friend has, therefore, considered whether there is anything which he could possibly do in the administrative sphere to assist these children. I ought to say at this point that Regulations under the Act provide for the Oath of Allegiance being taken within a certain time of the issue of the certificate. Section 19 of the Act lays down that the Home Secretary may make Regulations with respect to the time within which the Oath of Allegiance has to be taken after the granting of a certificate of naturalisation, and the Regulations themselves prescribe that the Oath shall normally be taken within one month of the issue of the certificate, or, in special cases, during such longer period as the Home Secretary may direct.<br/>
It is clear that there is nothing which my right hon. Friend can do by any action upon his part which would have the effect of immediately conferring British nationality upon these children. But what my right hon. Friend can do, and what he is prepared to do in these wholly exceptional cases, is this. He is prepared, where the mother of the child is a British subject and is serving over-


seas in His Majesty's Forces at the time when the child is born, to issue a certificate of naturalisation, under Section 5, Sub-section (2). That certificate, it is true, will not be legally effective to confer British nationality upon the child until the child can itself take the Oath of Allegiance, but the child will be able to take the Oath of Allegiance before an age at which any disability would result through the absence of British citizenship.<br/>
The hon. Lady mentioned a number of points as regards which these children might be under a disability. It is clear that, if 16 was the age, then 16 is the age at which aliens have to be registered under the Aliens Act, and these children will, if they so desire, having obtained their certificates, be able to take the Oath of Allegiance before they reach the age of 16. Moreover, they will be able to take the Oath of Allegiance before they attain the age of 14, and the question of scholarships, which the hon. Lady raised, will be met in that way. I should not like at this stage, because this decision was only taken this afternoon, to say precisely at what age we shall be prepared to accept the swearing of the Oath by these children. It will be somewhere round about the ages of 12 to 14 years. That, I think, will meet any of the practical drawbacks from which these children would suffer as a result of their not having British nationality conferred upon them automatically at birth; and it will be an earnest of the intentions of the Home Office that we shall have given these children an absolute right, if they so desire, on attaining the years of discretion, when they understand the nature of an oath, of opting for, and obtaining, full British citizenship.</p>

<p>I am very grateful for what my right hon. Friend has said, but there is this difficulty. When the certificate of naturalisation is immediately issued, will there be a sort of automatic register, so that when a child reaches the age at which it can take the Oath of Allegiance, the responsibility will be imposed upon the Home Office to try and find out the whereabouts of the child and its parent so that the attention of the parent can be drawn to the case?</p>

<p>After the issue of a certificate, will a child be regarded as a British subject from the

point of view, say, of competing for an educational scholarship?</p>

<p>It is clear that these children Will not be British subjects by virtue of holding the certificate until they have taken the Oath of Allegiance. In response to the hon. Lady's question, the alternative to what I have suggested&#x2014;and I think I have gone a very long way towards satisfying her&#x2014;would have been to say that we would not entertain an application for naturalisation until the age of 12 or 14 years. That might have had the great drawback that many of these children possibly will not, in 12 or 14 years' time, know the circumstances of their birth. They may not even realise that they do not possess British citizenship, but by this means&#x2014;the method I have suggested&#x2014;they will hold a document which will serve to remind them that they have a right to become British subjects, but that there is the further step, that of taking the Oath of Allegiance, upon which they will automatically become British citizens. We shall have their names registered at the Home Office, but we do not undertake to find the children in 14 years' time and send them a reminder. The issue of the document to them at this stage will be their earnest that they can obtain British citizenship on their own behalf.</p>

<p>Would my right hon. Friend consider, in conjunction with the Service Departments, the possibility of the mother either being brought home to this country or being brought to some British territory before the birth of the child so that when the child is born difficulty might not arise at all?</p>

<p>I cannot answer for Service Departments. I believe that every precaution is taken to see that girls in a state of pregnancy do not go overseas, but, of course, accidents in this respect will happen. One or two of the solutions suggested to us in regard to this problem, I must say, seem to involve practical difficulties. One, was that the girls should be taken on to a British ship at the time of the birth of the child, and the other was that they should be conveyed to the British Embassy, but both of these seem to involve all sorts of practical considerations which would make it very difficult.<br/>
Question, "That this House do now adjourn," put, and agreed to.</p>
