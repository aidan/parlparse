<p>asked the Secretary of State for the Environment what is the present value of assets owned by the Transport Holding Company; whether he will publish a list in the OFFICIAL REPORT appropriately categorised; and, having divested itself of its holding in Skyways Limited, what further hiving-off operations he proposes to require it to make.</p>

<p>I refer my hon. Friend to the Transport Holding Company's Annual Report and Accounts for 1969 and to my reply to the hon. Member for Portsmouth, West (Mr. Judd) on 27th January.&#x2014;[Vol. 810, c. <i>131&#x2013;2.</i>]</p>

<p>I congratulate my right hon. Friend on proceeding with the denationalisation of the assets of this undertaking, but will he confirm that his recent statement regarding Thomas Cook &amp; Son represents a precursor in this respect and that it is his ultimate intention to divest himself of all the publicly owned assets in the undertaking named?</p>
</speech>

<p>Yes, Sir. Any legislation dealing with Thomas Cook would comprise also a provision to wind up the Transport Holding Company.</p>

<p>Does the right hon. Gentleman realise that, apart from Thomas Cook and the 38 per cent. holding in the Penarth Dock Company, there is not much left to hive off, and will he

say in which lots he proposes to offer Thomas Cook: will it be Thomas Cook, Lunn-Poly and the rest, or will he offer them separately?</p>

<p>My advice is that legislation is necessary in order to sell Thomas Cook because legislation was introduced originally to create the Transport Holding Company, the duty of which was to hold Thomas Cook. Since then, the Transport Holding Company was unwise enough to acquire Lunn-Poly, which, I am happy to say, can be disposed of without legislation.</p>

<p>What sort of private company does the right hon. Gentleman expect to purchase these normally profitable hived-off parts of nationalised industry? Will they be such shining examples of private enterprise efficiency as Rolls-Royce, Cammell Laird, Harland and Wolff or Mineral Securities?</p>

<p>asked the Secretary of State for the Environment whether he can now make a statement on his examination of rural transport services, in particular the licensing of private minibus services, with special reference to depletion of routes and services in South Worcestershire.</p>
</speech>

<p>The rural pilot studies and the examination of the licensing system are making good progress. In the meantime, local authorities already have powers to assist rural services, and where existing operators withdraw there is much greater scope for mini-bus operators and others to apply successfully for licences.</p>
</speech>

<p>But is not my hon. Friend aware that, because of the straitened state of their finances, many smaller local authorities are not in a position to devote funds to rescuing rural transport? Will he give an assurance that in areas like South Worcestershire, now almost denuded of bus services, he will, through the licensing authorities, encourage the employment of private enterprise mini-buses and any transport


of a kind likely to prove mutually rewarding to both passengers and the undertaking?</p>
</speech>

<p>I must tell my hon. Friend that the local authorities of Worcestershire, in financial difficulties though they may be, have agreed to support the rural services of Midland Red to the sum of &#x00A3;28,000. We are reviewing the licensing system to see whether more flexibility for mini-buses, among other things, can be achieved.</p>

<p>asked the Secretary of State for the Environment when he expects the reports from his two study groups investigating the problems of rural transport in the South of England.</p>

<p>No, Sir. We might learn something relevant. but the two inquiries are concerned with the rural aspect of the passenger transport problem. I accept that urban areas are by no means free of this exceedingly difficult and obstinate problem.</p>

<p>My right hon. Friend will be aware that when we have the reports we shall have had our third report on rural transport. The first was in 1935. Is not it time that action was taken on the matter and on the broadening of the licensing requirements?</p>
</speech>

<p>Will my right hon. Friend accept that there is a fundamentally different attitude among people in the South-East towards airports from that taken by people in the rest of the country, mainly because the South-East already has access to international airports, and will he look seriously at the site on Severnside which has been discussed as it is the only environmentally suitable site which will be within one hour of Central London by the time that advanced passenger trains are operating in 1978?</p>

<p>Is it not a fact that one of the reasons why people living around Heathrow are so hostile to aircraft noise is that the airport is unfortunately situated from the point of view of approach, so that aircraft approaching are compelled to fly over the populated areas of London? Will the right hon. Gentleman recognise the urgent need to reduce the amount of noise at and around Heathrow, and, whatever he proposes to do, will he make up his mind quickly, preferably in favour of an airport on the coast?</p>

<p>I am sure that the whole House is very grateful for that even more novel illustration of the new Government's policy, or lack of it.

<p>With permission, I would like to make a statement on the Post Office dispute.<br/>
When I reported to the House on Monday, the Post Office and the union were meeting following the Post Office's suggestion that the two sides should meet to discuss the possibility of finding measures to improve efficiency which would enable the Post Office's offer to be increased without adding to costs.<br/>
In these discussions, the Post Office tabled a proposal to increase its offer to 9 per cent. in return for a specific commitment by the union to action to increase efficiency.<br/>
The union's executive met the same day to consider this improved offer and rejected it, its negotiators having first tabled during the joint meeting a paper which specifically stated that the offer must be increased from 9 per cent. to 13 per cent. without any conditions whatsoever.<br/>
In its letter of rejection the union proposed that the two sides should have private meetings under the chairmanship of an independent mediator.<br/>
The Post Office came to see me yesterday, at its request, to report the position which had been reached. I also thought it right to invite the U.P.W. to see me, so that I could be fully informed of its position and in particular clarify with it the precise meaning of its proposal for a mediator. It explained to me that in its view the mediator would be empowered to attempt concilation but would have no authority to put forward any recommended settlement in the event of the parties failing to agree. At the union's request, I then conveyed to the Post Office the explanation which the union had given me of its conception of the mediator's r&#x00F4;le.<br/>
The Post Office representatives then left me in order to consider their decision with their colleagues and, as the House will

know, they announced late last night that they were unable to accept the union's proposal on the ground that they could not see how mediation of the type suggested could resolve the difference on amount and on the question of productivity. The Post Office reiterated its view that arbitration remained the right course for resolving the dispute, but the union has since reaffirmed its refusal to consider arbitration.<br/>
In the circumstances, I regret to have to inform the House that the deadlock continues.</p>

<p>Is the right hon. Gentleman aware that the unyielding attitude of the Corporation has only succeeded in stiffening the determination of the postal workers to continue their action, and that the country, therefore, now faces an indefinite strike, with increasing dislocation of private and commercial convenience? Is he also aware that Mr. Ryland has made it pretty clear that he is prepared to pay more, if only somebody would tell him to do so. [HON. EMBERS: "Oh."]<br/>
Is the right hon. Gentleman aware that it is useless for him to continue to say that the union ought to go to arbitration in a situation in which no clear wages policy has been worked out by the new Corporation to take the place of the Civil Service pay principles under which these workers used to be dealt with, and that when the right hon. Gentleman tells the House that other Post Office unions have gone to arbitration he is failing to point out that the union concerned, the Association of Post Office Executives, has made it clear that it has gone to arbitration in a very different situation, where the pay claim was being dealt with on a Civil Service basis, and that the association has made it clear that it supports the Union of Post Office Workers, the postal workers, in refusing to go to arbitration where no clear criteria have yet been laid down?<br/>
In view Of this&#x2014;[HON. MEMBERS: "Too long."]&#x2014;in view of this, have not the Government a clear and urgent public duty to break this deadlock by the personal conciliation efforts of the right hon. Gentleman really bringing the two sides together and trying to find a settlement, or by the appointment of an independent mediator, or by setting up a court of inquiry?</p>

<p>The union over the weekend has reduced its claim from 19 per cent.&#x2014;I think of that order&#x2014;to 13 per cent. So both sides have not been unyielding, but the gap is still very big, and the union has been at least as unyielding as the Post Office on certain matters&#x2014;for example, on its attitude to arbitration and on its complete refusal to discuss any increase in the offer with any conditions attached to it whatsoever in relation to productivity; on that the union has been utterly unyielding so far. The right hon. Lady referred to Mr. Ryland being prepared to pay more if anyone would tell him to do so. That is completely incorrect. What Mr. Ryland has said all along is that he and his colleagues do not believe that their existing offer of 8 per cent.&#x2014;or rather, the total cost of their existing 8 per cent.

offer&#x2014;can be increased without their having to ask for yet further increases in postal charges which they do not think there ought to be, not only from the public's point of view but from the point of view of their own industry because of the effect any increase might have in causing a decline in their business. He has, however, said all along that, since he was a party to an arbitration agreement, he would be prepared to go to arbitration and abide by it even though it went against him and he had to ask for increased charges. The union will not accept arbitration. I cannot accept the arguments of the right hon. Lady because, if they are valid, why did the union sign the arbitration agreement as recently as last August? Had this been a long-standing arbitration which had been brought with the Post Office from its previous incarnation under different circumstances, there might possibly be something in that, but the union signed the agreement last August in full knowledge of the conditions.</p>

<p>Is my right hon. Friend aware that many of us feel that if there had been a secret ballot before the dispute the strike would never have taken place? Can he tell us whether any machinery exists whereby there could now be a vote on either the original offer of 8 per cent. or the revised offer of 9 per cent. with strings, so that the rank and file voice of the postal workers could be heard?</p>

<p>No precise machinery exists for that, although Mr. Jackson has in the past put an offer on ballot to his membership and has spoken of the possibility of doing so on this occasion when he has an offer which he is prepared to recommend. So far there has been no question of it, nor is there any automatic machinery available for balloting the membership on the offer as it stands at the moment.</p>

<p>If it is inevitably a matter of speculation whether a meeting under an independent mediator might produce progress, is it not nevertheless the case that it could not possibly do any harm? Since anything is preferable to deadlock, will not the right hon. Gentleman suggest to Mr. Ryland that at least it is worth a shot? If it cannot do any harm, it might just do some good.</p>

<p>The view of the Post Office, as I understand, is that the discussions have been so long and the gap is so great, not only about the amount but about the attitude to tying anything to productivity, that the Post Office needs the help of somebody who, in addition to conciliating, can make recommendations and decisions. This is part of the gap between the two parties. My services and the services of my Department have been available, are available and will be available.</p>

<p>Mr. Ryland may be afraid of getting the sack, as his predecessor did, if he gives way. I am mystified about the r&#x00F4;le of the Minister of Posts and Telecommunications. Could not he be made redundant and his salary paid to the pool to assist the poor oppressed postal workers?</p>

<p>Is it a fact that the Post Office during the course of this dispute has lost revenue in excess of &#x00A3;13 million which, had it not been so lost, would have enabled the Corporation to concede an additional increase of 5 per cent. or 6 per cent. to the Post Office workers? Could he tell the House what scale of loss we must reach before the Minister who is politically responsible for this Department decides to intervene?</p>

<p>I am not sure what the lion. Member means in the last part of his Question, because he seems to forget that, not through the action of this Government, but through the action of his own Government, this is now an independent Corporation. My right hon. Friend can no doubt be questioned about his powers in relation to that when appropriate, but it is certainly not a matter for me. As to the first part of the question, this is one of the tragedies in a strike, on both sides. On the one hand, the workers involved feel sufficiently strongly to forgo a lot of earnings because they believe it is so important. Equally, the employer is prepared to do likewise, and that is why strikes are such serious matters and why, thank Goodness, they do not normally arise in any official, serious way on this scale. This happens when both sides take deep positions to which, whatever may be the rights and wrongs of the situation, they hold very strongly</p>

<p>Is my right hon. Friend aware that only yesterday the Chancellor reaffirmed that the Wilberforce settlement of 10&#x00B7;9 per cent., taken at its best, was not to be regarded as representing a norm? If the Post Office does go beyond 9 per cent., with a general


settlement of say, 10 per cent., would it not be regarded as a norm to be applied across the whole field and make the inflationary process catastrophic?</p>

<p>The Wilberforce inquiry stressed very strongly that the electricity workers were a special case because of their productivity. What matters from the overall economic point of view&#x2014;and this is what causes some of the difficulty and confusion about figures&#x2014;for the industry is the addition to the wage costs of the industry. The reason why movement is much more possible in the electricity industry at the moment is because of the ongoing introduction of well-founded incentive bonus schemes. It is possible in that industry for people to add substantially to their personal earnings while making much smaller additions to the overall labour costs of the industry. In the Post Office it is not so easy. This was also the basis of the Post Office negotiations at the weekend. While it could not add to the total amount involved in its previous 8 per cent. offer, it said that it would be prepared to seek ways and means of making that more in individual terms if it could be offset through efficiency which would reduce the total additions to labour costs to what was originally offered.</p>

<p>Is it not significant that the Post Office chose last weekend, at the height of the strike, to release to the Press its long-term plans for wrecking the postal services, including the gradual abolition of all postal deliveries to houses and therefore the complete abolition of all postmen? Is that not an indication of its intention not merely of starving them but of trying to frighten the postmen back to work?</p>

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. I ask your assistance in a matter which has caused me some difficulty. On six occasions over recent weeks, I have applied for an Adjournment debate. Last week, I was successful. I was allotted the Adjournment debate last night. On yesterday's Order Paper there were four separate Bills sponsored by the Government falling to be discussed in the course of the day. I waited throughout the discussion on the first Bill, made certain inquiries about the progress of business, and discovered that we were likely to spend several hours on the other matters. However, the Committee having completed its discussions on the first Bill, the Government, without any warning to me, withdrew without notice the rest of the day's business, whereupon the House adjourned, I not being in my place to open the Adjournment debate. [HoN. MEMBERS: "Where were you?"] I hear the bawdy cries from the benches opposite asking where I was.</p>

In response to the bawdy cries which came from the benches opposite just now, I say only that were I to be denied the possibility of raising this


matter, which is important to my constituents, I should have to take a different attitude to other matters which might come from the Government in the future.</p>

<p>I wish to express my opposition to the provisions contained in the Clause. In doing so, I hope that it will be appreciated that Clauses 85, 86 and 87 are inter-related. I shall make every endeavour not to stray into any discussion of the merits of the other two, but I hope that the Committee will bear with me if I find it necessary to refer to them indirectly.<br/>
Clause 86 contains provisions which, if accepted by the Committee, can only result in the deep resentment of all trade unionists. The philosophy has long been accepted amongst trade unionists that they have the right to indicate their support to fellow trade unionists who are engaged in a dispute and that, from time to time, they have also the right to translate their support into action. There have been many instances of it recently.<br/>
As the Clause is drafted at present, it raises a number of points which I hope that the Solicitor-General will clarify. For example, when the word "contemplation" is used in relation to the furtherance of a dispute, I believe that it refers directly to a sympathetic strike or action of any kind which is taken by one group of work people in support of another. As the Clause is drafted, it would deny to trade unionists the ability to give immediate and spontaneous


support to colleagues who were engaged in any dispute against an employer.<br/>
Sympathetic action of this kind takes many forms. I have no doubt that from time to time those excellent trade unionists who sit on the benches opposite will have indicated their own support for their fellow trade unionists engaged in industrial disputes, though I will not quote the instances about which I know.<br/>
It is not only important to reserve the right to indicate that support. It is also important to a trade unionist that he should continue to enjoy the right to withdraw his labour on grounds of conscience or loyalty or because he feels that at some later time he may be involved in a similar dispute or even the same dispute.<br/>
When trade unionists take sympathetic action of this kind, they are indicating to those involved in the dispute, especially the employers, that they will not co-operate and perform tasks which normally would be carried out by those already involved in the dispute. In an earlier debate, my hon. Friend the Member for Darlington (Mr. Ted Fletcher) referred to an example which perhaps I might pursue. He told the Committee of a case involving toilets, and the placing of a time book on a table outside the toilets in which women employees had to register. Suppose that the male workers in that factory decided to support their female colleagues and told the management that the conditions which had been imposed upon the female employees were intolerable. Suppose, further, that they gave notice that they intended to join the dispute at some time in the future. Would that be regarded as the furtherance of the dispute? Would it be a threatening attitude, would it be aiding, would it he abetting? What classification would be attached to such circumstances? I suggest that in all cases any one of those provisions could be applied.<br/>
Anyone who refused to act in any way detrimental to his colleagues&#x2014;silence can often be detrimental to a man's colleagues&#x2014;could be brought within the ambit of furtherance of a dispute, of aiding, or of abetting. No doubt careful perusal of the language of Clause 86 would bring to light many more legitimate charges which could be brought against a man.<br/>
We have knowledge that there are practices which black certain operations, products, supplies and services because of an industrial dispute. If this is done as hitherto when the Bill is passed&#x2014;God knows, I pray that it will not be passed&#x2014;then blacking will be an offence.<br/>
I shall illustrate a hypothetical case. If the long-distance lorry drivers of the Transport and General Workers Union were asked to take messages and mail from point A to point B and any one driver were to say, "No, this would normally go by post; it has not been the custom and practice hitherto to do this and therefore I will not, because I shall be interfering with an industrial dispute", and the employer insists that the change of practice must be accepted, what would happen? If that driver refused, could he individually be accused of an offence? If any of his colleagues in the same area working for the same employer&#x2014;perhaps even accompanying drivers on their lorries&#x2014;took action, what would happen? As the Clause is drafted, no doubt there would be a grave potential danger for such persons in terms of being accused of an offence.<br/>
The general unions and the craft unions have different sections. The general unions cover many industrial occupations. If there were any cross-supplies or services which seemed to go over an area in which one section of workers was involved, what would happen if another section of workers belonging to the same union were to take the stance that, under no circumstances, would they make any contribution which was detrimental to their fellow trade unionists? If craftsmen, who take pride in their craft, decide that certain things should not be done, either because of hazard or safety, or other things of which they are justly proud, and demand that certain practices be deplored and discontinued, again no doubt in that setting charges could be made. Many consequential things could overflow into areas of associated and ancillary workers who may respond in this situation by resentment and resistance.<br/>
The words
<q>to take or threaten to take</q>
are ambiguous. They can mean almost anything. They can be made to fit any situation not specifically dealt with in the Bill. This provision gives a wide range of application to employers when dealing


with situations which might emerge, but which, by definition, might be blurred in relation to furtherance of a dispute, aiding or abetting.<br/>
Attitudes of non-co-operation can be made to appear as threatening. Even a discussion to consider informing an employer that the employees will not co-operate could be interpreted as a threat. If a number of people get together and draft a statement which they have duplicated and circulated to their colleagues, a similar situation would arise.<br/>
What does "aiding" mean? What does "abetting" mean? What does "financing" mean? It would appear that by a personal or corporate contribution, by finance or by support, aiding, abetting or financing could be brought into play. Even a meeting called to discuss an industrial dispute and a decission to make a collection to send to some special fund to alleviate hardship could come under aiding, abetting or financing. I have no doubt that with the versatility of those engaged in the legal profession, including the hon. and learned Gentleman, even procuring might eventually appear in the charge&#x2014;<i>[Interruption.]</i> I make this point quite sincerely. I hope that this will be taken on board and looked at very carefully.<br/>
4.15 p.m.<br/>
Any direct or indirect support or any observations intended perhaps to be advisory could be caught by Clause 86. Even Members of Parliament who might be asked to attend a strike meeting in relation to the Post Office workers, if they advise that under the circumstances, because of statements made from both sides&#x2014;<i>[Interruption.]</i> I will develop this further, because I think that I am right.<br/>
Clause 86 refers to "aiding" and Clause 85 refers to an industrial dispute, but Clause 86 is not clarified. I think that it has been deliberately framed in that way. In Clause 87 reference is made to "section 86(2)", which can catch within the net, if so desired, those who attend an industrial dispute who are not members of the union or are not involved in the industry or trade. In certain circumstances, it could be said that they contributed both financially and in terms of advice. Members of Parliament could be placed in that situation. If the Bill

were applicable now, no doubt I could be held to have been in contempt of it last Monday when I attended a meeting of the Post Office workers.<br/>
Many points emerge under these headings. If I were to write for any trade union journal&#x2014;at the moment I am the Chairman of the Parliamentary Group of the Transport and General Workers Union&#x2014;or to make public comment which was printed and circulated in the union journal&#x2014;after listening to some of the exchanges today, I might be tempted to make a categoric statement and give advice to the postmen to take a certain course of action&#x2014;I should be in contravention of Clause 86.<br/>
The Bill is stifling freedom. It is depriving trade unionists of the one asset which they prize above all others&#x2014;namely, that in certain circumstances and according to the needs of the situation they can go to the aid of their colleagues. Refusal to act under such circumstances might bring a wealth of attribution at some later date, particularly if they are members of the same trade union.<br/>
I have no doubt that the Solicitor-General in his legal capacity from time to time would feel obliged, though not necessarily in absolute agreement, to render support, oral or in any other form, to some of his colleagues in the legal profession. It is not so long ago that I read criticism of one of my right hon. and learned Friends in relation to a case before a court. I noticed that a right hon. and learned Gentleman on the other side of the Chamber immediately sprang to the defence of his professional colleagues and said that everything that was done was perfectly and rightly done. But under the Clause, if any trade unionists were to so print and proclaim, there is no doubt that there could be charges. There would not always be these charges, but it would leave the opportunity for them to be made. That would be to the detriment of industrial relations and, at the end of the day, we would not contribute one whit to understanding but would build up a resentment from which there would be no escape at any time.<br/>
The phrase "short of a strike" can mean anything. Either one comes under the category of subsection 2<i>(a),</i> or the rest of it comes under subsection 2<i>(b).</i> This is an all-embracing Bill, trying to create for the first time an offence for


anybody acting in any way, or purporting to act in any way, in support of any colleague in any situation of industrial dispute. It would go further than a denial of freedom. It would make virtual prisoners of trade unionists in certain industrial circumstances. Again, it will not always happen, but the opportunity will be there. The Clause tries to take away the right of free assembly, freedom of action and freedom of objective support by whatever means are used, by language, literature, radio, television or other media.<br/>
Concerted action under Clause 86(2)<i>(b)</i> can be a problem. If I believed that goods, services or supplies from an industry in which there is an industrial dispute should not be purchased or supported by myself, my friends, my relatives, or my colleagues in the House, and I were to join with them and plan a campaign in which we would indicate our resistance to the purchase of such goods or services, we should be in contravention of the Clause.<br/>
I am not worried that an answer could be given today that what I have suggested could happen would be far from the realities. I am still concerned that the Bill will be the basis for case law, which has a peculiar way of turning in opposite directions. I call in aid the Gaming Act, 1963, to support that proposition. No one on either side of the Committee would support some of the case law which flows from that.<br/>
The hon. Member for Southampton, Test (Mr. James Hill) referred yesterday to the Liverpool dock situation last year and the year before. I wish to correct some misimpressions and misunderstandings which might have flowed from what he said. The port employers and the National Port Employers Association met the trade unions concerned. After intensive discussions, the port employers suggested that their offer was a reasonable basis on which recommendations could be made. The leadership of the negotiating team accepted that it was an appropriate time to convey that offer to those working in the dock system. They did not come to an agreement. They said, "All right, we will take the offer back". They did so.<br/>
Once the operatives in the dock system heard the recommendations, they rejected them. When I say "they", they are the

trade union. It is not a leader or a single person. Each member is the trade union and corporately he forms it. They said to their servant, the leader who represented them, "This offer is not good enough. Please go back and tell the Employers Association that we reject it." Strange to relate, when that was done a better offer was immediately made and was accepted within 24 hours. But a long time had elapsed with consultations, taking the offer back to the men and with public meetings so that the recommendation could be explained in detail. The decision was from the members. I hope that we can discount that situation as enumerated by the hon. Member for Southampton, Test.<br/>
Clauses 86, 85 and 87 are intended for one purpose only. There are many aspects of that purpose. I have briefly indicated a few. They are meant to destroy the solidarity and unity of the trade unions. They are meant to divide and to rule. Anyone who says different has not read Clause 86.</p>

<p>When I entered the House of Commons I did not expect to contribute to a debate on industrial relations. But for two years I was responsible for probably one of the largest industries run by this or any Government&#x2014;the Royal Dockyards. Week by week I would chair meetings of the Whitley Council, and discuss industrial problems in one of the better environments for discussing them which exist in this country. Much criticised at times, the Whitley system still has a genuine method of consultation.<br/>
We are discussing a fundamental principle, for lines 4 and 5 of the Clause go right to the root of much that we on this side of the Committee find abhorrent in this legislation. If one went outside the House of Commons, one would find on a superficial questioning that quite a number of people would say that we should ban sympathy strikes. I do not claim that sympathy strikes are very popular. But those people do not face up to the logic of the principle which is under attack, which is the principle of collectivism, the principle of people being able to join together freely to exert pressure for their rights.<br/>
We have seen that principle attacked through the closed shop. We have seen it now attacked in some firms, as I hope


I shall be able to illustrate. The Government are attacking the only way in which some trade unionists can protest effectively.<br/>
The biggest Royal Dockyard is in my constituency, and there are three other major dockyards. It is not clear to me whether, if, which I hope will not arise, strike action was taken in Devonport Dockyard, under the Clause anybody in the three other dockyards would be prohibited from taking any other action.</p>

<p>That does not make any difference. The hon. Gentleman should know that it makes no difference. If we were dealing with sympathy action, unofficial strikes, at least a case could be made. Whether I agree with that or not I do not intend to go into. But certainly the most serious thing is that this is a threat of an official strike. If the dockyards went on strike, it would probably be an official strike. With this industry I had two pressures on me. One was when I was the employer negotiating with the unions, on productivity deals and union pay rates; and the other was an input from my constituents who were most affected.<br/>
4.30 p.m.<br/>
In those circumstances, if the right to take sympathetic action in Rosyth, Portsmouth and Chatham is removed, the workload could be rearranged and strikes could be broken simply by sending ships which needed repair to a different area. I therefore hope that the Solicitor-General will give us a clear answer as to whether workers are affected if a strike is taking place in the same industry but in a different part of the country. The logic would seem to be that there cannot be sympathy strikes within the same industry and under the same employer.<br/>
The next case to which I want to draw attention is the strike which has been taking place at the Fine Tubes factory in my constituency. This must be one of the longest strikes on record in Britain. I hope that I can illustrate why in this instance the refusal to allow sympathy action could be devastating to the power of the unions negotiating in this circumstance. I shall not go too deeply into

the merits of the strike, but the Committee should know the sequence of events.<br/>
One of the problems in the strike is that we have not been able to get the two sides to discuss at all. The management of Fine Tubes has resolutely refused to discuss the situation with the strikers. Few people will deny that this is probably never defensible. There are always two sides to any dispute and it is important that management should listen to the other side.</p>

<p>I will come to the role of the D.E.P. in this matter, because there are certain major illogicalities about the Department's position.<br/>
The situation goes back to 9th December, 1969, when negotiations started in the Fine Tubes factory for a substantial pay rise. These were concluded&#x2014;I think I had better say "terminated"&#x2014;on 3rd June in a total failure. I give credit to the management, but that it fulfilled the York agreement, but this was common at that time throughout the country. Many manufacturers, to retain any degree of parity, were going well above that Agreement; and I do not think that it was ever disputed that the unions had a formidable case at that time for a greater rise than was offered.<br/>
Anyhow, on 15th June, 1970, in the midst of the election, 172 men and women withdrew their labour at 2.30 p.m. Soon after this the strike was made official by both the A.E.F. and the Transport and General Workers' Union.<br/>
Next in the sequence of events an ultimatum was sent to the 172 strikers on 30th June, 1970 to return to work the next day or be sacked. They did not return to work; and in consequence they were sacked. The Department of Employment and Productivity has taken the view that these people were legally sacked&#x2014;that the employers acted properly thereafter in that they paid sickness and holiday pay; so these people were considered to be sacked.<br/>
Then we came to the question whether in this case the Department of Employment and Productivity was to offer the facilities of the Department to fill the gap left by the 172 people who had been sacked. This is a very serious issue. The


Department has used its facilities to fill these vacancies.</p>

<p>My case is that at present throughout the country people are involved in sympathy action with the Fine Tube strikers and this is probably the most classic case of factory workers being involved in sympathy action with their fellow trade unionists up and down the country. In fairness to the Committee I thought that I should give the background before dealing with what sympathy action has been taken, how all this affects the Department of Employment and Productivity, and how this affects crucially the unions' bargaining position if the power to take sympathy strikes is withdrawn.<br/>
With respect to you, Sir Robert, I think that this is relevant to the whole question. There is a terrible tendency to talk in generalities. We are dealing with a detailed situation in a small factory where an employer has sacked people, where people are on strike, and where sympathy action is being taken by their fellow workers throughout the country. If the Bill becomes law in the summer, that strike will be seriously affected.</p>

<p>I respect your Ruling, Sir Robert, and I will do my best to comply with it.<br/>
There having been this sequence of events, the Fine Tube strikers were faced with the problem that they could exert influence only away from Plymouth. As the Department of Employment and Productivity had used its facilities and as Plymouth is an area where there is relatively high unemployment, it was not difficult to fill the vacancies; so the factory went on to production. Yet the men went on strike. As this was an official strike, they used their facilities&#x2014;</p>

<p>I have tried to tell the Committee about that, and it raises the point that the Chair has raised. It is important to give the facts. The strike is about wages. I have been in fairly continual consultation with the Minister of State, Department of Employment. I am one of the few people who can speak to both unions and management, and I have tried not to exacerbate the position. I have tried to get them round the consultation table. The hon. Gentleman will find that his colleague at the Department knows the facts of the situation. I do not think that there is any dispute&#x2014;I will gladly withdraw what I have said if it is found that I am wrong&#x2014;about the fact that the Department has used its facilities. It sent inspectors in to find whether there had been any contravention of the law. It used its facilities. In consequence, the factory is producing.<br/>
The trade unionists felt that the only way in which they could genuinely push their claim in the circumstances was to black work coming from the Fine Tubes Factory. It is a tribute to the trade union movement that it has been successful in various parts of the country in ensuring that this very delicate tubing did not go out of the factory and was not accepted in other areas. There is argument as to the effectiveness of the blacking action, but it took place and is continuing to take place. Further, those who are still on strike maintain that it is vital in their interests.</p>

<p>Will the hon. Gentleman make clear how this can arise on the Clause? He has just told my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary that the strike was about wages and was, therefore, a perfectly ordinary, normal, fair subject of strike action. There is nothing in the Bill which in any way seeks to restrain the calling of a strike for that purpose. So the original strike is not itself unfair. I am trying to find out how any strikes called in support of it are said to be caught by the Clause.</p>

<p>The Clause contains these words:

<p>Let us listen to the argument first. If I understand the argument, the hon. Gentleman argues that sympathetic action is banned only if the original strike was unfair. So sympathetic action can be taken if a strike is judged not to be unfair. I hope that the Solicitor-General will be straightforward about this. In June, when the Bill becomes law, if the workers at Fine Tubes are still taking strike action, and sympathetic strike action is continuing, with the blacking of work coming out of Fine Tubes, that will not be affected by what I have understood the Bill to mean as regards sympathetic action. Is that right?</p>

<p>It is most important that this point should be clearly understood. Clause 86 is about industrial action in support of an unfair industrial practice. If the primary strike, to put it in that way, in other words, the Fine Tubes strike, is a fair matter and not one which is in any way restrained or curtailed by the Bill, secondary or sympathetic strike action in support of that fair primary dispute is not in any way restricted.</p>

<p>I am intervening to try to help the Committee on the scope of this Clause. If dockyards help one another by switching work from one yard to another, they are all either involved in the same primary dispute under Clause 87 or they are taking supporting action under Clause 87 so that strikes against such work-switched dockyards would also not be unfair under Clause 87. But in the context of Clause 86, if the primary strike is fair, to use borrowed strength in support of sympathetic action remains equally fair.</p>

<p>This elucidation helps me so long as the Solicitor-General will not take a different position on Clause 87. However, I remain anxious, because of our difficulty in having to select a specific Clause for debate. I felt that the general principle of banning sympathetic action outright was in issue on Clause 86. I shall listen to the debate with interest, but from the words of the SolicitorGeneral&#x2014;this is an important principle for the strikers to whom I have referred, and I am glad to have brought it out under Clause 86&#x2014;I seem to understand that, if their strike is not considered to be an unfair strike, that is, it is considered to be a fair practice, and it is an official strike, if they can persuade their fellow trade unionists to take sympathetic action that will not be banned under either Clause 86 or Clause 87.</p>

<p>I hope that I shall be thought to be doing my best to help the Committee in interpreting the Clauses, and I want there to be no misunderstanding about this. The hon. Gentleman the Member for Salford, West (Mr. Orme) has raised a question about Clause 87. Clause 87 imposes a specific narrow restriction on secondary strike action. [HON. MEMBERS: "Yes."] It can be debated separately from Clause 86. Clause 87 is directed at the inducing of strike action intended to procure breach of specific commercial contracts, other than contracts of employment, if these contracts are being broken by people who are innocent of and extraneous to the original dispute.</p>

<p>Secondary action, but only if it is taken against someone who is not a party to the original dispute, who is innocent of it, and who has taken no action to support the primary employer. The dockyard point, therefore, is covered, for two reasons, because every dockyard, if it takes switched work, is involved in supporting action, quite apart from the fact that it may well be a party under the same management.<br/>
In Clause 86, however, which is what the Committee is now debating, the intention is limited to supporting secondary sympathetic strikes which are in support of action which is itself unfair. It is no wider than that.</p>

<p>I think that the hon. and learned Gentleman is helping me somewhat on the dockyard question, but I am still uncertain about Fine Tubes. I see a different issue of principle here. One recognises that the Atomic Energy Authority, one of the factories concerned with blacked work, and parts of the aircraft industry at Bristol similarly affected, are not themselves deeply involved, but the workers there are involved because they are members of the A.E.F. and the Transport and General Workers' Union.<br/>
If those workers freely and democratically&#x2014;the Solicitor-General may feel it necessary to impose a procedure to satisfy himself that the decision is taken freely and democratically&#x2014;take sympathetic action on the basis of collectivism, on the

basis of union solidarity, what will the position be?<br/>
When the situation was considered by the Donovan Commission, it referred to the judgment of Lord Herschell in 1898 to the effect that the right of anyone to pursue his trade or employment without "molestation" or "obstruction" is a branch of the wider right of anyone to do any lawful act he chooses without molestation or obstruction, and he could not, therefore, entertain the proposition that an act not otherwise wrongful becomes so if it interferes with another's trade or employment.<br/>
As I understand lines 4 and 5 of Clause 86, it is in direct contravention of Lord Herschell's judgment in 1898. The Solicitor-General implied that the limitations which he puts on sympathetic action in Clause 87 are narrow and specific. We shall listen with interest. I realise, Sir Robert, that you would not wish us to go into Clause 87 now, although I feel that this puts us in some difficulty because of its relationship with Clause 86.</p>

<p>With reference to the Fine Tubes question and not other matters, it seems to me that the Solicitor-General is saying that there is a narrow contradiction between the two Clauses. By his comment, he acknowledges that there is a contradiction there on this narrow point. I do not agree&#x2014;I imagine that my hon. Friends will take the same view and I consider that there is a much wider contradiction, but at the moment we have the admission from the hon. and learned Gentleman that there is a narrow contradiction between the two Clauses.</p>

<p>What concerns me is the way these things work out on the ground, how they work in Fine Tubes, for example. There is a tendency for us here to legislate on principle and not to follow the logic down to how people are affected on the ground. I take again the case of Fine Tubes. A man has been on strike. A man has been encouraged to help by sympathetic action. Ever since the strike took place, there has been a test case about whether these workers, because they were sacked, were eligible for unemployment benefit. This has been consistently refused. It has been refused even to a man in my constituency who has given up strike pay voluntarily and


taken the opportunity to undergo an electrical course. He has been refused unemployment benefit, and, with all the commitments which he has, he now has to bring up a family on &#x00A3;9&#x00B7;05 a week. Again, the Department of Employment and Productivity has intervened decisively on the side of the employer, as the Government now threaten to do in banning sympathetic action.<br/>
I return to the general principle. It is small factories that are most affected by any ban on sympathetic action. The labour force can be made up that much more easily, as has been done in Fine Tubes. If a factory has done that and is getting its work out, the only influence the unions can bring to bear on the management is sympathetic action at the outlet.</p>

<p>If the Department is interpreting the law in the narrow sense of saying that men are on strike and therefore cannot have unemployment benefit, it cannot have it both ways, and it should not give the facilities of the Department to the management to obtain labour. What I am upset about is the illogicality of the application of the existing law. The Department is putting people involved in a serious strike that has gone on since June in the position of being threatened by not having the ability to take sympathetic action. Yet as I understand it the Solicitor-General now says that it is all right for them to take sympathetic action in the circumstances.</p>

<p>I listened with great interest to what the Solicitor-General said. But the important thing in the Clause is the phrase
<q>anything which by virtue of this Act is an unfair industrial practice".</q>
It then goes on to subsection (2). In Clause 87 we have the point that my hon. Friends the Members for Salford, West (Mr. Orme) and Tottenham (Mr. Atkinson) raised, which drags the Clause into Clause 86. The narrow point that the Solicitor-General made is not covered because Clause 87 covers Clause 86 precisely.</p>

<p>That is exactly the point I have been trying to make. I realise that this poses a difficulty for the Chair, but we cannot debate the principle embraced in Clause 86 without being cognisant of the small print which comes afterwards, and which so often in the Bill is the most important part.</p>

<p>On a point of order. Surely there is a clear distinction between the two Clauses. I have great sympathy with what the hon. Gentleman says. Clause 86 is based on a strike which is originally fair, which is not an unfair industrial practice. That is not the case with Clause 87.</p>

<p>I think that I can dispose of the matter to everyone's satisfaction right away. Passing references to Clause 87 are not only in order but seem to me to be essential if we are to understand what we are talking about. But let us not go into detail on Clause 87.</p>

<p>This helps the Committee, Sir Robert. It is clear from what the Solicitor-General said that he should now clarify his position in relation to my point, embracing Clause 87 as well as Clause 86. I think that the hon. and learned Gentleman wants to help the Committee.<br/>
We are concerned with a situation that deeply affects many men. For 90 people to have maintained a strike since June on very limited pay in a time of increasing prices shows that they feel that they have right on their side. I know that there are two interpretations of the strike, and they are very worried about the effect the Clause might have if they maintain their position and their solidarity after this Measure is passed. I hope that the Solicitor-General will intervene on the interpretation he has now given. I think that most hon. Members feel that it is this in the circumstances I have outlined. The Department still considers it to be a strike, and will not pay unemployment benefit, and does not accept that the workers were sacked at the end of June or early in July. The interpretation is that under the Bill there is nothing to stop sympathetic action continuing to help this isolated case, which was basically a fair strike.


I have raised other points, but not to go into them in detail, The Department must consider its position with great seriousness. I have written to it and have had conversations with people in it. They seem to be taking sides in the dispute somewhat unfairly.<br/>
We return to the principle. If the Solicitor-General interprets Clause 87 as narrowly as he seemed to do, then, though I still do not like it, the position is clearly much improved. I do not think that anyone would deny that. But we are very suspicious that that will not he the case. After all, one of the problems about the Bill is that it will be interpreted by lawyers. What people in the country do not realise is that we are making law, not just stating vague principles. It is the actual wording of Clauses 86 and 87 that will affect people's attitudes throughout the country.<br/>
Much has been said by hon. Members opposite about their aim to strengthen trade unions. They say that the Bill is not an attack on trade unions, that it is to be an attack on bad management as much as on other aspects. But the root of the Bill is the continued attack on the principle of collectivism. I urge the Secretary of State in particular to look at-this. He has managed a large indust<ob/>y and knows the problems. Some of us on this side have had the privilege of managing large industries. We know that over the years immense benefits have come from strong trade unions, from individuals grouping together to take collective action.<br/>
I do not want to discuss the closed shop principle again, but the time when I was most involved with this was when I was negotiating probably the largest productivity deal ever negotiated by a Government Department, with industrial workers in the dockyards. The whole question came up, and I am glad to say that the managers of all the dockyards saw the benefit of a closed shop and exerted as much pressure as they felt they could for it. I was prepared to concede that no newcomer to the dockyard should be allowed who was not prepared to join a union. The question of sympathetic action is just as much a fundamental principle. There are cases where to deprive a union of the ability to take sympathetic action, particularly

cases such as I have described of small factories in areas of high unemployment, which can easily fill up with blackleg labour, means a major emasculation of trade union powers, it is an emasculation which hits again at the principle of people combining.<br/>
The Solicitor-General has given a very interesting interpretation. He said that it is a narrow interpretation and implied that in the circumstances I have outlined neither Clause 87 nor Clause 86 would stop sympathetic action taking place. If that is not the case, he should clarify the situation. We are hopeful that that is a concession that we shall obtain from the Government. But the Government are in danger of once again encroaching on a very important principle on which trade unionism is based just as much as management is. Management acts collectively, and there has been value in that. We would not despise it. But this principle needs a great deal of clarification, and we hope that the Committee will be given it in Clause 87.</p>

<p>I speak in support of the Amendment. I do not believe&#x2014;I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Sutton (Dr. David Owen) will forgive me&#x2014;that there has been any concession whatever in the intervention of the Solicitor-General. I take the view that we are debating Clause 86 and that we should stick to it and then criticise the Government on Clause 87 when we get to that. Clause 86 is bad enough, in my judgment, and I want to concentrate on that.<br/>
It is true, in my submission, that the Post Office strike would have nothing to do with Clause 86. It does not have to be brought into this discussion. What Clause 86 is governed by&#x2014;and I think this should be common ground in the Committee&#x2014;is the words,
<q>&#x2026; anything which by virtue of this Act is an unfair industrial practice on the part of that other person.</q>
That is the governing phrase. It means that action which anyone, either a union or a group of work people, is aiding or abetting or showing sympathy towards in the first place must have been an unfair industrial practice under the Bill.


That much, I believe, ought to be common ground. Therefore, it rules out anything under Clause 86. I am not looking forward to other Clauses or discussing any principles. I am addressing myself entirely to the way in which Clause 86 is drafted. We therefore have to exclude from our minds at this moment of argument anything that is not in its origin an unfair industrial practice.<br/>
The Bill is so full of what are called "unfair industrial practices" that this is not the narrow point which the hon. and learned Gentleman tried to claim it to be, aided and abetted by some hon. Members opposite who are equally mistaken. It is a very wide and dangerous point which should be firmly opposed by this side of the Committee. Again, we must not start chasing hares as to what might happen if people who are not working in industry make speeches anyway.<br/>
What this provision is meant to hit is the most civilising influence that the trade union movement has had in British history&#x2014;solidarity and sympathy for fellow workers. That is what the provision is meant to hit, and to hit fundamentally and most unfairly. There is not an organisation in the country, or anywhere else, that has done more to civilise the behaviour of people to people than the British trade union movement. It created the principle of solidarity which has allowed people when they have felt lonely and perhaps isolated, or with defeat staring them in the face, to feel that there were fellow workers who would show solidarity with them.<br/>
No false distinction between unofficial and official disputes is involved here at all. The way the Bill is drawn means that both official and unofficial action can constitute an unfair industrial practice. The distinction is between unfair industrial practices and other industrial practices. <i>[Interruption.]</i> If the hon. Member for Barry (Mr. Gower) agrees with me, he must know what he is agreeing with. It is a very wide principle. A whole trade union may be held as acting against the law if it is acting in aid and sympathy with what was originally regarded as an unfair industrial practice. That is the real distinction.<br/>
Let us examine the position in real life. Let us take an example, which I knew about personally. Supposing a manager has been brought into a department and for several months has been conducting himself in a way in which he should not conduct himself. I take this example from the steel industry, with which I am very familiar, and no doubt in other industries there are similar examples. After feeling has built up, something cracks. As a result, the manager turns to two workpeople and says, "You two go home. I will not have you on this shift." This is said at 2.30 a.m. What are the men in that shift to do? Very often, the only possible reaction is to say, "In our opinion, you have no right to do this, and if these two men go, we go as well." This is very often the only kind of industrial self-defence that a group of work people are in a position to undertake in order to be effective at the time that it is most important that it should be effective, yet under the Bill it will be called an unfair industrial practice.<br/>
Very often the dispute is put right because the much-maligned shop stewards get together in the morning, have a discussion with the senior manager, and the thing is cleared up and the two men come back to work. But if, for some reason, the thing is not cleared up quickly, it may be a question of another department coming out which was not involved in the original dispute, which the Government want the courts to interpret as an unfair industrial practice in origin. Perhaps there is a factory next door where the work people say, "We will not have this. If we allow this sort of action by a manager, such high-handed attitudes may spread. We are not going to make distinctions. The Government have declared, unjustly and unjustifiably, that this is an unfair industrial practice, but we shall go to the aid of the people next door. We will collect money and aid and support them on our shop floor."<br/>
All this would fall under the trap of Clause 86. That is why it has very wide implications. The Government are taking away fundamental rights of the people by this Clause, as they are doing throughout the Bill. They must not be allowed to ride off by saying, "This is only very narrow Clause. If the conflict in its


origin was not an unfair industrial practice, sympathetic action does not fall under this Clause", as though that makes it unimportant. One can see the clever way in which the lawyers advising the Government are trying to winkle in vast changes in the rights of British working people under the pretence that these are only very narrow changes. We should stick strictly to this question of the invasion of the rights of the working people.<br/>
Another point makes the Clause wider still in its application. At present we have no distinctions between registered and unregistered unions. The Government are trying to introduce a very great difficulty for a union which is not registered once the Bill becomes law. That has implications that would still further widen the application of Clause 86, which is designed to frighten people into registration. I use the term advisedly and very rarely, as the right hon. Gentleman knows, but I say now that this is the beginning of an approach to the corporate State. This is deliberate intimidation of unions which are not prepared to register, as they now have the perfect right not to do. This is something that the Government are trying to slip in without admitting to it.<br/>
Under the provisions of the Bill, an unregistered trade union would be engaging in an unfair industrial practice that would be regarded as a perfectly fair industrial practice if it were engaged upon by a registered trade union. That makes the Clause wider still. It does not mean that all the actions of an unregistered trade union would fall under this provision&#x2014;of course not. That is the additional danger. The main danger remains the original one that I have pointed out&#x2014;that it is not possible or desirable that a group of workpeople should be prevented from using immediately their only way of industrial self-defence.<br/>
The Solicitor-General showed his ignorant approach to industrial relations and industrial life when he spoke yesterday. These things do not happen at the drop of a hat, as he suggested; they do not happen because someone suddenly gets in a rage. They happen because something has been building up. In the factory I quoted as an example, the situation had been building up over a period of six months. There comes a situation

when what has been a bad attitude by the management flashes into action against certain workpeople. That is the point where solidarity has to assert itself, as anyone with experience in industry knows. It is at that point that sympathetic action&#x2014;taken when it is most needed&#x2014;comes under this Clause. I hope that we shall oppose Clause 86 and support the Amendment.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Plymouth, Sutton (Dr. David Owen) said that this was the first occasion on which he had spoken during this Committee stage. It is unfortunate that he has not previously contributed out of his considerable experience, but I hope that we shall hear more from him. When the Bill becomes law, it will be clear whether the two cases which he cited were fair or unfair industrial practices, and it will therefore be clear whether Clause 86 would apply to sympathetic action in connection with them.<br/>
I am surprised to find myself in some agreement with the hon. Member for Penistone (Mr. John Mendelson); we rarely agree. The hon. Member for Liverpool, Kirkdale (Mr. Dunn) spoke of action which he might have taken which was seen to be aiding and abetting the Post Office strike. Leaving aside whether arbitration should have been used, let us assume that under the Bill it would be an entirely fair industrial practice and an official strike; any aiding and abetting which the hon. Gentleman mentioned would then not be subject to any penalty under Clause 86.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Kirkdale (Mr. Dunn) and I are members of the same trade union.

Clause 86 in line 36 uses the words
<q>by virtue of this Act".</q>
Clause 87 states what are the other unfair industrial practices covered by the Bill, one being to induce a person to break a contract, not being a contract of employment&#x2014;otherwise, a commercial contract. My union will not allow this man to deliver mail because that would be breaking a strike which we support and for which we have sympathy, and we there-


fore say that we are taking sympathetic action, but it is an unfair industrial act by virtue of what is said in Clause 86. Now&#x2014;</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman has forestalled one of my questions to my hon. and learned Friend the Solicitor-General. I should like clarification as to whether sympathetic action in support of unfair sympathetic action would itself be unfair. For the moment, I am reading Clause 86 as though the action which is to be considered unfair would follow the original unfair action; but I should welcome an explanation from my hon. and learned Friend.<br/>
The hon. Member for Penistone said with a great weight of emphasis that the governing words in the Clause were "unfair industrial practice". He went on to say that he was not happy about the list of unfair industrial practices in the Bill. He is entitled to say that; but Clause 86 simply says that if the Government and, when the Bill becomes law, the country do not accept unfair industrial practices as such we cannot accept the proliferation of strike action in support of unfair industrial practices which we cannot support.<br/>
It is a simple argument and one which with Clause 86 as it stands, apart from my query about sympathetic action, is unarguable in the context of the whole Bill and the acceptance of the list of unfair industrial practices.</p>

<p>It is not only arguable but very greatly arguable. Even if the Government intend to have a series of novel definitions, bitterly opposed by the trade union movement, of what will in future constitute unfair industrial practices, it is one thing to discourage people from doing what the Government would regard as an unfair industrial practice, but quite another to attack the solidarity of

working people when, as a matter of the judgment of their own conscience, working people take sympathetic action in support of those already engaged in a struggle.</p>

<p>The Bill is meant to prevent or reduce unofficial action which in some circumstances might call for sympathetic action. There is no undermining of trade union solidarity where there is a fair industrial practice; that is to say, a fair, constitutional strike.

<p>I apologise for breaking into the hon. Gentleman's remarks so early and before he has had a chance to develop his argument, but I did not refer to sympathetic action taken in respect of fair industrial practices.

<p>That is the point I was about to come to. This marks the difference in our approaches to the Bill and its purposes. My hon. Friend the Member for Penistone forcefully pointed out that sympathetic action is to be outlawed by the Bill very largely depending on one's interpretation on what is fair and unfair.<br/>
So far as I am concerned with my class bias&#x2014;or my objectivity perhaps&#x2014;my interpretation of most industrial disputes is that they are always fair. In that sense, it would not be straining my own dialectics to say that the working class is always right and can never be wrong. Having asserted that, I start out on my analysis of this legislation.<br/>
The question of what is fair and what is unfair gives us an understanding of what the Bill is about. I totally reject&#x2014;and I am one of many who take this view on this side of the Committee&#x2014;the Government's understanding of fair and unfair industrial practices. We certainly challenge the interpretation of hon. Members opposite. We would say that almost all disputes, unofficial or official, are honourable occasions, and we are proud of the part played by shop stewards in organising workers and fighting for better standards for people in industry.<br/>
We cannot spell it out any clearer than that what divides us in this matter of deciding what is fair and unfair. The longer discussion goes on in this Committee the more some of us will tend to start apologising for what hon. Members opposite regard as an unfair practice. To us it is nothing of the kind. We must get out of this habit before it catches on. We should recognise that in our language

and in terms of our purpose every dispute is a fair one.</p>

<p>Of course it does. We should not take a semi-apologetic attitude on these matters.<br/>
The Government's view appears to be that employers have a right to combine but trade unions have not. Employers have a right to combine together to overcome disruption which may arise as a result of an industrial quarrel, but the Bill spells out that trade unions have no such a right to combine to further that quarrel in safeguarding their own interests. Again, there is a class difference in approaching the problems of industry. We are arguing that the trade unions have every right to take this sort of combined action to represent their own interests.<br/>
If I may come to the Fine Tubes argument, my hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Sutton mentioned that a district levy was being applied in his own district to help members who had suffered loss of wages. This was a voluntary effort by members of the trade unions concerned, and the levy went to a central fund. It would appear that under Clauses 86 and 87 such a levy would not be possible. This is one of our major objections to these Clauses since it will create difficulties for trade unionists in raising funds by levy to help fellow trade unionists. This is a very real problem. I should be interested to hear the Solicitor-General's views about the imposition of levies or the taking of collective action in such circumstances.<br/>
Are the Government saying that in terms of a "fair"&#x2014;to use the Government's language&#x2014;dispute an injunction is not permissible? I do not know whether the Solicitor-General is familiar with the recent Johnson Matthey case, which will undoubtedly go down in trade union history, or indeed anti-trade union history. Is it feasible that such a case will arise in future? It involved an employer who sought an injunction and claimed compensation from a trade union which took sympathetic action. No doubt such a situation would depend on the interpretation of a fair or unfair industrial dispute and its origins. We shall oppose these two Clauses if only because of the difficulties they will create for trade


unions in raising funds to help those who are in dispute.<br/>
The second point involves the problems which arise when a transfer of work takes place within the walls of a particular factory. When there is a dispute in one department of a factory, managements seek to overcome the subsequent loss of production by shifting the work to another department in the same factory. This happens regularly in many large factories. Trade unionists in the department in which the dispute has occurred go to workers in the other department and try to persuade them not to carry out any work on that transferred job within the same factory. This is not a narrow point on fair and unfair practices but a major problem which confronts a trade union organisation in a factory and within the same works committee. I should have thought that that sort of case was parallel to the Fine Tubes situation, although within the walls of the same factory.<br/>
My reading of Clause 87 leads me to believe that it is the Government's intention&#x2014;and presumably this will be the court's interpretation at a future date&#x2014;that all sympathetic action, or "blacking of work", as we know it today, will be outlawed in general, except in narrow circumstances where the question of fairness is clearly defined. If there is any ambiguity about the origin of a dispute, the court no doubt will take the view that sympathetic action is to be outlawed. This again is one of our fundamental objections to this Clause.<br/>
I believe that once the Bill becomes law these two Clauses will be the first to be used, and that it is in respect of these provisions that the first trade union casualties will come.</p>

<p>The emphasis of my remarks stems from Clause 86 and not from Clause 87. Therefore, any reference to Clause 87 is a passing reference. My remarks are centred on Clause 86.<br/>
We are discussing a part of the Bill which will cause the first casualties in the trade union movement if it becomes

law. The first casualties will be those charged with offences under the Clause, and we must be very careful about what we do. We must ensure that the Government thoroughly understand what they are doing and what is likely to result from the law as it will become. Presumably the Government are anxious to get the Bill on the Statute Book before 18th March, when the T.U.C. is being recalled. I take it that they have discussed the timetable in the light of that fact.</p>

<p>It will not be impossible. When the imposition of the guillotine was first discussed, presumably the Government's intention was to get the Bill through by the time the T.U.C. was recalled. There are precedents. We dealt with the Bill on Rolls-Royce in a day. There is no doubt that we can get through this Bill by 18th March. Assuming that the Leader of the House and the Secretary of State are right in their assessment of the time that it will take to put before the House a code of conduct and other matters in the next three or four months, there will be a period in October and November when we shall run into trouble with these two Clauses.<br/>
There are areas in industry in which there will be need to renew contracts and existing arrangements about October and November. I therefore predict that the two Clauses will bring in their wake a trail of casualties&#x2014;the first people to suffer as a result of this iniquitous legislation.</p>

<p>On a point of order. I seek your help and guidance, Mr. Jennings. In initiating the discussion on the Question, That the Clause stand part of the Bill, I did not make much reference to Clause 85 or Clause 87, but it is within my knowledge that my colleagues will wish to do so. I draw your attention, Mr. Jennings, to line 4 of Clause 87, which refers to Clause 86(2) and sets out paragraphs <i>(a)</i> and <i>(b)</i> dealing with the interpretation and implementation of Clause 87. Therefore, the Clauses cannot be separated.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman was present when the Chairman of Ways and Means gave a Ruling


on this matter. The hon. Gentleman must abide by that Ruling, as I intend to do. The Chairman ruled that, while Clause 86 was the Clause under discussion, passing references could be made to Clause 87 because it was in part bound up with Clause 86. I have allowed passing references to Clause 87. But the hon. Gentleman must remember that we are due to debate not only an Amendment on Clause 87 but the Question, That the Clause stand part of the Bill. If we abide by the Chairman's generous interpretation we shall get along all right.</p>

<p>I speak with some diffidence because it is always a little odd for a Member to complain of the lack of progress of a Clause and then make a speech which takes up the time of the Committee. Therefore, I promise to be very brief.<br/>
The Committee is making rather heavy weather of the Clause. It is conceded by hon. Gentlemen opposite that it does not put a blanket ban on sympathetic strikes in the sense that it does not ban a strike in support of a strike which is legitimate and is not an unfair industrial act under some other Clause of the Bill. The Clause says in the simplest possible language that if a person or union is guilty of an unfair industrial act it is only common sense to say that a person who aids and abets such action by strike action is also guilty of an unfair act.<br/>
If we did not have the Clause in the Bill, the result would be completely absurd. Clause 7 seeks to ban the pre-entry closed shop. If Clause 87 were not added to the Bill we would be in the absurd situation that, whereas workers in a shop could not take strike action to enforce a pre-entry closed shop, people in the shop next door could take strike action to enforce a pre-entry closed shop.

That would be veritable midsummer madness. If we provide in the Bill that certain industrial action is unfair and is not permitted, we cannot later in the Bill allow people working next door to the people directly affected to take that form of action. That is what the Clause is about, and I do not see any mystery about it.<br/>
The hon. Member for Tottenham (Mr. Atkinson) said that perhaps the Bill would become law by March. I am sure that people outside would be absolutely delighted if that were possible, but I am afraid that it is crying for the moon. I make this criticism, with the greatest respect for the hon. Member, who I know has studied the Bill and made a number of very useful contributions in Committee. He said that, as a result of the Bill, employees will have no right to combine.<br/>
Hon. Members should be very careful about how they put their arguments. The sort of phrase used by the hon. Gentleman will be latched on to by people in the country. When the hon. Gentleman stops to reflect for a moment, I am sure that he will agree with me that the Bill does nothing of the sort. Nowhere in the Bill are there provisions which take away from the working man the right to combine. So let us all learn to be a little more careful about our language so that people in the country do not get a misleading impression of what the Bill is about.<br/>
I am sure that hon. Members on both sides of the Committee have been deeply disturbed at some of the advertising in the Press undertaken by the T.U.C. which bears not the slightest relationship to the Bill's contents. I had to comment at a meeting the other day&#x2014;</p>

<p>I realise that I was skating on thin ice, Mr. Jennings, but I was merely trying to reply to a point made by the hon. Member for Tottenham. He said in terms that as a result of this Bill employees would have no right to combine. I wanted to make it clear&#x2014;and I take it no further than that&#x2014;that the Bill does nothing of the sort. I am sure that the hon. Member will concede, on reflection, that not only does the Bill not do that but certainly this


Clause does not. The Committee would probably, in these circumstances, be wise to move on to more interesting Clauses.</p>

<p>What I was arguing was that I challenged this definition of the term "unfair" or "unfair practice". I then went on to relate my remarks to that and said that the Bill denies workers the right to combine, in effect, to commit an "unfair practice" in the terms used by the Government. Would not the hon. Member agree that what the Bill is doing is making it impossible for workers to combine to commit an "unfair practice"?</p>

by someone as exalted as yourself. The point I was raising on a point of order, and raise now, was precisely your intervention on my hon.

<p>I was saying that I fully understand that the hon. Member for Tottenham (Mr. Atkinson) disapproves of and dislikes the whole concept of unfair and fair industrial action. It is one thing to say that one objects to the creation of this new concept of fair and unfair industrial actions, but it is another thing to go so far as to say that as a result of the passing of the Bill employees will have no right to combine.<br/>
I was invited to reply to the point raised by the hon. Member for Liverpool, Walton (Mr. Heller). He asked me to say what I meant by normal and ordinary people. When I was speaking in Yorkshire on Friday night I was asked a question, "Don't you realise that there are 10 million trade unionists in the country most of whom have wives and families? I have tried to work it out and they represent 68 per cent. of the population, so you have no mandate for the Bill." I said, "What sort of fantasy world are we living in? I do not represent Bournemouth or a seaside resort, I come from Nelson, which used to be called 'little Moscow'. If I go into Nelson on Saturday morning I do not get lynched, I am far more likely to be approached by a wife who says, 'I wish you would tell my Jack to get back to

work and use a bit of common sense.'" That is the sort of approach that is made to Members of Parliament in their constituencies. That is what I mean when I refer to ordinary people. The ordinary people are behind the Bill and we know it from their reactions in the constituencies.</p>

<p>Time and time again in considering the Bill we have had from the Government bench in reply to criticisms from the Opposition the answer that a registered trade union is protected. In considering Clause 86 that stock answer cannot be made. Registered trade unions are not protected under Clause 86.<br/>
My hon. Friends the Members for Penistone (Mr. John Mendelson) and Tottenham (Mr. Atkinson) both touched upon the way in which Clause 86 undermines the solidarity of trade union organisation. Since registered trade unions are not protected by Clause 86, considerable point is put on what the hon. Member for Penistone said about the workers feeling isolated. If they do something which is an unfair industrial practice they cannot be backed up by a registered trade union because the trade union would then be in breach of Clause 86.<br/>
In the centre of Clause 86 are the words "aiding and abetting". These are words of criminal application, not of civil application. Although it has been said on many occasions on the Government benches that the concepts embodied in the Bill are civil concepts, here a criminal concept enters in. I stress the width of those words "aiding and abetting". They are as wide and their meaning is at least as sinister as the word "induce" in Clause 85. In the criminal courts juries are told that aiding and abetting is sufficiently established if there is a look-out man while a safe blowing is going on in an office or factory. The look-out man is just as guilty of the safe blowing as those who are actually doing it. That is the width of the concept that is being applied here.<br/>
While many things done by unregistered organisations, by <i>ad hoc</i> bodies of workers, are unfair industrial practices although they would be perfectly fair if they were done by trade unions, many things which it is now legitimate for trade unions to do would not be fair


practices under the Bill. Certainly Clause 86 would strike at many things which are done in the workshop and which are now considered fair and perfectly legitimate industrial procedures.<br/>
I apologise for referring, in passing only, to Clause 85, but it is important to notice how far the attack on the freedom of conversation and the liberty of speech between workers on the shop floor goes in these two Clauses. The curtailment of liberty is so extreme that I would be inclined to say that these two Clauses impose a kind of statutory "Coventry" on workers. I make a passing reference to Clause 85 because the unfair practices in Clause 85 will be struck at by Clause 86. If in a workshop there is a source of disagreement and the workers are annoyed about something&#x2014;an illustration was given in our last debate of a time and motion study of girls going to the lavatory&#x2014;it will be obvious to anyone who has ever seen a workshop that the workers will converse amongst themselves about it.<br/>
Yesterday criticism was made about the difficulty of getting evidence, but one would only have to put in a tape recorder to hear conversations all round the workshop. The workers would be discussing their grievances and saying what might be done about them. My criticism of these two Clauses is that that conversation on any view would be subject to the construction that it is inducing. When one worker says to another, "We must take action about this", the first worker could be taken to be inducing the second worker to take action. It is no good saying that it would be all right for a spontaneous walk-out or a spontaneous laying-down of tools to take place, because, if before that there had been conversation between the workers, this would be construed as inducing and, whether they were or were not members of a trade union, this would be unfair practice.<br/>
When it comes to the trade union seeking to back up the workers who can be charged with inducing each other to break their contracts, the trade union cannot give that official support because by doing so it would be aiding and abetting in terms of Clause 86.<br/>
If, after a conversation which could be construed as inducing, a worker decides to stop work or to lay down his

tools, that is unfair practice and automatically under Clause 85 once he has done that any further conversation could be regarded as abetting, and, if action follows, as abetting a strike.</p>

<p>While I accept some of the criticisms made by the hon. Gentleman, does he not agree that what he fears will arise only if there is an original unfair industrial practice, and any reference which is likely to arise would be based on the original unfair industrial practice and not on any secondary matters of the kind he describes?</p>

<p>It is certainly true that the section has to be preceded by an unfair industrial practice. Apart from the three Clauses which we are dealing with in Part V, there are no fewer than 22 heads of unfair industrial practice. Of these, a great many heads of unfair industrial practice are practices that would be fair for a trade union but unfair for an organisation of workers that is not registered. That means that many things which the hon. Member for Barry (Mr. Gower) and I would regard as perfectly legitimate industrial practices today will be struck at by Clause 86.<br/>
I ask the Government Front Bench to think again about these Clauses. I have spoken carefully and avoided speaking about Clause 87, for which I ought to be congratulated. All of the Clauses in this part of the Bill are open to the same criticism and I call upon the Government to drop Part V or else to think again about it and, if they are not prepared to drop it, at least exclude from these provisions conversations between fellow workers about conditions.</p>

<p>This part of the Bill tells the worker, "You must not talk, you must not suggest that anyone should do something, and if you do so we will take action against you". My biggest regret is that the Solicitor-General or the


Secretary of State did not introduce this Clause. I am sorry to sound parrot-like, but here again we have imprecision. It will need a battery of lawyers to tell people precisely what is meant by the words in Clause 86.<br/>
There have been arguments as to whether it applies to registered trade unions. The difficulty about the Bill is that it has been framed from theory but will not be applicable in practice without the results we have suggested. The Solicitor-General explained clearly in an intervention why this would not catch the full-time trade union official belonging to a registered trade union, or the funds of that union. This is quite true from the language of the Bill. However, what happens in practice is the important thing. I will try to illustrate this simply because I think the Solicitor-General ought to examine the applicability of this Clause rather than its theory.<br/>
Suppose that there is a large holding branch in a trade union, where the general branch combines with people in various industries because the membership in the given unit is not large enough to justify a separate branch. This is not fanciful. Many of the big unions adopt this procedure. I will draw from my own experience again and relate this to U.S.D.A.W. We organised a laundry. The laundry workers are among the lowest paid workers in the country. We put them in the general branch. The laundry workers, rightly or wrongly, and if I was an official I might say wrongly, came out on unofficial strike. It was a long strike and they were low-paid people with no strike fund. At the branch meeting, at which the full-time union official was present, the rest of the branch members decide to make a collection for the strikers. The act in itself was illegal under this Clause because it would be financing the strike. But what would be the position of the trade union official?<br/>
If a trade union official stands up and opposes the collection, as he has a legal responsibility to do, his life would not be worth living. If he does not oppose it he is passively supporting the unofficial strike action. In such circumstances it could be that an employer could charge a union because its official had been present. Even though it may appear that the registered unions will not be

affected, there are so many circumstances in industry under which trade unions operate that they might, whether or not they or the Solicitor-General like it, act outside the Bill.<br/>
I have a strong criticism to make of the Bill in that it has been drawn up by people with no idea of what goes on in industry. It may be good English and it may seek to deal with a given situation, but because it is not applicable to industrial conditions it is either a waste of time or else it imposes on industrial workers, registered and unregistered trade unions alike, a yoke against which they will not be able to strain.</p>

<p>The Solicitor-General and I have already discussed this aspect earlier in our proceedings. If he recalls it I was describing to him the situation which arose during the local authority strike in September and October, which he will recall was as popular an industrial action with the general public as one would expect. This sort of Clause is not necessary to protect members of the public from that kind of strike. He will recall that the strike was selective and certain people were brought out in various parts of the country.<br/>
In one area roadmen had been left working and the road contractors' drivers were bringing tar to the roadmen. After a while, once the strike had started, the contractors' lorrymen were unloading tar, taking the lorries into the centre of the town and picking up refuse from the dustbins (the dustmen were on strike) and taking it away to rubbish dumps.<br/>
The result was that the National Union of Public Employees blacked the contractors' lorries as a way of maintaining the integrity of the strike. On that evening the Solicitor-General in those mellifluous tones we have got to know so well in this Committee, and with that lucid exposition of the law which we have also got to know, said that this might well not be illegal in terms of the Bill.<br/>
What he has omitted to do is to bend his mind to the sort of situation that actually occurs in industry, a situation when we have a shop steward or a branch secretary, occupying such a position perhaps because no one else will do the job or because he has been a member of the


road-working gang for longer than anyone else. He has to decide whether he will black those lorries. Will he induce some action, organise it, or will he bring pressure? At the moment all that he has to do is to decide on the basis of the industrial relations elements of the situation. What hon. Gentlemen opposite are seeking to do in addition is to impose the whole network of law on top of these unfortunate people.<br/>
Unfortunate people they will be in the circumstances under which the Bill will operate. For example, if this shop steward or branch secretary blacked the lorry, through his union, because the lorry contractors were an extraneous party interceding in the dispute he might well be within the law but, without the benefit of what I am sure will be an inspiring legal volume to me&#x2014; "Howe on the Law of Industrial Disputes" which we shall get for the price of several pounds in years to come&#x2014;he would have to decide to stick to that sort of action, whereas what he might have done in the circumstances is to go to one of the lorry drivers and say, "Will you get your lorry drivers to stop this road-making contract?". In that event, he might well be within the terms of Clause 86, especially if the lorry driver told the roadmen's shop steward, "I do not want to go back to my employers and say that we have blacked this contract. But, if you can black it, I will tell them that the contract has been blacked, and matters can proceed smoothly".<br/>
That is all very well, but people who become the secretaries of trade union branches are not normally the sort of people who say to themselves, "If I go about this operation in one way, I shall be within the law; whereas, if I go about it in another, I shall be outside the law". The liability of a trade union, of its shop stewards, its members and the union funds may depend not on the action taken at the point of the dispute but on the way in which the action is taken. If this Clause proves to be a contribution to the construction of good industrial relations, I shall be very surprised.<br/>
I understand that it might be a defence under Clause 86 for a local branch secretary to explain that he was acting within the authority that his union had given him. However, on this sort of selective strike, it is difficult for branch

secretaries and shop stewards to be confident that the way in which they are acting is within the law. For example, if a selective strike is called, the industrial action taken by the members of a union is a matter which must be taken by the national executive committee of the union, for obvious reasons. On the other hand, action in a dispute such as the one that I have described must be taken quickly and on the spot by someone who knows the situation, namely, the shop steward. In other words, a formal situation may arise where the authority to take this sort of action is reserved to the executive committee, whereas the actual action is taken by the shop steward on the spot.<br/>
The shop steward on the spot having taken action, the matter then goes up the trade union line of command to the area officer, the divisional officer, the national officer and the executive committee, who may back the shop steward. If they do not and the shop steward becomes the source of an action under the Clause, he may be forced to explain that what he considered right at the time has proved subsequently to be wrong, that he did not have the authority of his union and, therefore, that he has committed an unfair industrial practice.<br/>
These are some of the practical problems which the Government seek to impose on trade unionists supposedly in the interests of creating good industrial relations. In fact, right hon. and hon. Gentlemen opposite are creating chaos, disorder and confusion on the ground.<br/>
I have been interested in industrial relations for about 15 years. Looking back over the years, one of the most socially productive industrial actions that I can recall was one which may be banned by the Clause. I do not know whether I shall have all my right hon. and hon. Friends with me, but I believe that the growth of compensation for redundancy has been one of the most constructive achievements in industrial relations in my 15 years' experience. I give the Solicitor-General the point that a large part came about as a result of the introduction of the law into the subject, although the law was introduced following meticulous negotiations between the B.E.C., as it then was, and the T.U.C. The Measure was not introduced until agreement had been reached. However, I say that in passing.


It is difficult to comprehend at the beginning of the 1970s what was the attitude to compensation for redundancy even 15 years ago. I remember how managers in my industry would start a discussion on the subject of compensation for redundancy with the statement that a labourer in the industry was on an hourly rate and therefore was entitled only to an hour's pay or an hour's notice when the time came to dismiss him, no matter what the circumstances were. It may be that they never intended that to be the ultimate solution, but it was the point from which they started their argument on the subject of redundancy.<br/>
6.15 p.m.<br/>
Against that background, in the summer of about 1956, a number of car workers drew their weekly pay on a Friday afternoon and discovered in their pay packets a week's pay, together with another week's pay and a little note thanking them for their past services and saying that they would not be required in a week's time. Without resorting to the negotiating machinery, large numbers of those car workers went on strike against what they regarded as this inhuman handling of a redundancy problem.<br/>
A process of negotiation by means of Press statements began in which the general attitude of the management could be summed up as, "We do not care if you go on strike because we do not want your services, anyway. We were being decent in keeping you for another week, so you might as well strike now".<br/>
Clearly, those strikers were in a very weak position. I cannot remember whether the strike was made official by the Transport and General Workers Union. The situation was solved by Mr. Frank Cousins, who had recently become General Secretary of the Transport and General Workers Union, telling his dockers to black exports of cars at the docks. The result was that the Coventry car employers caved in rapidly. Compensation for redundancy was negotiated for the car workers who had been threatened with dismissal, and, from then on, a social movement was begun which resulted in the Redundancy Compensation Act and the provision of redundancy compensation to almost every employee who is dis-

charged as a result of technological change.<br/>
I would like the Committee to contemplate what may have been the feelings of members of the public affected by the secondary action to which I have referred. They may have been bitter. Dock employers were losing money, and they may have been bitter. Other members of the public inconvenienced as a result of the non-flow of cars through the docks may have been bitter. But if that action had not been taken, all members of the public would now be worse off since it would not have started the social and industrial movement which has ended up by giving the country a method of redeploying its labour as painlessly as possible and introducing many technological changes over the past 15 years with a relative lack of resistance. All that has been possible because of this conception of redundancy payments, and the net result is that every member of the public today enjoys a higher standard of living than would have been possible if this movement had not been started by that strike. We might have achieved the compensation later and possibly in a less satisfactory form. But it was that strike more than any other that I can recall in my 15 years' experience of industrial relations which made such an important contribution to the way in which we look at these matters.<br/>
This is the sort of sympathetic action which, unless it is handled carefully by trade union officials on the ground, will render trade union officials liable to action under this legislation. From time to time, right hon. and hon. Gentleman opposite put their hands on their hearts and say that they are in favour of the right to withdraw labour. I am sure that they are sincere. However, a little gloss should be put on their attitude. What they are saying is that, provided that a strike is ineffective, it is moral and may be legal. But if a strike is effective, it is immoral and should be declared illegal by every possible means at the disposal of this Government.</p>

<p>I should like to put one question to my hon. and learned Friend. May I ask


why he wants the words "threaten to take"? I can understand that my hon. and learned Friend wants power to take steps. But is he not giving himself a great deal of unnecessary trouble by the vague words "threaten to take"? Will they not cause something complex of definition?<br/>
Surely the purpose of the Clause would be served perfectly well if those words were omitted. I hope that my hon. and learned Friend will tell us his thinking about them. I should like to know the reasons which have promoted my hon. and learned Friend to put those three words into the Clause.</p>

<p>The point made by the hon. Member for Uxbridge (Mr. Curran) is germane to the discussion. What I hope will also be germane is to state categorically that our objections to Clause 86 are based on the knowledge that it is intended to strike at the very sinews of collective bargaining and trade unionism.<br/>
No doubt the Solicitor-General will employ his tortuous semantic meanderings later to try to prove that the Clause does not apply to this, that or the other strike, or that there are so many exemptions that it will be a last resort sanction imposed upon trade unionists which will apply only in rare circumstances, rare strikes, or, to use another term, something sort of a strike. I hope that the hon. and learned Gentleman will explain what "short of a strike" means.<br/>
We have come to the conclusion that the phraseology of the Clause and the way that it has been presented by hon. Gentlemen opposite&#x2014;notably the hon. Member for Nelson and Colne (Mr. Waddington)&#x2014;confirms our worst fears and suspicions about the nature of the Bill and this Clause in particular.<br/>
Throughout the debates on the various Clauses we have had constant repetition by the Secretary of State, by the Solicitor-General, and, almost without exception, by all hon. Members opposite who have spoken that they believe in strong trade unionism, that they wish to see the development and expansion of trade unionism, that they wish to see the liberalising of industrial relations, and that they want to remove all kinds of social injustices from industry.<br/>
Hon. Gentlemen opposite cannot say that they want to expand, support and strengthen trade unionism and simultaneously remove from trade unionism the basic fundamental means of securing industrial rights. It is no good dodging the issue. Right hon. and hon. Gentlemen opposite must understand that it is absolutely fundamental that, if they seek to remove, usurp or infringe the right of workers to undertake industrial action in support of other industrial action, whether an unfair or fair industrial practice, or neither one thing nor the other, it will be interpreted correctly as a deliberate attempt to undermine the strength of trade unionism.<br/>
The point is well made by comparison with American experience. I should like to quote from someone who can be accorded the status of an authority on American trade unionism, George Meany, President of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. In a document written at the end of last year about the proposed British system of industrial relations and comparing it with the system in America throughout the years, he said:
<q>Since we have had no experience of freedom from these bans"&#x2014;</q>
what he calls "secondary boycotts" and what we call "sympathetic strikes"&#x2014;
<q>we cannot state with assurance what different effects would have resulted. I am myself reasonably certain that union organisation would have occurred, in the absence of these restrictions, in various fields &#x2026; where unscrupulous employers have largely blocked organisation.</q>
We cannot speak of America in terms of strong trade unionism when only 23 to 25 per cent. of the total labour force is unionised. No one can talk about strengthening trade unionism when, because of statute and common law throughout the history of industrial America, trade unionists have been forbidden in practice from undertaking sympathetic action. No one can argue that it is a system which has introduced a more peaceful, serene, pacific system of industrial relations in America.<br/>
Right hon. and hon. Gentlemen opposite have acknowledged time and again that America's strike record and recruitment in certain sectors of the work force, notably among women and white collar workers, is significantly worse in ours, and that the disruption caused by strikes of public employees, which are in law


illegal, is greater than here. All these things have happened in America where sympathetic strikes of any description have been illegal throughout its history of trade unionism, with the possible exception of the years between 1941 and 1947, when a favourable Federal Court judgment gave them a certain legality.<br/>
If the Government argue and mean that they want to strengthen trade unionism, they will remove from our minds the most marginal suspicion of any attempt to strike at sympathetic action by removing the Clause. We know that this will not happen, so the suspicion will remain. It will be compounded and turned into industrial strife by bitterness because of the disingenuous hypocrisy of those who say, "We want industrial peace and strong trade unionism, but we will, by law, deny trade unionism the means of strengthening itself".</p>

<p>It is important for the Committee and the country to understand the objectives behind the Clause and not to interpret it too widely. I certainly cannot accept the proposition put forward by the hon. Member for Bedwellty (Mr. Kinnock) that unless we abandon the Clause, along with almost every other Clause, our whole exercise is unacceptable. I do not believe that people who have closely studied the present situation with genuine concern can come to the conclusion that anything which introduces the marginal suspicion of any curtailment of the absolute right of anyone to induce industrial action for any purpose must be rejected. I do not believe that that represents the feeling of the Committee or of the country.</p>

<p>We are trying to make reasonable proposals which maintain the balance between the interests of society and of individual workers and the legitimate interest of the Labour Movement for maintaining its strength.<br/>
Hon. Members have said in the debate, although less frequently as we have got closer to understanding what the Clause is about, that we are seeking to outlaw all sympathetic strikes. We are not. It may be thought outside this Committee that we are seeking to outlaw all sympa-

thetic strikes without really bothering to define what we may mean by "sympathetic strikes", which is a phase more easily uttered than defined. We are not seeking to do any such thing. We recognise the importance of the trade union movement and to workers in their own organisations to be able to rely upon and to invoke the assistance of borrowed strength. We merely suggest that there are some areas and some situations where that is either not necessary or not desirable to proceed in that way. <i>[Interruption.]</i> Parliament decides. That is what we have been concerned with during these discussions. We are striving to strike a balance in pursuit of the central proposition that the calling of strike action in certain situations is too often regarded as a weapon of first, rather than last, resort.<br/>
6.30 p.m.<br/>
It is for that reason that the inclusion of the words "threaten to take" assumes some importance. Anyone who has been concerned with this problem will know that it is much easier to stop people coming out on strike than it is to persuade them to go back once they have come out. In the range of situations which we have identified as unfair it is right that someone who is threatened with the calling of a strike in pursuit of an unfair objective should be able to get that threat averted. It is at that point that the day may be saved. It is too late if a strike in pursuit of an unfair objective is called. Then the only way of dealing with the situation may be the awarding of compensation.<br/>
Once we accept that there are certain strikes the calling of which are unfair because they are in pursuit of an unfair objective&#x2014;and I appreciate that there is not common ground between both sides of the Committee on that point&#x2014;it is right, logical and necessary that a strike in support of one designed to secure an unfair objective shosuld itself be identified as unfair. I agree that it is right and logical that if the original strike is unfair&#x2014;which can arise in the case of some strikes that are called by registered unions, as well as unregistered organisation&#x2014;no matter what the nature of the organisation that calls or procures the supporting of the strike, it is equally unfair. Subject to the important qualification mentioned by the hon. Member for Lewisham, North


(Mr. Moyle), even then an official of the union, acting within the scope of his authority, remains protected under the law.</p>

<p>I want to take the Solicitor-General back to the first part of his argument, when he spoke about a sympathetic strike in support of a fair strike&#x2014;that is to say, a strike legitimately called by a registered trade union. I am in rather a difficulty on that point. I should like the hon. and learned Gentleman to help me by citing a possible example. If we take two separate bargaining units, as defined in the Bill, it would be possible to have a legitimate strike in one bargaining unit and a sympathetic strike in the second bargaining unit, with the consequence of the second sympathetic strike in the other bargaining unit not in actual dispute not being affected by Clause 87(1)<i>(a)</i> and <i>(b).</i> That is the difficulty.</p>

<p>Sir Robert, you will have heard what the Solicitor-General has said.

<p>I am trying to deal with the matter in the context of the debate as it has gone so far. I shall come to the hon. Member's point.<br/>
The first proposition is that Clause 86 is designed logically and inevitably to curtail the right to call supporting strikes, but only where the primary strike is itself unfair. That is the objective that I commend to the Committee.<br/>
The point concerning the relationship between Clauses 86 and 87 is a different one. Clause 87 is directed in a quite different way at a particular kind of secondary strike, whether the original strike is fair or unfair. I acknowledge that. It is differently designed. Clause 86 deals only with the strike in support of a primary strike that is unfair. Clause 87 can attach itself to situations where the primary strike is fair but the nature of the damage sought to be inflicted by the strike at which Clause 87 is directed is one which Parliament, if it accepts the Clause, regards as unfair.<br/>
I do not want to go too far into that point. At the moment, through what is described in the Donovan Report as the maze of case law, it is possible in certain circumstances for an employer at whom a secondary strike is directed to secure an order restraining that secondary strike. It depends upon a very complex series of hoops through which he and the trade union have to go, and in recent case decisions a series of judgments have been arrived at, some of which, it may be said, agree with what my hon. Friends and I regard as fair and some of which may not agree with what we regard as fair. The important point is that the present law is securing its results as a result of a random legal pattern not related to the merits of the industrial situation. That point has been made by a number of commentators. Professor Grunfeld in at least two cases has made the point, and Professor A. D. Hughes has made the same point&#x2014;both saying that there are certain situations where strike action in the secondary form can be properly regarded as unfair but that the present law does not achieve that objective in a rational way.<br/>
We are seeking in Clause 87 to say that if a strike is called the person calling it is committing an unfair industrial practice if he is doing so in order to procure the breach of a specific commercial contract by a third party who is in no sense involved in the initial strike or dispute with which the strike order is concerned. If he can show that the person whom he is attempting to get to break the commercial contract is a party to the primary dispute and has taken action in support of the primary employer he is entitled to secure the breaches of that contract as he may.


The only situation in which Clause 87 is designed to bite is that in which somebody sets out to procure breaches of a commercial contract on the part of someone in no sense connected with the original dispute.</p>

<p>I am keen to follow the Solicitor-General's thinking on this point. A dispute may arise in which the person referred to by the Solicitor-General is not a primary party to the dispute&#x2014;that is, but for a contractual relationship, that person would not be in the dispute. If the result of the making of a contractual relationship is such that the person is being employed to break the strike&#x2014;that is, by taking goods or services into that factory which will enable the person against whom the original dispute is being fought to continue his operations&#x2014;is that then, for his purposes, aiding and abetting the original party to the dispute, in this case the employer, because he is then able to perform his normal function? Is strikebreaking of that sort legal?<br/>
My second point is, how far does the hon. and learned Gentleman draw his line&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>

<p>I am anxious not to go further than I should in the discussion of Clause 87. Clause 87 is designed to deal with the secondary strike whether or not the primary strike is fair. It is designed to deal with the secondary strike directed at the entirely innocent party, as we would put it. In answer to the point made by the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, North (Mr. McNamara), the external party who takes action in support of the primary em-

ployer against whom the original strike is called, in a way which the hon. Gentleman suggested, would not fall into that category, and the strike against him would be fair and in no sense restricted by Clause 87. Perhaps we can return to discussing the many examples on that when we discuss Clause 87.<br/>
The central point about the Clause 86 strike is that it becomes unfair under the Clause only if the person against whom the complaint is brought is deliberately setting out to procure a secondary strike in support of the original unfair wrong purpose. This is at the root of some of the examples given by hon. Members opposite. For example, the present Post Office strike situation is about a fair objective, namely, the terms and conditions of the employees of the Post Office Corporation. There is no question of any secondary or sympathetic strike taken or induced in support of that fair primary strike being regarded as unfair.<br/>
Similarly, on the point put by the hon. Member for Plymouth, Sutton (Dr. David Owen) about the Fine Tubes strike, the original strike was in respect of the terms and conditions of pay&#x2014;a wages dispute&#x2014;and secondary strikes called in support of or in sympathy with that remain fair.<br/>
The same goes for the example put by the hon. Member for Lewisham, North when he spoke about the strike over redundancy pay. Certainly, if a strike were called, back in the time before the redundancy pay provisions were on the Statute Book in 1965, in protest at the lack of intention of the employer to make redundancy payments, that would be a strike about a term and condition of employment which would be a fair one, and any supporting or sympathetic action in respect of that would be fair.<br/>
If the original strike was itself unofficial, called not by the union but by unofficial wild-cat people in breach of original contracts of employment, then that would be unfair and the right to have sympathy strikes in support of that would not follow. But, surely, if the original strike in support of which sympathetic action is going to be justified is one that is related and can be related to terms and conditions of employment which can be perfectly fair, then it is not unreasonable at least to expect a strike to be called on due notice or by a union exercising authority.</p>

<p>As far as I know, the hon. and learned Gentleman has expounded the legal position quite correctly, but would he bend his mind to the industrial relations situation where there is an explosion of wrath which may ante-date by a considerable time any official recognition of the dispute. In the intervening time, what happens to the sympathetic action?</p>

<p>That is the point which I was making, and an entirely fair one. That is where one returns to the provisions of Clause 102(3), that if the original strike, be it fair or unfair, called by a registered or an unregistered organisation is caused or provoked by clumsy conduct on the part of management of the kind which has been identified and described in that situation, then the Industrial Court&#x2014;</p>

<p>That is an aspect of some importance to appreciate here. In the present state of our law, developing perhaps unpredictably by case law, if a court now decides that a strike was unlawful through the present series of hoops, the ordinary courts have no inbuilt power to say that that strike, although it may be unlawful in the present law, was so manifestly provoked by management's incompetence that it would be wrong to grant any remedy in respect of it. In this framework the court is required to take into account the extent to which the original strike was provoked by management's conduct.</p>

<p>Before the Solicitor-General goes on to the wider problems of what happens if the union happens to be unregistered, will he deal with this? Does he not see that in arguing on the Bill&#x2014;we do not accept, and the trade union movement does not accept, that there are unfair industrial practices&#x2014;that the original strike was an unfair industrial practice he is now depriving workpeople in the workshops of their right to judge whether they wish to express solidarity because in their opinion they do not accept the definition "unfair industrial practice" as having given rise to the first conflict? That

is a terrific widening of the deprivation of rights of working people to use their judgment on whether they are to exercise sympathy or solidarity or not.</p>

<p>I do not accept that it can be put in that way. The restraint is only in respect of the particular identified unfair practices. If someone is to claim the authority&#x2014;as sometimes is done without the full backing of trade union&#x2014;to call sympathetic strikes in pursuit of an objective already being pursued by other strikers, it is surely not unreasonable to say that the person claiming the right to call such a secondary supporting strike should satisfy himself as to the legitimacy of the primary objective.<br/>
In any given situation, judgment has to be made in the light of facts. The kind of sympathy strikes which I have in mind are those on recognition issues, one of the matters which have caused a great deal of unnecessary hardship to people employed in industry, and more widely than that. Most of the cases which current case-law is working out to give remedies concern recognition strikes, like Stratford <i>v.</i> Lindley and some other recent cases. The Torquay Grand Hotel case is another one. It is being done in the present situation creakingly and by chance.<br/>
What we are saying in the framework of the Bill is that there are new remedies per Clauses 42 to 48 where there is a recognition of a dispute, and that it is therefore fair to say that if a trade union is given the right to claim those remedies from an independent agency, it is unnecessary for it to resort to strike action when alternative machinery is made available for it.<br/>
It follows from that that if the union is striking for recognition against employer A and can have a remedy in respect of that claim, and if the strike action against employer A is unfair, it would be illogical if a strike by that union or by others supporting it against employer B should not be regarded as unfair as well, because they are part of the same use and exercise of borrowed strength. Borrowed strength can by all means be used in the support of ordinary, fair strikes; but I suggest to the Committee that unfair strikes where remedies are provided in the alternative in this way do not need to have this support.


The hon. Member for Liverpool, Kirkdale (Mr. Dunn) discussed a situation where it would be wrong to think that the Clause would prevent a union from striking. If because of a primary strike, fair or unfair, at a given place, the work-people at another factory were confronted with a change of work because the second factory manager was going to support the management at the first factory, that again would not be unfair, because people striking at the second workplace would have a fresh and separate primary cause of dispute.</p>

<p>What about the unregistered union point, to which the Solicitor-General was to return?</p>

<p>I have made it plain on these Clauses that the registered or unregistered union calling a secondary strike in support of an unfair objective is acting equally unfairly; but the official of the registered union is not, if acting within the scope of his authority.<br/>
Returning to the point made by the hon. Member for Sutton we are not here challenging the principle of people banding together to assert rights. That is at the heart of collective organisation in industrial relations. However, we assert that the principle is not one that can prevail over all else so as to threaten or destroy the rights of other people in all circumstances. What we are saying is that it is certainly right for that principle to prevail for most purposes&#x2014;for the overwhelming majority of purposes where the original cause of dispute is fair, and it is entirely right for borrowed strength to be used to that end; but not for all, not when the damage being done to that outside party&#x2014;the innocent party; this trespasses on Clause 87 as well&#x2014;is disproportionate to the scale and connectedness of the grievance which is provoking the primary strike. This is the balance we have tried to strike in Clause 87.<br/>
In the examples the hon. Gentleman put to me, if work was being switched from one dockyard to another&#x2014;say, from Devonport to Rosyth&#x2014;then, without knowing the detailed structure of Her Majesty's Dockyards management as the hon. Gentleman does, if they were in the single management of one organisation the primary-struck employer would be

one and the same throughout; it would all be part of the same primary strike.<br/>
However, if the work was switched from one company to another company which was quite separate and distinct as a means of combating the strike at the primary place of strike, the second company could no longer be regarded as extraneous. It would by taking action&#x2014;by taking work which would formerly have been done at the first dockyard&#x2014;be acting in support of the first employer or his management. So, again, the unions would be free to strike in each of those situations.<br/>
Therefore, we return to the reasonable situation, that in the area of strikes the calling of which we suggest to the Committee is unfair because alternative remedies are provided it should, and must logically be, equally unfair for there to be a supporting strike called in support of that unfair primary objective.</p>

<p>I have always thought of the Bill as a theological matter. The responses I had evoked to my quotations from the scriptures shows how right I was.<br/>
The Bill as a whole clearly turns into an unfair industrial action almost every weapon in the trade unionists limited industrial armoury. The phrase "unfair industrial action" is a euphemism which, although it deceives nobody, is clearly to be a breach of the law&#x2014;a breach of the law which, in spite of what the Solicitor-General has repeatedly said, could in some cases at least expose individuals and trade unions to orders for contempt in the county court, with all the consequences that could flow from that.<br/>
The Clause extends this very same vulnerability to any individual or trade union who directly or indirectly, deliberately or unwittingly, aid and abet the commission of any of these unfair industrial practices. I say&#x2014;and here I echo what so many of my hon. Friends have said&#x2014;that this is an enormous extension of the punitive provisions of the Bill, not least in the way it multiplies so many times the obnoxious effects of Clause 85.<br/>
7.0 p.m.<br/>
It is right that reference was made in the debate to Clause 87, because of the way in which that Clause is linked with and buttresses every reference to "unfair industrial practice" in the Bill, including that in Clause 87 itself. We challenge the validity of the whole concept of unfair industrial practice and its application in particular situations.<br/>
The Solicitor-General said that Clause 86 is only to prevent strike action which is designed to support unfair industrial action. But it is not just about strike action. It goes much wider than that, bad enough as that would be. It refers to
<q>calling, organising, procuring or financing a strike</q>
and
<q>organising, procuring or financing any irregular industrial action short of a strike".</q>
In spite of the number of times on which the question has been raised, we have never yet been given an adequate explanation of what is meant by "irregular action short of a strike". There have been references to the so-called definition in Clause 148, but no more than that.<br/>
When the hon. Member for Nelson and Colne was speaking, I could not help reflecting that in his references to Clause 5(1) he might have helped the Committee better if he had addressed himself to the absurdity which arises when we take Clause 86 in conjunction with Clause 5(1), that part of Clause 5 which gives every worker the right not to belong to a trade union and makes it an unfair industrial practice for anyone to seek to prevent his exercise of that right. Why did not the hon. Gentleman and his hon. and learned Friend try to explain to us what will happen in the sort of situation which will almost certainly arise when people refuse to co-operate with the non-unionist, when, inevitably, they will say, "We will not work with such an antisocial individual. We will not engage in the normal industrial relationship which is so essential to the smooth functioning of industry"? In that situation, will those workers be culpable under Clause 86?<br/>
The Solicitor-General says that he is aiming only at what everybody would consider to be the need to maintain a fair balance and to prevent people from


participating in unfair action in industrial relations. My hon. Friends have given many examples culled from their deep personal experience of industry, citing disputes and various actions arising from those disputes which it would be difficult to describe as unjustified or unfair. I can think of no example given from this side of the Committee in relation to which I, as a former shop steward, should not have been prone to embark on exactly the sort of action which was described in such situations, and I do not think that the Committee would regard me as an unfair or unreasonable individual.<br/>
Last night, I deliberately curtailed my remarks in winding up the debate, but I had in mind then a recent example which had come to my notice when I was a junior Minister in the Department of Employment and Productivity. I thought it significant then, and I think it relevant for the Committee's attention now. A building worker at a building site in Kent had been required by his employer to work on a platform which did not comply with the building regulations. He refused to work on that platform and encouraged his workmates to do likewise. The employer said that if he did not go back to his work and allow the matter to be resolved either through a visit from the building inspector or through the intervention of his union, he would be dismissed.<br/>
Under that coercive pressure from his employer, that man returned to the platform and dissuaded his workmates from taking industrial action. Two hours later, he was dead, having fallen from the platform.<br/>
In that situation, would it have been unfair industrial action if those workmen had gone on strike to compel their employer to do what he ought to have done and, in the event, save that man's life? It seems to me that under Clause 86 the employer would have been entitled to say, "Unless you return to work, I shall haul you before the court".</p>

<p>I repeat again the point which has been made many times. If ever there were a clear case in which the provisions of Clause 102 (3) would apply, the hon. Gentleman has just given it. It is inconceivable that a court

<p>&#x2014;seeking to restrain that strike would not take the view that the cause of the strike was the employer's attitude. The one change which the Bill would make is that the man threatened with dismissal could with confidence know that he could appeal against that unfair dismissal, and he would not have felt obliged to go back to work. In that way, the change in the law would enable him to stand on his rights and reach a different conclusion.</p>

<p>The Solicitor-General now tells us that the workman in that situation could console himself with the thought that, instead of having a straight choice between doing as he was told or being sacked, he would have a third option, the possibility that, if he refused to carry out the employer's instructions, he could eventually go to the court with some hope of succeeding. That would not console either him or me in such a situation. What I should have done would have been unhesitatingly, as a shop steward or not as a shop steward, to instruct&#x2014;let alone advise&#x2014;the work people on that site not to go upon that platform.</p>

<p>I am glad to hear that, but what about the other advice which the Solicitor-General has just given us? He says that that man could now take into account the possibility of taking action in the Industrial Court. The hon. learned Gentleman makes the same error that all lawyers seem to make in assuming that work people will go to the courts with the readiness which they themselves go to pick up their fees. He seems to be unaware that the apparatus of the courts, whether the judicial apparatus set up under the Bill or the existing county courts and the rest, is an awesome apparatus from which ordinary people, very understandably, recoil.</p>

<p>Hon. Members opposite in this debate, as in so many others, show an alarming lack of familiarity with the realities of not only the functioning of industry but the psychological climate within which people work, the pressures to which they are subjected, and the way in which they normally respond to those pressures.<br/>
Having given that example, I return once more to the question repeatedly pursued by my hon. Friend the Member for Blackley. We are still waiting for a reply. On Second Reading, my hon. Friend put it to the Secretary of State:
<q>Will the right hon. Gentleman clarify Clause 86, with regard to aiding and abetting, which hitherto has been a strictly criminal concept? Does it mean that the trade union which supports action under Clause 85 and turns a strike into an official strike is guilty of aiding and abetting and loses the immunity of the 1906 Act?"&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT. 14th December, 1970; Vol. 808, c. 979.]</q>
The essential point on which my hon. Friend seeks an answer is this. Suppose an unofficial strike begins and is caught as being an unfair practice under Clause 85, but is subsequently made into an official strike by the union. Does it cease to be an unfair industrial practice? If the Solicitor-General wants to intervene to give us a clear, unambiguous answer I shall readily give way. I want him to understand very clearly the importance of the point. In the engineering industry what I have described is not an exceptional rarity, but is part of the normality, the generality of the situation. With the frequent references to the number of unofficial strikes, the Government seem not to have understood that in engineering almost every strike, because of the negotiating procedure and trade union rules, must start off as unofficial. If the hon. and learned Gentleman, having understood that, will now give us the reply we have been waiting for since Christmas, I will allow him to intervene.</p>

<p>If the hon. Gentleman will be patient, I was about to say that his hon. Friend raised it on Second Reading two months ago. As a result of his doing so, we have looked again at the form of words in the Clause, because the function of hon. Members raising points in debate is for us to he able to examine them.<br/>
If an unofficial strike under Clause 85 has already been induced, and thereafter the union makes it official, the union is not doing anything to aid and abet the inducing of the original unfair strike. The original unfair unofficial strike has already taken place, and nothing the union thereafter does aids and abets that.<br/>
The point put by the hon. Member for Manchester, Blackley in the debate on Second Reading was that the use of the words "aid and abet" had criminal overtones. The hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Leith (Mr. Murray) made a similar point this afternoon. We were asked to look at the matter again. Our conclusion was that the use of those words makes it plain that the union doing that is not aiding and abetting. If we had replaced the phrase with civil words, such as "supporting or assisting", or something like them, the difficulty might arise. But if a person has induced the original unfair strike, any subsequent action making it an official strike is not an aiding and abetting of the inducing of the original strike.</p>

<p>Does the original strike still remain an unfair industrial practice?</p>

<p>It is not the strike that remains an unfair practice. The point is that the original inducing by the unofficial leader of the first strike, if that be the case, is unfair. <i>[Laughter.]</i> There is no point in hon. Members saying "Ha, ha". It is a matter then for very great doubt as to whether employers would in many or any cases necessarily bring proceedings in respect of the originally induced strike. In any event, thereafter the action of the union in making it official does not amount to an aiding and abetting of the original inducing.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1971-02-17a.1914.3" hansard_membership_id="6836" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/29659" speakername="Mr. Walker" colnum="1914" time="">
<p>Now we really find ourselves confronted with questions. I do not want to weary the Committee with repeated references to actual situations


that arise within industry. But many of my hon. Friends will have been confronted with a change of practice arbitrarily and suddenly introduced without fair warning by an employer. They as shop stewards or workpeople will have come to the conclusion that an unsafe practice or a health hazard is being introduced, and they must make an immediate response, afterwards seeking ratification from their district committee. It seems that when they have said to the workpeople, "We advise you not to carry out the employer's instruction until we have contacted our district committee", they have thus initiated an unofficial strike and rendered themselves guilty of an unfair industrial practice. No matter what the district committee or even the employers' federation may subsequently say, no matter what the generality of opinion may be, it still seems that they have irreversibly committed something that is illegitimate, not to say illegal, under the Bill.<br/>
The union having subsequently endorsed the action and given it an official stamp, the question arises whether it is not only the resources of the individual who induced that unfair industrial action that are exposed to the action for damages in the courts but whether the union's resources are also exposed. This is a new question. The Solicitor-General would have been well advised to apply himself to it. We keep turning over these stones in the Bill and exposing some very ugly things underneath.<br/>
The change of emphasis on the Government's part should not go unnoticed. It used to be accepted that whether a strike was official or unofficial was a question entirely within the union's discretion and its rules, which could vary from union to union. Three or four unions could be involved in a strike that was unofficial under the rules of one union, and official under the rules of the next. So, in an identical situation, some members of the work group are guilty under Clause 85 and some, for exactly the same offence, are not. There used to be talked, much more logically, about constitutional and unconstitutional strikes. Now the Government have got back on the old band wagon of unofficial strikes and official strikes, and this is

leading them into curious byways. They are getting lost on the way.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend is fully aware of the point I want to make, but I make it to emphasise again to the Solicitor-General that within the engineering industry practically every strike, apart from a national strike called by the executive council, starts off as as an unofficial dispute but is possibly made official at a later stage, first by the district committee and then by the executive council. Will not it be the case now that a union such as the A.U.E.W., to protect itself, may have to make its rules such that a strike becomes official from the time the members take that action, because otherwise it is vulnerable right along the line?</p>

<p>My hon. Friend accurately puts his finger on one of the inconsistencies of the Government's approach. Their theme has been one of strengthening the central official authorities of the unions against those whom they describe as the trouble-makers at the bottom, the shop stewards. They fail to recognise that an inevitable consequence of their approach will be to compel unions to alter their rules to give the shop stewards the authority that they have so far lacked. An inevitable by-product will be a strengthening of the hands of the shop stewards. Only in that way will unions be able to give the shop steward the necessary protection.</p>

<p>Will my hon. Friend also pursue the point of what happens over a strike that was constitutional when it started but is then declared un-stitutional by the trade union executive. Is it totally legal one minute and the next minute illegal, and are people responsible for what happened before or what happened after?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1971-02-17a.1916.4" hansard_membership_id="6836" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/29659" speakername="Mr. Walker" colnum="1916" time="">
<p>I would not attempt to reply to that very complex point off the cuff. My hon. Friend has put a matter for reflection on the great complexity of the industrial situation. Hon. Members opposite seem to assume that what is very complex is really very simple. It is nothing of the kind. The labyrinthine process that my hon. Friend has just described is part of the procedure that


shop stewards must reconcile themselves to and work within every day of the working week.<br/>
I suspect that the Committee is getting anxious to draw the debate to a conclusion, but I do not want to finish without referring to the Solicitor-General's reference to Clause 87. I do not want to transgress on what will no doubt be an interesting debate on Clause 87, but I remind the Committee that he stated that it was important not to interpret the provisions of the Clause, and, indeed, the Bill, too widely. But it is not a question of how we interpret it; it is a question of how the courts interpret it. They will not heed the Solicitor-General's honeyed words but the black and white of the Bill.<br/>
The Solicitor-General says that he is not seeking to outlaw all sympathetic strikes. We await with eagerness and interest to see how he reconciles that statement with the sweeping and far-reaching provisions of Clause 87. That Clause clearly outlaws all strikes which lead to a breach of contract other than a breach of employment. Sympathy strikes, under Clause 86, even those that do not fall foul of the requirements of Clause 86&#x2014;strikes that are in breach of contracts of employment&#x2014;could often, and in many ways almost invariably, lead to a breach of commercial contract and will thus be caught under Clause 87. In effect, the hon. and learned Gentleman is saying, "I am lying in wait with a double-barrelled gun. If I miss with the first shot I can use the second barrel."<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Penistone (Mr. John Mendelson) went to the heart of the matter. I echo what he said. By the provisions of Clause 86,</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1971-02-17a.1918.0" colnum="1918" time="">
<p>the Government have at a stroke rendered unlawful a vast range of actions which have traditionally been part of the fabric of industrial relations for over a century. That may well be their intention, in spite of the silken words of the Solicitor-General, which implied that they were only suppressing practices which they regarded as anti-social and a deterrent to industrial efficiency. Whatever the Government may say, trade unionists and, I am sure, the whole Committee, will now be under no such illusions but will recognise that the Government's real purpose is to weaken drastically and dramatically the bargaining power of working people in industry.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1971-02-17a.1918.1" colnum="1918" time="">
<p>My hon. Friends in earlier debates, and my hon. Friend the Member for Penistone again today, raised the spectre of the corporate State. Let there be no mistake. The road on which the Government are embarked, as exemplified in these Clauses, is the path that has been trodden by every Fascist dictator this century. [HON. MEMBERS: "Rubbish."] Other Governments have shown that one can produce a quietness and passivity in industrial relations by removing the power and the strength of the workers to react against conditions which bear hardly on their lives. The Government are removing weapons which have traditionally been available to trade unions and trade unionists to fight for their cause&#x2014;and this is the practice which has been carried out by every Fascist dictator in this century. I therefore ask the Committee to reject the Clause.</p>

<p>In the course of these debates, the Secretary of State has been described as the Sorcerer's Apprentice. I regard the Solicitor-General as the Tory Party's friendly insurance agent. He is very adept with words. He has a beguiling tongue and all the skill and ability required of an insurance agent to sell a death policy as a life policy. The Bill which he is promoting, particularly Clause 87, and I am here concerned with subsections (2) and (3), is the death policy for certain traditional and basic rights which the trade union movement regards as essential for the legitimate conduct of its affairs.<br/>
As with all insurance policies, the small print of the document must be read. I have said before that the clear intention of the Tory Party is to maim the trade union movement. [HON. MEMBERS: "Nonsense."] We will see whether it is nonsense. Some parts of the document

are fairly subtle. The right not to join a trade union seems on the surface to be reasonable, as does the establishment of the agency shop. Clause 61(3), which gives parliamentary licence to blackleg, appears to be on the surface to be reasonable. But on Clause 87(2) and (3) the fair and reasonable mask of the Tory Party starts to slip. This is where we get the more brutal application of the principle which the Tories have pursued since June of this year and before, and it is to damage, shackle, and inhibit the British trade union movement.<br/>
I do not doubt that in his friendly way over the Dispatch Box the Solicitor-General will say that that is not true and that the Government are being fair and reasonable and that their intention is to strengthen and not weaken the trade union movement. The test of their sincerity lies not in the imposition of policing duties on officials of that movement, but on the one test of whether in a situation of industrial conflict their actions strengthen the workers involved. I am a great believer in the litmus test in politics. Any situation can be dipped to see whether the litmus comes out red or blue, and if the Industrial Relations Bill is given the political litmus test, it is very "blue", and subsections (2) and (3) are the brightest hue of all.<br/>
We are bound to approach the Clause, as we approached all the others, with deep and profound suspicion. We believe that we are justified in that suspicion and that our accusations against the Tory Party of wanting to maim trade unions are fully justified and well founded. The Conservatives are primarily responsible for helping to create an environment of hostility against trade unions in British society. Anyone who doubts that should read reports of weekend gatherings of the Tory faithful.<br/>
We have witnessed the hysterical outburst by the Chancellor of the Exchequer on the T.U.C's document on inflation which every sensible person in the country thinks was a fair assessment of the problem and gave some indication of how to get out of it. Then there were the recent speeches in the Enfield, West constituency where the Tory candidate spoke of what he termed the arrogance of the trade unions. And we need go no further than the Young Tories conference where they were foaming at the mouth wanting to take away supplementary benefits from


people who were on legitimate strike. Then there was the performance the Tory Party gave on the Consultative Document which gave less credence to the point of view of the T.U.C. than to the views of their friends in the B.M.A. Now we have the guillotine which is a contempt of working people.<br/>
We should also remember the conduct of the Conservative Party during the General Election. This is where I come to the interjection from one hon. Gentleman who shouted "Nonsense" at the beginning of my speech. If at the General Election Labour supporters had asked for details of the sort which are now to be found in Clause 87(3) and we had told them that the Tory Party meant to impose agreements on workers who do not want them the reply of the Tory Party would have been "You are far too suspicious. Our motives are pure and clear. We have no intention on those lines." That is what they would have said on 17th June. But they have not said it on this Bill in relation to Clauses 35 to 40. The clear pattern of Conservative strategy comes out clearly in Clauses 87(2) and (3). This is part of the Government's attack on the trade union movement, and is blatantly pro-employer.<br/>
The situation which will arise from the Bill is that workers are to be divided whereas employers are to be strengthened. Wedges are to be driven between workers on the shop floor since there are to be differences between registered and unregistered unions which will lead to the inability of one set of workers to help another. Even the rights of registered trade unions are to be impaired. Clause 87(2) and (3) will mean that the sympathetic strike will be ruled out. Indeed I suggest that any question of striking at all will for all practical purposes be ruled out. I shall come to that matter a little later.<br/>
Clause 87(3)<i>(a)</i> will strengthen employers and give them protection where they are already united and subsection (3)<i>(c)</i> encourages the unity for industrial political purposes where those employers are not bound under paragraph <i>(a).</i> We seem to be reaching the stage of the growth of a private political industrial fund organised by employers for employers which is to be used by them at their discretion without any restrictions being put on the use of that fund. Are

we to anticipate the situation in America since it would appear that American law is being brought into this country? By bringing in American law and practices this could lead to anti-trade union vigilantes financed by this fund to strike-break; and a new age of Pinkerton will arrive on the British industrial scene.</p>

<p>I will give way to the hon. Gentleman a little later since I shall be mentioning him. The situation could arise in Clause 87(3)<i>(a)</i> in which an associated employer could be instrumental in imposing an agreement under Clauses 35 to 40 and it is to this practice we most object. Men who have been bound by an agreement to which they have never agreed could not strike justifiably because that would be regarded as an unfair practice and they would be forbidden to engage in any sympathetic action against an associated employer.<br/>
For a definition of "associated employer" we have to look forward to Clause 148(5) where we discover that the term will mean controlling employers, a situation which puts a different light on the words. The essential power of trade unions and the whole concept of trade union solidarity is being disrupted. The fiction is being introduced in Clause 87 that it will be the workers alone in an industrial dispute situation who would be regarded as being isolated and not part of a highly complex interrelated society and there will be no means for their colleagues to assist them. Then when the workers step into the real world situation and begin to ask their fellow workers for help in a dispute penalties will be imposed on the trade union.<br/>
7.45 p.m.<br/>
The Tory Party appears to me to want to have it both ways. The Government Front Bench spokesman quote Victor Feather in terms of the idea that one man's strike is another man's lay-off. Perhaps I could interpose the point of view that one man's strike can also be another man's protection. This is one of the reasons we in the unions do not get hysterical about strikes. In voicing their contributions from the Conservative benches, Tory Party spokesmen recognise the interdependence of our whole complex society. They then come to the fictitional part that one man's strike must


not be actively backed by another man. They deny to the worker the reality of having to live in the real world. This is the denial to the worker brought about by subsections (2) and (3) although there is no such denial for the employers. They are to be allowed to live in a world of reality. They will be able to get help, assistance, guidance, and people to join with them in decision-making and association in the dispute in terms of complete impunity.<br/>
We see from subsection (3,<i>c</i>) that employers by donating money to a fighting fund, which is what it will be, can play a key r&#x00F4;le in industrial disputes. They can inject cash into a dispute situation, they can buy labour and use it for strike-breaking. If that fund happens to be drained away because they decide to intervene in a dispute which they think is an essential matter of principle, in the long-term interests of employers they can evade Clause 87(3,<i>c</i>) as being directly or indirectly involved by writing an innocuous letter saying that, because of certain industrial disputes, the fund has drained away and they need another cash inflow. But they need not mention the dispute that is involved. We all know that in those terms a nod is as good as a wink. Again, they can get away with it with complete impunity.<br/>
The employers by the terms of the Clause are to be given room for man&#x0153;uvre which is to be denied by the trades union movement. We all know that they can act secretly and discreetly as they always have done at the golf club, or in telephone calls, or in contacts with their interlocking directorships which we all read about, whereas the workers are always forced to be absolutely open about what they require to do. We are required to have mass meetings, but no private telephone calls. The employers will be able openly to taunt workers with the combined strength and the use of the political industrial fighting fund in a unity sanctified by Parliament in Clauses 85 to 87 of the Bill.<br/>
One of the ironies of the situation is that the political industrial fighting fund will come out of the pockets of the workers. The workers will be required by their efforts not only to put up the profits which will go in dividends or in

directors' salaries or in investments. The workers will also be required to provide the profits for an employers' fighting fund. We are duty bound to ask the Solicitor-General whether money in that fund will be included in the information which employers will be required to give to the trade unions under some of the less objectionable Clauses of the Bill.<br/>
We have objections to almost the whole of the Bill. They are not academic, as some hon. Members opposite have suggested. They are based on the experience of the creation of similar types of fund. I refer to the political funds of Aims of Industry and the Tory Party. One knows that that sort of fund is used to influence decisions. This Bill is almost part of the pay-off for the increased cash flow into the Tory Party coffers before 18th June. It is a pay-off for services rendered.<br/>
The Labour Party and the trade union movement put a great deal of credence in the need for solidarity. In our view, a sympathetic strike is an essential weapon for working people. It is one of our weapons in a very limited armoury in the industrial relations situation. We do not use it terribly frequently. We intend to keep it for the basic principal industrial dispute, where something crucial is at stake. We do not use the sympathetic strike in every strike situation; we use it very rarely. But when we employ it we do so because there is something absolutely essential at stake for the whole trade union movement.<br/>
Yesterday the hon. Member for Barry (Mr. Gower) said&#x2014;and I paraphrase his words&#x2014;that if anyone could show him that the Tory Party would take away the worker's right to strike he would join us in the Lobby. He will have to join us in the Lobby in our fight against Clause 87 because subsection (1)<i>(b),</i> for all practical purposes, takes away the worker's right to strike. The Solicitor-General may deny that, but I do not think he can because the wording of subsection (1)<i>(b)</i>&#x2014;and that is the crucial provision&#x2014;is such that the worker's right to strike is taken away. The Government were bound to notice this. If they noticed it, we must ask why no Government Amendment to the Clause has been tabled to clarify the situation if they did not want to take away the worker's right to strike.


Subsection (1) provides that any person&#x2014;not a registered or unregistered trade union&#x2014;who interferes
<q>with the performance by another person of a contract</q>
to which that other person is a party shall be indulging in an unfair industrial practice if the other person is an extraneous party. It does not refer to any person stopping the performance of work upon a contract. It merely refers to a person interfering with the performance of a person who is extraneous to the industrial dispute. This would appear to be a blanket provision against the worker's right to strike, whether he be in a registered or unregistered trade union.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman knows perfectly well that yesterday I were referring to Clause 114, which provides that there shall be no order or injunction to
<q>compel an employee to do any work or to attend at any place for the purpose of doing any work.</q></p>

<p>There are different ways of skinning the industrial worker. If he engages in an unfair industrial practice there are other ways of getting him back to work without obviously ordering him to do so. The hon. Gentleman's excuse will not do and he will have to join us in the Lobby because all strikes interfere with someone's ability to perform a contract. What about the postmen? What about the railwaymen, if they decide to strike? Their strikes are bound to interfere with the performance of an extraneous party. A railwayman going on strike in Cumnock, in Ayrshire, could well interfere with the performance of a person extraneous to the industrial dispute. In Wolverhampton&#x2014;well, we all know about people in some parts of Wolverhampton.<br/>
The Solicitor-General, if he agrees with my interpretation of the Clause, is bound to give us an assurance that he will undertake to amend it on Report.<br/>
I said that the solidarity of the Labour movement in a sympathetic strike situation is absolutely vital. The Labour Party rejects the philosophy not only of this Clause but of the Bill and I ask my hon. Friends to vote against it, although we shall get an opportunity to repeal it later.</p>

<p>None was intended. I was simply congratulating the hon. Gentleman on his skill to indulge in what appeared at times close to a general tirade against the Bill and yet speak to the Amendment.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman said that sympathetic strikes were rarely employed by the trade union movement. That may well be so. All that the Clause seeks to do is to ensure that it is not only rarely but fairly employed as a tactic, and I believe that Parliament has the right to lay down the circumstances which it regards as fair.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman also attempted to show that subsection (2)<i>(b)</i> affects the right of workpeople to strike and withdraws the provisions of Clause 114. But subsection (1)<i>(b)</i> refers not to people taking part in a strike but only to the steps set out in Clause 86(2)<i>(a)</i>; that is,
<q>calling, organising, procuring or financing a strike",</q>
not taking part in a strike. Only those actions can conceivably come within Clause 87(1)<i>(b).</i><br/>
But the effect of the Amendments would be, first to allow the calling of strikes and other industrial actions in support of primary strikes which are unfair. Surely that is a nonsense. I can understand hon. Members opposite disputing whether any industrial action should be unfair, but, having once said that certain industrial action is unfair, to say that there could be sympathetic strikes in support of it is a manifest nonsense.<br/>
Secondly, the Amendments would (allow industrial actions to be called against persons or firms not involved in the dispute. We can argue about precisely what "involved in a dispute" means and where one draws the line at the relationship between "actively involved" and "not actively involved". But the country widely recognises that so-called sympathetic strikes against firms which are totally uninvolved in the


primary dispute are unfair, and Parliament should make it clear that they are unfair.<br/>
The hon. Member for Lewisham, North (Mr. Moyle), speaking in a previous debate, complained that those involved in industrial relations would be inhibited because they would feel that they had to have regard not only to industrial relations factors but to the background of the law. All I can say is that it may be a factor to bear in mind, but all of us in our lives, certainly those engaged in commerce, have always to bear in mind the background of the law. If society decides it is right that the law should make a dividing line between what is fair and what is unfair, of course that is right. Parliament will decide in this instance, and surely it is not too great a burden to ask those engaged in industrial relations to bear this provision in mind, as they do others.<br/>
I see no merit at all in these amendments, and I hope that they will be rejected by the Committee.</p>

<p>I do not wish to make a speech which might be more appropriate to the Question, That the Clause stand part of the Bill, but in view of the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Sillars) and by the hon. Member for Paddington, South (Mr. Scott), I think it should be made clear just to what extent this Clause as it stands will interfere with the fundamental right to strike. I do not think hon. Members opposite have fully understood this. At least I hope they have not, for I am prepared to credit them with the belief that they are preserving some of the vestiges of the right to strike.<br/>
The Clause as it stands, in my view&#x2014;and I am speaking with some experience as a lawyer engaged in industrial matters &#x2014;would destroy the right to strike in almost all circumstances, notwithstanding that all the requisite notices have been given, and despite lengthy negotiations beforehand and regardless of the fact that the union is a registered union. The right of workers, and their unions, to withdraw their labour is effectively abolished by this Clause.<br/>
The Solicitor-General in the debate on the last Clause said that it would be neces-

sary in cases covered by the last Clause for the employer or person aggrieved, taking a claim for damages before the Industrial Court, to establish that the trade union knew of the specific contract which was involved. With respect to the Solicitor-General, this is completely contrary to the judgment of the House of Lords in the case of Stratford <i>v.</i> Lindley (1964 &#x2014;3 All E.R. 102). In that case it was held by Lord Reid (p. 106), after reciting the facts:
<q>The respondents knew that barges were always returned promptly on the completion of the job for which they had been hired, and it must have been obvious to them that this was done under contracts between the appellants and the barge hirers. It was argued that there was no evidence that they were sufficiently aware of the terms of these contracts to know that their interference would involve breaches of these contracts; but I think that at this stage it is reasonable to infer that they did know that.</q>
I submit that, as the law is laid down by the House of Lords in that case, it is not necessary to establish that the union responsible for breaking the contract actually knew of it, if it is reasonable to infer that the union knew of the contract. If that is the case, then every strike is going to involve an unfair industrial practice, because every strike, as my hon. Friend the Member for South Ayrshire pointed out, results in other parties who are completely extraneous to the dispute breaking their contracts. I think that probably every business in the country has had to break some contract or another by reason of the postal dispute.<br/>
It is hypocritical for hon. Members opposite to say that the right to strike is being preserved, while at the same time they are declaring that every strike is unfair which involves any extraneous parties breaking their contracts, which the union ought reasonably to be capable of info ring existed. If that is so, then the right to strike is effectively abolished by this Clause. Every time there is a strike on a transport undertaking it involves breaches of contract between extraneous parties of contracts of which the union might well be held to have imputed knowledge, as in the decision in Stratford <i>v.</i> Lindley. Every time there is a strike on a building site between the employees of one contractor and his employers that strike will necessarily involve breaches of contract between other contractors on the site and the principal contractor and sub-contractors. Every time


there is a strike in any firm in industry which is supplying components to another factory which in turn has contracts to deliver goods reprocessed to yet another concern, there will be a breach of contract. It must be obvious that it is likely to be established successfully before the Industrial Court that the union, particularly when a national union is concerned, knew that goods from factory A go to factory B and from there reprocessed to factory C, and that a strike at factory A affects factory B and factory C, and will involve a breach of contract between B and C.<br/>
If this Clause is not substantially amended the right to strike is completely and effectively abolished. I sincerely hope that we shall hear from the Solicitor-General an assurance that this Clause will be fundamentally amended, before we get to Report.</p>

<p>I do not wish to intervene to curtail the debate but in order. I hope to clear the ground on which the discussion is taking place.<br/>
The intention of this Clause is to replace and clarify the present rather imprecise area in which the courts are developing the right to restrain certain kinds of strike which can be described as secondary boycotts. At the moment such strikes are actionable in the ordinary courts in some cases. The hon. Member for Kensington, North (Mr. Douglas-Mann) mentioned one example, Stratford v. Lindley. Johnson Matthey is a more recent case. The Torquay hotel case is another case. There is a growing number.</p>

<p>That may be so. The hon. Member may have started it. I do not want to deny him his credit. That is something of which I was not necessarily aware.<br/>
This Clause is not intended to deny the right to strike or of secondary boycott but to redefine it. It has to be read alongside the provisions of Clause 118 which remove litigation about the inducement of breaches of contract from the ordinary courts.<br/>
So we are here concerned with the extent to which it should be an unfair

industrial practice for certain kinds of secondary strikes to be called&#x2014;secondary boycotts; by which I mean a strike designed and intended to procure breach by an innocent extraneous third party to a commercial contract. The intention here is that this should be done not by reference any longer to the maze of case law to which the Donovan Report referred, but only when it can be shown that somebody has intentionally set about securing or organising industrial action in order to induce a breach by another to produce the non-performance of a commercial contract.<br/>
Beyond that, the right is only to be available, as my hon. Friend the Member for Paddington, South (Mr. Scott) pointed out, when it can be said that the party who is being induced to break or not to perform a contract is extraneous, innocent, outside, not supporting the primary dispute.<br/>
The Committee will no doubt, want to discuss the merits or the demerits of that concept in whole or in part, whether we have tried to draw correctly this definition of the areas within which getting innocent parties to break their contracts should be fair or unfair&#x2014;whether that has been properly drawn. That is a matter which the Committee will want to debate.<br/>
But there is one matter which both hon. Members opposite have already mentioned, the hon. Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Sillars) and the hon. Member for Kensington, North when they said that the wording, as it stands, of subsection (1)<i>(b)</i>&#x2014;and I take the point made by the hon. Member for Kensington, North&#x2014;about interfering with the performance by another person of a contract, goes, or may go, too widely. That is certainly a point which has some force in it, and I undertake here and now that those words will be looked at.<br/>
It is not our intention to do anything along the lines which the hon. Member for Kensington, North suggested, namely, to produce a situation in which the calling of strike action which results inevitably, accidentally and consequentially in the breaking of commercial contracts by the employer against whom the strike is called is proscribed, struck at or impedes by the Clause.


The intention is that the calling, procuring or organising of industrial action should be unfair within the concept of Clause 87(1) if the purpose or principal purpose of the person calling, procuring or organising that action is to induce another person to break&#x2014;the existing words of Clause 87(1)<i>(a)</i>&#x2014;or not to perform a contract to which that other person is a party. But there has to be a deliberate intention of the person who is possibly being proscribed by the Clause to produce the breach or non-performance of the contract; in other words the situation that arose in the Torquay hotel case where the intention of the party striking or the strike-calling party was to procure a breach of the oil delivery contracts or, at the very least, non-delivery of the oil under the contracts. The important thing is that it should be the intended result of the secondary unfair strike that someone innocent of the primary dispute should be obliged to break or not perform his contract.<br/>
That is clearly not the result of the wording as it now is, but I hope the Committee will accept from me that we do not want to waste our time in talking about a wrong form, we want to talk about the objective of the Clause.</p>

<p>The hon. Member says that we shall have to change the words, and I accept that. Because the matter ranges more widely than this, the question is how far we should seek to describe a party as extraneous.

<p>I am obliged for the assurance which the Solicitor-General has given.

<p>I take the hon. Gentleman's point. I am not sure that

I go as far as he does in saying that Stratford <i>v.</i> Lindley or the other cases were wrong. The courts have said that it is not necessary for the person calling the strike to know the precise form and terms of a given contract if he plainly knows or must know of the existence of a contract of that kind. We do not want someone to be in jeopardy under the Clause if something which he knows not of or suspects not of is accidentally, consequentially broken. I undertake to look at the formulation of the knowledge point in the Stratford <i>v.</i> Lindley, the Torquay hotel and other cases to make certain that this is clearly met.</p>

I am not seeking to mislead the Committee by saying that the undertaking I gave alters the substance of the intention of the Clause as hon. Members opposite are entitled to criticise it. I am merely trying to make clear, for the assistance of the Committee, the ground we are debating, which is the proposition that certain people wholly innocent of a primary industrial dispute are entitled not to be persuaded by industrial action to break contracts when they have done nothing whatsoever to intervene in or to support the party to the primary dispute. It is that which the Committee will want to debate, and I hope the Committee will forgive me for having intervened to deal with this narrow point.</p>

<p>I want to understand the Solicitor-General's point about the question raised by the hon. Member for Kensington, North. Is it the intention of the Government that if anybody is to be guilty under the Clause he must be shown to have a precise intention, and that it will not be left to such words as "in contemplation or furtherance" but will be a precise <i>mens rea</i> that is required?</p>
</speech>

<p>The reason for including the words "in contemplation or furtherance" is to confine the jurisdiction of the Industrial Court to an industrial disputes matter, but the point which the hon. and learned Member for Montgomery put is an important one distinct from that. Hon. Members have already put several different shades and nuances on this. The precise intention, with precise knowledge to secure the breach of a given contract, is putting it at its highest, and the hon. and learned Member will know several cases in which it is plain that the person inducing the strike, so it has been held, knew or must have known of the existence of a particular contract although he may not have seen the document in writing. I do not think that one can be required to go as far as that, but all the points made, including the one made by the hon. and learned Member, will be borne in mind.</p>

<p>I have much sympathy with the Solicitor-General's point about an innocent party being pushed to break a contract. Does he recognise the difference between using a strike to prevent a party entering into a contract and using a strike to break a contract? I will perhaps expand this if I say a word on my Amendment which comes in this group. There is a difference between preventing the carrying out of a contract and preventing a contract being entered into.</p>

<p>That is a valid point, but the Clause as drawn does not seek to proscribe a strike which is designed to prevent a contract being entered into. It is designed to prevent a strike which is intended to secure the breach or non-performance of a subsisting contract. I do not think that any case law goes so

far as to make unfair the prevention of someone from entering into a contract, and it is not the Government's intention to go that far. It would be a completely new principle in this field of law, as in any other, to say that people should be unable to take action to prevent the creation of new contractual relationships, so the point of the hon. Member is already borne in mind in the Clause.<br/>

<p>I am grateful to you, Miss Harvie Anderson, for giving me the opportunity of putting a question to the Solicitor-General which I feel must be prefaced by some explanation. I felt it improper to intervene with my question because the introduction that would be necessary before coming to the question would be so long that you would have said that it was not an intervention.


The Solicitor-General has said that he is dissatisfied with the Clause. I want to tell him that his dissatisfaction is only one-hundredth or possibly one-thousandth of the dissatisfaction felt with the Clause on this side of the Committee. I believe that my hon. Friends will feel that only the acceptance of the Amendment which seeks to dispose of this section entirely will be a satisfactory outcome and that no modification of the subsection will meet the case.<br/>
On the other hand it is a welcome sign that the Solicitor-General should have seen that what he is proposing could have serious consequences, going beyond even the Government's intentions. There are certain other circumstances not covered. The hon. and learned Gentleman has said that he proposes to modify the Clause so that people who are coincidentally affected are not brought within its range. What of the circumstances in which people, through trade union solidarity, are brought quite intentionally into a position of industrial dispute?<br/>
Hon. Gentlemen opposite underestimate the effects of taking one action upon such areas. They have seen already, and it was a surprise to many of them, that as the result of a previous Clause they have restricted the freedom of the Press. Similarly, as a result of this Clause&#x2014;and I want to know whether the Amendment will cover it&#x2014;traditional trade union solidarity will be seriously undermined.<br/>
I will give an example of what is a fairly frequent occurrence. Two or three times a year a situation arises in the film studios when technicians and actors are unpaid. The reason is the chaotic financing of the film industry, which has always been done on the basis that films are seldom made by the parent company. Generally speaking, even very major films are made by small companies created for the purpose with small capital, sometimes only &#x00A3;100.<br/>
The consequence of that is that in the event of a default in payment at the end of the film&#x2014;unfortunately, this happens occasionally&#x2014;the situation arises that the film is complete but payment is not made. In these circumstances it is not unusual for the Association of Cinematographic Technicians to give an

instruction to workers in a film laboratory not to continue with the processing of this film until after the other people have been paid. Consider the situation that arises here. Here we do not even have the same employer because the film is made by one employer and by this time is the property, probably, of the distributor.<br/>
Hon. Members opposite have not given due weight to the effect of trade union solidarity. The example I have given can no doubt be matched elsewhere in industry. I am sure that my hon. Friends will have other examples of situations in which workers, on a sheer fraternal basis, possibly having in mind some long-term advantages&#x2014;or the avoidance of disadvantages&#x2014;will take this kind of action. In this case these people take such action because it is the only action which can be taken in the circumstances to ensure that those who made the film are paid. Often payment is not made by the company which owes the money, but by the distributor who has purchased the film. This is because he has a product and he wants to sell it. If he does not pay there is the possibility that his film will never get on the market. What is the situation here?<br/>
Here is a trade union giving official instructions to a group of members not directly involved in the original dispute. In some instances the instructions will be given not even on behalf of the members of the same union but on behalf of members in other unions. A decision of this sort has been taken in the Federation of Film Unions and all the parties are a party to the decision. Who is responsible? Who can be proceeded against under the Bill, and what is the consequence of that action?<br/>
I would like the Solicitor-General, when he returns to the defence, to tell us in these circumstances who is caught by the Bill. Is it the workers as trade unionists or the trade union officials, and if it is, then of which union? Will he also say whether, once the changes to the Bill have been made, this action will be impossible to operate? If this is the case, then certainly in this industry he will create more trouble than he imagines because it will then be necessary for the trade unions to take alternative action which will have repercussions far more severe, not only for the unions but for the employers.


8.30 p.m.<br/>
Right hon. and hon. Gentlemen opposite may have wondered why the Federation of Film Producers decided to express its doubts and fears about the Bill. The reason is not that its members are not perhaps contributors to Conservative Party funds and that they do not approve of the Government's action in principle. The reason is that members of the federation are like very many other employers; and this is where disillusionment is beginning to set in among right hon. and hon. Gentlemen opposite. Even they are beginning to doubt the validity of the Bill.<br/>
The general proposition has been put out to the Press by the Conservative Party that something should be done about the trade unions, and it has gained general assent. Hon. Members have made these broad statements in their election addresses, and they have gained general consent. However, when they come to spell out these matters in detail in Clauses like this one, they begin to see that, not only for employees but for employers, something is being eroded which is precious to the trade unions, to employers and to the country as a whole.<br/>
I hope that the Solicitor-General will say that no Amendment or alteration is necessary because he thinks that the whole Clause should be deleted.</p>

<p>At the beginning of his speech, the hon. Member for Putney (Mr. Hugh Jenkins) said that the whole of Clause 87 should be deleted. However, I think that it is one of the most fundamental Clauses in the Bill, in which very important issues are at stake.<br/>
The present position on strikes is set out clearly in paragraph 888 of the Donovan Report. That says:
<q>At the present time, however, it is a familiar aspect of trade disputes that trade unions not only call out their members on strike but also endeavour to exert additional economic pressure on the employer in dispute by sealing off his sources of supply of materials or his outlet for sales, or both: and unless unlawful means are used to secure these ends, such action is permissible.</q>
Surely we are now debating whether such action ought to be permissible.<br/>
I hope that I can be considered a reasonable man who can see both sides of a case. Earlier in this Committee I sup-

ported the Opposition on one Amendment. But, however hard I try, I cannot see any justification for sympathy strikes. If employees have a dispute with their management, clearly they are entitled to withdraw their labour. That is a formidable weapon, though it has been written down by hon. Gentlemen opposite who suggest that we are eroding the weapon. It is a weapon which can force employers into bankruptcy. Why should trade unions have an additional right to persuade the suppliers of materials to a factory to stop delivering their goods?</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman has just read paragraph 888 of the Donovan Report. Perhaps he will refer to paragraph 900, which is the Commission's conclusion on the very passages to which he has referred. The last sentence reads, having regard to all that has gone before:

<p>Those of use who have attended these debates realise that some hon. Members adopt some parts of Donovan&#x2014;<i>[Interruption.]</i> That is a perfectly fair point. Neither side is using Donovan as its bible. I was trying to establish the facts, and I draw a different conclusion from Donovan.<br/>
Suppliers of materials to a factory who have no quarrel with the factory are persuaded, often with a good deal of threatening, to take action against the management of the factory. I believe that that is an abuse of power. It is an unpleasant weapon and it savours of bullying. It offends against the fundmental principles of justice, and it is a feaure of industrial action today which offends the general public more than any other.<br/>
The hon. Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Sillars) made no attempt to justify the sympathy strike on its merits. I have always understood that right hon. and hon. Gentlemen opposite are anxious to promote the principles of justice. These principles, surely, involve the protection of the rights of the individuals and of companies and businesses.</p>

<p>Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will listen to the following proposition. As I see it, under


the Bill the Government are giving freedom to non-unionists on the same basis as it is given to unionists. In other words, they are given the right not to belong to a trade union, just as trade unionists have the right to belong to a union. In the circumstances, the Government are moving towards the position where blacklegs can go into a factory during an industrial dispute. In those circumstances, Clause 87 becomes very important to trade unionists. The only protection which trade unionists on strike will have against their own blacklegs is to try to prevent supplies going into the factory where the blacklegs are operating against probably the majority of the employees.</p>

<p>I hope that the hon. Gentleman will have an opportunity of developing this point.<br/>
It is wrong and contrary to the principles of justice that employees having a dispute with a particular firm should be allowed to try to persuade and threaten other people who have no dispute with that firm not to deliver supplies. It seems to be an evil.<br/>
I am surprised that hon. Gentlemen opposite do not support me on this point, because they are keen to look after the rights of individuals. Yet these people and their businesses are threatened by outside forces.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman is making a very important point about the protection of the individual. May I change that round and consider the position of the person engaged in an industrial dispute who is in fact on strike and a third party enters into a relationship with the employer to supply goods or produce so that he can fulfil his contract. The other person then says to his mates who work in that other firm, "Withdraw your labour. If you do not, your employer will be interfering with my right to strike." At that moment he cannot fail to be interfering with the other employer, nor can he under the Bill.<br/>
There is no equal balance between the two.</p>

<p>This is becoming an interesting philosophical discussion. My view is that the employee is entitled to withdraw his labour from the employer, but not to go beyond this and to bring pressure on other people supplying goods to break their contracts. I do not think that it would be helpful to take this philosophical discussion any further. The alternative to the Bill is a kind of jungle warfare in which the combatants in any dispute are no longer just the parties to it but anyone whom the unions can persuade to join in.<br/>
This may conform to the idea of solidarity, and we have heard a lot about solidarity. It may conform to the motto, "Let the workers unite." However, it does not lead to justice. In deciding how to frame the Clause we should be thinking of justice more than anything else. Therefore, I believe that the Clause is right.</p>

<p>The right hon. Lady may have a good point on detail. The hon. Member for South Ayrshire and other hon. Members who have spoken have gone much further than taking Committee points. They have talked about solidarity. They have raised the entire concept of sympathetic strikes. However, the right hon. Lady may have a point. If the Clause is not correctly drafted, my hon. and learned Friend will certainly look at it, because he said that he would. We are dealing with the main principle of sympathetic strikes. Hon. Members opposite have said that they would like to throw out the whole Clause, and it is that issue on which I have been speaking.</p>

<p>I should like to start on the


narrow point before broadening out to the issue of solidarity.<br/>
Clause 87(2) makes it quite clear that it is an unfair industrial practice for any person, in furthering an industrial dispute, to interfere with the performance by another person of a contract to which that other person is an "extraneous party." What do we mean by "extraneous party"? We find that
<q>a person shall be regarded as an extraneous party &#x2026; if he is not a party to that dispute, and he has not &#x2026; taken any action in material support of a party to it.</q>
What is "material support"? We find that if he is an associated employer it gains him exemption. We then have to ask: what is an associated employer? We have to turn many pages of the Bill to find that definition, but we eventually find that
<q>For the purposes of this Act any two employers are to be treated as associated if one is a company of which the other (directly or indirectly) has control, or if both are companies of which a third person (directly or indirectly) has control; and in this Act 'associated employer' shall be construed accordingly.</q>
That is marvellous! There can be a strike in one firm, and under the provisions of the Bill it is not possible to bring pressure on the other firm because it is associated. Yet the two firms can be under common control and can have a common financial interest.<br/>
We can see the break-up of firms into associated companies, which would mean that the range of industrial action would become very narrow. That does not conjure up the image of an innocent party. One individual can own several companies. He may have a direct financial interest in every one of them. In one of those companies a dispute may break out. He decides to stand firm. He can afford to do so, because he may be supported by the receipts from 19 other plants. He will have those receipts and will be able to carry on the fight against the workers in one isolated factory. I shall refer to loyalty in a moment. That is the nub of the question of bringing about parity in bargaining situations.<br/>
Even under present regulations a worker who goes on strike will have to subsist on about &#x00A3;9 a week for himself, his wife and, perhaps, two kids. In that situation he is being asked to fight an employer who may be able to take advan-

tage of the returns from 19 factories. That is not equality of bargaining. It is precisely because of the existence of inequality of this sort that 19th century employers decided that trade unions should be granted some immunity before the law.<br/>
The issue before us is clear. This is an attempt completely to change the balance of power between the trade union and the employer. <i>[Interruption.]</i> It will not be brought to parity. How can we talk of parity when postmen are on the streets in receipt of &#x00A3;9 a week to support them in their struggle, while the Deputy Chairman of the Post Office continues to live in comfort and continues to say, "No"? Is that parity? Does parity exist in a situation when postmen receive &#x00A3;9 a week while the State puts up however many millions of pounds it likes in the fight against them? If it is, it is a strange parity. I know which side I would rather be on in a dispute of that sort.</p>

<p><member>Mr. Golding</member> Under the Labour Government many of us disputed the contention that the balance of power had shifted. This we know from our common experience.

</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1971-02-17a.1946.3" colnum="1946" time="">
<p>The principle of loyalty has been mentioned. The traditional difference between the trade unions and the employers has been that whereas employers have had employers' associations we have had a trade union movement in which the doctrine of obligation has gained considerable ground. This is because we do not believe that in the industrial situation today there can be innocent third parties, because every wage claim and settlement has an implication for other settlements. Day by day and week by week the Government Front Bench tell us that each settlement has an implication for others.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1971-02-17a.1946.4" colnum="1946" time="">
<p>It is very difficult to define who is and who is not a party to a dispute. The Clause would remove from trade unionists the freedom c: the worker to withdraw his labour if he does not like the use to which his products are being put. In the


trade union movement our relationship to work is not just that of a contract of doing work for a certain sum of money. We have to be concerned with the use of the products.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1971-02-17a.1947.0" colnum="1947" time="">
<p>It is reasonable for men who object to the use to which the employers put their product to say to the employer, "We are stopping work." This is true in the present Post Office dispute. The failure to distribute oil to a Torquay hotel has been mentioned. There are telephone exchanges which will face serious difficulties in the near future because oil is not being supplied to them. I would defend the right of the Transport and General Workers' Union members who are refusing to deliver that oil, because they are constantly told that the outcome of the postmen's dispute will have an effect on the wages of all workers.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1971-02-17a.1947.1" colnum="1947" time="">

<p>On the Post Office dispute in another respect, it is possible for trade unions to have a vital interest in the outcome of negotiations without their being parties to a particular dispute. The U.P.W. is in dispute with the Government over the pay of postmen, telephonists and counter clerks. The union I represent&#x2014;the Post Office Engineering Union&#x2014;is not a party to the contract, and it is not for us to say whether the percentage arrived at in negotiation is right or wrong, but we are concerned about the principles being settled during the dispute. The Post Office says that what matters is not the percentage but the principles of pay.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1971-02-17a.1947.3" colnum="1947" time="">
<p>The Post Office thus widens the interest in the dispute away from the U.P.W. to all the unions concerned in the Post Office, because they have a direct interest in the principles of pay established. Our interests are vitally bound up in the outcome of the dispute.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1971-02-17a.1947.4" colnum="1947" time="">
<p>The Government are repeating the Post Office assertion that the union will not go to arbitration. Other unions would be upset if the principles of pay for the entire Post Office staff were settled by arbitration. Moreover, it is not correct to make the broad claim that the U.P.W.

agreed to go to arbitration. All the Post Office unions agreed to go into the public Corporation on certain understandings set out in a White Paper, including an assurance that the Government would expect of the employer that industrial relations would be even better in the public Corporation than they had been in the old Post Office. We went in on that undertaking. The unions signed an agreement. There has been argument about whether it is ambiguous.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1971-02-17a.1948.0" colnum="1948" time="">

<p>No, because, first, in the past there were agreed principles for settling pay which had been determined by the Tomlin and Priestley Commissions after years of study and work. There was no need to go to a mediator; neither side had said unilaterally that it was changing the principles of settling pay. Second, an arbitration court had been established.<br/>
To return to the main theme, it is difficult to determine who is a party to an agreement. It would be much fairer, in my view, if two additional points were made: first, that no employer be given exemption if he has either financial or physical control; and, second, that trade unions which have a direct interest in the outcome of negotiations should themselves be entitled to take action.<br/>
The Government's policy is to relate one wage claim to the next&#x2014;X minus 1, X minus 2, and X minus 3. Given that policy, each union in the public sector must have an interest in the settlement of any dispute. If the Government intend to create a situation in which a certain formula is to be applied, and if there is to be parity of bargaining between workers and employers, the workers must be free to act in any dispute which they think will vitally affect their interests.</p>

<p>The logic of that is that any pay dispute could lead to a general strike. Everyone is interested in the public sector, says the hon. Gentleman, so if there is a pay dispute it is fair enough


for all the unions to join in and call a strike. That cannot be right.</p>

<p>Hon. Members opposite are leading me into difficulty, Miss Harvie Anderson, tempting me into philosophical arguments which you would rule out of order. There is no logic in what the hon.

The Post Office Engineering Union has not the same interest in the Ford dispute. We know that, whatever the productivity at Ford Motor Company, however bad the cars which it produces&#x2014;it has just sold me a bad one&#x2014;the workers will get their increases because they are in the private sector and because they are in a more powerful position&#x2014;</p>

<p>I accept your rebuke at once, Miss Harvie Anderson. I saw the danger when the hon. Gentleman rose to intervene. It is difficult to remain within order on these matters.<br/>
Our objection to the Clause as it stands is of vital importance, vital to the essence of the Bill. I do not believe that the Bill is directed so much to the removal of strikes, or unofficial strikes, as to the transfer of power from shop floor to managers and the professional class. Clause 87, I believe, is one key to the Government's strategy in this respect. They are trying to do what managers traditionally have done; that is, divide the working class, take them section by section, and then, having done that, deal with the workers in weak groups, in that way gaining the domination which traditionally they have been able to hold because of their ownership of economic power.</p>

In the film industry a &#x00A3;100 company can hire technicians and artists and fail to pay them, or owe them part of their payment. Being a small company with nothing to lose, it can go into liquidation, leaving those technicians and artists high and dry. The company has the commodity in the can.

I hope that my hon. and learned Friend can find words to allow for the processors of the film not turning it into a saleable commodity until the company has settled its debts to the technicians and artists.

<p>The hon. Member for Peterborough (Sir Harmar Nicholls) has demonstrated what I call a saccharine paternalism towards the Committee, and it is to be hoped that in future when he addresses us he will take his own advice to heart.<br/>
I agree broadly with the principle stated by the Solicitor-General on this Clause, because there are dangers&#x2014;and indeed, there have been examples&#x2014;of great injustices being caused to independent and entirely innocent parties in disputes because it is thought that they should be involved so as to broaden the industrial front. They often suffer severely in the process. I am entirely


with the Solicitor-General in desiring to give protection to that kind of person. I also agree with him that there are a number of decided cases&#x2014;a labyrinth of cases&#x2014;and that it would be a good thing if a clear position were to be enunciated and an end put to the disputes which arise from these causes.<br/>
Having said that, I am not at all convinced that the Clause is not drawn far too broadly. For example, it seems to me that the very concept of "extraneous party" is difficult to accept. If one is in a dispute, one is a party to a dispute. The very words "extraneous party" are self-contradictory. A person or association is either a party to the dispute or extraneous to the dispute.<br/>
Subsections (2) and (3) are very complicated. It would have been better for the unions if they had not existed and Clause 87(1) had read as it does but with the substitution of the words, "other person is a party or is not a party in relation to that industrial dispute". If the wording were in that form, it would be much better than it is now. I understand the hon. and learned Gentleman to have in mind a kind of protection to enable parties who are perhaps associated with companies involved in a dispute not to be drawn in. This is a crucial Clause and there is no doubt as to its wide ambit as drawn.<br/>
If there is an industry-wide dispute in which some firms are involved in association while producing the same kind of goods, but not in association with other companies, and there are union workers employed in each, the union workers employed in a company not associated with the others would be in breach if they took strike action. It is difficult to see how the Clause as drawn cannot work considerable injustice.<br/>
I say "as drawn", but we can consider the Clause only as drawn. The history of Parliament shows how the intentions of any Government are different from court decisions later, when the words enacted by Parliament are interpreted, and one sees how often right hon. and learned and hon. and learned Members and others on the Government Front Bench, of whatever party, have been found to be wrong.<br/>
The words of the Clause are far too wide, and I should support an Amend-

ment for the deletion of subsection (2), because the Clause does not carry out the intention as stated by the Solicitor-General. The hon. and learned Gentleman has given an absolute undertaking about one matter, and, as I understand his present mood, he is prepared to look again at the whole Clause with a view to introducing different words to limit the intention he has stated. I do not think that any fair-minded person could dispute the intention he has delimited, but the words of the Clause, which is all the Committee has to consider, are so wide as to be likely to wreak injustice.</p>

<p>The Committee is plainly anxious to move to the "Clause stand part" debate, and I should like to deal more generally with the Amendments.<br/>
I begin by taking up a point made by the hon. and learned Member for Montgomery (Mr. Hooson). He suggested that the industry-wide strike on terms and conditions of employment might be caught automatically by the Clause. Quite apart from what I have been looking at, the structure of the Clause, I suggest that it is not likely or possible that that would happen, because the Clause is not aimed at anyone who induces breaches of contract of employment.<br/>
If a sympathy strike throughout an industry takes place because of the claim by the workers in one part of it, a fair strike about their terms and conditions of employment, and the other workers throughout the industry join in, someone inducing them to break their contract of employment would not come within the Clause. Only if the person inducing the sympathetic strikers throughout the industry-wide strike were doing so with a view to securing breaches of contract other than contracts of employment would the Clause begin to bite.<br/>
I take the point that the Clause as drafted might inadvertently catch that, and that is why I have undertaken to look at it again, but it is certainly not the intention to prescribe calling or inducing strikes by other people throughout an industry simply because that involves them in breaking their contracts of employment; it is only if the secondary strikes are specifically directed to bringing about a breach of contract other than a contract of employment, and that is


what the Clause is directed at. The position does not arise if the respondent can show that the party whose contract is being broken is not extraneous to but is supporting the original strike.<br/>
9.15 p.m.<br/>
To deal with some of the particular points and examples which have been put to me, the important point to emphasise is that subsection (3) is saying that a person shall not be regarded as having taken supporting action by reason only that he is an associated employer, or member, of the same employers' organisation, and so on. It is not asserting that associated employers are automatically to be regarded as extraneous. All that is asserted is that the mere fact of association and common membership of an employers' association does not in itself establish that he is taking materially supporting action. Of course, a member of the same federation or the same group of employers would immediately become a supporting party if taking action in support of the employer primarily struck against. It is here we try to draw the line between the wholly innocent party away from a dispute altogether and people who are reasonably and legitimately involved.<br/>
The hon. Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme (Mr. Golding) raised the question of the relationship between the Post Office Engineering Union and the U.P.W. and the question of how far any supporting action might or might not be fair under the Bill. That, again, would not be affected by this provision. We start off with a fair primary strike by the U.P.W. about its new wage bargain, and if anyone sought to persuade the members of the P.O.E.W. to strike in support of that, that persuasion would be directed not to particular breaches of particular contracts by the Post Office but to persuading it to undertake a sympathy strike in support of the fair primary strike. There will be no question of that being caught by this Clause or in any other way.<br/>
The hon. Member for Putney (Mr. Hugh Jenkins)&#x2014;and my hon. Friend the Member Peterborough (Sir Harmar Nicholls), though on a slightly different tack, but in general along the same lines&#x2014;put an example to me of a situation which is not unfamiliar in the motion picture industry. The answer is that if under the present law officials of A.C.T.A.T. were to persuade

the work people of the film processing company to break their contracts of employment with a view to procuring a breach by the film processing company of its processing contract, then, even with the law as it now stands, and subject to the way in which they did it and the way in which the particular facts fitted in with the maze described in the Donovan Report, the procurement by union officials of a breach of the processing contract could now quite probably be actionable and restrainable under the present law.</p>

<p>In theory. It is a situation in respect of which actions have been brought, though not, so far as I know, in that particular situation.<br/>
The same could well be true of Clause 87(3) as drafted. The present position is that the people calling such a strike as individuals, though not the union, could be found liable under the present law. Under Clause 87 as drafted the people calling the strike could not be found liable but the union could be. It is difficult to say whether the affected party would or should be regarded as an extraneous party.<br/>
I am grateful to the hon. Member for Putney for raising that example, which illustrates the difficulty raised by the hon. and learned Member for Montgomery, of defining the extent to which we reserve the balance of the present law which gives some protection to the innocent, outside party and the extent to which we modify it so as to legitimise fair strikes which are in pursuit of a fair primary objective. The example given by the hon. Member is one to add to the many others which we have considered and at which we shall look in the course of the reconsideration of this Clause.<br/>
I invite the Committee to reject the Amendments, which go to the heart of the Clause, and to support the principle of the Clause on the basis that there is a clear distinction between the legitimate use of sympathetic supporting strike action and the use which goes further than can be justified in the complex state of modern society and involves innocent people who should not be involved in the dispute.</p>

<p>As the Solicitor-General said, we are all anxious to get on to the


Question, That the Clause stand part of the Bill, because my hon. Friends have been in great difficulty in having to discuss the vital principles associated with the Clause in the context of Amendments of limited scope. We have had this difficulty throughout our discussions on the Bill. We have all found it quite impossible, if we wanted to do so, which we certainly do not, to do what the hon. Member for Peterborough (Sir Harmar Nicholls) suggested, namely, to sit down together and improve the details of the Bill before we have had a chance to bring home to the Solicitor-General the fact that the details of the Bill are a reflection of a basically wrong principle. This has been our problem. It is not our fault that our Amendment dealing with the principle was not called. We are therefore merely discussing one aspect of the Clause.<br/>
The hon. Member for Peterborough, who pays us rather hurried visits from wherever it is he comes from and goes back again, having lectured us about how naughty we were to attack the Clause and how we should be sitting down with him to try to improve its detail, went on to quote examples of how bad the Clause was in its effect. I could not help feeling that circumstances alter cases. In discussing a Clause like this we can get involved in terrible abstractions and easily lose our way unless we are careful. It is interesting to note how, when any of us has had personal experience, the abstractions which sound so plausible in the mouth of the Solicitor-General turn out to be very different animals when aplied to concrete situations. That is the truth about some of the abstractions which we have heard from the Solicitor-General on these two Amendments.<br/>
The hon. and learned Gentleman admitted that valid points of detailed criticism had been made from this side of the Committee and went on to say that he would look into some of the wording of the Clause, thus proving what was clear, I should have thought, to anybody listening to this debate, that if the Clause was intended to clarify the obscurities of the law on the secondary boycott&#x2014;obscurities of which the Donovan Report complained&#x2014;it had failed dismally. All the Solicitor-General has managed to do is to make the legal situation still more

obscure and still more of a minefield for any trade unionist trying to thread his way through it.<br/>
That is why the Donovan Report said that the only way to deal with this situation was to clarify the law. The Donovan Report said that the principle of borrowed strength was not only a traditional principle of industrial relations but a hallowed principle by any standards responding to natural human needs and the needs of those trying to organise for certain ends. Donovan wanted the law clarified to make the path forward more sure for trade unionists. What the Solicitor-General is doing by this Clause, as he has made clear in his remarks to us, is attempting to clarify the law by increasing the restrictions on trade unions, and that is why we have this phony distinction which is put before us of the difference between an "innocent" employer caught up in the wicked machinations of trade unions and the employer who may be said to have a real interest in the strike though not an immediate and direct party to it.<br/>
So we come to this definition of the extraneous employer who, in the words of the Solicitor-General, is an innocent employer and ought therefore to be left alone. What the Clause as it now stands says is that an extraneous party is an employer who is
<ol>
<li>"<i>(a)</i> &#x2026; not a party to that dispute, and</li>
<li><i>(b)</i> has not &#x2026; taken any action in material support"</li>
</ol>
of it.<br/>
First and foremost, of course, this adds nothing to the relief of obscurity, because it is certainly not easy to define the concept of who is and who is not a party to the dispute. We had some exchanges about that earlier in connection with the dockyards, and I hope my hon. Friends will be following this up in the wider discussion on the Question, That the Clause stand part of the Bill.<br/>
When we turn to the other limb of this part of the Clause, namely, what constitutes material support, we are entering a very wide field indeed, for subsection (2)<i>(b)</i> says that if an employer is to be considered extraneous and therefore innocent he must not have given material support
<q>in contemplation or furtherance of that dispute".</q>


I am sure that we on this side are still totally unsatisfied that this does not mean that the ordinary supplier of goods who knows that his supplies are helping to break a strike does not then become an extraneous or an innocent party, because if that is so, if it is true that the ordinary supplier of goods who knows that his supplies are helping to break a strike becomes an innocent party so that there may be no action against him by his own workers, then this eliminates almost every supporting employer. Every supporting employer becomes extraneous. The extension of this meaning is very wide indeed, and we believe that it was intended to be wide. We believe that the purpose of these words is really to compound the apparent obscurity of the law instead of clearing it up, and to make darn sure that there will be very few guilty employers indeed under these secondary boycott provisions and, therefore, very few employers against whom it will be legal to take secondary boycott action.<br/>
Then the Government go even further &#x2014;in subsection (3). As my hon. Friend the Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Sillars) pointed out, the Government go out of their way to ensure that whole groups of employers whom the ordinary layman would consider certainly to have an interest in and an influence upon a strike are rendered immune from sympathetic action.<br/>
9.30 p.m.<br/>
The Solicitor-General gave an interesting explanation of the reference to the associated employer in subsection (3)<i>(a).</i> It is remarkable that he should say that an associated employer should be immune. An associated employer may have financial, commercial and possibly negotiating and bargaining links with the employer who is involved in the original strike. It is contrary to all commonsense that an associated employer should be called an innocent party. I am glad to see the hon. Member for Sudbury and Woodbridge (Mr. Stainton) nodding his head&#x2014;</p>

<p>We have had an explanation from the Solicitor-General. The Solicitor-General was challenged on this by several of my hon. Friends. He said that he was merely saying that a person shall not be regarded as having taken the action mentioned by reason only that he is an associated employer, and he shall not be regarded as having given material support by reason only that he is an associated employer. We say that an associated employer must be deemed to be guilty in the Solicitor-General's sense, namely the opposite of innocent or extraneous, because he is associated. Why is this reference to the associated employer spelt out in subsection (3)? The Solicitor-General said that all he was saying was that he shall not automatically be regarded as guilty, not extraneous. To that we reply, why not automatically assume that there is a connection?<br/>
I do not use "guilty" in an emotive sense. It is the Solicitor-General who uses these emotive terms about people being innocent or guilty employers. It is an absurd concept, because the opposite of innocence is guilt. There is no guilt in being an associated employer and having an interest in whether a strike succeeds or is broken. In commercial terms it is a straight piece of negotiation. The Solicitor-General loves wheeling out these moving phrases which make the general public feel that the Government are on the side of God.</p>

<p>I want to reinforce the right hon. Lady's point. I had not noticed until now that "associated employer" is defined for the purpose of the Bill in Clause 148(5) and has a very narrow meaning indeed.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1971-02-17a.1960.2" hansard_membership_id="4880" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2085" speakername="Mrs. Castle" colnum="1960" time="">
<p>I was coming to that point.<br/>
Then the Government go out of their way in the interpretation Clause to define the associated employer in subsection (5). That definition has already been read by my hon. Friend the Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Sillars). It says clearly that an associated company is one that has a linked control. It cannot possibly be extraneous. My hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster (Mr. Harold Walker) has just pointed out to me that the definition of associated company in this Bill is the definition of associated employment which we put into the Equal Pay Act.


Why did we do that? We did that to say that a woman shall be given equal treatment with men in the same employment and then we went on to define the same employment as being the same employment by men employed by her employer or any associated employer because there is a common interest and responsibility and a common link.<br/>
The Government are standing the whole concept on its head. They are saying that the very fact that there is this kind of link, commercial, financial, negotiating and all the rest, does not automatically mean that the employer is guilty. If it does not mean that what does it mean? Does it mean that he is extraneous? The hon. and learned Gentleman cannot have it both ways. He has to put it positively, we cannot be left in the air with this negative. Trade unionists and workers can be penalised by law once the Bill is passed and they have a right to have it put the positive way round, not the double negative way. If it does not automatically follow that because an employer is associated he is guilty, and therefore the action against him is legal, when will the action against him be illegal? Tell us that. Tell the trade union movement. It is intolerable to add to the obscurity of the present law. This is a classic example of the double talk and double meanings which we are getting from the Government together with all of the double dangers.<br/>
Secondly, says the Solicitor-General, the mere membership of an employer's organisation does not destroy the innocent status of the secondary employer. However, that organisation may have decided to use its collective strength to resist strikes. Thirdly, subsection (3) spells it out, an employers' organisation or any group of employers may actually set up a strike indemnity fund, as the Engineering Employers Federation has done, to compensate any one of its members against loss which they may incur in resisting strikes generally.<br/>
That is to become legal under the Bill. The fact that an employer is contributing to a common indemnity fund to resist strikes does not deprive him of his innocence under the Clause. It is an intoler-</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1971-02-17a.1962.0" colnum="1962" time="">
<p>able example of the incompatibility between what the Government do and say. No wonder they have been accused of hypocrisy by my hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Walton (Mr. Heffer). I think that his language was remarkably restrained in view of the enormity of this Measure. I say to the Solicitor-General, "Come on, let's be adult, let's play it straight with one another". Will he not admit that Clause 87(3)<i>(c)</i> was put into the Bill at the specific request of the Engineering Employers Federation? The Federation has been running this indemnity fund; it can hardly come before any common sense audience and claim to be entirely innocent in the situation when it has its indemnity fund as part and parcel of its apparatus for fighting strikes. But if a trade union tries to use borrowed strength against the collective strength of the Federation, the Solicitor-General will have it up and see that it suffers the penalties of this law.</p>

<p>The Committee may be interested to know that the final crux of the situation is that contributions to strike indemnity funds are probably allowable for tax purposes. My hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster asked a pertinent Question about this on 12th February. He asked the Chancellor of the Exchequer
<q>&#x2026; if a company's contributions to a strike indemnity fund of an employers' association are allowable for tax purposes.</q>
The Financial Secretary to the Treasury replied:

<p>On a point of order. As you are aware, Sir Alfred, during the course of a debate fresh points sometimes arise as a result of which it is decided that it would help generally if a vote were taken on a subsidiary Amendment. I submit for your consideration that such a fresh point has arisen in relation to Amendment No. 462, in the name of the hon. Member for Peterborough (Sir Harmar Nicholls). In the course of our discussion it was clearly shown that that Amendment raised issues not covered by the Amendment that was moved. It deals with a separate issue, which ought to be decided separately by the Committee. You have been here throughout the discussion, Sir Alfred, and you will doubtless recognise that a fresh point was raised. In those circumstances I beg to ask leave formally to move Amendment No. 462 for a Division.</p>

<p>My hon. Friends and I wish to debate this Clause in a little more detail than we have been able to do up to now. A great deal of what has been said by my right hon. Friend the Member for Blackburn (Mrs. Castle) covers many of the arguments that we would deploy. I pay tribute to my right hon. Friend; the contribution that she has made has emphasised precisely how difficult it is for the layman to get to grips with the Bill and to understand it. We shall want some very clear answers from the Solicitor-General in relation to the points made by my right hon. Friend.<br/>
I shall have to be a little careful about what I say during the debate, as I seem to have run into a little local difficulty on a couple of occasions today.

I will do my best to keep strictly in order.<br/>
We regard not only the Clause but the whole of Part V as one of the most pernicious parts of the Bill as far as it operates against the trade union movement. The Clause is probably the most pernicious Clause of a Bill which is full of pernicious Clauses. We shall make it clear during the next two or three hours that this part of the Bill and especially this Clause ought to be withdrawn. I am very interested to note that even the representative of the Liberal Party also appealed to the Solicitor-General to withdraw this part of the Bill.<br/>
In the course of an earlier brief speech, the Solicitor-General made it absolutely clear that whereas Clauses 85 and 86 could well apply to unregistered trade unions and to unofficial strikers&#x2014;although there was argument about interpretation&#x2014;nevertheless this Clause, to use his words, is directed in a different way and it affects strikes whether they are official or unofficial, whether the strike began as a so-called fair strike or as an unfair industrial practice. This is the basic point on the Clause.<br/>
The Roberts Arundel dispute was mentioned both yesterday and today. I know that the hon. and learned Gentleman would say that that dispute would be covered by the fact that within the Bill the union could apply for recognition and the American employer would be forced to grant it. It may well be that an employer could be forced to grant recognition under the Bill. But, having been forced to accept recognition of the trade union, an employer could then carry out a series of actions which could lead to the workers taking what hon. Members on the other side of the Committee would regard as a fair action and calling an official dispute at that firm. We should remember the type of management with which we would be dealing. It is one that has made it perfectly clear that it really objects to the principle of trade unions. But it has been forced into a position of having to accept a trade union. Nevertheless, it will then conduct


the dispute in every possible way to ensure the defeat of the trade union.<br/>
10.0 p.m.<br/>
Under the Bill the trade union would face an immediate problem. A firm which was supplying goods, perhaps on a long-term contract, could well argue that it had no particular association with the dispute but was merely supplying on the basis of a long-term contract entered into years before when the firm was a British firm.<br/>
In those circumstances, under this Part of the Bill, the trade union could not ask the workers in the factories supplying the goods to take action against the supplier.</p>

<p>Hon. Gentlemen are agreeing, yet hon. Members opposite deny the argument adduced by many of my hon. Friends to the effect that the Clause tilts the balance entirely in the employer's favour. If there can be no right to appeal to trade unionists in supplying factories, the employer starts off with a 100 per cent. advantage over the union. This is not parity.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1971-02-17a.1969.3" hansard_membership_id="2363" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/19183" speakername="Mr. Orme" colnum="1969" time="">
<p>Is my hon. Friend aware that fundamentally the Roberts Arundel strike was not about trades union recognition. It was about bad management. It lasted two years and was resolved only by the union eventually taking three actions&#x2014;trying to prevent the supply of goods, blacking all sub-contract work in the area, where ever it was being done, and imposing a levy on members throughout the district concerned? All three actions would be illegal under the Clause.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1971-02-17a.1969.4" hansard_membership_id="5612" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/11612" speakername="Mr. Heffer" colnum="1969" time="">
<p>I am grateful to my hon. Friend. A study of this dispute shows that for the trade union to be able to defeat this anti-trade union firm it was necessary for pickets to follow certain lorries at night to discover where the goods were coming from and then to appeal to the workers in those factories not to allow the goods to be sent to Roberts Arundel. The trade union had to go further and appeal to trade unionists in Europe. Solidarity on this national

and international scale was necessary to defeat this anti-trade union firm.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1971-02-17a.1970.0" hansard_membership_id="9352" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/32415" speakername="Mr. David Mitchell" colnum="1970" time="">
<p>The hon. Gentleman has spoken of the need for solidarity and of the way in which solidarity brought about an end to the Roberts Arundel dispute. In that case, why was not the union able to obtain solidarity in the works? If it had succeeded in achieving that, it would not have needed to take any further action, because no firm can operate without labour?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1971-02-17a.1970.1" hansard_membership_id="5612" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/11612" speakername="Mr. Heffer" colnum="1970" time="">
<p>To use an old clich&#x00E9;, I am glad that the hon. Gentleman raised that point, because it leads me on to my next point.<br/>
The hon. Member for Chippenham (Mr. Awdry) said that he could not understand why we felt so strongly on this matter. I believe that the hon. Gentleman is genuinely trying to understand our point of view, as I hope that we are trying to understand his. I would not say that of all hon. Members opposite, but I believe that the hon. Member for Chippenham is genuinely trying to understand our point of view.<br/>
In reply to the hon. Member for Basingstoke (Mr. David Mitchell), the firm continued with a very small group of workers, all of whom were non-trade unionists. Many of them were paid over the union rates. This rate was paid to get them there for the time being; and then, when the union was destroyed, they would not be paid the official union rates.<br/>
The Government say that workers should have a legally protected right not to join a trade union. Let us suppose that a group of these workers, not trade unionists, remained at work and other workers took action because they were not trade unionists. First, that would be an unfair industrial practice, and, second, they would be caught under this Clause at a later stage. So there are two bites at the cherry. Obviously, we cannot accept that.<br/>
Now, the question of solidarity. In his excellent speech, my hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster (Mr. Harold Walker) spoke about employers' contributions to an indemnity fund. Indemnity funds are known particularly in the engineering industry, but they are not


confined to engineering. Many employers' associations have them. An indemnity fund is for the purpose of assisting other members who may be involved in a trade dispute or for other reasons regarded as entitled to support.<br/>
Apparently, it is perfectly all right for employers to assist one another and to show solidarity&#x2014;they are not caught under the Bill&#x2014;but it is no good the workers thinking that they may show solidarity and support one another through sympathetic action. We are told that the balance is not tipped in favour of the employers and the system is perfectly fair. Yet employers may assist one another and, what is more, it is all right if they are members of the same association.<br/>
Clause 148(5) means that there could be a number of associated companies with direct financial interests in one another, but under separate forms of management, which could assist one another; yet if the workers decide to take sympathetic action in relation to those managements, they would be in trouble under the Bill. Do hon. Members honestly think that this is fair and not intended to weaken the trade union movement? Of course it is not. I have never seen anything more blatant. We could not possibly accept it.<br/>
So often in these debates, I have had to promise my hon. Friends that I would make a short speech so that as many others could take part, and I have done the same tonight, but I wish, before I close, to draw attention to one or two other aspects of the Clause. I take, first, the part which directly relates to the dispute which took place between the Transport and General Workers' Union and the Torquay hotel.<br/>
Lord Denning gave this judgment on that occasion:
<q>The time has come when the principle</q>
&#x2014;of liability in common law&#x2014;
<q>extends to a case where the third person ate and direct interference with the execution of a contract without that causing any breach.</q>
So we have a new concept. It does not even have to cause a breach to be interference with the execution of a contract. He added that such interference
<q>extends to a case where the third person prevents or hinders a party from performing his contract.</q>

In the Clause we find the words:
&#x2026;
<q>to interfere with the performance by another person of a contract (not being a contract of employment) to which that other person is a party,</q>
It is clear that hon. Members opposite have lifted the judgment of Lord Denning and put it into the Clause. I understand from my legal friends that that is a novel situation in the law. If it is not, I am certain that lawyers on the other side of the Committee will be only too keen to put me right.<br/>
This part of the Bill, like most of the Bill, is based upon the Taft-Hartley Act. There is no question about that. I have a copy of that Act. Section 8<i>(b)</i>(4), dealing with this matter, is headed,
<q>Unfair labour practices".</q>
That Section is taken out almost word for word, though put in a different way&#x2014;<i>[Interruption.]</i> The words can be the same, but they can be rearranged. If hon. Members opposite do not know that, they do not know anything. The Clause comes straight out of the Taft-Hartley Act.<br/>
What exactly does that mean? Again I quote Professor Wedderburn, who, the Solicitor-General says, is a dedicated leftist, or something like that. I can only assume that the Solicitor-General is a dedicated rightist. The hon. and learned Gentleman does not like us referring to what Professor Wedderburn says. In the speech of 12th January Professor Wedderburn said:
<q>Clause 87 would make unlawful sympathetic and other secondary strike and solidarity action which has been lawful in Britain for decades. Two leading professors at Yale Law School put it well when they said about the similar Taft-Hartley law in the USA, that curtailing secondary action makes unions 'enter the economic struggle with one hand tied'.</q>
That is precisely what happened.<br/>
I should now like to quote another passage from Mr. Meany's letter to Mr. Victor Feather. He wrote:
<q>Our legislation does not, however, by any means make all forms of secondary industrial action unlawful.' Indeed, questions of what sorts of secondary actions are permissible and what are illegal are the most complex and difficult to answer in our whole body of labor law.</q>
That is going to be the position. We shall get into the most difficult and complicated situations in discussing this whole question.

I do not care whether a strike begins as an official strike or as an unofficial strike or whether it starts as an unofficial strike and is made official. We do not always agree with unofficial strikes. Many of us have made statements to unofficial strikers urging them perhaps to take a different line of action. But we have always regarded the right to strike&#x2014;any form of strike&#x2014;as one of the most important principles of freedom. It is a principle which <i>The Spectator</i> pointed out a few weeks ago as being undermined by the Bill. It warned us, "Be careful as to what is happening in this country". That principle is not a dangerous philosophy. The dangerous philosophy is that of the Government, who are slowly but surely eroding fundamental rights in this country which have been built up by the trade union movement and by democrats throughout the centuries.</p>

<p>I have not upgraded an unofficial strike. Nor have I downgraded an official strike. I have said that the right to strike, officially or unofficially, is one of the basic freedoms which the working people or any other people have in this country, and that this part of the Bill is taking away the right of workers to take that action without incurring the wrath of the law.<br/>
This can be the first step on a very difficult road which the Government are taking, and it is a very serious step. We have seen this sort of thing before in other parts of the world. The process begins like this. A right is eroded very slowly. Then the process builds up. When

there is a continuation of strikes&#x2014;and this provision will not prevent them from taking place&#x2014;voices on the benches opposite will be raised, as they are now being raised in the United States, to say, "We have to go further." The question of secondary boycotts is interesting in this context. In 1947, when the Taft-Hartley Act came in, there were very few illegal secondary boycotts. Then the Landrum-Griffin Amendment was introduced and the law was tightened up. Voices are being raised now saying that it should be tightened up even further.<br/>
Before we know where we are, we in this country will find that the trade union movemetn is completely tied up-&#x2014;and all this despite the fact that hon. Members opposite, with their hands on their hearts, are constantly telling us that they are fair in their attitude towards the trade unions.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman wags his head. If, when I sit down, he is still wagging his head, I shall have failed to make any impression on him. But that should not deter one from trying. I do not challenge his sincerity, but in his peroration the hon. Member for Walton got a little carried away. He said the Clause is intended to tilt the balance wholly in favour of an employer. <i>[Laughter.]</i> Hon.

<p>I shall not rise to that, having been here trying all evening to make the point which I have been rising time and again to make.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman might consider the other point of view, that the intention and effect of the Clause is not to tilt the balance in anybody's favour, and most especially not to favour the employer.<br/>
What it does is to protect the person who has no part in the dispute from the damage which may be done to him and which may be extremely serious to him and to persons employed by him when he has no connection with it, when there is no fault on his part and when he has no interest. That is another way of looking at it. Is it necessarily wrong to seek to protect that person?<br/>
Of course we recognise that the right to strike is something which has been fought for and established, and we recognise it as a perfectly legitimate bargaining weapon and the right to strike is built into the Bill. But should there be a right to take action to damage an innocent party? That is what the Clause is all about. What we are talking about is whether it shall be an unfair industrial practice to take action against a person, who is not a party to the dispute and who has done nothing material in that dispute, for the purpose of injuring him and making someone else do what one wants, by inducing him to break a contract to which he is a party, perhaps with serious consequences for him, or to prevent him, a person not a party to the dispute and who has done nothing in connection with it, from performing a contract into which he has entered and by which he is bound and upon which his livelihood and that of his employees may well depend.</p>

<p>Would the hon. and learned Gentleman say therefore that paragraph <i>(b)</i>&#x2014;

<p>I am coming to that. What I have done is to say that this is what we are talking about, whether it should be an unfettered right for people to act in that way and so to cause harm

to people who are not a party to and have not taken an active part in the matter.<br/>
Having said that, I entirely accept that there is considerable room for discussion as to the precise terms of what is and is not allowed, and I believe that the hon. Member for Salford, West (Mr. Orme) has a substantial point in the wording of subsection (1)<i>(b).</i> I am sure that the Committee was much obliged to my hon. and learned Friend the Solicitor-General for intervening much earlier on to say that he was not happy with it.</p>

<p>I thought that that was what Parliament was all about&#x2014;to discuss what was in a Bill. The House of Commons is often more generous than may sometimes appear and I hope that hon. Members will be quick to respond when a Minister in charge acknowledges that the wording is not satisfactory and that changes must be made.<br/>
I would suggest one other possibility. The Solicitor-General made it clear that the revised wording is intended to cover preventing somebody from performing his contract. He made it clear that it would not cover preventing somebody from entering into a contract. There is one other matter which arose in the Torquay Hotel case. A contract can often be determined by a week's or a fortnight's notice. I hope that it will be made clear in the revised wording that action to force somebody to terminate a contract which they would not otherwise have terminated will be among actions which constitute an unfair industrial practice. I take the point made by the hon. Member for Salford, West (Mr. Orme) who is concerned that this should not apply to any contract which is broken or interfered with quite incidentally as a result of a strike. However, we have had such a clear assurance that we need not spend more time on that matter.<br/>
I understand the misgivings about the use and definition of the phrase "associated employer". It is tolerably clear that because of the use of the word "only" this is not intended to have such wide repercussions as some hon. Members thought. I hope that the Solicitor-General in his revised wording will make


a little clearer that what is meant is that the mere fact that companies are associated shall not prevent somebody being an extraneous party; that there must be some greater connection than a mere association as defined. If there is a way of making it even clearer that that is what is meant, I should welcome it. We do not want to leave room for misgivings. May I as a lawyer say that the one thing we do not want to do is to leave room for argument and litigation&#x2014;</p>

<p>I thought that might raise a smile, but there are some of us who have a catalogue of the number of occasions when we have told this House that if it passes something in a particular form it will create work for the lawyers.<br/>
The House has usually passed it nevertheless and our point has soon been proved. We are as anxious as anybody to make sure that when legislation leaves this place it is intelligible. Let us accept that there is considerable room for improvement on the detail of the Clause.<br/>
What we are concerned with in this debate is whether or not it is right that any person, whether a trade union, unregistered organisation, or anybody else should be free to cause damage to an entirely innocent party in the furtherance of their own interest. I believe it is not right that that position should continue; that it is no infringement of anybody's liberty to say that should not be done. It is the barest protection which should be given to the other members of society who are in no way responsible for or concerned in the dispute.</p>

<p>I am grateful for catching your eye at last, Miss Harvie Anderson. I do not mean that in any rude way. It was just an expression of relief, having sat here for nearly seven hours without being called.<br/>
The hon. and learned Member for Southport (Mr. Percival) said that we on this side of the Committee were overstating our case and that perhaps some of the fears which my hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Walton (Mr. Heffer) outlined would not be realised or were far too great and that it was wrong to say that we were tilting the balance in the employers' favour. But I think that that is correct. I. do not think that the balance was ever tilted in our favour. I do not think that there was ever an equilibrium. The balance has not been "tilted" in the employers' favour; it has been "tilted further" in the employers' favour&#x2014;much further.<br/>
The hon. and learned Gentleman said that the right to strike was built into the Bill. It is. It is walled up. The right to strike has been so limited and curtailed that we shall need the services of the hon. and learned Gentleman every time we have a dispute on the shop floor to be able to see our way through the maze of legislation and conditions which have been discussed before we can decide whether a person is entitled to withdraw his labour.<br/>
My trade union has a particular interest in this set of Clauses. The general workers' unions were built up purely and simply on the basis that they would be able to establish their right to strike and to take sympathetic action in order to protect one another. This was learned in Liverpool and other places from Connolly and Larkin, and it gave us our strength so that we could take on employers one by one and use our collective strength to protect ourselves. This right has been taken away by the Bill.<br/>
May I say how glad I am to see one of the Under-Secretaries of State for the Environment on the Front Bench. I hope that he will be able to give us some elucidation on the points raised earlier with the same success as he had last time. The Solicitor-General was some-

what shy when we were discussing Clause 86. He said that we should discuss certain matters on Clause 87. When we discussed Clause 87, some of the points raised were not answered by the Solicitor-General when he spoke to the Amendments. Therefore, I should be grateful if the Under-Secretary could answer some of the points which are of considerable concern to us.<br/>
We started with a situation in which we had a primary employer in a dispute with a trade union, and we put forward a number of cases concerning lines 36 and 37 of Clause 86 and the interpretation being placed on line 4 of Clause 87. We said that if pressure were put on an employer directly to intervene&#x2014;<i>[Interruption.]</i> Does my hon. Friend wish to make a point?</p>

<p>A remark was made by an hon. Member opposite and I wrongly replied&#x2014;for which I apologise to my hon. Friend. The hon. Member opposite said that I should sit on the Opposition Front Bench to make up the sparse numbers. I said that it was not the Opposition Front Bench but the Government Front Bench which needed reinforcement, and it would be nice to see the Attorney-General, who has never put his nose in the Chamber during the discussions on this Bill.</p>

<p>I would say that my hon. Friend would be an excellent person to be there, considering how it was that the Leader of the House was yesterday persuaded to reserve for the Order Paper those iniquitous proposals to be put on the Statute Book.<br/>
To come back to what is far more serious, for the benefit of the Under-Secretary of State I will repeat the situation. An employer has a strike on his hands. We come to the second employer. The second employer deliberately decides to go to the help of the first employer, who, for the purpose of this Clause, is not an extraneous party. We now come to the second situation. The second employer already has a contract existing with the first employer. A union brings pressure to bear on him not to fulfil his contract, because if he fulfils his contract the primary employer will not be damaged. Is that employer in that case, who is only normally fulfilling the contract, extraneous for this purpose, or not?


The third situation which arises is where the employer has a contract with another employer who is still in dispute, and then the other employer takes on a further obligation under the existing contract to make good losses which the employer in dispute is having as a result of the dispute which is going on. If a union brings pressure to bear on that employer who has the existing contract and has taken on a further burden, and if that employer suffers damage on his existing contract by virtue of taking on the extra burden, is that an extraneous matter under the Clause?<br/>
Fourth, what happens if in normal commercial negotiations there is a dispute and another employer negotiates a fresh contract with the employer in dispute and starts to perform it? Is he thereby endamaged as an extraneous person if a union brings pressure to bear upon the employer in order to prevent the employer in dispute from being successful in his dispute?<br/>
There are four fairly easy matters, and I look forward to the hon. Gentleman's reply to them.<br/>
The next point I want to make&#x2014;and it is important&#x2014;is this. We had a statement by the Solicitor-General, when he was talking about action taken under this Clause in relation to action under Clause 86&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>

<p>Will the hon. Member allow me to disabuse hon. Members about the situation? The hon. Member surely knows that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State is involved with negotiations over the Post Office dispute. I will say no more than that. I think the Committee would at least ex-

cuse him on that ground. The Solicitor-General, who will be replying to the debate, is having a very brief break, having sat here since 3.30 this afternoon.</p>

<p>I am glad to know that the Secretary of State is not deliberately an extraneous party to the debate. I accept that he is engaged in serious negotiations, and I am glad his Department is working on conciliation, which it has failed to do for so long. I appreciate that the Solicitor-General has been here all day, and that he has attempted to answer our questions, but he has failed to do so.<br/>
The Solicitor-General said that if sympathetic action was taken in support of a strike by a registered trade union which was originally unofficial, that secondary action was unfair industrial practice. However, if the trade union executive made that strike official, the unfair industrial practice which constituted the secondary boycott became official, and the actions of those people were one minute regarded as unofficial and the next minute as official. But in a constitutional strike which later becomes unofficial, the secondary boycott is at first official and legitimate and then becomes unofficial. So the answer is a banana. What is the logic of this? The hon. Member for Nelson and Colne (Mr. Waddington) said that we had been talking midsummer madness about the Bill, but the Solicitor-General made confusion worse confounded by his attitude.<br/>
Under the Bill, action which is not official industrial action is unfair, and if unfair action is taken by a registered trade union, that union may be liable to pay damages of up to &#x00A3;100,000. But when a trade union which is not registered or a group of people take part in an action which may at one time be legal and become illegal, or at one time be illegal and become legal, where will the quantum of damages and the limitation be placed? We are making an ass of the law.<br/>
To take this one stage further, two unions may be involved in a dispute. For the sake of argument I assume that they are both registered and that the dispute is legal. One of those unions may recognise the dispute and the other may not. The workers may belong to two separate


unions. If one group of workers belongs to the A.E.F., for example, and the A.E.F. recognises the strike, they are justified as a secondary industrial boycott. But say they are members of the Transport and General, which does not recognise the strike. They can say: "We support the A.E.F. which is an official strike but not the unofficial T.G.W.U. strike because if we do we shall be subject to the penalties of the Bill." It is a banana. Whichever way you go you slip on it.</p>

<p>The Solicitor-General is making the law asinine and is in danger of bringing the whole of the law into disrepute. Law can so easily be destroyed by actions which are shown to be so class-motivated and against the working class. Weighting the scales in this way is not a new idea. I would like to read a quotation from the debate on the Trade Unions (No. 2) Bill on 30th May, 1911:
<q>It is not good for trade unions that they should be brought into contact with the courts, and it is not good for the courts. The courts hold justly a high and, I think, unequalled prominence in respect of the world in criminal cases, and in civil cases between man and man, no doubt, they deserve and command the respect and admiration of all classes in the community, but where class issues are involved, and where party issues are involved, it is impossible not to pretend that the courts command the same degree of general confidence. On the contrary, they do not, and a very large number of our population have been led to the opinion that they are, unconsciously no doubt, biassed."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 30th May, 1911; Vol. 26, c. 1022.]</q></p>

<p>The former Prime Minister had to some extent overcome the effect of his original sin.<br/>
Not only are these Clauses basically unfair, not only do they hit at the strong, but they hit those in small institutions who cannot look towards a greater institution to protect them. More than this they show the bias contained in the Bill.<br/>
Employers can pay into a strike fund to indemnify themselves against a strike but if a trade union wants to help a strike fund it will be punished. What happens if trade unions say that they will have a general strike fund to be used at their discretion in industrial disputes? Will this be caught by the Bill.<br/>

<p>If the hon. Gentleman looks at Clause 86 he will see that the provisions for a strike will have to be drawn very carefully. If there is a collection, like the whip-round we had for the Post Office workers or in support of a strike, then the people doing that are likely to be caught by the Bill.

<p>The hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, North (Mr. McNamara) described this problem as "a banana". But it appeared to me that the greater part of his speech was concerned with Clause 86.

<p>Clauses 86 and 87 are interlinked. Though hon.

<p>I make no complaint about it, because the hon. Gentleman made some fair points. I wish merely to make it clear that it is Clause 86, and not 87, which differentiates between a fair and an unfair dispute.<br/>
We have been discussing whether the words in the Clause will be construed in the way in which this Committee would wish. In other words, this is a matter, first, of the intention, and then of the wording necessary to ensure that our intention is put into effect. My hon. and


learned Friend has assured us that he will look closely at several parts of the Clause to which his attention has been drawn. In view of that, I am inclined to leave the lawyers to argue about the wording, and I am no lawyer.<br/>
As for the intention, it was interesting to hear the hon. Member for Liverpool, Walton (Mr. Heifer) cite the case of the Imperial Hotel, Torquay, <i>versus</i> the Transport and General Workers' Union. He described it as a legal ruling. However, in my part of the world it was a little more than a decision of the court, because it affected the future livelihoods of many people.<br/>
As my hon. and learned Friend said, Clause 118 will prevent the courts entertaining another case of this sort, and, if they do, they will be unable to reach the same conclusion. For that reason, it is important to know what the case involved.<br/>
It was about an inter-union dispute. The Municipal and General Workers' Union had organised catering workers in Torquay for many years. The Transport and General Workers' Union came along&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>

<p>We have to remember what we have been told by hon. Members opposite so often. They maintain that the voluntary solution of these problems can be safely left to the T.U.C. What happened in this case was that not only was the T. and G.W.U. in dispute with a number of hotels, but it operated a secondary boycott against the Imperial Hotel and also against a number of smaller hotels which had nothing to do with the dispute. No employer could find a solution in any event, because it was an inter-union dispute and had to be resolved by the unions concerned.</p>

<p>I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will agree that I was citing a legal judgment and not discussing the rights and wrongs of the dispute. Will he also agree that some employers will make agreements with those whom they regard as tame unions, and then, when another union secures a majority of members, they argue that their agreement is with the tame union, even though it has the smaller membership?</p>

<p>I do not think that any members of the M.G.W.U. present tonight would be inclined to agree with the hon. Gentleman's reference to its being a tame union. <i>[Interruption.]</i> Is it a tame union? This was the inference. If not. I apologise.<br/>
I have known of staff associations, for instance, which have been and would be the type of organisation to which one would refer as "tame" and to which employers can say, "There is no need for us to recognise you as another <i>bona fide</i> union because we have one." I accept that point.<br/>
To return to my point, the hon. Gentleman was either suggesting or inferring that the M.G.W.U. was a tame union. <i>[Interruption.]</i> If not, we can forget about that particular argument.<br/>
There were two <i>bona fide</i> T.U.C. affiliated unions in dispute with each other. The M.G.W.U. had had recognition agreements with the hoteliers of Torquay over many years. Then the Transport and General Workers' Union walked in and declared that it would organise Torquay. The Transport and General Workers' Union has a perfect right&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>

<p>We have been reminded that under Clause 118 the power of the


civil court to deal with these matters is to be restricted, because there will be other ways to deal with them. Had the Imperial Hotel not had the funds to entertain a court case&#x2014;most of the other hotels would probably not have taken the risk&#x2014;I question whether it would have got to court at all. Yet many hoteliers who were not involved in the primary dispute were put in extreme danger.<br/>
The Clause will at least cover that point. A small employer will not have to ask the civil court to make a decision and, because of different legal opinions and decisions in various cases, not know until the case has been decided how much expense he has incurred in trying to pursue his protection, as was proved in the Imperial Hotel case. There could be another case which could go the other way, and Clause 118 takes away the right to take it up in a civil court. This is a much more sensible way of doing it.<br/>
11.0 p.m.<br/>
The principle of the Clause has been explained time and time again. Where some other employer is closely connected, either as a party to the dispute or as having taken action in material support of the primary party, the Clause will not apply. There would be complete justification for a secondary boycott being operated in that other company because it was materially connected with the original dispute.<br/>
On the other hand, where one has organisations, companies, and small businesses which have no connection whatever with the dispute and which can do nothing about it because it is none of their business, unless the Clause is there they could be damaged and even put out of business by a secondary boycott, although they could do nothing about the dispute. Some rewording will be needed, but the principle of the Clause is correct in protecting those not materially connected with a dispute from a secondary boycott.<br/>
My hon. and learned Friend has given an undertaking that we can look at this again on Report, but the principle is good and it will prevent some unfair damage in certain circumstances.</p>

<p>The hon. Member might tell us what expense the new Industrial Courts will cost the country with the salaries of High Court judges and the paraphernalia which will surround them.<br/>
The question of secondary boycott and blacking of work is germane to industrial solidarity in this country. My right hon. Friend the Member for Blackburn (Mrs. Castle) and my hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Walton (Mr. Heller) earlier said that this was a vital industrial activity which was not practised to extreme in this country, but there are occasions when it is necessary.<br/>
The Roberts Arundel case was given as an instance. It was a classic case. That was an engineering firm producing engineering equipment for the cotton industry. It employed skilled engineers. The interesting thing was that the firm would not become a member of the Engineering Employers' Federation. The voluntary code of conduct that exists between the trade unions and the Federation would have prevented the very things that happened at Roberts Arundel. It would have preserved the basic right of trade union recognition and basic negotiating rights. These are agreed by established firms as being fundamental rights that operate throughout the engineering industry.<br/>
Secondary boycotts arise in most cases with firms that are non-federated. They are normally small firms; very often the employers are of the militant type, who take an individualistic view of trade unions. They adopt a 19th century attitude. In consequence, disputes often arise.<br/>
In the South-West the workers in an engineering firm recently went on strike for about nine months&#x2014;not on the question of trade union recognition but as a result of a wages case. My union paid the strike pay for nine months, and in the end had to impose a levy on its members. It circulated all the branches of my organisation asking that all the work coming from that firm should not be handled&#x2014;in other words, that it should be blacked. There was no calling out of


members of the union in the other firms. That is why the Solicitor-General has worded the Bill in such a way as to catch action other than strike action. The members of the union were not called out and were not instructed not to handle the sub-contract work; they took their own decision.<br/>
Apparently it is all right for an employer to send out his work for subcontract in case of a dispute; he is covered by the law. But if a trade union tries to prevent that sub-contract work being done it is acting outside the terms of the Bill.<br/>
The hon. Member for Peterborough (Sir Harmar Nicholls) mentioned the protection that exists for employers' indemnity funds in Clause 87(3). It is an affront to the trade union movement that in the very Clause that takes away some of the basic rights of trade unions and penalises them for taking secondary action the employers are having their position strengthened. It is incredible.<br/>
There is no defence for that sort of thing. Nobody objects to an employer having an indemnity fund, like a trade union's strike fund, but if the hon. Member for Peterborough and the Solicitor-General think that the provisions of the Clause represent an evening out of the imbalance between unions and employers their idea of natural justice is different from that of my hon. Friends and me.<br/>
I turn to the question of preventing secondary boycotts, and the effect that that has had in the United States. The 1947 Taft-Hartley Act was found to be not strong enough, so the Landrum-Griffin Amendment was brought in. In November, 1969, I was in the United States&#x2014;in California&#x2014;when the General Electric Company strike was on at Los Angeles and San Francisco. I visited some of the firms involved and talked to the men on the picket lines. I found that an official dispute was taking place throughout the whole of the General Electric Company's factories in the United States, involving about 148,000 employees, who were out for about six months. They were forbidden to ask for support from other unions, such as the Teamsters, who were bringing in supplies. The President of the Teamsters told me that they were liable to a fine of about 50,000 dollars a. day if they told their members not to take goods in. It

was far stricter even than that; if any of his members acted unilaterally, the union was still responsible.<br/>
Ironically, the effect of this was to extend the length of the dispute. We all know the figures for the length of the official disputes in the U.S.A., and one of the reasons is that, because of the rigours of the law, unions in a dispute cannot take secondary action. This tends to solidify the situation: the employers sit it out and the unions have to do the same.<br/>
We are always being told about the detrimental effect of strikes on the British economy. The British economy. unlike the American, cannot sit out strikes. If we want to rejig our union structure so that there are frontal industrial battles lasting for months, not weeks, in the central heavy industries, this is what the legally binding contracts and procedure agreements tend to bring. They bring rigidity, because there can be no movement throughout the period of the deal in question.</p>

<p>The hon. Member makes this comparison between the position in the United States and the position here. In the automobile industry in the United States, there are, at the end of probably a three-year agreement, these long strikes, which may run, normally, for six or eight weeks&#x2014;perhaps longer, but that is the normal length. Our own automobile industry lost in 1970 very roughly 25 per cent. of production through strikes. That is 10 weeks in one year. I suggest that six to eight weeks in every three years is preferable.</p>

<p>I do not have the comparative figures here now, but hon. Members recognise that the American strike record last year was about three or four times as bad as our own.

The hon Gentleman can see from the comparative figures what I am getting at.</p>

<p>In his very interesting booklet, "Greener Grass", on page 47. Mr. Lowry says:

<p>My hon. Friend underlines what I have said by calling in aid Mr. Lowry, who has wide experience in industrial relations on the employers' side.<br/>
What would be the position if secondary action were to be taken by a registered or an unregistered trade union&#x2014;let us say it was my union, the A.E.U.W.&#x2014;circularising its branches asking members to black work done at a certain firm&#x2014;for example, Fine Tubes? This would be the case of a firm producing a commodity and having sub-contractors which were not directly concerned in the dispute.<br/>
What would be the position if my union had a ballot of members in a district asking them to contribute money with a view to supplementing the strike pay of members on strike? Would that be construed as a secondary act, and would the union be liable? What would be the position if a multi-national company or a large combine with plants in different parts of Great Britain and abroad decided, because of a dispute, to transfer work to a plant abroad? Fords decided to transfer work from a plant in Britain to a plant at Ghent. The workers took action, because they did not want the work to go to Ghent, as the matter had not been cleared properly in the British plant. They warned their brethren in Europe to this effect.<br/>

<p>He is a good authority. His analysis of the situation is as good as that which can be introduced on the Bill. The Solicitor-General does not like the professor's politics. We do not like the Solicitor-General's politics, but we do not question his right to be Solicitor-General, nor do we assert that he is not an adequate or qualified lawyer.

Some of the lawyers opposite seem to think that Professor Wedderburn has escaped from the trap and is not playing the game. We pray the professor in aid because he is a most valuable and outstanding authority on American and British law.<br/>
Who is to explain the meaning of Clauses 85 to 87 to rank and file trade unionists and shop stewards? The Solicitor-General would not be a good person to send on that errand. Much more will be heard about these Clauses, because people will be trapped by them when seeking to exercise their fundamental trade union rights. These Clauses will probably be some of the first Clauses which will impinge upon the trade union movement. The unions should study these Clauses in great detail. We can merely vote against this matter.</p>

<p>I intervene only to make a brief comment on the doctrine or principle of interference, which has had some rough treatment during the debate, and to take up two observations which fell from the hon. Member for Liverpool, Walton (Mr. Heifer) in what I freely concede was a carefully considered opening speech.<br/>
The subsection dealing with the matter of interference is comparatively friendless, and I understand that my hon. and learned Friend the Solicitor-General has expressed himself as not content with the drafting. For my part, having looked at it, I find the drafting wide and somewhat imprecise. One hon. Gentleman earlier quoted an observation of Sir Winston Churchill in his Liberal days. I can express my view of the drafting in terms of an observation of Sir Winston Churchill in his Conservative days: I can without difficulty confine my enthusiasm within the bounds of decorum.<br/>
But the criticism has gone a good deal wider than the drafting. It has gone to the principle, and I wish now to point out that this principle has a better background of respectability than might have been thought from some of the comments made.<br/>
The hon. Member for Walton quoted the passage in Lord Denning's judgment in the case of Torquay Hotel Company <i>v.</i> Cousins, in which he said:
<q>The time has come when the principle should be further extended to cover deliberate and direct interference with the execution of a contract without that causing any breach".</q>


The hon. Gentleman did not like those last words, but it is fair to say that the reason for their incorporation was that there was in the contract for the delivery of oil between the Imperial Hotel and Esso an exception clause, a <i>force majeure</i> clause, which freed Esso from liability for non-fulfilment of contract to supply due to labour dispute.<br/>
It follows, therefore, where there is a <i>force majeure</i> clause of that kind that, however great or gross the interference, there can never be any breach of contract. I imagine that that is the reason why Lord Denning expressed himself in that way.<br/>
If it had been a lawyer who had said, "We must look only at whether there was a breach of contract between the parties," we should have come under instant attack from hon. Members opposite, who would have said, "You must not look at this just within the narrow confines of commercial contract. That shows your lawyer-like predilection for these things." But I am turning the tables on the hon. Gentleman. It is he who, at any rate by implication, is now saying that we must look at it in that narrow form, and it is I who, though a lawyer, am saying that we must not look at it merely like that but must look at it in its broad social context. That, I think, was what Lord Denning was doing.<br/>
The other observation that the hon. Gentleman made was that the principle of interference was, in effect, a revolutionary departure in the law relating to these matters.</p>

<p>The right hon. and learned Gentleman is nothing if not amusing. Does he agree that this emphasises the point being made throughout on this side that the implication of giving such wide powers to the judiciary as are being given to what is, in effect, a new industrial branch of the High Court is that the judiciary will be able to make law, just as Lord Denning made law in that case by extending the concept of a breach of contract

to the concept of interference with contract?</p>

<p>I think not. The hon. Gentleman is really inviting me to anticipate the content of the next Clause, which, unhappily, we probably shall not be able to discuss. I should be out of order to do so. I would only say in parenthesis that this is all very reminiscent to me. I heard all the same arguments about these matters when I stood night after night at the Dispatch Box 14 or 15 years ago with part-Ministerial responsibility for the passage of the Restrictive Trade Practices Act, when we set up the Restrictive Practices Court. Not only did we win in the Division Lobbies, which is important; not only did we win in argument, which is more important; but, most important of all, we won by the test of time and the practical experience of the workings of that Court. Therefore, I must reject the hon. Gentleman's argument on that.</p>

<p>In that case the hon. Gentleman did even better than we thought. When the long days and laborious nights of this Committee stage are over, it is not too late for him to read for the Bar. If he joins the Middle Temple and wants a Master of the Bench to sponsor his application and testify to his credentials, I should be only too happy to oblige.<br/>
The principle of interference has a longer ancestry than perhaps we would think from the hon. Gentleman's remark about its being a revolutionary departure. The original concept of inducement to break a contract goes back about 120 years to the case of Lumley <i>v.</i> Gye. If the concept of interference does not go back so far, at any rate the words are found in the celebrated trade union case of Quinn <i>v.</i> Leathem at the turn of the century. In that case the principle was that each of the parties has a right to have the contractual relations with the other duly observed. The judgment there contained the following passage:
<q>It is a violation of legal rights to interfere with contractual relations recognised by law if there be no sufficient justification for interference.</q>


It is right and proper to say, in explanation of a very good contemporary judge, that it is against that background that Lord Denning made his dictum. But, of course, he did not suggest that interference should be written into the law simply in that general, abstract and undefined term. On the contrary, as we would expect of him, he defined quite precisely the requisites that there must be to constitute interference. There must be, first, a preventing or hindering; secondly, the interference must be deliberate; and, thirdly, the, interference must be direct.<br/>
11.30 p.m.<br/>
These matters do not seem to have been written into the Clause as it stands, and it may be for that reason that my hon. and learned Friend was dissatisfied with the drafting. But I feel that it is right that the Committee should have in mind that the concept of itself in the most strictly defined and more limited form is a respectable concept, and it may well be that, if it is defined by reference to these essential ingredients to which Lord Denning referred, we can, as the House of Commons, properly give statutory effect to the gist of what he said in the Torquay case&#x2014;that the common law would be seriously deficient if it did not condemn such interference.<br/>
It is the business of Parliament to buttress and reinforce the common law by Statute when it is so required, and that is what, when put into proper form, this Clause, as I see it, seeks to do.</p>

<p>I cannot hope to emulate the right hon. and learned Member for Hertfordshire, East (Sir D. Walker-Smith) because, as must be obvious, I am not a lawyer. But at one point in his charming and witty speech he talked about being "not content", and I thought that perhaps he had some nostalgia for another place. Some of us exercised a self-denying ordinance on the Amendments to this Clause, and I intend my remarks on the Clause to be brief so as to give other hon. Members a chance to take part in the debate.<br/>
The Solicitor-General said earlier that he had been persuaded to some extent

that Clause 87 was unsatisfactory in its drafting. However, I have since become somewhat worried in that perhaps some of his hon. Friends are beginning to persuade him that the Clause does not, after all, need so much redrafting. I hope that he will confirm that he will reconsider the drafting. Indeed, I hope that he will eradicate the Clause altogether.<br/>
If Clause 87 is implemented, many good, God-fearing, decent people will probably be in dispute and in violation of the law for the rest of their lives. I want to give a simple example. Sympathy strikes have been mentioned. I have referred before to my experience in the mining industry. One can get sympathy strikes of such a nature that if one were to suggest to the men that they were in violation or in dispute with the law, one would arouse a great deal of ire and would. in fact, probably cause more industrial disputes.<br/>
There was an old tradition in the mining industry whereby whenever a man was killed the pit was idle for that day. This was done for two reasons. The first was that, with the daily toll in the mines, a death was something which people&#x2014;not only the miners&#x2014;were distressed about. Secondly, the miners believed that it was the only way in which they could make their protest and teach management to make sure that conditions were safe.<br/>
But they withdrew their labour at a cost to themselves. As time went on, not the management but the union tried to alter that. We tried to persuade miners that we would build up a fund, that there would be contributions from management and union to ensure that dependants received additional compensation. I speak from vivid experience, for my father was killed in the pit.<br/>
It was difficult to implement that scheme. Sometimes we can manage to persuade the men, but lawyers never will. I have had the experience of going to the pit and meeting men walking off the night shift saying that they were going home because John Smith or John Brown had been killed, that they had been saying for weeks that the area was unsafe. They are not always justified, but they go home as a protest.<br/>
The Solicitor-General may institute fines and penalties on men going home,


but they fine and penalise themselves by doing so, for, because of the bonus shift system, they lose more than one day's pay. But they do so as a token of their respect to the individual who has been killed and as a protest against unsafe working conditions. No lawyer in the House of Commons could solve that problem, nor compel the miners to work in a section in which a man has been killed if they feel that they will not work, not even if they are penalised, put in gaol and lose their furniture.</p>

<p>I appreciate the hon. Member's deep feelings on this matter, but it is not lawyers who will do the compelling but the attitude of the employer. Has he any reason to expect a different attitude?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1971-02-17a.1997.1" hansard_membership_id="3861" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/14419" speakername="Mr. Eadie" colnum="1997" time="">
<p>I do not want to be distracted from my theme. The hon. Member must have heard the contributions of eminent legal gentlemen who suggest that we can solve the problem in a context of legality, within a legal framework. I assume that when he was fighting the General Election the hon. Member himself spoke about a legal framework for industrial relations. I am saying that industrial relations is a human problem which cannot be dealt with in a legal framework.<br/>
I should like to allow time for more hon. Members to speak and I shall curtail what I would have said about the sympathy strike. I agree with what my hon. Friend the Member for Salford, West (Mr. Orme) said about these disputes. In the mining industry the men take the view, "If you injure one, you injure all." We have had many unofficial disputes, and there have been many in which I have tried to persuade men to go back to work and try to negotiate. I was an official at an unofficial strike. I defend the right to go on unofficial strike, for sometimes there is an increase in productivity as a result and sometimes there is an improvement in the relationship between management and men.<br/>
Under this Clause, managements will be able to indemnify themselves, but if a pit is on strike and the families of the men are suffering, miners in that part of the coalfield will be in violation of the law if they take up a collection for those families. This is a tradition. We have

had it for 100 years. Even if they are 100 per cent. wrong, miners will not allow men, women and children to suffer hardship because of money problems.<br/>
If the Government put this Clause into operation, they will put many decent, God-fearing people in such a position that they will violate the law. We were elected to uphold parliamentary democracy and to represent the people. It will be a serious violation of parliamentary democracy if we pass the Clause, never mind the Bill, and place people in such a position that, through no fault of their own, they are in breach of the law.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1971-02-17a.1998.0" hansard_membership_id="387" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/16355" speakername="The Solicitor-General" colnum="1998" time="">
<p>I acknowledge the obvious sincerity and force with which the hon. Member for Midlothian (Mr. Eadie) addressed the Committee. I underline what I have tried to make clear throughout our proceedings. We are not seeking to introduce a law to regulate or transform human relationships in an unrealistic way or attempting to deal with the human and real problems about which the hon. Gentleman was talking. There is no suggestion of remedies being brought to bear against individuals leaving their place of work in the circumstances which the hon. Gentleman described. There is no possibility of remedies being sought or invoked against people leaving their place of work or being persuaded to do so on grounds of safety. It is inconceivable that any lawyer will advise under these provisions that proceedings should be commenced against people leaving the coal face in the circumstances described by the hon. Member. It is not our intention, it is not a possibility and it is not the objective.<br/>
Hon. Members on both sides of the Committee fully appreciate the explosive conditions in which industrial disputes can sometimes occur, provoked by misconduct or incompetence by management or by dangerous or adverse conditions. The Bill is not designed to check, and will not have the effect of checking, the ordinary right of industrial protest. But we cannot accept the way in which the hon. Member for Liverpool, Walton (Mr. Heller) invited the Committee to approach the problem. He put the matter as widely as this: the right to strike in any form of dispute and to call


any form of strike is basic and fundamental and cannot be tampered with. That is an unrealistic and, I suggest, unacceptable proposition in this day and age.<br/>
We live in a country in which the balance of industrial bargaining power is not so adverse to organised labour or to workers as it was 50 or 60 years ago when the law first took its present form. We live in a society in which people are more and more interrelated, and the harm which can be done by precipitate and unnecessary calling of industrial action outweighs the advantage, which can be secured for anyone concerned in it.<br/>
We suggest that it is reasonable to see in what ways the balance needs to be altered. The Committee deceives itself if it does not acknowledge that in almost every other sophisticated modern industrialised society the right to call strikes does not exist in such an unrestrained and unrestricted form as it does in this country.</p>

<p>I have not very much time. Whatever hon. Members opposite may say, I am not seeking to advance a system of industrial relations comparable to that which prevails east of the Iron Curtain. [An HON. MEMBER: "What about Poland?] The hon. Gentleman talks about Poland. [HON. MEMBERS: "What about Spain and Greece?"] Hon. Members opposite must try to live in the real world. Time and again in these proceedings we have had fanciful speeches suggesting that we are taking the first step towards the corporate State. One does not even understand what this concept with which we are being charged is meant to mean.<br/>
11.45 p.m.<br/>
All we are doing is looking round at almost every other comparable country facing the same kind of industrial problems in the second half of the twentieth century and recognising that balances and checks upon the freedom to induce industrial action are different almost everywhere else and that we are getting further and further behind the field in the industrial race. It is for that reason that we introduce these proposals here.<br/>
In the context of this Clause my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Southport (Mr. Percival) and my hon. Friend the Member for Totnes (Mr. Mawby) both gave a very clear exposition of the basic object of the Clause, and the description of the Torquay case indicated why it is necessary to get away from the maze through which the Torquay hotel proprietors were able to steer themselves. I am very grateful to my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Hertfordshire, East (Sir D. Walker-Smith) for his own very clear exposition of the object of the Clause and his explanation of the words of Lord Denning which the hon. Member for Liverpool, Walton quoted.<br/>
The intention here is to provide a remedy in respect of procuring deliberately and directly a breach of a contract or deliberately and directly interfering with the execution of a contract. That is the objective, and there is no novelty in trying to achieve that.<br/>
My hon. and learned Friend the Member for Southport asked me to confirm that it was not intended to restrict strikes designed to prevent entry into a contract. That is not the intention. He invited me to look at the effect of calling strikes intended to bring about the termination of a terminable contract. I will look at that. It is obviously an example taken from the Torquay hotel case. He commented&#x2014;I have taken a note of what he said&#x2014;on possible misunderstanding of inclusion of the words "associated employers". Again, the key to the inclusion of those words is the proposition that somebody shall not be taken to be supporting by reason only of the fact that he is an associated employer by reason only of the fact that he is a member of the employers' federation.</p>

<p>Then can the hon. and learned Gentleman explain to the Committee why in Clause 86, when dealing with workers, it is "aiding and abetting" but that when dealing with the employers' side, in subsection (2)<i>(b)</i> of this Clause, it is that
<q>he has not &#x2026; taken any action in material support of a party</q>
to the industrial dispute?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1971-02-17a.2000.1" hansard_membership_id="387" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/16355" speakername="The Solicitor-General" colnum="2000" time="">
<p>Because I suggest to the Committee that taking any


action in material support is a much wider concept than the rather narrower proposition of aiding and abetting, and the employer who has taken any action in material support of another employer party is immediately in jeopardy in this situation. That is certainly the way in which I read it.<br/>
The comparison which might also be made, and has been made by some hon. Members, is the fact that the employer is not to be regarded as supporting by reason only of the fact that he is contributing to a general strike insurance fund, and the parallel to that is that the worker or organisation which is contributing ordinary membership dues whether to the organisation itself or to a federation of workers' organisations is not for that reason supporting or giving assistance to any particular strike.<br/>
I was asked about the extent to which a strike levy amongst the workpeople, either in a given town or in a given group of industries, is raising money to produce funds for workpeople elsewhere on strike. That would not be indirect or supporting action because it would not be action taken to call a strike because it was intended to aid and abet a strike which was unfair. It would only be making money available to people taking part in a strike and would not in itself give rise to any difficulties at all.<br/>
I was asked a number of questions about the Roberts Arundel case, and I hope what I say will not be misunderstood. That case has a long and particularly complicated factual history, with an emotive background, and I will not answer the questions with specific reference to that case. It is right to say in that kind of case that new recognition remedies would provide an alternative earlier remedy. There would be no restraint on any official strike which was subsequently called about the terms which the employer was offering, nor would there be any difficulty about calling a strike designed to persuade suppliers not to renew their contracts, nor on striking against people taking material action in support of the original employing company&#x2014;</p>

<p>&#x2014;I am coming to that next&#x2014;nor on inducing action designed to prevent any new, fresh or further sub-contracting or giving material support to action designed to secure the breach of pre-existing agreements. So sub-contractors would be within the scope of the Clause. I hope that answers the hon. Member's point.<br/>
If I may come back to the more general point&#x2014;</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1971-02-17a.2002.1" hansard_membership_id="6836" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/29659" speakername="Mr. Harold Walker" colnum="2002" time="">
<p>Will the hon. and learned Gentleman deal with the point raised by my right hon. Friend about what seems to us to be the exceptional position of employers in relation to strike indemnity funds and the allowability of contributions for tax purposes?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1971-02-17a.2002.2" hansard_membership_id="387" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/16355" speakername="The Solicitor-General" colnum="2002" time="">
<p>I have already explained that contributions to a strike indemnity fund of a general kind are in the same category as contributions to a union's strike fund not directed to any particular strike. They are in exactly the same position.<br/>
On the question of tax liability, I cannot add anything to what my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary said in the answer he quoted. It depends no doubt on the structure and construction of the fund of the association or body. Far be it from me to challenge what the Financial Secretary said about that.<br/>
To come back to the central point with which the hon. Member for Liverpool, Walton began, he suggested that we are here out-Taft-Hartleying Taft-Hartley. Not so. The points made by the hon. Member for Salford, West (Mr. Orme) demonstrated how much further American legislation goes, so he says, in attempting to restrain secondary boycotts. It deals specifically with refusal to handle, refusal to deal with, refusal to deliver-blacking is very generally defined. The hon. Gentleman quoted the case of the long General Electric strike; but there is something odd about the criticism being made that we are going unduly far when, on the observations made by hon. Members opposite, it seems that we are not going anything like as far down that particular road, let alone many other roads.<br/>
We come back to the point that there is here a legitimate objective. The hon. and learned Member for Montgomery


(Mr. Hooson) agreed that it was a legitimate objective, and invited us, as we shall, to look again at the formulation of the Clause. The hon. Member for Walton intervened to quote a sentence or two from Mr. Pat Lowry's book about the situation in the United States. He quoted the first two sentences of the paragraph which I am looking at now which sought to suggest that wild-cat and unconstitutional strikes are a problem in the United States, whatever system they may have there. He did not quote the immediately preceding sentences:
<q>The great majority of strikes are constitutional and tend to be lengthy. What is more important, they are a contingency which can be precisely forecast in terms of time and, equally important, they can be planned against with great care. The impact of a strike of this character is therefore much less severe than the more frequent unconstitutional strikes which are so typical of the British situation.</q>
It is precisely for that reason, against that diagnosis, that I invite the Committee to support the Clause.</p>

<p>On a point of order. Sir Robert. You will remember that when we were discussing Clause 86 you ruled that we could make a reference to Clause 87 but we should not go into details. On the basis of that ruling many of us who wished to raise points on Clauses 86 and 87, because we felt that they were linked, waited until the discussion on Clause 87. When Clause 87 came I was fortunate enough to catch your eye. The Solicitor-General said that he would answer questions on Clause 87 when he came to deal with it. He was not in the Chamber at the time, and I understand that, because he had been here for a long time, and, like the rest of us, needed some refreshment. However, I gave him four specific cases on which I asked for his legal opinion. I asked the Under-Secretary to take them down. I gave him a further number of cases on Clause 86 and raised points about a strike fund. At no time have we had an answer to these points from the Solicitor-General. With respect, you said that on Clause 86 we could refer to Clause 87 in passing. We did this, and we had an undertaking from the Solicitor-General that he would answer the points on Clause 87, but we have not had this.</p>

<p>I have the hon. Gentleman's point. I am able to say that

it is not a point of order, because I cannot control exactly what the hon. and learned Gentleman says. All that I can do is to say what would be in order and what would not. There is nothing that the Chair can do to assist the hon. Gentleman. I cannot compel the Solicitor-General to make his speech in a certain way. That is not to say that I do not have sympathy with the hon. Gentleman. There is nothing I can do.</p>

<p>If the Solicitor-General refuses to answer my hon. Friend's questions, perhaps he will, at even this late stage, answer some questions. Would he say whether, in his view, under this Clause an ordinary supplier who knows that his supplies are bound to break a strike by giving material support will come under Clause 87(2)? Will he get up and tell us whether this Clause reverses the decision in Thompson and Deakin? Will he give his opinion? He has just got time to do that in spite of the guillotine.</p>

<p>The question of an ordinary supplier, looked at in the context of Clause 87(2), depends on the words of Clause 87(2)<i>(b)</i>. If the ordinary supplier is supplying ordinary supplies in the course of his normal trading relationship, then he has not, in contemplation or furtherance of a dispute, taken action in material support of the party to it. If he changes his trading pattern and begins doing work on a contracting-out basis or a sub-contracting basis, then he allies himself with the primary employer and immediately becomes exposed and cannot complain of strike action taken against him. The person who is following the normal pattern of trading is entitled to stand apart from the issues unless he takes some action to make himself a part of it.</p>

from solemn responsibility to farce and in the next few hours the Committee will wander round and round the Lobbies in such fashion that we do damage to ourselves, to the Government, the Opposition, to the reputation of Parliament and, above all, we are putting the House in a position where it is losing respectability and the respect of the country. I therefore propose that the House should now make procedure its servant and no longer be the servant of procedure.</p>

<p><i>(seated and covered)</i>: Further to the point of order raised by the hen. Member for Portsmouth, Langstone (Mr. Ian Lloyd). May I support his point of order and his contention that we had a serious and constructive debate up to midnight, when the "chopper" fell, and that it is indeed making a farce of Parliament that at midnight this Committee should be expected to accept on the nod the whole of Part IV of this Bill&#x2014;26 Clauses, all of them dealing with constitutional issues, all of them dealing with the setting up of a new court and giving new powers to industrial tribunals, not one item of which will have been debated by the Committee, with hon. Gentlemen opposite going through the Lobby like lobby fodder?</p>

<p>I am afraid that what the right hon. Lady is raising is not a point of order. I wonder whether what she has in mind&#x2014;what the hon. Member for Portsmouth, Langstone (Mr. Ian Lloyd) had in mind, but could not get to either through force of circumstance&#x2014;is that we might take the whole of these Clauses and vote for or against them <i>en bloc.</i> Is that what she has in mind?</p>

<p>No, that is not my point of order. It is that it is not maintaining the dignity and rights of this House to vote <i>en bloc</i> 26 constitutional Clauses, a whole section of the Bill, without having debated a word of it. My point of order is that it is to make a farce of Parliament for Part VI to be voted in its entirety without a word of debate. I therefore call on the Leader of the House to give us more time to debate Part VI. for which we have had no time.</p>

<p>I am sure the right hon. Lady knows very well that that is not a point of order for me, that she and I and the whole Committee are governed by the terms of the Resolution


of the House as set out by the Business Committee. There is nothing we can do about that. In case the matter should be raised again, to save the time of the Committee, may I say&#x2014;I know that this was not the right hon. Lady's point: this is me saying something for the moment&#x2014;that it is impossible to take the Clauses all together and vote against them, because it is contrary to the practice of the House and could militate against the right of any minority, however small, to express its opinion against any particular Clause?</p>

<p><i>(seated and covered):</i> On a point of order. On page 106 of the Bill it states quite clearly that certain parts of this Measure apply to Northern Ireland, but not all of it.

<p>Further to that point of order.

Could you help me to decide what is more mischievous and irresponsible than to vote on a serious Measure which does not affect the constituency which one represents? It is explicit in the Bill that it does not all affect Northern Ireland. Therefore, I ask you, Sir Alfred, to reconsider your answer and to say that those Members who come from constituencies in Northern Ireland should not, in decency, vote on those parts of the Bill which do not affect the Province.</p>

<p><i>(seated and covered)</i>: On a point of order, Sir Alfred. During the Second Reading debate, I asked the Under-Secretary of State


for Employed and Productivity whether legal aid would be available at the Industrial Court in respect of the matters on which we are now voting. He replied:
<q>That is a matter which will have to be considered &#x2026; I say quite frankly that I do not know the answer to that question but I will find out and tell the hon. Member. It will certainly have to be considered."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 14th December 1970; Vol. 808, c. 1072.]</q>
My point of order is this, Sir Alfred. Two months have passed since that reply was given, and we are now going through a process of voting on the part of the Bill dealing with the Industrial Court. Still no reply has been given to me, and no information has been given to the House. On the other hand, I understand from comments in the Press that certain assurances have been given to Conservative Members of Parliament who have raised exactly the same question, although the information has been denied to hon. Members who have taken part in the debate.<br/>
Is it in order to give that kind of reply and then make no statement to the House, yet divulge information to Government back benchers? Second, if we cannot have the argument here, would it not be in order at least to have replies to the questions which have previously been raised set out in a statement in the OFFICIAL REPORT, since we are denied the opportunity to debate them in the Chamber?</p>

<p>Further to that point of order. The Committee must be in some dilemma, and this is a very serious issue. We are discussing something that will play an important part in the courts. It might involve people brought before them, and lawyers. The records of the House will show that it was the intention of one of Her Majesty's Ministers to make a statement to the House to clear up the point raised by my hon. Friend. If that is not done not only will the House and

the whole of jurisprudence in the land have been deceived but the whole nation will have been deceived. There will be no confidence in any such law which the House passes unless a statement is made.</p>

<p>When the Chancellor made his statement on 27th October last and announced to the House that there would be a cessation of school milk to children at primary schools from the age of 7 there was a great deal of consternation on this side of the House. Arising from that, many of us have been addressing very many public meetings. At every public meeting without exception that I have addressed the question of school milk has been posed, because there is great anxiety about the reduction in the nutritional condition of the children who lose this liquid in the schools. At my last meeting, at Holytown in my constituency, one of the principals of one of the higher grade schools put a question to be about it, and coming as it did from such a responsible person it concerned me very much.<br/>
Consequently, I put down a Question to the Secretary of State for Scotland which was answered on 3rd February. It asked what action, if any, had been taken by the Minister to seek medical advice before he took this decisive step. The Under-Secretary of State for Health and Education, Scottish Office, replied for the Secretary of State and said that no medical advice had been sought. In fairness to him I should add that he did say that if medical advice was required it was, of course, available to him.<br/>
The following day, 4th February, I had a Question along the same lines to the right hon. Lady the Secretary of State for Education and Science. In putting my supplementary question I reminded her that the previous Government, my

own Government, had ceased to give free milk to children attending secondary schools and that, much as I felt that that was a retrograde step, I was assured, and the House was assured, that medical advice had been sought before that action was taken.<br/>
In conversation with my right hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle-upon-Tyne, Central (Mr. Edward Short), he told me last night that the reply he had received was that if he ceased to give milk to children under 10 it could be a disservice to the health of those children. In fairness to the Labour Government I emphasise that they at least took some action, but the present Administration have taken no action at all.<br/>
Consequently, I feel, and many medical experts feel, that this step will be detrimental to the health of the children attending primary schools. The harm to the health of the children by the decision to stop school milk to the over 7s. is incalculable. The Government's decision is particularly ironic in that it follows a survey by the Queen Elizabeth College School and Nutrition Unit which revealed that only 32 per cent. of the 4,000 children studied could be regarded as having a satisfactory diet.<br/>
A total of 57 per cent. were regarded as unsatisfactory and eleven per cent. as poor. The third of a pint of milk allocated to primary children is a valuable source of calcium. Pupils up to the age of 12 with medical requirements and pupils in special schools will continue to receive milk, so it is difficult to see the logic of an assumption that milk is of benefit to the physical well-being of the mentally deficient but not that of other children.<br/>
The estimated saving in a full year is about &#x00A3;9 million. Yesterday morning, I spoke by telephone to Dr. McQueen, the adviser for the Scottish Milk Marketing Board, which did a survey in Renfrewshire in 1968 after my Government stopped milk in secondary schools. They found that 14 per cent. of secondary pupils and 9 per cent. of senior secondary pupils ate nothing before going to school, and 13 per cent. of secondary pupils and 13 per cent. of senior secondary pupils drank nothing before going to school. Most of these were in the lower income groups.


One person who has investigated individuals is Dr. George Lynch, of Queen Elizabeth College, London University. His report, presented in September, 1970, shortly before the Government's White Paper, showed that the withdrawal of milk from the primary school children surveyed would increase the percentage of those deficient in calcium to 34 per cent., assuming no compensatory change in food habits. This question is crucial. One considers what happened when we stopped milk to secondary schools. In 1968&#x2013;69, the period during which that withdrawal came into effect, the sale of liquid milk declined by 18 million gallons. The Chairman of the Milk Marketing Board, Sir Richard Trehane, attributed this decline to a rise in the price of welfare milk and to the withdrawal of free milk in secondary schools.<br/>
When I put the question to the Secretary of State for Education and Science, my right hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle-upon,-Tyne, Central (Mr. Edward Short), the previous Secretary of State, asked in a supplementary question whether she was contemplating legislation to permit the sale of milk in schools, since we had been informed that this was possibly the Government's intention. The right hon. Lady replied that they were contemplating such legislation. I have had talks with the E.I.S.&#x2014;not on an official basis but with many of its members&#x2014;and they make it indelibly clear to me that they are not prepared to cooperate in this because it will be an added imposition on the work of teachers, and we all know that there is great difficulty in getting the required number of teachers, particularly in the secondary schools.<br/>
I am not trying to fly the flag of my party when it was in government, because I was bitterly opposed to the action which it took, but in fairness to the Labour Government I should say that I questioned my children after the decision had been taken and every one of them conceded that they did not bother much with milk at secondary school. I do not put that forward as a valid argument because many of the poorer families do not have the necessary milk supplied to them in their homes and this decision will have an adverse effect on the lower income groups. But when we made inquiries about primary school children it

was related to us that, in 1969&#x2013;70, 91 per cent. of the primary school children were taking school milk and, since the introduction of the scheme in 1946 arising from the Education Act, 1944, a steady 90 per cent. of children were taking school milk. We must give careful consideration to this fact if we have any thought for our citizens of tomorrow.<br/>
It has been stated by the Chancellor of the Exchequer that when this measure is introduced in the summer this year children who have reached the age of seven will continue to get free milk until the summer vacation. Some of the children will attain the age of seven during the summer period and after the summer vacation some children in the same class could be entitled to free milk but other children, because they are over the age of seven, would not. How will we tell the latter children that they are not entitled to free milk?<br/>
I ask the Minister to give very careful thought to this matter. There are many anomalies in this Government decision. It was a niggardly decision. The Government are playing with the health of the children. I want to thank the hon. Gentleman for being present, because I have kept him out of his bed and I have kept you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, out of your bed. But I do not make any apology for raising this subject. I feel strongly about it, and so do my hon. Friends. I ask the Under-Secretary of State to request the Secretary of State to retrace his steps and reverse this niggardly decision which will be detrimental to the well-being of our children.</p>

<p>I am grateful to the hon. Member for Bothwell (Mr. James Hamilton) for the way in which he has spoken on this subject. While some matters are raised in what I might call a political or controversial way, the hon. Gentleman has the merit of absolute consistency because he complained about the decision of the previous Government and he is now complaining about our decision.<br/>
Before I deal with the basis of the case, I should like to refer to two points which the hon. Gentleman mentioned. He


referred first to the survey which is being conducted by Dr. Lynch, of the Social Nutrition Research Unit at Queen Elizabeth College. This report has still to be published. Dr. Lynch has still not published details of his research, and it cannot be commented on objectively until we have that report.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman then asked whether health departments have ever been advised that school milk must now be stopped for the under 10s. The departments seek advice from the Committee on the Medical Aspects of Food Policy. That body has never said to us or to any previous Government that milk is essential for children over seven or between seven and 10.<br/>
The basis of the hon. Gentleman's comments was to criticise the Government on two points: firstly, that we have decided to discontinue the indiscriminate supply of free milk to all primary pupils over the age of seven and, secondly, that before reaching this decision we did not consult the British Medical Association.<br/>
To take the second point first, so far as I am aware, it has never been the practice to consult the British Medical Association on matters of this kind. The normal practice has been, where this is necessary and appropriate, to consult the Committee on Medical Aspects of Food Policy, a United Kingdom body of recognised experts chaired by the Chief Medical Officer of the Department of Health and Social Security and the Department of Education and Science. On this occasion, however, no such formal consultation seemed necessary. We are not proposing to withdraw milk from all pupils over a given age&#x2014;as the previous Government decided to withdraw it from all secondary pupils. We have made it clear that we intend that any primary school pupil of any age who requires milk on medical grounds will continue to get it free. Of course, all pupils in special schools, of any age, will continue to get it. Since the decision in regard to any particular child is to be left to the school medical officer, formal consultations were not necessary. It is, I think, significant, despite what has been said, that we have had no representations against our decision from any medical body. I appreciate, of course, that we have had representations, but, to my

knowledge, no medical body has made representations to us on this decision.<br/>
I turn now to the main issue. All of us recognise that school milk, at first at a nominal charge and since the war free of charge, has in the past helped to ensure the health of our pupils. But times change. We are not living in the 1930s or 1940s, and one-third of a pint of milk on 200 days in the year is no longer, in my view and that of my advisers, essential to ensure that our children are adequately nourished. It is perhaps desirable that the youngest pupils&#x2014;up to the age of seven&#x2014;should continue to get it, and there will be some older primary pupils who need it. It will still be provided for them. But we do not think that every other child needs this supplement to the diet provided at home and to the nourishing meals which are provided at school. In our view, this is a saving in public expenditure which can and should be made without any adverse effect on the health of our pupils.<br/>
In view of what the hon. Gentleman and others have said in this House, it should be emphasised that we shall keep the situation under review. We are setting up an adequate and effective monitoring system to check the effect of the change. This will be over and above the constant flow of information about the heights, weights and physical conditions of the many thousands of children examined each year by the school health service. That mass of information confirms what every hon. Member knows from his own observation&#x2014;that the general state of our children's health is extremely high, and incidentally has improved greatly since the war without any increase in the daily supply of milk which a pupil is entitled to receive at school, so that attempts to argue for a simple cause and effect relationship are quite untenable.<br/>
I repeat that on this occasion we certainly shall maintain a monitoring system to check the effect of the change. All the best available advice which we have had is that no adverse effects should follow to our school children, particularly in view of the safeguard which we have put in about children who are indicated as requiring school milk. But, over and above that, we certainly shall be assessing the effects of the withdrawal.


I am sure that the hon. Gentleman, with his special interest in the matter, will keep in touch with us to hear how the monitoring system is working.<br/>
There is another point which I should make, because the hon. Gentleman raised it in his speech. One consequence of the action taken by the former Government in 1968&#x2014;I am sure that it was unintentional&#x2014;was that education authorities, in being relieved of the duty to provide milk for secondary pupils, were also deprived of the power to provide milk for them at all, free or on any form of payment. We intend to put this right in the legislation which we shall be introducing to give effect to our decision. In future education authorities in Scotland, and in England and Wales, will be empowered to provide milk, on payment, to any of their pupils. It will, of course, be entirely for them to decide if and how to make such provision&#x2014;in tuck shops, through vending machines, or in any other way.<br/>
I am sure that local authorities will be conscious of the point made by the hon. Gentleman about the supply of teachers and the responsibilties which they have. This should give children not entitled to free milk, but whose parents feel that they should drink milk during the day, an opportunity to do so. Therefore, we are providing this new power to local authorities to sell milk, if they wish, so that children will have the opportunity to buy milk at school, if they or their parents so wish.<br/>
I and, indeed, all my colleagues, and the Secretary of State, who will take a keen interest in all that the hon. Gentleman has said, are conscious of his sincere feelings in the matter. However, I should emphasise that we are on this occasion making provision for children

who do need milk. This undertaking will be honoured.</p>

<p>Is it not statistically correct that, by and large, children in Scotland are smaller and less heavy than their counterparts in England and Wales? In these circumstances, does the Minister consider that this factor should be taken into account when it is proposed to discontinue the general supply of milk to Scottish children?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1971-02-17a.2022.1" speakerid="unknown" speakername="Mr. Taylor" colnum="2022" time="">
<p>I have not got actual statistics on this matter. I understand that this was the position and that a previous survey indicated something along those lines. On the other hand, it is fair to point out that the provisions which we have had in the past have applied equally to Scotland, England and Wales. We are conscious of the point raised by the hon. and learned Gentleman. But even if we take this into account&#x2014;of course, things can change rapidly&#x2014;such matters are often out of date before we get the information.<br/>
While some hon. Gentlemen opposite&#x2014;I know the feelings of the hon. Member for Bothwell on this matter&#x2014;feel that this was a wrong decision, I should emphasise that we are providing reasonable safeguards.<br/>
I thank the hon. Gentleman for the way that he made his remarks. Everyone in the House is aware that on the occasions when he speaks on matters of this kind, he speaks with knowledge and sincerity. Certainly on an Adjournment debate at this time in the morning the hon. Gentleman made an agreeable speech.</p>
