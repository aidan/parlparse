<p>My hon. Friend has sent me two letters, one of which was anonymous and made statements in general terms which could not be tested; in the other case inquiry showed that there was no foundation for the complaint. I am writing to my hon. Friend to explain the circumstances more fully.</p>

<p>Is my right hon. Friend aware that one reason I asked this Question was that these letters were published in the Press at the time of the campaign to encourage women to do part-time work?

<p>My attention has been called to this Report, but I am not aware of any excessive depletion in the numbers of skilled workers engaged in milk pasteurisation. I consult my right hon.

<p>With my colleagues who are responsible for the Supply Departments, I have the needs of transferred workers in these respects constantly under review, and where further provision is found to be necessary active steps are taken to see that it is forthcoming so far as is reasonably possible in view of the competing demands for building labour and material for other urgent national purposes.

<p>The answer to the first part of the Question is that postcards received by friends show that a number of persons deported from the Channel Islands are now in a camp known as Stalag VI. The address of the camp in which civilian internees are detained does not indicate any differentiation in treatment. Civilian internees are not detained in camps with military personnel and no question of rank arises in connection with the treatment of civilians. The fact therefore that some civilians who were detained in a camp with the name of Oflag are now detained in a camp with the name of Stalag does not give ground for thinking that there has been a breach of the agreement relating to the treatment of civilian internees.</p>

<p>The special Compulsory Enrolment Order for the City of London, which applies only to men, was made because having regard to the extremely small resident population it was necessary to require persons working in the City to do fire-guard duty in any part of it even though they lived outside.

<p>I am glad to have an opportunity of informing the House of the proposals which I have made for the amalgamation of police forces under the powers conferred upon me by the Defence Regulations. In accordance with the undertaking which I gave during the Debate on 14th October, I have forwarded details of the proposals to the police authorities concerned, and until I have considered their views I am not in a position to take any final decisions. The proposals which I have communicated to them are as follow:&#x2014;<br/>
That in Kent, where, in addition to the county force, there are nine separate borough forces, all these forces should be amalgamated with the county force:<br/>
That in Surrey the borough forces of Guildford and Reigate should be amalgamated with the county force:<br/>
That the Isle of Wight county force and the Winchester borough force should be amalgamated with Hampshire county force:<br/>
That the borough force of Salisbury should be amalgamated with Wiltshire county force and the borough force of Penzance with Cornwall county force:<br/>
That in Sussex all the forces should be amalgamated, so that the two county forces of East and West Sussex and those of the county boroughs of Brighton, Eastbourne and Hastings and the borough of Hove will form one force.<br/>
In the course of the Debate I said that I did not propose to interfere with the larger, substantial police forces, and that if I did I would make a special announcement to the House. Except in Sussex, each of the forces to be amalgamated with the county force has an authorised regular strength of considerably less than 100. In the case of Sussex more substantial forces are involved. The two county forces have each an establishment of over 300, and Brighton of over 200. The military importance of Sussex needs no emphasis, and it is clearly desirable from the point of view of military operations that there should be one police force for the whole area, more particularly in view of the fact that at present responsibility for this important part of the south coast is divided between no less than six forces. Despite the fact that three substantial forces are involved, I am of opinion that,

subject to any representations which the police authorities may put before me, I ought to proceed with the scheme. Before doing so, however, I think it right, in accordance with the spirit of the undertaking which I gave, that the House should be informed of this proposal.</p>

<p>I have been asked to reply. I assume that my hon. Friend is referring to the Defence (Trade Disputes) Order, 1942, which was made under the Defence Regulations last December. So far as collective bargaining is concerned, it is my right hon. Friend's desire that this should be encouraged in all Colonial territories in every possible way. This desire is shared by the Palestine Government, and the order provides that when a trade dispute is reported to the District Commissioner, the District Commissioner shall endeavour to conciliate the parties by all means at his disposal, and shall for this purpose make use of any existing machinery for the settlement of disputes as may seem to him appropriate to this end.
