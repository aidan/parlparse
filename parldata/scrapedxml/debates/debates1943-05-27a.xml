<p>Members of the Women's Land Army stand in relation to the scheme for further education and training in the same position as workers in the war industries.

<p>The treatment and rehabilitation of persons discharged from the Services on grounds of neurosis or temporary instability are undertaken in appropriate cases at special centres under the Emergency Hospital Scheme. The centres under my control are vocational training centres, and in so far as persons leaving neurosis centres are in need of learning a new trade, arrangements are made for their admission on a voluntary basis. I have power to direct persons where necessary to the training centres, but I doubt whether compulsion in these cases would be in the best interest of those concerned.</p>

<p>I presume my hon. Friend is referring to the restrictions on mooring of pleasure vessels in the Broads imposed under a Direction issued by the Regional Commissioner. As I indicated in reply to a Question on 20th May, it is still considered necessary to maintain the requirement of immobilisation of unattended vessels in inland waters in certain counties, of which Norfolk is one. Whether in these circumstances it will be possible to remove the restrictions to which my hon. Friend refers I feel doubtful, but

I will consider the matter in consultation with the Regional Commissioner and the other authorities concerned.</p>

<p>If I were to accept that argument, every motorist would be able to plead that as he was not able to keep his eye on the speedometer he did not know how fast he was going. There is a provision about this in law. The Road Traffic Act, 1930, provides that a person shall not be liable to be convicted for the offence of speeding solely on the evidence of one witness to the effect that in the opinion of the witness the motorist was driving at an excessive speed, and it is for the court to decide on the evidence whether the speedometer is the opinion of the witness.

I should mention, however, that where a policeman within this category has attained the age of 45 before taking up part-time insurable employment and subsequently retires from the Police Force on superannuation, the rate of old age pension payable to him at age 65 by virtue of his insurance will be lower than

the full rate of 10s. a week, the amount of the reduction depending upon his age at the date of his becoming insured. Whole-time members of the Police War Reserve are, with few exceptions, cornpulsorily insurable in respect of their police service and their position in regard to insurance would therefore not be affected by reason of their taking up part-time work in addition to their police duties.

<p>My right hon.

<p>There is no conflict of policy. Price control for wild rabbits was introduced by the Ministry of Food in full agreement with the Agricultural Departments. There is no evidence that the present maximum price is discouraging rabbit destruction where trapping can be effectively used. Complete extermination normally involves gassing during the breeding season under arrangements made by the Agricultural Departments. Decontrol of prices would conflict with the extermination policy and might lead to the retention of a nucleus of breeding stock, apart from the risk of exploiting consumers of rabbit flesh.</p>

<p>The Report has been published in Ceylon, and the Governor is being asked to despatch a small number of copies by the quickest route. As soon as copies are received I will arrange for one to be placed in the Library of the House for Members' convenience. The


Commission found that three European-nominated members of the State Council came within the purview of its terms of reference because they had been remunerated by the Associations which recommended their nomination. This arrangement was publicly known arid had in fact been suggested by a previous Governor in order to make it possible for the best representatives to serve in the Council. The Governor, in requesting these members to send in their resignations as a result of the Constitutional irregularity disclosed, made it clear to them that no opprobrium whatsoever attaches either to them or to the Associations concerned.</p>

<p>(by Private Notice) asked the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs whether he is aware that Polish nationals are being called up for service in the Polish Forces and directed by the Polish Consulate to register by 28th May; and whether he will issue a statement that such Polish nationals are at liberty if they prefer to serve in the British instead of Polish Forces?</p>

<p>I have read the notice in question, which seems to me a perfectly legitimate exercise of the right of the Allied Polish Government to call upon their citizens of military age in this country to perform military service in accordance with the law of Poland. It is recognised even in peace that a friendly State has the right to call up its nationals for military service who are residing in the territory of another friendly State, and this is a right which is obviously very important to our Allies in time of war. My

right hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs dealt with this point during his remarks in the Debate on 9th July in the Committee stage of the Allied Powers (War Service) Bill, when he made it plain that the right of the Allied Governments to call up their men was not accompanied by power to enforce the calling-up notices in this country, and the Allied citizens who did not respond to such notices would in due course be called up for the British Forces under our own National Service Acts, in accordance with the provisions of the Bill. The Bill has since passed into law, and has been applied among others to Polish nationals, who will accordingly become liable to be called up for military service under the United Kingdom National Service Acts from 1st June next if they fail to join their own national Forces.</p>

<p>Is it clear that many people in this country who are only nominally Polish subjects; and much prefer to join the British Forces, now have a right to do that, and, further, was the right hon. Gentleman consulted in the matter before this advertisement appeared, with its threat of dire penalties, on those who failed to register before the 28th? Could the right hon. Gentleman not ask them, in view of recent happenings, while they are enjoying our hospitality to exercise reasonable courtesy in avoiding misunderstandings of this kind?</p>

<p>I do not admit that anything is wrong at all. I take very strong exception to any suggestion that the Polish Government are in a different position from any other Allied Government. It is not so. The position is that each of these foreign Governments under the Bill that we passed have a right to call upon their citizens to join up. If they do not respond, they are called up in our Forces, under our own Act. If there is any doubt, I hope that what I have said will make the position clear.</p>

<p>I do not think so. I have read the call-up notice. It says that the provisions of the Polish law shall be applied to such persons. The Polish

<p>The position, I think, is absolutely clear, If these citizens join the Polish Forces or any other national Force, be it Dutch or Belgian, well and good. If they do not, they will be called up by us. There is no penalty that can be applied to them here.

<p>Yesterday there were a large number of Questions about the distribution of ration cards, about which there is some anxiety in the country. It is an urgent matter, and an hon.

<p>I beg to move, "That the Clause be read a Second time."<br/>
This new Clause is in substitution for the existing Clause dealing with the passing on to the consumer of the benefit from reduction in charges. All hon. Members who spoke on this Clause during the Committee stage expressed the view that the wording was unnecessarily cumbersome and difficult. The hon. Members for Gorbals (Mr. Buchanan), South Ayrshire (Mr. Sloan), Stockport (Sir A. Gridley), The Wrekin (Mr. Colegate) and others all asked us to do what we could to clarify the wording. Everyone agreed with the principle that whatever benefits were secured in the way of cheaper electricity should not be intercepted by undertakers but should be passed on to the consumer. The proposed new Clause clarifies the wording of the Clause which was approved in the Committee stage. There is, however, an addition which I ought to explain. The words:
<q>authorised undertakers who receive a supply of electricity directly or indirectly</q>
have been inserted. As the Clause passed through Committee it was only the benefit on electricity supplied directly to one undertaker which could be passed on to the consumer. We are informed that there may be cases in which one undertaker gets electricity and passes it on to another undertaker, and it is therefore necessary to provide that in such cases the second undertaker shall pass on the


benefits to the consumer. I understand that all the various local authority and other interests concerned, who have seen this Clause, are satisfied with the wording.</p>

This Amendment and the next Amendment on the Paper fall to be considered together. The proviso at the end of Clause 5 has been found on examination to be rather hampering, and we therefore wish to alter the drafting. The point is that if the proviso as it stands were strictly read, the Board would have to produce the scheme before they started work. Everybody's intention was that the scheme should be available before there was electricity for sale, and in order to remove any doubt we seek to make this first Amendment. The Amendment which follows is of a more minor character. The provision in the Bill is in respect of "the area to which the constructional scheme relates," but that is not quite wide enough. What we want is the area in which the electricity is to be disposed of, and therefore we propose to insert instead the words "covering the North of Scotland District."</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 14, line 14, to leave out from the beginning, to "shall," in line 17, and to insert:
<q>Before entering into any negotiations with a view to an agreement for the transfer to the Board of any undertaking which any other undertakers are empowered by or under any Act to acquire, the Board shall notify those undertakers of their intention, to enter into such negotiations and the Electricity Commissioners, before approving any such agreement.</q>
Hon. Members will recollect that when Clause 18 was being considered in the Committee stage some apprehensions were expressed by hon. Members that an injustice was being done to existing undertakers who by their charters given by this House had a right to purchase by agreement other undertakings within their areas. Hon. Members believed that Clause 18, as we had drafted it, only provided for the Electricity Commissioners informing the existing undertakers who had these charters that negotiations had been entered into by the Board with the other properties that were sought to be acquired after discussions had taken place. Some Members felt that this was unfair to the chartered undertakings and that they ought to be informed before the negotiations began, so that they might be


in a position to make representations in the public interest as well as in their own that negotiations would take a certain form or should not be concluded, and what this Amendment seeks to ensure is that before the Board enter into any negotiations they shall notify these undertakers of their intention to do so before the negotiations begin. We think this is fair and reasonable, and there is general concurrence on this matter.</p>

I think it will be for the convenience of the House for me shortly to move the Third Reading and for my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State to make his remarks after other hon. Members who

desire to address the House have spoken. There is one point I should like to deal with, because my hon. Friend the Member for East Fife (Mr. Henderson Stewart) has referred to it. I think I can, within the Rules of Order, say this, in considering what is now in the Bill, that the present form of Clause 6 has been scrutinised very carefully in the light of the observations of my hon. Friend. As so often happens, two proposals are made, but they are not very easy to marry, and it is better to have one proposal standing by itself rather than try to incorporate with it something that does not go very well with it. We came to the conclusion, rightly or wrongly, that to adopt any of the suggestions made would not improve but, on the contrary, would rather impair the provisions as they stand in the Bill; but I can assure my hon. Friend that all he said in his speech has been carefuly examined by myself, and I have, of course, consulted my colleague, and in the light of that examination we are of the opinion that it would be better to have the Bill as it stands.</p>

<p>We have now reached the last stage of this Bill in this House, and I think it will be agreed in all quarters of the House that during its progress it has been considerably improved by the Amendments which have been made, but I feel bound to place on record that in the view of some hon. Members and myself it still remains a bad Bill, and in the few remarks I propose to make I will invite the House to agree with me. I think the fact that it is a bad Bill is to some extent due to the unfortunate history of this House itself. This problem as affecting this particular part of Scotland has frequently been before the House in recent years, and I would like to remind hon. Members of what was said in the Cooper Report in reference to the point I am now on. In paragraph 14 it says:
<q>Since 1922 20 years have passed during which the Highlands have sunk into deepening depression and the greater part of their valuable power resources is still running to waste. The discouragement which has been offered to any further private enterprise or initiative in this field has been very grave, for it is not easy to answer the challenge that the only policy which can be deduced from the action during these 20 years of a succession of Parliaments and of Governments is that they will neither develop the resources themselves nor allow anyone else to do so.</q>
That makes my point, that the record of


this House in dealing with this long-outstanding problem is not one of which we can be very proud. There is one other reference in the Cooper Report to which I would draw attention. Criticism has been directed at times and much prejudice created against the Grampian Company, and the Report says this:
<q>In view of the criticisms which have so frequently been directed against the Grampian Company in the course of their Parliamentary promotions, we feel bound to record our conclusions that they have proved them, selves under conditions of unusual difficulty to be competent planners of electrical development and capable suppliers.</q>
The Report goes on to say:
<q>The net revenue of the company after deducting working costs and depreciation has averaged over the whole period of the Grampian Company's existence a little over three and a half per cent.</q>
I hope the House will not think it inappropriate if I interpose this: For many years we had a colleague in this House who was the former Member for, Hampstead, the late Mr. George Balfour. He was largely responsible for the development of electricity throughout a large part of Scotland. He possessed a sturdy independence and tenacity of view which may not always have appealed to some Members of the House, but I think the Cooper Report, which he never lived to see, is a complete vindication of the Work he carried out in Scotland, and I hope when it comes to our turn to pass on we shall have a record to leave behind us which is no worse than that of our late colleague.<br/>
I have said that this is still a bad Bill, much as it has been improved, and I say that for one or two reasons. In the first place, it still remains a very bureaucratic Measure. Why do I say that? The Electricity. Commissioners are given far wider powers under this Bill than Parliament ever previously granted to them. There are no less than ten circumstances under the Bill in which full authority is left to the Commissioners to make decisions. In Clause 2 (I, <i>b)</i> they are empowered to decide whether the Board or the power company should supply in bulk to an authorised undertaker inside the power company's area. That is a power that was not granted by this House even to the Central Electricity Board when it was set up under the Act, I think, of 1926. The point I want to make is that there is no appeal. Either of the two parties may

think it has a grievance which it would like to refer to an independent arbitrator, but there is no appeal whatsoever. In Clause 2 (I, <i>c)</i> the Commissioners are empowered to decide whether the Board or an authorised undertaker may supply large power-users in the hitherto "chartered areas", to use the Secretary of State's term, of the authorised undertakers, and again there is no appeal. Under Clause 4 (2) they have to approve the development scheme. That is one of the appropriate powers. Under Clause 5 (3) they have to approve a construction scheme, but this time they have to obtain the approval of Parliament by the submission of an Order. So here, for once, we do exercise some measure of control.<br/>
In Clause 6 (3) they are empowered to approve distribution schemes. I agree that it may be argued that there they should have absolute authority to decide what may or may not be done. When we come to Clause re, we find they are empowered to decide what tariffs should be charged. There may be differences between the Board and the Commissioners, but again there is no appeal. Under Clause 12 they are empowered to decide how capital shall be raised and on what terms. Here there is a Safeguard, because they are subject to Treasury approval, and when it is a question of &#x00A3;30,000,000 and the principal and interest are to be guaranteed by the Treasury, obviously it is only right that the Treasury should have something to say about it. In Clause 18 they are empowered to decide whether the Board may acquire undertakings inside the chartered area of any power company, thus conflicting with the latter's rights conferred upon them by Parliament, and once again there is no appeal. In Clause 19 the Commissioners may decide the terms upon which transmission lines belonging to others may be jointly used, and though there may be a genuine difference of opinion between the two bodies, again there is no appeal.<br/>
Finally, under Clause 20, they may decide what economies have been secured by an undertaking taking supplies in bulk from the Board and how that economy should be passed on to the consumers. Although we have passed a greatly improved Clause 20, and therefore I am much more satisfied with it than I was, again I would point out there is no appeal. In six out of the ten instances I have given in which they have complete


or almost complete powers under this Bill there is no appeal, although in my view there ought, in common justice, to be a right of appeal from their decisions when serious differences arise.<br/>
The next reason why I ask the House to agree that this is a bad Bill is that I doubt very much whether any hon. Member has ever seen a more appalling case of legislation by reference. In the Fifth Schedule no fewer than eight Acts of Parliament are referred to. Some Clauses in those. Acts are to be omitted and others are to be applied, and anyone who tries to ascertain what may or may not be done under this Bill will have to refer to a mass of Acts to make quite sure that the power or the prohibition is there. This type of legislation is novel and bad because it completely ignores all past legislation governing all existing electricity undertakings, and it shows how easy it is to have to bring in appallingly bad legislation when you depart from the Measures which Parliament, in its wisdom, has put on the Statute Book for the guidance of a great industry like this.<br/>
There is one almost amusing point to which I would direct the attention of the House. This Bill is backed, as hon. Members will observe, by Mr. Secretary Johnston, supported by Sir John Anderson, Secretary Sir Archibald Sinclair, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr. Ernest Brown, Sir William Jowitt, and&#x2014;who comes next?&#x2014;Major Lloyd George, Minister of Fuel and Power.</p>

<p>The Electricity Commissioners were appointed under Section 35, I think it is, of the Act of 1919, to be under the direction of, and to be responsible to, the Minister of Transport, who now, of course, is replaced by the Minister of Fuel and Power. They are responsible to the Minister of Fuel and Power. Where has he been throughout all these proceedings? Not conspicuous by his presence, but by his absence. I see he is here to-day. The only power I can discover in this Bill which is retained for my right hon. and gallant Friend is a joint power with the Secretary of State for Scotland to appoint the members of this Board. But the Electricity Commissioners will now have two masters. They are responsible

under this Bill to the Secretary of State for Scotland, and except in this particular area they will be responsible to the Minister of Fuel and Power throughout the rest of the United Kingdom. "No man can serve two masters." He will despise the one and love the other. I am not quite sure on which Minister the love of the Commissioners will eventually be bestowed. I am still unhappy, very unhappy, about Clause 2 (3), on page 2 of the Bill. I would ask my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State whether he would look at it. We had some discussion on the Committee stage on this Sub-section. The Secretary of State said that this Subsection was not intended to confer upon the Board any powers other than those dealing with electricity. The view of my hon. Friends and myself was that the Sub-section goes far wider than that, and can be so interpreted. I am referring to Clause 2, Sub-section (3), on page 2.</p>

<p>Yes, line 28. What did the Secretary of State say during the Committee stage on this point? He said this: I am quoting from Column 233 of Hansard of 5th May:
<q>I do not want to mislead, either intentionally or otherwise.</q>
I am sure the Secretary of State has never made any attempt to do that throughout the whole of the discussions on this Bill. He has been transparently honest with everybody. He went on to say:
<q>I merely want to say that half the purpose of this Bill is to restore the population to the Highlands, to provide social amenities for the area; and we desire to have some Clause in the Bill providing that this. Board shall be something more than merely, as someone said to-day, a cold-hearted hydro-electric organisation. It is a development Board as well.</q>"&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 5th May, 1943;
col. 233, Vol. 389.]
That confirms the fears we have about this Sub-section. If I might give a very brief illustration of the fear I have, it is that the Board, under this Clause, might acquire great areas of land in anticipation of future development, pay for it, and get no revenue from it for a number of years. Land is often bought and held, as we all know, and legislation is being considered by this House at the moment for the better control and prevention of that sort


of thing. But here they might acquire a considerable amount of land, and if they have to hold it without any material revenue for a number of years&#x2014;</p>

<p>I am sure the hon. Member does not want intentionally or otherwise to mislead the House. May I draw his attention to the fact that the Board cannot acquire land unless under a constructional scheme, and that a constructional scheme must be approved by the Secretary of State and the House before such proceedings as he envisages can take place.</p>

<p>I always like, if possible, to accept the assurance of a Minister, but we all know that assurances given in Debate cannot be taken into account when lawyers have to consider the effect of an Act of Parliament. Speeches in the House then count for nothing. I have asked the Secretary of State more than once to put in just one word in this Subsection which will remove all doubts, so that the Sub-section would read:
<q>The Board shall, so far as their powers and duties hereunder permit, &#x2026;</q>
The interposition of that one word "hereunder" would satisfy us, and I would ask the Secretary of State whether he would again consider this matter between now and the consideration of the Measure in another place.<br/>
There is not much more I want to say, but I want to refer to the Treasury guarantee of &#x00A3;30,000,000 without which the promotion of this scheme would, of course, be utterly impossible, because money could not be raised for it without a guarantee of this kind. The future prospects of the scheme to meet outgoings are at least problematical for some years to come, yet I think that any scheme which is likely to benefit this part of Scotland is one which every Member of this House would like to further. But I want to issue this final word of warning. If there should be any so optimistic as to imagine that this scheme is likely to be in operation three or four years from now, I think they can disabuse their Minds of it; it is most unlikely that this scheme will come into being as an operative measure for five or six years. It will be constructed at a time when civil engineering costs must inevitably be considerably higher than if this scheme had been allowed to proceed in the pre-war years

when it was invariably turned down by this House. Therefore the time when income and outgoings will balance may be nine or ten years hence. That does not necessarily mean that the scheme ought not to be proceeded with. I do not say that for a moment. There is not a single power company undertaking in the country that in the earlier pioneering years, which may have been from 6 to 10 years, earned a dividend for its shareholders. It was only after the last war that they got on to their feet and went forward. Let no one think that this is going to be a scheme which will balance itself very speedily. In fact the time may come when some of the original construction cost, because it is more than it would be in normal times, may have to be written down. In that case the Treapry must be prepared to see, with the consent of the House, that extra cost written off. All the same, and though it is a bad Bill, I and those with me give it our blessing and hope it will confer great benefit on this area of Scotland at no distant date.</p>

<p>When this Bill was last before the House I endeavoured to voice the very grave disquiet that was felt by some Members and in some parts of the country, not only in Scotland but throughout Britain, at the doubtful finance contained in it, both as openly revealed in its provisions and as underlying them, and particularly the manner in which it had been made palatable by the incorporation into the promises made, in the speeches introducing the Bill, of what I might call by the very blessed and Mesopotamian word "regeneration." Unfortunately I was ruled out of Order when I tried to make those remarks on the Committee stage, and rightly, but now, on the Third Reading, I cannot let this opportunity pass without making at least one protest against what I consider to be a menace not only to Celtic Scotland but to the general social well-being of the whole of Britain.<br/>
Before I proceed very briefly to discuss these points may I explain why a mere Welshman should be so concerned for the fate of Celtic Scotland? It is partly on the analogy of the poor stranger of the Gospel who alone returned to give thanks for the benefits which the natives did not appreciate, and partly because professionally I am concerned with the fate of all Celtic


countries, and not Wales alone, and because I am only too well aware of how the old way of life which depends on the survival of the Welsh and the Celtic languages, is regarded by some members of the present generation with contempt and even with hatred.<br/>
In the first place, there is the more general matter of the provisions of the Bill, in Clause 2, for the distribution of electricity to Scotland. As I understand it &#x2014;and I suggest that one cannot understand the Bill without reference to and thorough familiarity with the Cooper Report, that superlative example of a company promoter's prospectus&#x2014;as I understand it, the heavy industries which are described in the Bill as "large power users" will be enticed 443 the Highlands by the provision of electricity at a specially favourable rate.</p>

<p>I should say that the metallurgical industries are fairly heavy. Let me quote the words of the Bill,
<q>appreciably more economically than the authorised undertakers.</q>
Because the Board is to be sustained by the guarantee of &#x00A3;30,000,000 of public money it will be able&#x2014;indirectly of course &#x2014;to place certain industries in such a privileged position that they can command profits impossible elsewhere in Britain, and, while, of course, there is a limit prescribed by the Bill to the profit to be made by the Hydro-Electric Board itself, there is no limit or control of the profits made by those industries which will come in its wake.</p>

<p>No, I am speaking of industrial undertakings, not electricity

undertakings. There is no provision in the Bill for dealing with the profits of concerns which come to Scotland because they are attracted by cheaper electricity. At the same time, the one undertaking which is designed to serge the public interest in the matter of electric power, the Grid, is compelled by Clause 16 to buy all the electricity that the Hydro-Electric Board prescribes at a very enhanced rate, the top price of steam-generated' power in Scotland. So industries, in Scotland and elsewhere, drawing their power from the Grid will necessarily be unable to compete with the new favoured industries in this area. In other words, by the authority of Parliament, as expressed in this Bill, these new industries will be able to close the deadly hand of monopoly around the throat of all other enterprises. We have often listened to Members on the other side of the House decrying the killing of private enterprise by State interference. This is not the place to comment on that, but what will the guardians of private enterprise think of a condition in which one private enterprise, uncontrolled and un-scrutinised by the State, is enabled by the help of State interference to strangle all other private enterprise. To describe that, I would borrow Shakespeare's phrase&#x2014;"A chartered libertine "&#x2014;if it were not too mild. It seems to me that the only phrase that is adequate to describe such a proceeding is the name given to that discredited form of piracy in the old days&#x2014;" Letters of Marque."<br/>
I come to the benefits that are to accrue to the farmers, the crofters, and the fishermen by the provision of cheap electricity. If there is one matter on which all Members of this House are agreed, it is the necessity of providing cheap electricity for the countryside all over Britain; and if this Bill were designed, as the right hon. Gentleman, the Secretary of State, honestly believes, to make life in the Highlands more comfortable and more abundant for the crofter and the fisherman, there is no man in this House who would not welcome it with acclamation. The Bill, as now amended, contains the words:
<q>Including isolated areas.</q>
But what can possibly be the value of that guarantee when we know that the Cooper Report drawn, up by the experts has stated unequivocally its opinion, in these words:


<q>It is, in our view, plain that the general provision of electricity to crofts and fishing hamlets throughout the Highlands for domestic and small-power users is quite impracticable.</q>
And again:
<q>It has become apparent to us that in certain quarters expectations are entertained as to the possibilities of electrical developments in the remoter areas of rural Scotland.</q>
What is the comment on that?
<q>&#x2014; which under no conceivable circumstances can be realised.</q>
No words of mine can be nearly as strong as what is said in that Report. I think these words give the lie direct to the words
<q>including isolated areas</q>
now added to the Bill. They dispose, of the contention that life in the Highlands, the traditional manner of living in Celtic Scotland, is going to be benefited by this Bill. What possible value except "made-to-sell" value can be in the futile and disingenuous addition of such words? This Bill, in my view, will not only fail to achieve the objective of regeneration, but it will actually help to destroy what life there is in the Highlands at present, as I hope to show very briefly.<br/>
Now we come to the Hydro-Electric Board as a public utility undertaking. I make no apology for claiming that such a concern, especially when backed by vast sums of public money, should fulfil the meaning of both words, "public" and "utility." In other words, it should serve the greatest possible number with the least possible concomitance of private gain. This great undertaking, backed by the nation to the extent of a guarantee of &#x00A3;30,000,000 should be a national concern, and should benefit the Highlands directly and openly, by the provision of cheap national electricity, and not, I maintain, indirectly and covertly by secondary activities which have as their only concern purely private profit, or, to borrow the language of hon. Members on the Labour benches, a vast extension of the capitalistic system and the creation of a vast new ganglion of vested interests. We hear a good deal these days of the black-coated interests of this country; perhaps this is a case which might well be described as the black-vested interests. While the farms, homes and workshops should be able to benefit by the close proximity of electric power, the residue of that power should go to the first and natural claimant, the National Electricity Board, the Grid, so that when similar

schemes are brought before Parliament in future they may be adopted by the unanimous welcome of Cornwall as well as Caithness, of Kent as well as Anglesey, of Glasgow as well as London. The product of a public utility company, financed by the Treasury, must go to the benefit of the whole nation.<br/>
I need mention only one other similar monopoly, the wireless service, which is common to the whole nation at a uniform rate. The B.B.C., without reluctance and without question, has expended vast sums in bringing its benefits to the more remote areas of Scotland and Wales, where the listeners are very few and the licences make a very small contribution to the B.B.C's revenue. Or, to turn to a case to which a national utility is comparable, no sane person would dream of encouraging new industries to go to other areas by giving those new companies a cheaper telephone rate or a reduction in the cost of stamps because they happened to pitch their factories near where they made telephones or where they manufactured stamps. Such a scheme should be asked to do two things: first, to make a generous provision for the development and betterment of its own countryside&#x2014;in this case of rural Scotland&#x2014;and, secondly, to hand over all the rest for the benefit of the country in general. In both ways the Bill fails. The benefit to Scotland is small and problematic, in the light of what the Cooper Report says; and, by its hardly-concealed concession to big business, it is creating a vicious extension of monopoly capitalism. Yet speaker after speaker from the Labour benches has welcomed it as something which offers such outstanding benefits to the Highlands that their principles may for the time being be regarded as conveniently shelvable&#x2014;a state which I believe the theologians call "interim morals." A wife beater once&#x2014;</p>

<p>I thank you for that guidance, Sir. So far I have not referred to what I think ought to be in the Bill. I have tried to address myself to what is actually in the Bill. I was quoting an example. One Labour Member expressed the attitude of the party very clearly when he said that we must accept the industrial development of the Highlands in order to preserve the Highlands. What does "preserving the Highlands" mean? There was a time when "preserving the Highlands" meant denuding them of men and women in order to place deer there instead. The words still, to my ears, bear a very sinister sound. Did that hon. Member suggest seriously that such industrialisation of the Highlands as will follow on this Bill is going to preserve the Highland community, or put back among those desolate mountains the men and women who alone are entitled to the term "Highlanders"? If he did, then I think he believes in modern miracles.<br/>
I feel considerable diffidence in objecting to a Scottish Bill which has been welcomed so heartily by all my hon. Friends, but I am heartened to know, however, that one Member&#x2014;the hon. Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Sloan)&#x2014;did share my apprehensions on this Bill and said so on Second Reading, and I am in complete agreement with what he said. The idea that by introducing large industries or manufactures or what not you can repeople the Highlands with their own natives, or even with Scotsmen, seems to me to be a foolish and dangerous delusion, as we in Wales only too well know, who saw the "repopulation" of the Welsh valleys not by our own sons and daughters, not even by Welshmen, but by masses of hungry hordes from the most backward districts of England. A dead

lier method of destroying what remains of Highland life I cannot conceive. It is a method which will end for ever the life and civilisation of the Highlands and substitute for them, not even the life and civilisation of the Connemara cabin; it will be the life and civilisation of the Dublin slum. That has already happened in the rural parts of Scotland and in the Lowlands&#x2014;</p>

<p>I bow to your Ruling, Sir. I gave exactly one illustration, and I intended to give one more, but in accordance with your Ruling, I shall not do so. It is agreed that the main concern of the Secretary of State is a very worthy one; it is based on a desire to regenerate the Highlands, and it is equally clear that he hopes to do so by industrialising them. He intends to do it, I take it, by the financial provisions of this Bill which lend themselves to giving big business what is virtually a bribe to carry on in the Highlands as they have carried on elsewhere. But this might have been done a long time ago when there was a fair population in the Highlands. It is now too late.<br/>
Before I sit down I would like the right hon. Gentleman to consider what will be the results of industrialising the Highlands. He will not bring back there those people who speak the Gaelic tongue and whose history, language and literature created a new romance for the whole of Europe during the nineteenth century. Almost the last pibroch has been played through the glens, and almost the last coronach has lamented the sons who will no more return from their world-wide diaspora in lands beyond the sea. We can no longer rebuild the clachans of the Highlands; let us take heed lest we plant there instead the cities of the plain.</p>

<p>I would like to congratulate the Secretary of State for Scotland upon having brought In this Bill to the House and taken it to the stage which it now has reached in this Chamber. I was amazed when I heard an hon. Gentleman opposite say that it was a bad Bill. If anything in the history of Parliament in recent years ever justified a Bill of this kind it was what happened during many years when Electricity Bills


were brought forward for the development of water-power in the Highlands. Almost invariably, they were rejected by the House probably for a variety of reasons. As far as I am personally concerned, they were rejected because private people coming forward with Bills, so arranged their designs that they interfered with other people lower down the valleys and had no regard whatever to the interests of those other people. When these Bills went to the Examiners of the House they met the Standing Orders and the procedure of the normal Private Bills, and were rejected for reasons such as these, and possibly for a variety' of other reasons. I do not profess to say what moves the average Member to support or reject a Bill; I know what moved me to vote against particular Bills when they came forward, and it is the reason I have just stated.<br/>
This Bill obviates all that sort of thing. It appoints a Board which is to have the duty imposed upon it of developing the Highlands; and money is to be provided whereby it may carry out that development. If it produces a scheme to which local people object, those people have ample opportunity to make objections to the Board in the first instance, and to the Secretary of State for Scotland subsequently, if they so desire, and have the schemes amended. But it is not at all likely that a Board which is specifically set up for the purpose of benefiting the Highlands is likely to do anything that will militate against the interests of any great body of people in the Highlands. It is obvious to me that in a matter of this sort a Board of this kind was required, and I am glad to see that it has reached this stage. The Board will be set up and money will be provided for it to help in the development of the Highlands in the manner to which the hon. Member for the University of Wales (Professor Gruffydd) was objecting a moment or two ago. He objected to the selling of power to the Central Electricity Board at a rate that was equal to that of a steam-run plant. Any manufacturer who comes to the Highlands of Scotland might, possibly, get some cheaper power than he could get in the South of Scotland or elsewhere, because he has to pay in the latter case for steam-generated power, which presumably is dearer than water-developed power. The hon. Member forgets that there is an additional cost to anyone who goes to the Highlands. There is the transport of material

to the Highlands and of manufactured products back again. I should be very glad indeed if the Secretary of State for Scotland and this Board would be able, even under the conditions of this Bill, to persuade manufacturers to go to the Highlands.<br/>
It is true that large concerns like the carbide producing companies may possibly take advantage of this Bill. But smaller normal power users will make use of it only if they can get some advantage to compensate them for the additional transport to the Highlands and back again to the centres of population where their goods wig be distributed. Is it not most desirable that industries should be, spread as widely as possible throughout the country? It is obvious therefore to me that the Clause which gives the Board the power to supply electricity at the rate at which the steam-generating station can produce it is a right and justifiable suggestion. Any excess profit in the production of their own power from water has to be used in the area itself. The words of the Clause are:
<q>It would be the duty of the Board to provide supplies of electricity required to meet the demands of ordinary consumers including isolated areas.</q>
I hope that that will be done to the greatest possible extent. I notice that the words "as far as practicable" have been added to the Clause. I regret to see those words there because the Board having an option of developing various areas may neglect others. They may say that to develop the other areas the cost will be so great that it is not practicable, whereas I would like to see, if it were possible, the whole area developed and the cost equally divided over the area concerned. That may not be practicable and it may be for that reason that the words "as far as practicable" are included in the Bill, but I earnestly hope that the instructions that the Secretary of State for Scotland will give to the Board will be to develop the smaller areas to the utmost possible extent. I hope they will spread electricity wherever possible and in that way they will undoubtedly benefit the Highlands and restore to them once again the population which they had many years ago.</p>

<p>Unlike the hon. Member for the University of Wales (Professor Gruffydd) I pin my faith to this Bill which, I believe, will do a great deal


for the Highlands and Islands. We can congratulate those responsible, on the skilful piloting of this Measure through a multiplicity of Amendments. It is good to know that it is a State Measure based on service for the good of the community, and not for profits to shareholders. Hence its general acceptance by the Highland counties. The Highlands certainly offer facilities for electricity second to none in Britain, and what has been done in this respect in Switzerland and Scandinavia is now possible in Scotland. By means of this Bill I hope to see development of industrial activity which has hitherto been denied to the Highlands and Islands. Those concerned about amenities and beauty spots will, I hope, now be satisfied with the safeguards provided. But, after all, we want to see the Highlands and Islands something more than a mere holiday resort or a sporting ground for deerstalkers for a few weeks. The tragedy of the Highlands and Islands has been depopulation, and to-day thousands of the descendants of Scottish exiles have returned from Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Africa to fight for their mother country.<br/>
This Bill promises to be the key to economic and agricultural revival. The Highlands and Islands are a storehouse of non-metallic minerals which could and should be developed. Some concern has been shown about recent land speculation in the Highlands and this is of great importance to this Hydro-Electricity Measure. A glaring case is that of the purchase of 50,000 acres in Invernessshire by Panton Investments Ltd., a company that was formed in 1934 as the Prince of Wales Theatre Products Ltd. These 50,000 acres cover farms, croftings, townships, hill pastures, water-power resources, and light industry sites. What possible interest could such a company have in the Highlands? It certainly could not be to erect theatres. My contention is that a very watchful eye will have to be kept on land speculation of this kind. Electricity development in the Highland must not be plagued by land speculators. In planning for the future this Bill offers something worth having and I wish my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland the best of luck in this great new venture.</p>

<p>As one who has followed closely the progress

of this Bill from its inception to the present stage and who had not an opportunity of commenting upon it during the Second Reading Debate, I welcome this chance of making some observations which have been in my mind from the first moment that I saw the. Measure. First, I take this opportunity of paying a very sincere tribute to the exceptionally friendly, courteous and accommodating way in which those particularly interested in the details of this Bill have been treated by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Lord Advocate. An outstanding feature of the progress of this Measure has been theft extreme courtesy and consideration towards the many points of view which had to be brought to bear upon it. But for that I suggest that the Bill might have had a much rougher passage. We all know that there were many Amendments down to it which, had they been pressed, might have made the Bill so controversial as to cause its withdrawal by the Government. But all this has been avoided and I think the fact that it has been avoided is almost entirely due to the courtesy, consideration and accommodating spirit which has been shown in the conduct of the Bill.<br/>
This Bill is a great experiment and one which I have no intention whatsoever of frustrating. I am glad that the House by an overwhelming majority has obviously accepted the Bill in that spirit but I think it is right at this time that a <i>caveat</i> should be entered, lest certain people in Scotland, notably in the,Highlands, are carried away with enthusiasm for, and great expectations from, the Bill. I would like to quote a remark which my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister made in one of his Budget Speeches when he was Chancellor of the Exchequer:
<q>Blessed is he that expecteth little. Verily, he shall not be disappointed.</q>
I feel that an impression has been created in certain minds in Scotland that this Bill will do great things for the Highlands and I think it would be a pity &#x2014;and I think the Secretary of State himself, enthusiastic as he is for the Bill, would agree&#x2014;if expectations were raised too high. After all, we have to remember that this Board is not really a Development Board in the true sense of the term. Its functions and collaboration, particularly under Clause 23, are really restricted to the provision of electricity.


I sincerely hope, and I think there is every reason to believe, that some new and doubtless very important industries will come to the Highlands of Scotland as a result of this great new development of electrical power, but on the other hand it is important to remember that these industries are likely to be more in the nature of electrical-chemical and electro-metallurgical industries which T understand, although I am no expert, do not employ great numbers of people and are not likely to have a very material effect on employment in the Highlands, although they will use a considerable quantity of electricity and thereby be a substantial profit-making asset to the new Board. That is well and good and the new Board, no doubt, will welcome them with open arms to the Highlands although Highlanders may have mixed feelings when these industries start operations. If they think they will get a large measure of employment as the result, I think, they may be substantially disappointed.<br/>
While it is hoped that these industries will be attracted, they will not be attracted solely because of cheap electricity or the provision of abundant hydro-electric power. Other considerations will have to be taken into account, such as transport, the supply of raw materials, local rating, and convenient markets for the goods. Do not let us run away with the idea that the mere provision of this electricity will, automatically, cause a rush of industries to the Highlands of Scotland. While I believe specialised types of industries will be attracted, I think it is important to remember that what we need most of all in Scotland, especially in the Highland areas, is the provision of more light industries. The provision of these industries, in which the Secretary of State is so deeply interested, and which he has done so much to assist already, will depend to some extent on the provision of cheap power. But even then it is not a fundamental factor because I understand that in the total cost of production in light industries electricity, the cost of power as a whole, does not exceed about 3 per cent. So, I emphasise, as the first part of my remarks, that we should not be led' away into great expectations with regard to the advantages we shall get from the Bill from the point of view of employment in the Highlands of Scotland. I do not think we ought to have great expectations with regard to other

advantages which the Highlands might get from the provisions of this Bill. In spite of the permissive Clauses in the Bill I do not think that the average glen, Highland village or croft will get very much benefit from the point of view of getting their own electricity unless it pays the Board to supply it. I imagine that it would not pay in many instances and if it does not, I have grave doubts as to whether the Board will supply it.<br/>
I have a feeling that the principal people behind this Bill are the Secretary of State&#x2014;whose enthusiasm for bringing industries to Scotland leaves us in debt to him for what he has already done, and who is providing the stimulus towards this great objective&#x2014;and the major metallurgical and chemical industries who feel that this will be a great opportunity for them to develop their business and trade, although not necessarily to the great advantage of Scotland. I have a feeling, too, that another of the major parties in this triumvirate are the Electricity Commissioners who are deeply concerned and who should be extremely gratified at the great powers which the House of Commons has given to them in this Bill. I hope and believe that they will use those powers with the greatest possible impartiality, having regard to the essential necessity for safeguarding the interests of all undertakers and because the Board has to see that it does not exercise its powers to the detriment of existing undertakers. It would be most unfortunate if, in this great experiment in which the existing undertakers are willing to co-operate, they should feel that they were, in any way, being crippled, handicapped or overridden by the great powers given to the Board and the still greater powers given to the Electricity Commissioners. I say this deliberately because it is obvious that in this Bill we are setting up a precedent in giving such powers to the Commissioners. I have confidence that those powers will in no way be abused, and that therefore the precedent may stand for the satisfaction of all concerned, but it will be watched very closely by those who are very much concerned with that important point.<br/>
I wish now to pass to the finance of the scheme. I have a feeling that there is some danger in assuming that the new board must be self-supporting, and yet the Secretary of State and the Lord Advocate have repeatedly said that it was a


fundamental of the Bill that it must be a commercial proposition and must pay its way. That is, of course, sound enough from some points of view, but what the Highlands want, and what industries want if they are to go there, is cheaper electricity, and I am not yet entirely convinced that the Board will be able to provide this cheap electricity, as everyone desires it to do. After all, its profits are really dependent on the results of the supplies to the Central Electricity Board. That is where the main revenue will come from. The earnings and profits from this source are dependent on two speculative factors, the capital cost of construction of hydro electrical schemes and the cost of coal in steam stations. The lower the costs of construction and the higher the cost of coal the more possibility there is of making profit. The whole question of the solvency of the Board and of the cheapness of the supply of electricity depend upon two highly important but essentially speculative factors, so there is no absolute guarantee that the Board will be able to produce the electricity at an economic price which will keep it solvent and, at the same time, enable it to supply electricity at a really cheap cost, which is essential if the Bill is to effect its object.<br/>
A further point which it is essential should at least be mentioned, which I know he has not forgotten, and which he will implement, is the question of valuation and rating. He has told us he is going to set up a committee by which the whole question will be examined. I hope it will not be long before that committee is in being. These factors are of very vital moment from the point of view of the cost of electricity. If we can get the rating&#x2014;</p>

<p>I think I have said enough on the point. With regard to the composition of the Board, I know the right hon. Gentleman will not misunderstand me or take any offence. He is not that kind of Minister, but some of us have been concerned about the final composition of the Board. I think it is absolutely essential&#x2014;I feel sure the right hon. Gentleman will agree&#x2014;that the members of the Board should be chosen solely for their commercial, industrial, business and

technical knowledge. Any possibility of any accusation that their selection was due to any sort of political prejudice, would be most deplorable. I am convinced that any suspicions that some people may have had in that direction will be proved unworthy by the final action of the Secretary of State. The setting up of this public Board is a great experiment, and I hope that is fully realised. I accept the fact that private enterprise was, probably, not the right agent to conduct this great experiment in the remote areas of the Highlands, but not for a moment would I accept the suggestion that private enterprise has not proved itself capable in every part of the country, and not least in Scotland, to conduct great electricity operations, to the great benefit of the people concerned and with the utmost efficiency.</p>

<p>The hon. and gallant Gentleman will not expect me to follow him the whole road. In fact, we are sufficiently friendly for me to say I assume he will be quite glad that I am not going to join with him where he left off, If the economics of the situation were as he asks us to believe they are, there would have been no need for the Secretary of State to undertake this most arduous job of pushing the Bill through the House. I want to congratulate the Minister and thank him for amending the Bill in the fashion that I and several of my hon. Friends suggested he should on the Second Reading. I mean the Amendments to Clause 5 and the consequential ones giving a definite instead of an indefinite period in which objections can be tabled and sustained. I am sure I cannot be misunderstood if I point out that my-argument really was that an indefinite period would have provided a weapon for obstructionists. My right hon. Friend has gone so far as to lay down a definite period of 40 days. I wonder whether he will consider whether that is a sufficiently long period. I see him smile, but if he reads what I said, I in no way suggested that 40 days was too generous a period. Before he amended the Bill the, phrase was, "not less than 40 days," which might have meant 340 days. I know he understands thoroughly the difficulties of local authorities, particularly in such large areas as Inverness-shire, and in counties so badly served with transport as Sutherland. I suggest that he should make it


60 or even 90 days. I hope I shall not be misunderstood in making that point.<br/>
I am a trifle disturbed by the pessimism that we have heard expressed from the hon. Member for Stockport (Sir A. Gridley), the qualified pessimism of the hon. and gallant Gentleman opposite, and the greater pessimism of the hon. Member for the University of Wales (Professor Gruffydd). His has been the only blunt attack on the Bill as amended. I feel inclined to say, although he is not present, that he is no master of the new Bill nor of the Cooper Report, or he would not have made such misstatements as he made and such doubtful inferences. However, I will not pursue that, as he is not present. None of us on this side is in danger of making the mistake against which both the hon. Gentleman the Member for Stockport and the hon. and gallant Gentleman the Member for East Renfrew (Major Lloyd) warned us of thinking that this marks the millennium for the Highlands. We know that there is nothing revolutionary in the Bill. We know that it is a masterpiece of accommodation, and most of us have appreciated the efforts the Secretary of State for Scotland had to exert to secure such accommodation. As Scots we respect hard work, and ask Scots to admire the amazing and persistent work my right hon. Friend has put in to get so far with the Bill.<br/>
We expect nothing more for the Scottish Highlands than that this great and valuable experiment may become the basis of a new economic life for the North. We are in agreement with the hon. and gallant Gentleman that there is a great deal to be added before there can be any kind of secured and continuous activity for the Northern part of our land. We know also that we have still to tackle the problem of the other light industries and the whole question of transport. I think this is the first defined post-war Measure. We are extremely indebted to the Lord Advocate for the warnings he gave us on the Second Reading that the pace of development and of the operation of the Bill itself will depend upon the composition of this House and upon the pressure Scottish Members particularly are prepared to exert. If our constituents are not aware of that, they will get less than they might get. The question which the hon. and gallant Gentleman posed can only be answered by

the same kind of logic. We are prepared to follow the Bill with these ancillary measures which it would be out of Order to discuss on the Third Reading. The hon. Member for Stockport said he had very great fears about Clause 2 (3). His fears are our hopes, and we are confident that we can from this side of the House make those hopes real in the operation of the Bill. I most warmly congratulate my right hon. Friend.</p>

<p>May I refer at the beginning of my remarks to the speech made on Third Reading by the Lord Advocate, in which he referred to the discussion in Committee on Clause 6? In the course of that discussion I pointed out that the machinery laid down with regard to distribution schemes was unduly and exceptionally cumbersome. I showed that in the case of other electricity undertakings in England the company concerned had only to submit its distribution scheme to the Electricity Commissioners, sending a copy to the local authorities in the area, and that was its duty done. Under the Bill there is a very heavy weather procedure laid upon the new Board. They have to offer opportunities, indeed almost to goad individual members of the public to object to the scheme. Throughout the Debates I have been urging the Government to give the Board greater freedom. In this case it is loaded up with regulations which seem quite unnecessary and which I clearly showed are unprecedented. If in years past this House has passed Measure after Measure dealing with the supply of electricity in different parts of the country and has on this very point of distribution provided a very simple procedure, I cannot see why, in the case of Scotland, we should pass away from that simplicity and overload the procedure with bureaucratic methods. I am sorry that the Lord Advocate has offered so few reasons for rejecting the proposal I made. Large parts of England have enjoyed freedom from these restrictions and I cannot understand why the people of the Highlands should not enjoy the same-freedom.<br/>
Passing to the more general situation, I of course join with all my hon. Friends in congratulating the Secretary of State upon the energy and enterprise he has shown in translating this great idea, which in other forms some of us have supported consistently in this House for many years,


into concrete form. There is difference of opinion as to the wisdom and practicability of the particular form of the machinery set out in this Bill, but on the broad principle underlying the Bill&#x2014;of a planned, wholesale development in the public interest of the hydro-electric resources of the Highlands&#x2014;we are all agreed. All Scotland supports it and desires to see it carried through as quickly as possible and to the largest possible extent. The thought uppermost in my mind to-day is therefore to wish this project good luck. But I am bound to say, like my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for East Renfrew (Major Lloyd), that I have my doubts about the effectiveness of the machinery provided; and it is proper that those doubts, which are shared by many highly skilled and competent men in the electricity industry, should be expressed lest the people of the Highlands should imagine that once this Measure, with its &#x00A3;3,000,000 subsidy, passes, prosperity and an easy life lie before them.</p>

<p>It is a pure, unadulterated subsidy. It is a provision intended to support the Board when it cannot pay its way, and if it is not a subsidy, I do not know what it is. Any impression of the kind I have mentioned which is given to the Highlands would be both unreal and dangerous. The only way the Highlands can win prosperity after the war is by hard work on the part of t4e individual dwellers in that area, supported by a sound, enlightened policy carried through with vision here in London. That combination of individual enterprise within the framework of a sound Government scheme is the only hope for Scotland. The provision of electricity, even to every strath and glen in the Highlands, would not touch the fringe of the problem, the age-long problem of bringing life and vitality to these long deserted lands. As hon. Members in many parts of the House have said, much more than this Bill is needed. There must be efforts in 100 other directions with great energy behind them before we can preen ourselves that we have started this mighty job of improving the Highlands.<br/>
The question we have to consider to-day is whether this Bill is likely to serve the important but limited purpose for which

it is designed. I will not repeat the criticisms that I have made on the Bill in earlier stages, except to say that the more I reflect upon it and discuss its provisions with those who may have some part in working it the more certain I am that the views I have expressed are sound and that they will be found to be sound in the days to come. I have done my best in the ways open to me to improve the Measure, but the Government have not thought fit to accept my suggested amendments. The responsibility now rests on the Government; it does not rest on me. All we can do now is to consider how this new Board will work when it starts operations in the terms laid down in this Measure.<br/>
As I see it the success of this enterprise will depend upon two major factors, one of them incalculable, the other resting within the responsibility of my right hon. Friend. These two factors are the price of coal and the personnel of the Board. What about coal? It is clear from the most cursory examination of the Bill, confirmed by further study, that the main customer of the Board, certainly at the beginning and perhaps all through its life, will be the Central Electricity Board. It will be the bulk buyer, and the new Board will depend not only upon the Central Board for the bulk purchase but for the bulk of its income and the only part of its income which will show a profit. It is essential that the Highlands should grasp that matter. I gather that it is hoped that the Central Electricity Board will pay a price so calculated as to leave a slight margin over the cost of production of the supplies it takes from the Highland Board. Such a margin will be vital to the new Board. Without it it will find it impossible to carry on and will go bankrupt. For, let the House note, there is no other possibility of a margin from the sales of electricity in any other direction.<br/>
Take the other possible directions in which the sales of this Board may take place. There is the large electro-chemical industries of which we have heard much. As an hon. Member said, such industries will not look at the proposition of coming to the Highlands unless the electric power they required is offered at the very minimum price. My hon. Friend the Member for Inverness (Sir M. MacDonald) knows that better than I do. He made plain the disadvantages of the Highlands to a great industry of that kind&#x2014;the great distances away from the markets and


centres of population, the increased cost of transport, the shortage of ordinary services, the difficulties of obtaining labour and where to house them. These are great commercial difficulties which have discouraged industries from going to the Highlands and they will still discourage them. The only way the new Board can hope to induce them to enter their area is to offer them electricity at the very minimum cost price. Therefore there will be no margin there. And the same considerations will apply to the Co-operative Wholesale Society in Scotland. The shrewd business men who control this organisation will apply precisely the same principles when they are faced with this proposition. They will not go into Highland territory unless they get power at the cheapest possible rate.<br/>
The next group of possible purchasers are the authorised undertakers, municipal undertakings, and private companies. But these undertakers are already fully protected under the Electricity Acts. The Board dare not charge them a farthing more than they themselves would pay if they were producing electricity by their own plant. The cost of production to them is also the actual selling price and there is no margin to be had there.<br/>
It is inconceivable that private consumers, remembering the excessive costs of transmission and distribution which will be involved in supplying the outlying places, will offer a price that will result in the slightest margin of profit for the Board. The very reverse is more likely to happen. It is more likely that private consumers will be paying less than the cost price. Therefore, it is plain that the Board will depend directly and all the time upon the Central Electricity Board &#x2014;in other words the great industrial populations of the midlands of Scotland &#x2014;for their success. That demand from the midlands of Scotland is what will make possible the development of this great scheme. How does the Central Electricity Board fix its price? It is laid down in Clause 16 of the Bill, and it is as well that the Highlands should be reminded of the position It states that
<q>the price to be charged by the Board for electricity supplied under this subsection to the Central Electricity Board in any year shall &#x2026; be a sum &#x2026; equal to the cost of production in that year of a like supply of electricity at the steam generating station operated under the directions of the Central Electricity Board.</q>

It further indicates that it must be the most economic station so operated. In other words, the criterion of the price to be paid by the Central Electricity Board for the bulk of the supplies manufactured by the new Board is the price of coal. If the House can conceive of a great improvement in the scientific production of coal resulting in substantial new economies, and a lowering of the price of coal, the Board's income from the Central Electricity Board will fall and the vital margin from which its daily expenses are financed may possibly go. So we are faced with the strange dilemma that the more we improve the method of producing coal and so reducing the price per ton, the more difficult will it become to offer electricity to the Highlands.</p>

<p>I feel that this is the very crux of the matter. I am trying to explain that the bulk of the new Board's supply will be bought by the Central Electricity Board and that their price is based on the cost of coal. I am trying to show how that cost is likely to move, because upon that depends the success or failure of the Board. I feel that if I do not enlarge on it too much I may be in Order.</p>

<p>I was only warning the hon. Gentleman that it would not be right for the Debate to develop into a Debate on the cost of production of coal.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1943-05-27a.1794.3" speakerid="unknown" speakername="Mr. Stewart" colnum="1794" time="">
<p>On the other hand, if the House can conceive of another set of circumstances, namely, that the young men of the mining areas will increasingly decline to go underground; or, if they do go, will work only for shorter hours and higher wages, then the price of coal will rise and more money will go into the coffers of the Hydro-Electric Board. In that case the more the Midlands housewife pays for her fire and light the more her opposite number in the Highlands will benefit. But if circumstances are such that after the war the price of coal rises, as it is doing now, is it not very likely that other prices will rise also and that the Board's capital expenditure, on all the things that go into the making of great hydro-electric works, cement, steel, labour and so no, will heavily increase and thus


counter-balance the higher income received from the Central Electricity Board? In that event there would be no gain to the new Board. With these possibilities in mind one cannot look ahead with any certainty at all as to the future standing of this Board, and that is why I think the House must address itself to the further factor to which I have referred, the personnel of the Board.<br/>
I have already referred to the limitations under which this Board has to work. The Government have declined to bestow on the Board that freedom for which I have pleaded. The Board is going to be tied hand and foot by bureaucratic control in London and Edinburgh and bound to a short-term, scheme-by-scheme policy, unknown to any similar enterprise in the country. It is bound to that system to which I have protested so vigorously, a system which is calculated as I believe to hamper the Board if not to hamstring its efforts in the highly intricate technical work it has to perform. I think on the Second Reading I suggested that the task before the Board was one of the proudest any body of Scotsmen could undertake. I think that is true, but I think it is also the most difficult task any such body could face. We cannot now alter the Bill itself; the time has passed. We have tried, and we have failed. The machinery is laid down under which the Board has to operate. There is only one provision left unspecified and on which the House can exercise its influence, namely, the composition of the Board which is to work this great scheme. In these circumstances it is impossible to exaggerate the importance attaching to the quality of the man appointed to direct it.<br/>
At the risk of repetition, let me emphasise again that this great project is a business project. It is no good my right hon. Friend saying it is a development board. There is no doubt it must have regard to the social development of the Highlands; certainly, but to describe it as a development board is fatal to its prospects. It is a business proposition and can only achieve its purposes if it is run on sound, strict, business lines and the Board is inspired by great efficiency and by enterprise and initiative. These are the things that are going to make this Board a success, and it is really vital that the Secretary of State should indicate to us to-day what type of men he is going

to appoint. If the men turn out to be duds, the whole show is a failure and we shall have done great harm to the Highlands. It can only succeed if we get the best men available in charge of this mighty, difficult enterprise.<br/>
I tried in the Committee stage and put down Amendments to get an opportunity of discussing the personnel of the Board and the qualities of the men. Unfortunately the Chair did not call my Amendment or Amendments of other hon. Members directed towards the same end. Clearly the Vice-Chairman, who is to be the chief executive of this Board, has got to be a first-class business man with sound electricity experience behind him. I would like confirmation of that from my right hon. Friend, and all Scotland is waiting for it. Clearly there should be one member of the Board with wide general experience and, I hope, a good knowledge of the Highlands. I think a man like Mr. Neil Beaton would be excellent for the job. He has wide experience and was brought up as a Highlander and has first-class business ability. Merely. that a man should live in the Highlands is surely a poor qualification. That a man with other qualities should also know the Highlands is a good thing.<br/>
There are three other members of this Board to be considered. What sort of men is the right hon. Gentleman going to appoint? I hope politics is not going to enter into this matter.</p>

<p>I do not think it should be a bar, but if it is to be a successful project, political appointments might be the least advantageous to the Highlands. What I seek to see there is a body of practical men with the highest possible experience. I cannot emphasise too much the importance of this fact. Of, course the Secretary of State will be aware of all these considerations but the country is entitled to know and the House is entitled to know if the men are already selected.<br/>
I congratulate my right hon. Friend not only upon having done this thing&#x2014;I do not think it is the best thing he could have done&#x2014;but having done it I want to thank him also for his courtesy in the course of the proceedings. He has done little for me. I think he accepted one of my Amendments beforehand and


another in the course of the Debate. The Lord Advocate did not accept any. But for all that they have both been very polite. I think they have been most unwise to reject some of the proposals made to them, but there it is. This House wishes this new enterprise well, and I share that sentiment.</p>

<p>I have listened to the speeches made here today, and I felt that this Bill on its Third Reading stage was getting a very melancholy start. I asked myself, "Are we celebrating new life or are we gathered around mourning the dead"? and I have a feeling that both are involved, for I remember that the hon. Member for Stockport (Sir A. Gridley) said, "This is a bad Bill," and I felt my heart warm to the Bill. I was absolutely amazed to hear the hon. Member for Stockport quote the Cooper Report, in connection with the neglect of private enterprise. Is the hon. Member for Stockport unaware of the fact that private enterprise has had 200 years in Scotland, no one interfering with it, and it has completely depopulated the Highlands and turned Scotland into a derelict area? When I heard him say it was a bad Bill I realised that there was something good in the Bill. Anything that goes against the desires of the hon. Member for Stockport is bound to be in the interests of the people, but I will say to the Secretary of State for Scotland that it would have been a much better Bill had he accepted the Amendments in the name of the hon. Member for Dumbarton Burghs (Mr. Kirkwood), the hon. Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Sloan) and myself. The hon. Member for Stockport is typical of the other side of the House, all good business men. Where there is a shilling to be grasped they will grasp it. But in general they are very dull-witted. The hon. Member for Stockport makes fairly strong criticism of the constitution of this Board because he says the Board will be under two masters. He is correct; at last his eyes are open to the truth, but we had an Amendment down to eliminate the dual control of the Board and have the Board appointed by the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Secretary of State for Scotland responsible to this House. Where was the hon. Member for Stockport when that Amendment was discussed before the House?<br/>
This Board is of the very greatest importance to the people of the Highlands. The hon. and gallant Member for East Renfrew (Major Lloyd) said that the Board should be composed of business men and men of experience and there should be no politics entering into it. The hon. Member for East Fife (Mr. Henderson Stewart) followed up and is even prepared to throw cut a bait in the form of a co-operator in the hope that the rest will be good Tory or Liberal business men. When these people talk about no politics being introduced, they talk about it from the sense of their being members of the Tory Party.</p>

<p>&#x2014;and that no politics should be introduced into the question of their selection, but when you get a suggestion of that kind it always conveys, it must convey, the idea of having representatives of capitalist economy.

<p>I would not mind going on. The Board will be faced with a very difficult task. There are people who will try to use this Bill to exploit the Highlands. We want it to be used for replenishing the Highlands with the population which has been driven away. I am certain that is what the Secretary of State wants. We have in this House and in the country people with a peculiar morality: Anything is permissible, the depopulation of the Highlands, poverty, starvation, anything, as long as the sacred rights of property and profits are secure. That is their morality. It comes out in everything. Never once has the moral fibre of these business men on the other side of the House been disturbed by the power of the Minister of


Labour to transfer Scottish girls from Scotland to England, but as soon as the Minister of Aircraft Production interferes with the shares&#x2014;not the lives&#x2014;of Shorts&#x2014;what protests!<br/>
From the point of view of all those on the other side a good business man is one who can show a profit on the balance-sheet and a good dividend, not a man who can show a good profit in the health and the well-being of the people. The people may be perishing&#x2014;but how is the balance-sheet, is there a good dividend? Members on the other side from Scotland who are watching this Bill have all their lives been concerned with the question, "What sort of dividend are we getting?" while all around them in Scotland and in the Highlands people were being driven from their homes, people were living in the most unspeakable poverty. A former Secretary of State for Scotland, the hon. and gallant Member for Kelvingrove (Lieut.-Colonel Elliot) said in this House that conditions in the countryside in Scotland and in the Highlands of Scotland were absolutely shocking, a disgrace to civilisation. It was the business men of Scotland which produced that Scotland, and now they come along and say, "Let us see that we get business men on this Board." It is a very important.Board. I say that business men should not be chosen. Business men should be kept off the Board. One can imagine after listening to the hon. Member for Stockport what a boon and a blessing he would be to the people of Scotland if he were on the Board. He would wither up any of the green stuff that is left. As well have a flock of locusts going into Scotland. One has only to listen to him to realise where his mind is, what he is concerned with, what is his morality.<br/>
Have hon. Members any idea of how the people of Scotland were living before the war&#x2014;the horrible housing conditions, the lack of food, the lack of clothing, the lack of anything in the nature of amenities? The hon. Member for Cathcart (Mr. Francis Beattie) may shake his head, but it is true. It is the business men, who were concerned with profits, who have robbed and looted and brought Scotland to the condition in which she is at the present time. Do not try to put the blame on the Scottish people. I ask the Secretary of State for Scotland once again to hand round copies of that famous book

"Our Noble Families," in order that they may see how it started&#x2014;the robbery, the wholesale, open robbery, the corruption of the courts. These are the men&#x2014;</p>

<p>I am very sorry. I have been concentrating on this question of the composition of the Board. There are many points in the Bill which I feel are of the greatest importance, and I was pointing out that now that we have possibilities of development we get these sweet and courteous suggestions that the Board must be composed of good business men. There is not such a thing as a good business man, except in the relative sense, in the sense of being able to get profits. In relation to the welfare of the people there is not such a thing as a good business man.</p>

<p>In Scotland.
Mr. GallaPher: Of course, I do not expect hon. Members on the other side to understand or appreciate that, but it is the actual fact that the business man is the enemy of the people. He lives on the robbery of the people. The great problem is how to utilise this Bill not for the purpose of exploiting the Highlands but to help the Highlands and bring back at least some of their population. Is that something for a business man to do? Not at all. That is something for politicians. If we get Tory politicians or Tory business men or Liberal business men on the Board we shall get no real progress. If we get on the Board Labour or Communist politicians&#x2014;the united front&#x2014;who understand how the crisis in Scotland has developed, who understand the economic basis of the crisis, who understand the politics of the situation, we shall get the very best results from this Bill. Therefore, I want to impress upon the Secretary of State for Scotland and upon the Minister of Fuel and Power&#x2014;because the two of them have responsibility for the Board, the Board is appointed by two Ministers instead of one&#x2014;the very great importance of making a correct and effective selection of members of the Board. If it is a Board that is progressive, it will come into the closest association with and give the greatest encouragement to the Co-operative movement in the development of the industries in the Highlands, and that will have the


greatest value. If it is a progressive Board, it will gradually work towards taking over the independent undertakings. Of course, the hon. Member for Stockport will not like that, but the people of Scotland will, and it will not. matter very much what his reactions will be. We want a Board of that kind, a progressive Board that sees here the opportunity for bringing all the best forces in Scotland into association with the life of the Highlands for the purpose of developing and expanding the life of the Highlands.<br/>
The Secretary of State for Scotland has put in much work, time, energy, and patience in connection with this Bill. I must say&#x2014;I have said it before maybe&#x2014;that I do not know when there was a Secretary of State for Scotland who had so many well-wishers, and so much ready support in this House. I am glad that he has brought in this Bill. I am glad he has carried it to the present stage but regret that he did not accepts our assistance. It would have been to his advantage to have done so I hope above everything else that the selection of this Board will be of a character to launch the Act in such a way that there will be special benefit for the people of the Highlands and advantage to the people throughout the whole of Scotland.</p>

<p>May I add my tribute to the congratulations already expressed in this Debate so far to the work of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, and of the Lord Advocate, in pressing this Bill through to its present stage? Like one or two other hon. Members who have just spoken, I also put down one or two Amendments which were also not accepted. Nevertheless I know that those I represent realise that nobody could have been more painstaking and more sincere in his desire to meet the wishes and points of view of the Highlanders in particular than was the Secretary of State outside this Chamber. I know something of the meetings he has had, and the local authorities he has met, the individual associations and groups, industries, etc., he has met and discussed this matter with, and thrashed it out. Nobody could have taken more pains or, I am quite convinced, produced a more satisfactory Measure under the present circumstances than has the Secretary of State in this Bill. I would therefore like

to say that we in that part of the Highlands from which I come welcome most gratefully what we hope will very soon be the changing of this Bill into an Act.<br/>
The hon. Member for West Fife (Mr. Gallacher) and the hon. Member for East Fife (Mr. Henderson Stewart) both seemed concerned about the membership of the new Board, and there seemed to be some desire that the Board should be composed entirely of politicians. I would like to speak for my part of the Highlands to say that I hope that no politics will be allowed to enter into this Board in any way. What its members' particular political views may be will, I hope, be kept in the background, and not be subject to debate in this House or debate at their various meetings. I am quite convinced that the Secretary of State, whether my right hon. Friend who holds that office now or his successors, and advisers will be certain to adopt and nominate sound, experienced men. I was one of those who advocated in the Committee stage that one of the members of the Board should have some Highland qualifications. I did not advocate, as the hon. Member for East Fife said, that he should live in the Highlands. My hon. Friend the Member for Gorbals (Mr. Buchanan) insisted that rather than that he should be a Highlander the particular member should be a good experienced man in the electrical industry. I quite agree. I hope that all the Board will be men who will be business men, technical men, that whatever their status may be, they will be experienced men, and we hope also will know something of the Highlands. In view of the assurances given by, I think, the Lord Advocate and the Secretary of State I feel quite convinced we can safely leave the choice of that Board to the Secretary of State and his near advisers.<br/>
There has, I think, been rather a misconception about the whole fundamental basis of this Bill. I have heard it said, both in this House and outside, that here is a sum of &#x00A3;30,000,000 to be spent on the Highlands, so why go and spend it all on electricity? It is rather as though this was a tip given by a beneficent Treasury to us poor Highlanders. Surely that is entirely a complete misunderstanding of the position. I think from what I have heard my right hon. Friend say that it may quite possibly be that the Board may never have to go to the Treasury to


draw any of the &#x00A3;30,000,000, that this is merely a Treasury guarantee towards the success of this Measure. In spite of the criticisms, technical criticisms, I have heard to-day and in the Committee stage, we believe that in the course of time this will prove to be a most beneficial Measure. We do not believe it will cure all our evils; we do not believe it will bring back thousands, hundreds of thousands, of population to live in the Highlands, but we do believe and are quite convinced that this is a fundamental issue which must first of all be set right before any other development. The improvement of other matters which we are not allowed to refer to can only take place on the basis of the development of this scheme.<br/>
We look forward, not in five years' time nor in ten years' time, but that in decades to come when those of us here have passed away great benefits will have accrued to the Highlands, and that we shall see the Highlands redeveloped and with an increased population. It is quite impossible, I am convinced, that any Measure passed through this House is going to have immediate effect on the position in the Highlands. We know the difficulties there are to be overcome, but we feel that my right hon. Friend who at present holds the reins in the Scottish Office has our interests at heart and that this is only the first, we hope, of Measures he is going to bring forward to help set the Highlands going again, so that our children and our children's children will not be able constantly to fling the criticism in our faces that the Highlands are one of the depressed areas of the country Therefore, in conclusion I congratulate my right hon. Friend and wecome the passage of this Bill most heartily.</p>

<p>The question of the development of electricity in the Highlands has had a rather chequered career in this House. Many are the private Measures that have been brought in; and many were the fights and the Debates we had over them. We had splits in all parties. I differed from many of my colleagues on the issue. I always voted for those private Bills, and I was annoyed because always at the end of the day there stood the Highlands, in all its gauntness, and nothing was done. Then we had that Board in Edinburgh, on which I sat. I wondered whether the same thing was not going to happen again;

whether another Measure would be promoted to get power to the Highlands, whether it would again be defeated, and again nothing done. I always felt that no matter what scheme you brought forward, there were always overwhelming arguments in favour of it, but at the end the argument for doing nothing succeeded. This Measure at least sets out to accomplish something by Act of Parliament for the Highlands, and all of us should seize this opportunity and prevent any attempt to defeat the Bill. If that happened, all hope of obtaining an electricity supply in the Highlands would be gone for some considerable time.<br/>
This Measure should be welcomed because it is an effort to harness the water power of the Highlands for the development of electricity, although I am not going to throw up my arms and say that this is a great Measure. I want to say one thing to the hon. Member for West Fife (Mr. Gallacher), who is not now in his place&#x2014;he has developed a political technique now; he delivers a speech, and then can barely wait any longer. Judged by his standards, this Bill is bad. He is bound to be on the side of the Jeremiahs, who say that the Bill must fail. He said that it would not succeed because business men would be put on the Board. I know that the Secretary of State will put business men on it, and I know that it will not fail because he does so. But I deprecate this growing tendency in this House to say that politicians should not do this or do that. It is wrong. One of the greatest things that Scotland possesses is its judicial system. It is a clean system and a capable system; I do not think anybody would say that it is corrupt. In the main the great judges to-day have been drawn from the ranks of the politicians. Why should we be ashamed of the fact tha<ob/> we have served our country in this House of Commons?</p>

<p>The great judges are appointed to their office not because they are politicians, but because they are good lawyers.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1943-05-27a.1804.1" hansard_membership_id="1837" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/29485" speakername="Mr. Buchanan" colnum="1804" time="">
<p>But the suggestion is that you should go further, and make the fact that a man has been a politician a bar. All the great judges I have known have been no worse for having been here: in fact, they have become greater through their apprenticeship in the House of Commons. When I sat on that Board in


Edinburgh, who but a Member of Parliament was the mainspring behind the Bill which the hon. and gallant Member supported? The late Mr. George Balfour was the driving force. I say that this idea that the fact that a man has been in the House of Commons is something to be ashamed of, is wrong; it is something to be proud of. I hope that the Secretary of State will not make it a bar. A man should be judged on his merits, but the fact that he has been in the House of Commons should be an additional qualification. When people come to me and say that they have no politics, I know what they mean&#x2014;they mean that they are going to vote against me. I admit that a great deal depends on the terms of appointment of the Board. But I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will not apply any test other than he would apply were he running a business of his own and wanting it to succeed for the welfare of the people. I want capable people, who are fit to sit on the Board, but I trust that in the selection human qualities will not be left out of consideration. Human problems and the development of the Highlands have to be considered if this scheme is to be a success.<br/>
I have a rooted aversion to this idea of congratulating the Secretary of State. I have noticed that everybody congratulates the man who is in office, and then when he goes out of office nobody takes any more notice of him. I never congratulate people for doing what they are paid to do. I think the Secretary of State has done the job he is paid for doing, and that is the end of it as far as I am concerned. I hope that the Bill will be a success, for the sake of the people of Scotland, and particularly of the Highlands. The Highlands is a difficult country for anybody to undertake anything in. This scheme is an experiment. It may be a great success, and it may well fail. If it fails, I shall not blame the Secretary of State.<br/>
I would sooner he made an experiment and failed than that he should never have tried at all. That experiment may bring about the conditions that opponents have to say about it, and, if it does, the right hon. Gentleman will not be to blame. He is accepting the situation and deciding that in future the thing must be done, and to that extent he has done his job and done it decently. I hope that the Bill will succeed. There is no certainty. There are

many things in the Bill in respect of which one cannot foresee the future. It depends on future development as to whether the experiment is to become an absolute certainty. But at least the right hon. Gentleman has done what I hope Secretaries of State for Scotland will do in the future and what they have not done in the past. He has experimented. Some of us are too afraid of failure to experiment. As far as this is an experiment to try and develop the Highlands, I welcome it, and I trust that it will be successful in its operation.</p>

<p>The Secretary of State for Scotland has done a number of big things in his life, but I think this is the biggest thing he has ever done. It is something of which he has every reason to be proud, to have secured, for a part of the Highlands at least, control over water power, but evidently his task is not finished. He has still to appoint his Board. If he has been listening&#x2014;and I daresay he has&#x2014;to the advice which he has been given from various sides of the House, he will realise that his biggest task still lies in front of him. When he has examined all the business men who are not business men, according to the information we have, and who are incapable of being trusted, and he is reduced to examining the Communist Party for the membership of the Board, he will have the biggest and toughest job he has ever had in his life. I do not envy him the task when he is reduced to selecting his Board from the Communist Party. At the same time, I agree with my hon. Friend, the Member for Gorbals (Mr. Buchanan) that, if a man has the necessary qualifications, the mere fact that he is a politician should not debar him from membership of the Board. I do not think that in any of the previous discussions on this matter when previous Bills were introduced that anyone questioned the capabilities of knowledge of the late Mr. Balfour, formerly Member for Hampstead. He knew his business, and no one questioned his business capacity. The mere fact that he was a politician should not have prevented him from being a member of any electricity board, because he knew his subject, even if he was a business man.<br/>
I have witnessed all the battles that have raged over the question of electrical development in the Highlands of Scotland, and the Secretary of State has by some means or other had a pleasanter task and a


quieter time than on previous occasions. I remember the previous occasions to which my hon. Friend the Member for Gorbals has already referred when, particularly on Second Reading Debates, we had the whole House and parties divided. I also remember an occasion when I even voted for one of these private enterprise Bills, not because it was a private enterprise Bill, but because I wanted to see something done to develop the Highlands of Scotland. I believed that it was a means of bringing new life to the Highlands, and I was prepared to sacrifice principles that I held very dear in order to give a better opportunity to the Highlands of Scotland. I hope the result of the passing of this Bill will be that we shall have new life in the Highlands and see new industries suitable to the Highlands of Scotland springing up which will not disfigure the Highlands. We have heard a good deal from the other side of the House and on previous occasions when the Bill has been before the House about what private enterprise has done. It has nothing upon which to congratulate itself so far as development in the Highlands is concerned or upon what it has done for the Highlands. It has disfigured the Highlands to a considerable extent.</p>

<p>I am referring to private enterprise works already established there. I am dealing with the amenity question. We have had objections to this Measure on the ground that it was going to spoil the beautiful scenery of the Highlands of Scotland. You only require to come and see what private enterprise has already done in the Highlands of Scotland to see what it can do in destroying amenities. I am certain that under this Measure the Amenity Committee to be appointed by the Secretary of State will see that due consideration is given to preserving as much of the amenities of the areas that will be affected as possible. No Scotsman can look upon a matter of this kind with indifference, and ever since the first Measure was introduced after I came to this House I have taken the very greatest interest in these particular Measures. What happened before that time? Government after Government&#x2014;Liberal Government and Tory Govern-

ment, because we had no Labour Governments at that time&#x2014;came to this House year after year with a Budget with provision for a few thousand pounds ear-marked for the Highlands of Scotland, and this House considered that it was doing its duty if it passed these few thousand pounds for doing something to help the Highlands or the Islands of Scotland. No big Measure was introduced that went to the root of the matter.<br/>
I am prepared to admit the development which has already taken place in parts of the Highlands of Scotland; the Grampian scheme and the other schemes developed so far have all been to the advantage of part of the Highlands. This Bill is the last part which has been preserved from private enterprise. We have complaints from the hon. Member for Stockport (Sir A. Gridley) that this little part has been kept from private enterprise, although private enterprise, unfortunately, will have its opportunity even under this scheme. Private enterprise will come along after the juice is available. All private manufacturers and those who think that they can develop little schemes in the Highlands of Scotland will come along with their proposals, and private enterprise will get the juice which is necessary in order to go on with their works. First of all this scheme itself will have to be undertaken, but in the meantime I hope manufacturers will be looking around for pos<ob/>bbitities in the Highlands of Scotland. In these modern days there need be no difficulties with regard to distance and transport, as there have been in the past. This war has opened our eyes to great possibilities, and manufacturers who establish factories in Scotland should have no difficulty in getting to markets.<br/>
I hope that as a result of this Bill there will be big developments in the Highlands of Scotland. If there are, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State can congratulate himself on the work he has already done in connection with this Measure. The Bill was described by the hon. Member for East Fife (Mr. Henderson Stewart) as being tied up, bound and over-burdened with bureaucracy and regulations. All I would say to him is this: I have supported this Measure, even with all the imperfections he has described, much more heartily than any other Measure which has come before this House for electrical development in the


Highlands. This, at any rate, is something to be going on with, and even if these regulations should prove burdensome to the Board, so that they cannot carry on, there is nothing to prevent the Secretary of State from coming back to the House and asking that they should be dispensed with or modified so that the Board can have more freedom than is already permitted. I am prepared to accept the Bill as a landmark in the history of the Highlands of Scotland and as something which will provide a great opportunity for development in that area.</p>

<p>I did not have an opportunity of taking part in the discussion on the Second Reading of this Bill, owing to the number of Scottish Members who wished to take part, and I welcome the opportunity of saying a few words now, on the Third Reading. I am very much in agreement with what was said by the hon. Member for Sedgefield (Mr. Leslie) and the hon. Member for Gorbals (Mr. Buchanan). This Bill, which has aroused a good deal of expectation in Scotland, has been subjected to a good deal of criticism. There has been the fear that we would lose the beauties of Scotland, and an attempt has been made in the Bill to deal with any possibilities of destroying the amenities of our Scottish Highlands. I have met people who have said that it would be a great pity to do anything that would interfere with the wonderful grandeur and beauty of our Scottish Highlands. It is so nice to have them for Englishmen to visit; it gives Englishmen an opportunity of wearing the kilt in the seclusion of the Highlands.<br/>
But I think the Scottish Highlands are most notable, not for their beauty, but for the men and women they have produced in the centuries that have gone by. The Highlands have produced a vigorous people, but the population there has been steadily on the decline for many years. I welcome this Bill, therefore, because there are potentialities in it for the development of the resources of the Highlands, and with that development I think there will be opportunities for the people who have left the Highlands to go back from industrial centres and enjoy their Highland homes. The Bill is an attempt to utilise the water resources of Scotland, and I hope that it will have great success in contributing to the development of our

country. At the same time I am not unduly optimistic; the fruits of this Measure will depend upon many factors. One factor which aroused my willing support was the fact that the Treasury have guaranteed an expenditure of &#x00A3;30,000,000. I want to see that money expended in Scotland, because Scotland needs large sums of money in order that it should have its appropriate development.<br/>
In connection with the speech made by the hon. Member for the University of Wales (Professor Gruffydd), I see no reason why there should not be agricultural and industrial development in the Highlands of our country. The time is long overdue, and I hope the Board will use their powers to see that there will be available power supplies in all parts of the Highlands at a cheap rate which will enable people to develop the resources of that area and also provide for the growth of the population and the bringing back of the vigour of that part of Scotland.<br/>
There has been a certain amount of criticism and advice given to Ministers as to who shall constitute the Electricity Board. I am not going to give the right hon. Gentleman advice, because I do not think he would take it, and I do not think that he will take the advice that has been offered to him. That is very much a foregone conclusion. I have a great deal of sympathy with what was said by the hon. Member for Gorbals with regard to the ruling out of the Members of the Commons House of Parliament. Think of it. The business of the country is being run in large measure by Members of the Commons House of Parliament. A man is in the Government one week and out of it the next, and ever so many big businesses are waiting on his doorstep pleading with him to join their board. I remember one Member of the House who could get on to any board in the country. The idea that this will prevent corruption is preposterous nonsense. I think however that the success of the Bill will depend not only upon the Board but upon Scottish opinion and activity in looking after its interests. One of the great defects of the Measure, to my mind, is that while all these powers are being handed to the Board, there are not along with them powers which would enable the Scottish people to have more control over it and over the resources of their country. I believe the only way of making this


Measure a real success is through the transfer of power from London to Scotland through the institution of a real Scottish Government to develop the resources of our country and give our people the real opportunity that they should have.</p>

<p>We are now getting very near the end of the road as far as this Bill is concerned, and as one who has taken a fairly lively interest in it I should like to say one word. I have been warned by the hon. Member for Gorbals (Mr. Buchanan) that in his opinion it is not right to congratulate the Secretary of State for doing what he is paid to do. I am not going to do that, but our thanks are due from all of us to him, the Lord Advocate and those who have been associated with them for the very courteous way in which they have met us on all occasions and for the very open-minded manner in which they have listened to what we have put before them, and I should like to place that on record.</p>

<p>I do not rise to make a detailed analysis of the provisions of the Bill, but before we finally pass it I think it is only proper and fitting that two words should be said from this Bench with regard to it. The first will be one of blessing. We believe that it is necessary and that in many respects it is in accordance with what a Bill dealing with this vast subject ought to be. We have had in years gone by several Bills brought before the House which have been thrown out for many reasons. One is that the House did not consider it proper that on a large-scale public utility of this kind private enterprise, with all the dangers that lurk in it, should be the means of exploiting it. This Bill gives controlling power to a public body appointed by the Secretary of State and in many of its largest decisions responsible to this House. We believe that when it comes to fruition it will bring a ray of hope to the Highlands population. Those who listened to the lugubrious speech of the hon. Member for the Welsh University (Professor Gruffydd), if they had not been aware of the facts in the Highlands, might have supposed that that area was one of extreme prosperity which the nefarious designs of the Secretary of

State were going to injure and bring to nothing. We all know that the exact reverse is the case. On the other hand we must not put our expectations too high. Neither for better nor for worse, for good nor for ill is this Bill going to bring a humming hive of industrial activity to the Highlands. The most that can be said may be that it will bring some more contacts with the outside world and prevent the isolation of this area which has existed up to the present, and some ray of hope to the Highlanders. In addition to that, we believe that it will do something for other areas of Scotland at the same time. We hope it will provide them with electricity for power and light at a price which is not too extravagant to make it of real, practical value.<br/>
The other word that I want to say is a word of caution and warning. It would be absurd to place extravagant hopes on the results of the Bill. At the most it is only a substructure upon which future prosperity may or may not afterwards be built. I do not think any of us, even the Secretary of State himself, can put his hand on his heart and say he knows exactly what the Bill is going to do and how it is going to work out. It is possible that it may not work out as well as some of us anticipate. For instance, if it were to mean that the beauties of the Highlands were substantially and materially disfigured, if it were to mean that those who toil in the Highlands were not to get the advantages which the scheme proposes to develop, if it were to mean that something like black industrialism were to spread over areas that ought to be sacred from such development, if it were to mean that no benefits came to Scotland by the creation and use of this water power but that all the benefits were going to some Central Electricity Board, as the hon. Member for East Fife {Mr. Henderson Stewart) seems to think, most of us would be disappointed. I am sure that no one would be more disappointed than the Secretary of State himself. It is because neither I nor my friends take that pessimistic view of the prospects of this Bill that we hope the House will give it a unanimous Third Reading and we wish the Bill and the Secretary of State in promoting it "God speed."</p>

<p>We have had a fairly exhaustive and very agreeable discussion upon the Third Reading of this Measure. With


what has fallen from several hon. Members, the right hon. Gentleman who spoke last being one of them, to the effect that we need not exaggerate or paint too rosy a vision of what may eventuate from this Bill, I whole-heartedly agree. This is only an instalment. This is only one step in what may be called the planning and utilisation of the energies and resources of the Highlands for a better day. There are other Measures we can think of, some of which indeed ought to have had priority. For my part, I am pretty certain that before we can have security and decent conditions of life in the Highlands we shall require to see something in the nature of the Post Office principle of equalised rates in transport.<br/>
This Bill is the Government's Measure for the utilisation and the selling of a great asset, a great commercial asset if you like to put it that way, which the Highlands have hitherto allowed to go to waste. Parliament in times past has quarrelled about how that asset should be marketed. Previous Measures have said that it should be marketed by private enterprise, and Parliament, the Highlands, the Scottish Press and everybody quarrelled violently over that solution. Some hon. Members said that we were getting nowhere, every year these resources were going waste, the population was leaving the Highlands and there was nothing but despair and apathy. The Cooper Committee sat to consider the problem. It gave us a unanimous recommendation. That recommendation was to the effect that all future hydro-electric development in the Highlands should be run by a non-profit making corporation, a public services corporation. That is the essential feature of this Bill. The Government adopted it with alacrity and speed. As hon. Members will have seen, on the back of this Measure are the names of some seven or eight Cabinet Ministers, including the Chancellor of the Exchequer, to show that there is no partisanship here. Liberal, Conservative and Labour Members of the Cabinet decided to back this idea and put it forward in the hope that we should get good will and a general concurrence and at long last get rid of this struggle and strife in which everybody, and particularly everybody in the Highlands, was the loser. Nobody is more conscious of the fact that the Bill is not perfect than I am. My right hon. and learned Friend the Lord Advocate and myself have had to compromise time and time again in

this matter because we wanted a Bill that would work. Nobody gets everything he wants in this world, and when my hon. Friend the Member for East Fife (Mr. Henderson Stewart) recited a catalogue of what he called defects in the Bill, I could have added some more to his list. That is not the point. The point is, Will this Bill work? It may work with some creaking, hut it will he capable of amendment, and if it works, I am sure that the House of Commons will have contributed something of real value to our Highland populations&#x2014;by this day's work.<br/>
I will not go over the dozens of points that were made in the Debate to-day. I will refer to only two of them. Most hon. Members, even when they spent most of their time cursing the Bill, ended by blessing it. The hon. Member for Stockport (Sir A. Gridley) began by saying it was a bad Bill and ended by giving it his blessing. The only hon. Member whose speech was one long, lugubrious monologue of despair was a gentleman from Wales. I rather gathered from his speech that he did not like the Bill. Against his view may I say that there were no Amendments to the Measure from the local authorities? That is a remarkable fact. There were no Amendments on the Order Paper which were taken to a Division by the amenity interests. They were withdrawn. There was no opposition from the Highland Press. There was no opposition from the Co-operative organisations in Scotland to the extent for which they can speak for the Highland populations. There was no opposition from the Trades Union Congress in Scotland. They backed the Bill. There has been no opposition whatever from any Highland Member of Parliament. They have all backed the Bill. I am entitled to say that there bps rarely been an occasion in this House, in my memory at any rate, in which there were such cordial unanimity and good will bestowed upon a major Measure of this kind.</p>

<p>I beg my hon. Friends not to say that. The good will and the cordiality lie in the essence of this Bill. Since we are talking about good will, it would ill-become me to allow this Measure to go from this House without my asserting in public the great tribute which I ought to pay to my right hon. and learned Friend the Lord Advocate.


His services have been most invaluable on a hundred difficult points. There is only one thing I want to say in conclusion. It is about the composition of the Board. Having gone so far, would we not be fools if we appointed a Board&#x2014;somebody suggested members of the Communist Party, somebody suggested party men and somebody suggested that only Highlanders should be members&#x2014;but would we not be fools if we did not give this Board the greatest possible start with good will? We must see to it that that good will is maintained, and, as my right hon. and gallant Friend the Minister of Fuel and Power and I can be shot at in this House if we appoint second-raters or men who cannot carry the confidence of the people of Scotland, we would be great fools if we did so.<br/>
I think the House may take it that, having gone so far and having put in so much hard labour in trying to get concurrence and agreement on this matter, the members of the Government responsible for the composition of the Board will take the utmost care to ensure that the Board will be such as will carry the confidence of the people of Scotland. I do hope, trust and believe that we have done a good day's work for the Highlands of Scotland, and however much this Bill may require amendment, it is something to be said for the co-operative spirit presently abroad that we can unite on agreeing that a great national asset of our country should henceforth be developed on a nonprofit making basis for the benefit of the people.</p>

<p>The Secretary of State has, I think, left us in no doubt that he is as keen as any Member in any part of the House that this Bill should become a workable proposition, and he has left us in no doubt at all that he is as fully alive as any other bon. Member to the fact that the passage of this Bill will not place any magician's wand in the hands of himself or of any successive Secretary of State. I am sorry I was unable to be here at the earlier part of the Debate, but I am sure many Members who have spoken have stressed the point that the Secretary of State and all associated with him should take the utmost possible care in operating the vast powers which the Bill will place in their hands and see to it that the amenities question,

which is a very vital matter as far as the Highlands of Scotland are concerned, shall be given the due consideration which it so richly deserves.<br/>
In talking about the post-war world and the conditions we hope to bring in, the point has again and again been raised of this great national asset. The hon. Member for Dumbarton Burghs (Mr. Kirkwood) has frequently called attention to the great natural asset we have for attracting tourists to this small Island of Great Britain. In the post-war world we hope to see, particularly from the United States of America, increasingly large numbers of tourists visiting this Island and going to see the beauties of the Highlands of Scotland, there to enjoy relaxation amidst beautiful scenic surroundings, and I may add that in the past none have been louder in praise of the scenic beauties of the Highlands than those who speak the same language 3,000 miles away across the wastes of the Atlantic Ocean.<br/>
In the past there has been another great asset, not a very popular one with hon. Members above the Gangway who have sought to represent that those of us who speak on behalf of the scenic beauties of the Highlands are merely using this as a camouflage or smokescreen for what they call a sportman's paradise. I do not speak on behalf of that at all, but do not let us forget what in the past sportsmen have done for Scotland, the amount of employment they have given in the autumn months&#x2014;indeed, I might say it has been a veritable harvest for those who have lived in the depressed areas in the Highlands&#x2014;the amount of work forthcoming in that direction. Do not let us minimise it, do let us be very careful. I know the present Secretary of State for Scotland, and hope his successors, will see to it that the scenic beauties of the Highlands are safeguarded and preserved in every possible way, that the least interference with these wonderful scenic surroundings shall be made as a result of the passage of this Bill.<br/>
I stand here in a sense as a repentent sinner, because on previous occasions&#x2014;I must make a clean breast of it&#x2014;I opposed every one of these Measures, even the last one. Notably I opposed the Bill which was sponsored by the present Lord Chief Justice when he was Minister for the Coordination of Defence. I am sure many of us, if he had been able to stand at that Box and say he was fully armed with all


the blessings and power that the then Government could give him and that this was a vital necessity, it might have gone without a Division or the majority against the Measure would have been very much smaller than on that occasion.</p>

<p>I do not want to enter into any contentions on this Measure, because the Secretary of State in winding up said that after all the strife and stormy seas that Measures of this kind have encountered here at long last we have almost complete unanimity.<br/>
As representing a constituency which has had a hydro-electric scheme, the Galloway water power scheme, operating for some 12 or 14 years, I am bound to say that if the 70 schemes this Bill envisages or any one of them are carried through with as little disturbance to the scenic beauties of the Highlands as was the case in the Southern Highlands of Galloway, then I do not think anyone in this House or outside has much cause to fear that our priceless treasure is likely to be bartered away. I know that the Secretary of State mentioned the Clatteringsliaws dam in his speech on Second Reading, and so did the present Lord Chief Justice. That dam and the loch which is now behind it are on ground which formerly belonged to me and which I parted with to the promoters of the Galloway water power scheme. I only wish it had come a little later, because I could have obtained a very much better price. The House is in a congratulatory mood, and the Secretary of State has said that he has secured practically a unanimous Measure. He has said also that he is alive to the defects in the Bill, and the right hon. Member for East Edinburgh (Mr. Pethick-Lawrence) called attention to the fact that we must not run away with the idea that it will cure overnight the ills of the Highlands. On Second Reading the Secretary of State talked about similar schemes in Norway and in Fire. Of course, the Norwegian scheme did not cure the ills of Norway. There are something like 3,000,000 people in Norway, and there are&#x2014;</p>

<p>With very great respect, Sir, I was only speaking of Norway by way of illustration. I was pointing out that Hydro-electric power schemes there had not improved the emigration problem of Norway, and I do not think that the Irish schemes have abolished the ills of Southern Ireland. In the old days I knew the counties of Galway arid Mayo very well indeed, long before the present <i><ob/>egime</i> in Southern Ireland, but it would be quite out of Order for me to say anything about conditions there. Certainly the Shannon scheme, fine though it was, has not cured the congested land question in those counties or in any of the other Southern counties of Ireland, so far as I am aware. I merely mention those cases to bring out in a concrete way the point that was made by the right hon. Member for East Edinburgh. We are delighted that the Secretary of State has secured this practical unanimity to-day, and we wish him God speed with the Bill, and at the same time I am sure that he will be alive to the slight apprehensions which have been expressed from some quarters.</p>

<p>I beg to move "That the Bill be now read a Second time."<br/>
A week or two ago this House unanimously approved of a Nurses Bill for England and Wales. The main object of that Bill was to protect the public and the nursing profession from unauthorised and semi-qualified and unqualified persons who were using the title of "nurse." The Act of 1919, sometimes called "The Nurses' Charter," provided for the State regulation of duly-qualified nurses, but made no provision for the regulation or the use of the designation "nurse" by unqualified persons. More than 20 years have elapsed since the passage of the Act of 1919. By the efforts of a previous Administration two Committees of Inquiry were set up, one the Athlone Committee, so-called because its chairman was the Earl of Athlone, and the other the Alness Committee, so-called because the chairman was Lord Alness. These Committees were set the task of seeing how far they could protect the pub-


lic and the nursing profession from the unauthorised use of the word "nurse" by persons who were not qualified to use it.<br/>
The Athlone Committee took evidence that there was a large body of women, varying greatly in age, skill and experience, who were neither trained as nurses nor were in training as student-nurses, but who were engaged in nursing. The Athlone Committee took the view that so long as these assistant nurses worked under supervision in hospitals their employment was of advantage to the community though sometimes their uncontrolled employment outside constituted a definite danger to the public and tended to lower the status of the whole nursing profession. The Athlone Committee were satisfied that far from imperilling the status or the economic position of the State-registered nurse, her position would be more assured if the assistant nurse status were defined and recognised and if at the same time steps were taken to protect nurses in both categories.<br/>
On the other hand, the Alness Committee took an entirely opposite view. They were informed that the number of these assistant nurses in Scotland&#x2014;at the time when they took evidence, which was in about the year 1938&#x2014;was negligible, and they were advised and came to the conclusion that the recognition of assistant nurses would tend to lower the status of the profession and would not be in the public interest. They felt that the creation and the recognition of a sub-standard grade of nurse at the lower salary would in the end tend to deteriorate the position achieved under the Act of 1919 by the State-registered nurse. It is an argument based on the old Gresham law that the lower tends to drive the higher out of business. They were unanimous in that vi<ob/>w<br/>
The Government were then faced with this difficulty, that the English Committee had recommended the recognition of this assistant nurse grade and the Scottish Committee were unanimously against it. The Bill recently passed in this House for England and Wales was on the basis of the recommendations of the Athlone Committee, and immediately that Bill was passed I had to make representations to the powers-that-be in the nursing profession in Scotland that a new situation had

arisen. When the Bill for England and Wales was passed, when the use of the word "nurse" was forbidden to certain low-standard categories there, if nothing were done in Scotland, obviously we should be flooded from the South of the Border by these low-standard and unrecognised nurses. I asked Lord Alness to get his Committee together and I met them and ascertained from them that they still stood by the terms of their report, and the evidence they had received that the recognition of these sub-standard nurses would be detrimental, in the long run, to the State registered nurse. Finally, I persuaded them with reluctance&#x2014;the Alness Committee and others interested in the nursing profession in Scotland&#x2014;to agree to a compromise, that if we would recognise in a Scottish Bill a grade of assistant nurses, we would only recognise it for a period of five years. That would give the situation which was blowing up as the result of the extra training of nurses due to the war time to settle down, and it would prevent the irruption into Scotland of unqualified nurses to the detriment of the nursing profession there.<br/>
Therefore the first point that I should like to make to the House to-day is that in Clause 2, Sub-section (3), they will find a variation from the terms that the House approved of in the English Bill. The English Bill agreed to the recognition in perpetuity of these, what I call for short, sub-standard or assistant nurses, whereas in this Bill:
<q>Unless Parliament shall hereafter otherwise determine, nothing in rules made under this Section shall enable a course of training begun after the expiry of five years from the commencement of this Act to qualify any person for admission to the roll.</q>
There is the distinction and the difference between the two Measures. That is the first divergence from the English Bill.<br/>
There is another divergency, however, to which I ought to invite the attention of the House. It is in Clause 14, and may I say that there has been some controversy on Clause 14 as to whether, as the Clause is phrased and framed, it is not too wide? On the other hand, there have been strong representations made to us that it is not wide enough. I propose very briefly to state the reasons which actuated us in giving power to the General Nursing Council to frame rules under which they may, in appropriate cases, give a remission in the period of


training&#x2014;[<i>Interruption</i>]&#x2014;it is the period of training only. I am glad my hon. Friend put that. I will come to it in a moment. They may give a remission in the period of training only in appropriate cases, as they may think fit, to nurses who are studying or propose to study for the full certificate under the 1919 Act. Why should we ask for this at all?<br/>
The Royal College of Nursing, I must say, so far as I know are very largely opposed to the Clause as we have drafted A, but the Royal College of Nursing themselves took a sample of what they called 1,031 of the nurses who are, or will be, in this assistant nurse grade in Scotland, to find out what their experience was and to find out what the facts were about them. Of these 1,031 they discovered that 860 of them had already begun their period of State training to become fully qualified nurses, that 681 of them had had more than a year's training for the position of a State registered nurse, and that as a matter of fact 47 of them had actually passed their preliminary examination, gone through the lectures and all the rest of it. We are urging as many of them as possible to get out of this assistant nurse grade. We say, "Do try to qualify yourselves for the full State registration, for the full salary, the better status and standard." These girls say to us, some of them at all events, "Very well, but here is our position. Some of us have sat for the preliminary examination once and have failed. We have gone through the hoops of the training for it, we have attended the lectures, we have worked as student nurses at the low salary. Does this mean that you are going to ask us now to begin at the beginning, <i>de novo,</i> and go through the-preliminary stage again before we can sit again for our examination?"<br/>
I think there is substance in the case put by those girls. Why should they go back to the lower standard of salary? We are urging them on to qualify for the higher standard. We are not disturbing the conditions of the examination. It is the same examination for everybody, but we say that it is right and reasonable that if a girl has gone through one year, or a year and a half or two years' preliminary training, and has attended her lectures, she should have some remission in the period of training if she intends to sit for her examination again. Not only have some girls sat for these examinations and failed.

Some of them have not sat for the examination at all. Some of them got married and are now back in nursing. Is it reasonable, is it just, that they should be asked to start <i>de novo,</i> go to the bottom of the class, so to speak, and start again? Of the 1,031 sample taken by the Royal College of Nursing, 634 had more than one year's student training, and had in addition sometimes three years' experience in a State hospital. We cannot ask those girls to go away back and begin again at the lower standard of salary and go through their lectures and so on again, that is, if we want nurses, and nurses are vital to us at this moment. [<i>Interruption.</i>] Yes, as a matter of fact I think there will be double these figures. We have over 2,000 of them. But the Royal College of Nursing itself&#x2014;it was not our test but theirs&#x2014;discovered that there were those figures of girls who had gone through the preliminary training to the extent of a year or more.</p>

<p>Yes, many of them are in emergency hospitals now. In reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Cheltenham (Mr. Lipson), I would point out that conditions are different in Scotland from what they are in England. They have been different since 1938. The evidence that was tendered to the Athlone Committee showed that a large number were qualified as assistant nurses in England, whereas in Scotland there were only 250. It is only since the war that this problem has arisen with us.</p>

<p>That is what I am trying to make clear. Please let me continue. We are not interfering one whit with the standards of examination. They have precisely the same standards of examination as those for student nurses. The only


concession offered in Clause 14 is a remission of the period of training. It is absolutely vital that the General Nursing Council should have power to fix a remission in the period of training, for good cause shown.</p>

<p>Certainly; there is complete reciprocity between the two sets of assistant nurses.

<p>Why did the Alness Committee's Report find only 250 nurses of a sub-standard who had initially started training for a State registration course, while the Royal College of Nursing discovered 950 in what they describe as only a sample? From where have the sudden additional figures come?</p>

<p>The answer is that the Alness Committee took its evidence in 1938, and that since 1938 there has been such an addition to the nursing profession that, obviously, the numbers of nurses known to the Royal College of Nursing have been greatly increased, The profession has been very badly organised, and it has been very difficult to get precise figures of any kind. I am only saying that the Royal College of Nursing figures themselves disclose these numbers to us. We are urging the nurses who can sit for these examinations to go on and do it. I trust that every effort will be made to encourage these girls. I think it is wrong for girls to be condemned to a sub-standard grade in the profession all their days and given no encouragement&#x2014;in fact, given great discouragement, because if they have to start <i>de novo</i> they come down to the student nurses' grade in salary. It is preposterous that we should do anything, in these days especially, to discourage girls who are willing to train themselves for the higher grades of the

profession. All we ask is that the General Nursing Council shall have power to make these rules. There is no deterioration whatever in the standards of examination. Once this rule is passed by the General Nursing Council, it has to be approved by the Secretary of State for Scotland, and it has to be laid on the Table of this House. More than that, under the principal Act these regulations of the General Nursing Council in Scotland have to be discussed with the General Nursing Council in England. Every possible attempt is being made to secure reciprocity. I am not wedded to the precise words in Clause 14. I propose, on the Committee stage, to suggest that the words:
<q>or have undergone training in order to such enrolment</q>
might with convenience be deleted&#x2014;although there are disadvantages in that also. I can appreciate the views of the assistant nurses who have already gone through the hoops of training, and who think that they alone should get the benefit of the proposed regulations. I can understand apprehension being excited by the words in the Clause empowering the General Nursing Council to make some remission in the training period of a nurse who has undergone no period of training as a State registered nurse. It may be possible to secure the object we have in view by making it clear that the Clause will apply to women who have been admitted to the role of assistant nurse and who have at some time undergone training for the State register.<br/>
There are other steps which will be required to make sure that we have adequate nursing facilities in Scotland. We have adequate beds, we have first-class hospitals now, but we are short of nurses. We are short of nurses for tuberculosis, for example.</p>

<p>Will the hon. Member let me get on with this point first? I know that there are a number of difficulties. I say only that we have, by and large, a sufficient number of beds, that we can treat tuberculosis patients in them, and that we have made arrangements to provide beds in our emergency hospitals without interfering in any way with the right of local authorities to run their own hospitals. We are discussing with certain voluntary hospitals how we can affiliate for training purposes some of our splendid emergency hospitals and rotate through two or more of these hospitals student nurses in the course of training. I would like to see more hostel accommodation, girls living out more than they do and less of the barrack room system. I would lake to see, if possible, encouragement given by bursaries, educational training and otherwise. I am not sure we shall not have to do something about the age at which a student must start.<br/>
The question of salaries and the differences between Scotland and England is a long and elaborate calculation, but I can say that not all the advantages are in favour of England. The staff nurse, for example, starts in Scotland at &#x00A3;100 per annum and in England at &#x00A3;100, but in Scotland she goes up &#x00A3;10 per annum to 1&#x00A3;120 after two years, whereas in England she goes up only &#x00A3;5 per annum to &#x00A3;140 in eight years, so that the Scottish nurse is &#x00A3;20 up by the time the fifth year is reached. Then the advantage declines, but it takes eight years before there is equality between the two nurses. There is time after eight years for us in Scotland to make certain that the two maxima are equated. In the meantime it is of the utmost importance that the lower stages should be such as to attract Scottish girls into the profession.<br/>
These, in the main, are the two points of difference between our Bill and the English Bill. The English Bill is bound to be on different lines from ours. The conditions are different, and I hope that after the explanation I have given on the two Clauses that we have had to vary from the English Bill, the House will see its way to give a general concurrence to the idea in this Bill and leave us to the Committee stage to see how far we can get agreement on these two vital points.</p>

<p>I rise for a few minutes in order to welcome this Bill

and to thank the Secretary of State for introducing it. The very full explanation he has given of the differences between this Bill and its English counterpart has been, I am sure, very much welcomed by the House. We wanted to have clearly put before us the reason for these differences. The limitation that is placed upon the period of qualification for this lower standard is a wise one It will be within the competence of the House when the end of the five years is reached, to extend the period it our expectations in that regard are not fully realised. It was, because of these differences, inevitable that there should be a separate Bill for Scotland and we are glad to have the opportunity of dealing with it. As the right hon. Gentleman says, the principal reason for the Bill is to give a proper standing to the assistant nurse position and to provide for the regulation of the arrangements in that connection. The Bill and what flows from it will place further considerable responsibility upon the General Nursing Council for Scotland and I am sure that that influential body will be glad to work the arrangements and set up the necessary standard in a way which will redound to the benefit of the nursing profession. As the Secretary of State has said, nurses are very important people indeed, especially in these days when we are becoming more and more conscious of the importance that health plays in the life of our country, and the establishment of proper arrangements in respect of the training of nurses certainly should take a very prominent part in our consideration of the matter.<br/>
Not only is the question of the status of these nurses important. The question of their remuneration is also important. The Secretary of State has made passing reference to the question of remuneration and we have had our attention drawn to this in very recent times by the publication of the two very valuable Reports from the influential Committee presided over by Professor Taylor. We have a set of standards set up for nurses right through the whole realm of that important profession up to the highest rank, which clearly indicates a great advance in recognition of what nurses are worth. We are, generally speaking, putting nurses on a comparative level with members of the teaching profession. That is all to the good and should enable us to improve the condi-


tions of nurses and encourage those who go in for the profession of nursing to make themselves efficient as quickly as possible in order that they may earn the greater rewards available for them in connection with this new improved rate of remuneration that has been brought forward.<br/>
I have had, Like other hon. Members, expressions of concern on the part of those who are interested in Clause 14, which the right hon. Gentleman has indicated he will be willing to modify when we come to the Committee Stage. All the apprehensions that I have had expressed to me in this regard are apprehensions that we might more profitably deal with on the Committee Stage and I propose to leave them until that time. The Secretary of State has given us an indication of what is in his mind on this matter and I am sure that we shall go into it more fully when we come to deal with the Clause on the Committee Stage.<br/>
This Bill represents another incursion by the right hon. Gentleman into the realm of health in Scotland. He has made other incursions into that realm without requiring the aid of legislation to enable him to do so. In many ways health services and facilities in Scotland have been transformed during the period of his occupancy of the position of Secretary of State for Scotland. I think my right hon. Friend is to be congratulated on that and on the developments that we see him obviously determined upon. My hon. Friend the Member for Gorbals (Mr. Buchanan) rather declaimed against the idea of uttering congratulations to the Secretary of State.</p>

<p>Yes, he expressed his gratification at what my right hon.

<p>&#x2014;posthumously on the great work he did while he was Secretary of State for Scotland. I think it is right

that we should take the opportunity while he is here, with a broken arm, and not a broken neck, to say how pleased we are at the way he is looking after our affairs in Scotland. This Bill is an indication of the way in which he looks after our affairs. I welcome it, congratulate my right hon. Friend on it and also offer him my congratulations on the work he is doing in the realm of health.</p>

<p>When the Bill connected with English nurses was passing through this House, I was approached by the senior members of the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh and also the Glasgow and Edinburgh branches of the Royal College of Nursing to see what was being done by the Minister with regard to the position of nurses in Scotland. I am glad to say that I found the Tight hon. Gentleman had the situation well in hand but his difficulties, which have not been confined to one sphere of legislation alone, were increased by the fact that a Committee which had investigated the matter had come to a decision somewhat different from that which he has just announced. Nevertheless, I think the Minister has produced a Bill which, from the general point of view, is admirable. There is no doubt whatever about the present shortage of nurses in Scotland; equally there is no doubt that that being the case, it is in the public interest that immediate steps should be taken to remedy matters. The Minister, as head of the Health Department for Scotland, has that responsibility and with his usual thoroughness he has taken the matter in hand.<br/>
Another question, however, which has to be faced is this: How is that shortage of nurses to be made up? It is inevitable that the ordinary course of nursing apprenticeship, if I may so put it, must receive some modification and that whatever happens, the standard of nursing must not be reduced. It is no good bringing into the profession nurses who are not up to the existing standards. What the Bill proposes to do is, first, to create a body of assistant nurses. I understand such nurses must pass a proper examination set by the General Nursing Council, and while I find difficulty in seeing how people who have not done the full course of nursing can pass this examination, _I feel that if that is to be the test, and the matter is left in the hands of the General


Council, there need be no apprehension. At any rate, I do not think the Minister can deal with the matter in any other way. But there is another proposal in this Bill which is creating difficulty. It is proposed that the number of State-registered nurses should be increased and in order to give effect to that increase, Clause 14 has been put into the Bill. As I said at the beginning of my speech I was consulted by the Glasgow and Edinburgh branches of the Royal College of Nursing particularly with regard to this Clause and I told them that they would be able to interview the Minister in Edinburgh. They did so and I hoped, knowing the Minister's fairness and tact, that he would be able to find some way out of the difficulty so that this Clause would not trouble us any longer. Since then I and other Members have received letters mentioning that this consultation had taken place, but pointing out that apprehension was still felt about the effect of this Clause.<br/>
One does not wish, on Second Reading, to go into unnecessary details but at the same time this Clause will require to be looked at very carefully and it will probably require considerable revision when we get to the Committee Stage. Personally, I cannot agree that the Clause is a good one; it is badly framed and I do not think it is clear in its results. I am not at all sure whether a better way out of the difficulty, having in mind the fact that we must maintain the standard of nursing, would not be to put the whole matter, without qualification, into the hands of the General Council and leave it to them to say who will be given facilities for coming into the profession as fully registered nurses, after a shorter period of training instead of trying to limit it to people who happen to be assistant nurses. As I say, I am not at all sure whether a better result would not be achieved by treating the matter broadly and leaving the question of how the reduction of the period of training is to be made, in the hands of the proper authorities. As the Clause stands it is imperative that there must be such a reduction. There is no option for the Council but to make a reduction. I have no doubt that the Minister will, as usual, give consideration to the views of the people who feel that they are affected and I hope he will see what can be done to overcome the difficulty. I leave the matter there having indicated that I still

think that the College of Nursing has definite grounds for apprehension. I certainly think the matter must be considered more fully.<br/>
There seem to be diverse views on whether one is to congratulate the Secretary of State or not. I think there is no doubt that he deserves the congratulations and thanks of Scotland, and of the nursing profession in particular. There are various ways of dealing with complaints. In the last war, when I joined a Scottish regiment and received a shilling a day for my services there was one occasion when we were not satisfied with the quantity of meat supplied. It seemed to contain rather an undue amount of bone. The sergeant major looked a kindly, genial man, not unlike the Secretary of State, so we took our grievance before him. The only consolation we got was, "When you have been longer in the Army you will realise that the meat that we get comes from a special kind of cow which has twice as much bone as any other." We did not go to him with any more complaints. The Secretary of State deals with complaints on a slightly different and improved basis, because he considers them and is always willing to meet anyone who has any point to raise and tries to get things straightened out. He has just had one real triumph and this is, relatively, a smaller matter, but we all know that he will deal with it in the same way. Accordingly, subject to what I have said, and in the hope and belief that those difficulties which I feel to exist with regard to Clause 14, will be cleared up in Committee, I commend the Bill to the House, and I offer my congratulations to the right hon. Gentleman.</p>

<p>The Secretary of State has been having so many bouquets thrown at him that perhaps a little cold douche will not do him any harm. For a very long time I have been interested in the conditions and wages not only of nurses but of women in industry generally. I do not think the nurses have anyone to thank for improving their conditions. It is only the fact that w<ob/> are not able to gct enough of them that has resulted in this House or anyone else doing much to improve their condition. As late as 1937, in the good old days when private Members had their chance on Fridays, a Bill was brought forward to limit the hours of nurses to 48. It was then stated that the scarcity of nurses


was such that we should not get them if we did not improve their conditions, in fact, that we did not deserve to get them. That modest Bill was defeated.</p>

<p>Yes, of course&#x2014;by something like II votes. There were a few on our side who did not bother to turn up. The Bill was voted down and nothing was done for the nurses. It is only since the shortage of nurses has become acute that the House has taken any interest in their wages and conditions. I am not going to congratulate my right hon. Friend or pat anyone on the back for doing anything for the nurses. It is the law of supply and demand which has resulted in nurses getting some measure of justice. I have heard to-day that at the time to which I refer there were only some 250 women in the nursing profession who had not qualified as State registered nurses. I do not know why the number should have gone up so much since then. I am beginning to wonder whether the standard of education is deteriorating, because we now find that a large proportion of the girls who go in for their examinations do not pass. I suggest that the Secretary of State should look to that point instead of lowering the standard for the nurses. It seems to me that it has been a very sudden conversion on his part which has led him to bring in this Bill. An article in the "Glasgow Herald," which I am sure was based on information given either by the Secretary of State or at any rate by the Scottish Office, said:
<q>It is the aim of the Secretary of State to safeguard the standards of the profession in Scotland and as also emphasised in the report by Lord Alness. There will be no creation of a sub-standard class of nurses for Scotland.</q>
I take it that we are not to have this particular type of assistant nurse introduced into the nursing profession. I believed that the new wages and the much better conditions and opportunities which are to be given to nurses under our new scheme would have attracted a sufficient number of women to carry on the profession. The report to which the article refers was only issued in April and, before we have had any opportunity of testing whether we might get a sufficient number of young women to come into the profession, we immediately bring forward a Bill which is going to dilute the industry. In the De-

bate on the English Bill I listened with amazement to speaker after speaker on all sides of the House, calmly arranging to dilute the industry without the consent of the people within it. I heard doctors speak on that occasion. There is a scarcity of doctors. I wonder how they would feel if we suggested assistant doctors who did not qualify in the same way as they had done. We know that we have doctors in training as well as nurses in training but, before they can qualify, surely they have to reach a particular standard of education?<br/>
Therefore, I say frankly to the Secretary of State that, although it may have been necessary, I am very disappointed that this Bill should have been brought in so quickly before we have decided whether we can get a larger number of nurses as a result of the improved conditions and wages that are being offered. I do not like to see the Scottish Secretary so slavishly following the English Minister of Health in bringing forward legislation. I thought, in view of his statement which was reported in the "Glasgow Herald," that he would not have brought in a Bill on these lines at the present time. It was rather misleading to suggest&#x2014;and it was suggested by the sponsors of the English Bill&#x2014;that this was a Bill to regulate and to prevent unqualified women from acting as nurses. It will not protect the public at all from the unqualified nurse for it regulates the assistant nurse and gives her the standing of a nurse. It may be true that some parts of nursing do not require such a high standard of training and qualifications as other parts, such as, for instance, the treatment of chronic cases. It is difficult to get people to go into hospitals for chronic cases, because that type of work is not so interesting as the care of cases where there may be a cure. I can understand the joy that a nurse or doctor has in looking after somebody who may be cured and seeing them walk out of the hospital better than when they came in. There is a hopefulness in that kind of work. In hospitals for chronic cases, however, the work is uninteresting, and although it may be very altruistic it becomes very tiresome. I can, therefore, understand the feeling of a nurse who does not want to go into a chronic hospital. The nurse for that type of work is the woman with a high standard of altruism which was characteristic of the nursing profession in the


older days and the difficulty will not be remedied by this attempt to bring in a sub-standard nurse.<br/>
We may be forced into having this Measure because we do not know how many nurses we may need during the war. If Europe becomes a shambles we shall want all the nurses we can get, whether trained or not. There seems to be a tendency to think that in future we are going to have hospitals all over the country with armies of nurses and doctors. That kind of prospect fills me with despair because I regard the appalling amount of ill-health that exists in the world as quite unnecessary. Any doctor will tell us that about 90 per cent. of the children who are born are born healthy and, given fair conditions of housing, food and so on, there is no need for this tremendous amount of ill-health. One thing that makes me almost despair is the way in which people accept this standard of ill-health as normal. It is not normal. I am in my sixties and have never been seriously ill, and I have not had an easy life. We want to teach people how to keep well, and that is not so very difficult. Some people accept a sub-standard of health and think that that is just as it should be. I do not think that, in future, we need have all these hospitals and nurses. I do not think we shall need such a tremendous number of nurses when the war is over as we improve housing and working conditions and teach people how to keep healthy. Much of the bad health now is due to bad conditions and the fact that people do not know how to keep themselves well.<br/>
I have spoken, so far, from the point of view of the nurse who is rather afraid of this dilution of her industry. She feels that at a time when she is secure with fairly decent wages and conditions we are going to bring in nurses of a lower standard which will lower the standard of the profession. There is a necessity for well-trained and intelligent women in the nursing profession because there have been great developments in treatment. The nurse to-day has to be a much more skilled person than she was in the old days, better treatment and all kinds of new treatment having been introduced in which the nurse has to be experienced. To lower the standard at such a time is a mistaken policy. I was really disappointed when I saw the Secretary of State so slavishly following the English Bill in this respect, in view

of the fact that a Scottish Committee has reported on the subject. This is the same Bill as the English Bill <i>plus</i> Clause 2, Sub-section (3) and Clause 14, which is contentious. I do not think anyone will object to Clause 2 (3), which says:
<q>Unless Parliament shall hereafter otherwise determine, nothing in rules made under this Section shall enable a course of training begun after the expiry of five years from the commencement of this Act to qualify any person for admission to the roll.</q>
I take it that that means that after five years this type of assistant nurse will cease 'to exist without the permission of Parliament. There is fear in the nursing profession about Clause 14. I do not take any exception to the spirit of it. I think that it is one of the most hopeful things with regard to the assistant nurse that she is to be provided with a ladder from which she can climb from the lower to the higher grade if she has ability and desires to do so. I am glad that the Secretary of State has decided to look into this Clause and see whether he can make it more acceptable to the nursing profession. I like the idea that if a student nurse is not successful in her examination or has not had the educational advantages that some of the other girls have had, she is not to be barred for ever from stepping up into the higher grade. I agree with the Secretary of State that after a girl has done a certain amount of training she should not be expected to start from scratch and that she should have some advantage because of her training. It would be for the Council to decide what that advanage should be, and that is where some different wording of the Clause is needed. It would be absurd to say to the girl who has had two years' hospital training that she must start from the beginning and work up. Therefore I do not object to the Clause as it stands. I do not object to the spirit of the Clause but I am glad that the Secretary of State is going to do something for that is the one Clause about which I have received representations from nurses in Scotland. Therefore, I do not suppose that I can oppose the Bill, but I hope they will be successful in providing a sufficiency of nurses and not lower the standard of the nursing profession.</p>

<p>It gives me a rather uncomfortable feeling to have to differ so sharply from my hon. Friend the Member for Springburn (Mrs. Hardie). I feel she does a disservice to this profession,


for whom she has already done so much work and for whom we all know she has a very high regard, when she talks of this Bill introducing an element of dilution. Indeed&#x2014;I am sure I will not be misunderstood&#x2014;I feel that the Secretary of State himself did not help matters when he chose this word "sub-standard" to describe this type of nurse. I know there are great difficulties here and that much thought has been spent by the Council to find the right description, but I think from the point of view of the profession and the confidence of the public we should stick rather closely to the word "assistant nurse" and leave it at that. They are not half-trained nurses; they are certainly not dilutees. I think the Member for Springburn does herself less than justice when she talks about this dilution, which inevitably means the introduction of a new element into the profession, whereas the problem the Secretary of State has to solve is how to protect his patients and organise his industry from an unorganised element which arithmetic has driven him to accept, and therefore, unlike my hon. Friend, I am not at all disappointed at the conversion of the Secretary of State to which she referred. It is not a position any of us accepted with any great glee, but if we were to be realistic about the situation, then we had to have a Bill more or less of this character.<br/>
I am concerned because I seem to see a conflict in the two substantial departures which my right hon. Friend has made in the Bill. When you have suffered so many Scottish Members to-day, Sir, it might be quite fitting for me to say in consolation eat I do not necessarily think that to follow an English example is necessarily bad. We should not immediately conclude that because it is an English Bill it is not a good Bill. I, like others, am glad of Clause 14. This Clause, I feel fairly certain, will give a stimulus to the assistant nurse and also will give some kind of professional dignity to this grade. At any rate I am certain that my hon. Friend who has just spoken is quite right when she says that it is good business and just and encouraging that women in the profession who have already given some service should have that service recognised and be left a device by which they can raise themselves, and that in itself, I should think, would be an enticement to any who may come into the pro-

fession as a war-time job and are not at all certain whether they are going to make it a life career or not.<br/>
But, unlike any other speaker in the Debate, I think this clashes sharply with the other difference between the Scottish and English Bills; that is, Clause 2. I dislike Clause 2 exceedingly and urge on the right hon. Gentleman that he is in a not negligible measure jeopardising the success of his efforts. This Sub-section provides that, unless Parliament decides otherwise, this grade of assistant nurse ceases to have new entrants in five years' time. Several speakers seem to have assumed that it meant the end of the assistant nurse. I cannot see how that can be. Having created your assistant nurse, you must allow her to retain her status, and therefore you must retain your roll, and you must also retain your grades, but I take it that the Secretary of State is saying to the girls of Scotland as he said in the conclusion of his speech, "Here is a difficult war-time situation. We have patients, we have hospitals, beds, we have equipment, we have not got nurses. Come in on this professional status of assistant nurse," and then, under the Sub-section he says, "But don't forget this is a rump profession, a profession I hope to see disappear." It is a profession that by this qualification we admit is a second best and a very poor second best. My hon. Friend quite properly sees the opportunity and says, "It is a very close second best." On the assumption that this is necessary, it will continue to be necessary. I say that although the hon. Member thinks it is undesirable, I think it is essential, and I think the Secretary of State thinks it is essential. I think the hon. Member is in a sense jeopardising the success of this regrading attempt.<br/>
Previous Members in this Debate, and in the Debate on the English Measure, pointed to the high standard of education needed to get a satisfactory entrance to the top grade of the profession just now. One of the necessities for accepting this assistant grade lies in the fact that there are, once you have deducted your teaching quota, insufficient girls coming from our Scottish secondary schools to-day to meet even recruitment needs.<br/>
The last speaker said that she hoped to see the great need for hospitals disappear. So do we all, and not one of us would disagree with her sentiments when


she says that we ought to transfer our energies to the positive aspect of health and teach the people how to live. I hope we are going to do that, and that it will have an effect upon those who are still at school, but we still have with us other generations of those who have not had that instruction, and so I say, in spite of the developments of medical science which some of us anticipate and many of us hope for, that within the next 30 or 40 years we can expect no diminution in the number of beds needed and the necessary professional attendance. That, I most seriously argue, rather disposes of the need for this Sub-section. I am going to make a concession to the "diehards" of the Alness Committee. I know privately that the Secretary of State does not accept the opinions held by the Committee, but I am afraid, despite the tributes already paid to them, it is to be feared that they made no very keen research into the arithmetic of even the 1938 situation.<br/>
Shortly, if there is to be this continued need the Secretary of State should not jeopardise his scheme by stigmatising this new grade of nurses as a war-time, rump profession. Let me call the attention of the right hon. Gentleman to Clause 5, in which he provides machinery for an appeal to the Court of Session. I can hardly expect the law officers within the Ministry to agree with me, but I think it might be cheaper, and it certainly would be quicker, if one could provide some court of arbitration within the Nursing Council to which these appellants might go. With these three qualifications I, like all other hon. Members who have spoken to-day, very gladly support the Bill, and if I do not throw any bouquets it is not because they are not undeserved but because I think the Secretary of State, like you yourself, Sir, must by this time be rather tired of Scottish voices to-day.</p>

<p>I rise first to thank the Secretary of State for the concession he has made in regard to Clause 14 in saying that before we reach the Committee stage he will look into the matter very carefully and see if the way is clear to meet some of the representations which have been made to him. This Bill must indeed be welcome to Scotland by bringing about better regulations for the nursing profession than obtain at present. I am glad to know, also, that the Secretary of State is well aware that

in providing nurses for the ills that visit the human race he is at the same time taking steps to reduce as far as possible the causes of the various diseases which have such disastrous effects industrially and socially. I do indeed welcome the broad-minded and energetic way in which the Secretary of State, and if I may say so his assistant, have tackled this matter, and, speaking for my constituency, I welcome indeed the efforts he is putting forward.</p>

<p>I would like to allude in the first place to certain remarks made by the hon. Lady the Member for Springburn (Mrs. Hardie), and I would like to agree with her very whole-heartedly in the matter of the pay and conditions of the nurses, which for far too long have been far less than they deserve, and I do not know that even now they are sufficiently high for the amount of work, the amount of training and the amount of responsibility which nurses take on their shoulders. But when the hon. Lady came to speak of the Bill as not regulating the nursing profession, then I parted company with her, because it seems to me that that is one thing that this Bill does do. As I understand the situation at this time, it is that we have a considerable number of people, some 2,000 of them my right hon. Friend tells me, who are called nurses and yet may have no experience whatever. So far as I understand it, the purpose of this Bill is to take these in and make them assistant nurses if they have the necessary qualifications to have that title applied to them. I think, along with all those hon. Members who have spoken, that this Bill should most certainly receive its Second Reading, because after all its purposes are that these assistant nurses should, if they are worthy of it, be given a recognised status, and, secondly, it is designed to protect the nursing profession and the public from persons with little or no training.<br/>
The only representation I have had made to me in connection with this Bill is in regard to Clause 14. We have had a very definite assurance from my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, in his opening speech, to the effect that this would in no way lower the qualifications which were required in connection with one becoming a State registered nurse, and that, I think, should go far to calm


or relieve the anxiety of those who feel on this matter. I think there is a certain amount of misapprehension likely to crop up here. The Clause refers to a reduction in the period of training, but where we are at a misunderstanding, I think, is that surely the period of training which is referred to in the Clause is that prescribed in a hospital to enable one to qualify as a State registered nurse. Today particularly there are very many people who are nursing, who are getting experience, who are getting training under State registered nurses, but who would not qualify as having entered on this prescribed course of training which is laid down. These people should have an opportunity after qualifying as State registered nurses. The Bill does not mean that their whole period of service is being reduced; it does not mean that they are really getting off any lighter. It means that experience that they have gained outside the prescribed course is, under certain conditions, to be allowed to count. There are women who, perhaps being a little young, instead of starting straight off in one of our big training hospitals, have gone into some of the big training homes, in Glasgow and elsewhere. They have spent perhaps two, three or four years there; they are acknowledged by the medical officers who attend those homes to be first-class nurses; but they cannot get their State registration unless they go back to the beginning and work up afresh. In so far as Clause 14 allows people like that to get a remission of time, it is all to the good.<br/>
I personally welcome this Bill. I think that, following on the assurance we have had from the Secretary of State, the fears which have been expressed as to the prestige of the nursing profession being lowered are unfounded. But I would like to put one point to my right hon. Friend. Clause 14 gives no indication that the standard of the examination is to be maintained. He has given us his assurance, but it is not in the Bill. I think that, with very little difficulty, words could be added to the Clause which would make the position absolutely watertight. I would ask him to consider that before the next stage, and to see what can be done.</p>

<p>It seems to me that if the Secretary of State

had slavishly followed the English Bill, he would have had the Second Reading before now. The only objections are to the innovation which he has made. Clause 2, Sub-section (3), which he has introduced into the Bill, has resulted in a good deal of discussion. I am inclined to disagree with the Secretary of State on that Sub-section. In this matter we are legislating in the dark. We do not know where we are in regard to this profession. There must be a considerable army of nurses who are being retained for special duties in connection with military operations. We do not know when the war will end, and I do not disagree with the five years' limit in the Clause. Surely, before five years are over we shall be out of our present difficulties, although we may be in other difficulties. We shall be through the war, I hope and expect; and we may have a very large army of fully-trained nurses to staff all the hospitals that we require. Of course, if what my hon. Friend the Member for Spring-burn (Mrs. Hardie) envisages takes place, and we are going to have a shambles in Europe&#x2014;</p>

<p>Yes, we might. Then we might have thousands, or tens of thousands, of mutilated men on our hands for years, and there is no saying what nursing assistants we may require. But I think the Secretary of State is wise in laying down this limit of five years for this class of assistant nurses to come along and qualify. The nursing profession is a very important one, both in peace and in war. I very largely agree with many of the sentiments expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Springburn that if we could get our people educated to lead healthier lives, we would not require so many hospitals and nurses, but we do require them. This is a most important service, which occasionally arouses the admiration of everybody in the country. Recently we had an outbreak of smallpox in Scotland, and we had nurses who volunteered to undertake nursing duties in those circumstances. The girls who go into smallpox hospitals and undertake that disagreeable work are heroines. There is also the question of tuberculosis, and there are nurses in our sanatoria doing most valuable work. Women who are engaged on work of that kind are really entitled not only to decent


conditions, but to adequate remuneration as well. While it may be true that the remuneration of nurses in Scotland will be improved as compared with that in England, I am not going to say that their remuneration is greater than the services they render.<br/>
I am not inclined to quarrel with the two changes the Secretary of State has made with regard to the Bill. I think that there should be a limit to the period in question, and I think he has fixed a reasonable one in making it five years. I agree again with him in the line be has taken in being prepared to look at Clause 14 to see that the standard of training is not reduced to such a point as to be a danger to the profession. If these two points are met, there is no reason why this Bill should not speedily go on to the Statute Book and help to improve the conditions for nurses in Scotland.</p>

<p>I do not intend to take up more than a few moments of the time of the House, as I have already inflicted myself on the House on the previous Measure. I only want to reinforce what has been said by my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries (Sir H. Fildes) and indeed the sentiments which have been echoed by every Member who has spoken, including the Secretary of State, with regard to the importance of Clause 14. The hon. Member for Dunfermline (Mr. Watson) said that if the Secretary of State had slavishly followed the English Bill, we might have had this Measure through the House in a very few minutes. We Scottish Members have had a great number of postal communications in the last few days in regard to this Clause, in dealing with which the Secretary of State, in opening the Debate, devoted so much time. His speech, as previous speakers have made clear, has gone a very long way towards removing doubts and misgivings which were in the minds of many of us owing to the communications we have received in the past few days from many in the nursing profession who thought that in some way or other they were likely to suffer by this Clause as at present drafted. Of course, we know that the Scottish Office in promoting this Bill, just like the Ministry of Health in promoting the Measure which this House disposed of a few weeks ago, in no way wishes to jeopardise, interfere or hinder those who are engaged in this great profession of nursing. This

Measure is designed to place the nursing profession in a position of even greater efficiency than obtains at the present time. The Minister has indicated that he is willing to meet in every way possible between now and the Report stage the fears which have been expressed by so many in the nursing profession with regard to Clause 14.<br/>
The hon. Member for Dunfermline alluded to the position of nurses in the present war and said we do not know the day or hour when their services, owing to. military operations, may not be utilised in a way in which they have not been utilised during the last three and a half years. It was right that he should draw attention to that in order that in no way whatever, so far as is reasonably possible, should anybody in the profession suffer, as they think they may suffer under Clause 14 as it at present stands. Personally, I feel that the Minister and those associated with him in the Scottish Office realise to the full the importance of not hindering or obstructing this noble and sacred profession, but of helping forward in every way possible this work of love and mercy.</p>

<p>This Bill has had a certain amount of criticism directed against it and in some quarters has been received with anxiety. I have shown the Minister petitions which I have had from nurses serving in infirmaries in the City of Glasgow, to which there were a large number of signatures. These nurses are vitally interested in reciprocity and in Clause 14 and while I do not propose to elaborate the provisions of this Clause, I want to emphasise to the Minister the keen interest that these nurses are taking in it. They fear that the status of nurses will be lowered. Anything the Minister does to raise the status of the nursing profession will, I am sure, have the support of the House; anything he does to lower it will meet with definite criticism. I do not think, however, that there is any reason to fear that the general status of the profession will be lowered by this Bill.<br/>
The Minister said that there were 2,000 assistant nurses and that a sample of them had been taken by the General Nursing Council. I would like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary what arrangements are being made for training centres. From the Alness period until now there


has been a very considerable increase in the number of available nurses. It is evident that many training centres must be created. If they have been created, I should be glad to know where they are. I want to congratulate the Minister on bringing in this Bill, which I am sure will be for the general welfare of the nursing profession.</p>

<p>I think the Debate has really proved that there is an earnest desire on the part of the House, and particularly of Scottish Members, to see this Bill speedily on the Statute Book. I can assure hon. Members that there is no intention in any way to reduce the standard or the qualifications of those who are engaged, or to be engaged, in the nursing profession. The Bill in no respect seeks to dilute the profession. Its primary purpose is not to increase the numbers of those in the profession but to see that only those who have been trained and have the qualification can in future use the term "nurse" and that those who are not so trained and qualified cannot mislead sick persons who require competent attention. There is no intention to reduce the status, training or qualifications of the nursing profession. I think the Debate has also conclusively proved that we have not slavishly followed the provisions of the English Bill. The main Debate has been on Clauses 2 and 14, and I think that, of itself, refutes the suggestion. Some Members have indicated that they dislike Clause 2. Whether the need is with us five years hence, because of the shortage of nurses, to continue assistant nurses, or rather to continue recruiting them, will be for Parliament to decide, because Clause 2 makes it perfectly clear that the roll of assistant nurses can be added to only during the five years and that it will cease to be further made up at the end of five years, unless Parliament otherwise determines.</p>

<p>No. Additions will not take place. Whether the need exists at the

end of five years will be considered by whoever may then be responsible for dealing with these problems. The aim and object of the Bill is to keep up the standard of the nursing profession. We are not anxious to have assistant nurses as such, but we want to give them an opportunity. There are five years in which they can get their training and qualify. We are very hopeful that the improved conditions in the nursing profession will attract the nurses that we require to meet the problems that are arising, because the need for nurses will be greater in future if we are to have a comprehensive health service and a comprehensive medical service. If we are to work on one of the basic assumptions of the Beveridge Report, which incidentally was accepted by the Government&#x2014;that of a comprehensive health service&#x2014;we shall require more and more nurses. We have taken the right step to attract an increased number by the improvement in salaries which were recommended by the Taylor Committee. Some of those recommendations will be found on page 23 of the Committee's second report. The recommendations on conditions of hours and employment will be found on page 19. These recommendations, so far as salaries are concerned, bring the nursing profession in some respects almost alongside the teaching profession. If we want to attract larger numbers of the type of individual we want in the nursing profession, we must improve the conditions of employment and the scale of salaries. We have been trying to do so. We have advised the local authorities that we will meet 50 per cent. of the increased costs that will fall on them, to enable them to pay the increased salaries recommended by the Taylor Committee. I have made it clear that Clause 2 can be reconsidered by Parliament, but we limit its operation just now for five years.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1943-05-27a.1844.0" speakerid="unknown" speakername="Mr. McNeil" colnum="1844" time="">
<p>Sub-section (3) of Clause 2 provides that no one undertaking training after the five years shall be added to the roll, but elsewhere the Bill provides for reciprocity with the English and Northern Ireland roll, if it is created. Are we to exclude English or Northern Ireland assistant nurses, who commence training after that date? If you are not going to exclude them you will have to add to the roll.</p>

<p>Some of these intricate points are better debated on the Committee stage. All the points raised on Second reading will be considered between now and the Committee stage with a view to a proper reply being given to them.<br/>
Clause 14 is the only other really contentious Clause, but the Secretary of State has already made it clear that he is prepared lu reconsider the drafting. Let me again emphasise the fact that the main purpose of this Bill is to protect the general public against the unqualified nurse. The purpose of setting up a register is to see that the person who calls for a nurse will be sure, if the term "nurse" is used, that they have a properly qualified person to look after them. I think it will be admitted that the general public are frequently unaware of the distinction between the registered nurse and someone who merely calls herself a nurse. This will be obviated if this Bill is placed on the Statute Book and the register is set up as suggested by the Bill. Then Clause 6 provides that no other than a registered nurse or enrolled assistant nurse will be accepted with certain exceptions. This will definitely improve the status of the profession.<br/>
So far as the point made by the Member for Cathcart (Mr. F. Beattie) is concerned, it is perfectly true that the demands for nurses will increase when war ends, if we are to have a comprehensive health service. Nursing personnel will be required for the extended medical hospital and public health services we are now planning. Casualties now being treated oversea will have to be brought home and nurses will also be needed for work in the liberated countries. The women doing temporary war nursing will have to be replaced. Some important steps have already been taken to increase the number of women available for nursing. In the first place, I have already indicated that, in order to make the profession more attractive, we have accepted the recommendations of the Taylor Committee, so far as the conditions of employment in the service of nursing are concerned. I want to express appreciation of the work done by the Committee and to thank Professor Taylor and his associates for their services. We have commended these reforms to the employing authorities and undertaken to pay 50 per cent. towards the cost of the salary increases.</p>

<p>I think it does, but I will make sure and tell my hon. and gallant Friend exactly what the position is. I understand that we are prepared to make them apply to the voluntary hospitals.<br/>
The quickest way of obtaining nurses for immediate needs is to draw on the available trained women who are not at present in the profession and, with this in view, all persons between the ages of 18 and 60 years of age who are at present engaged in nursing or have at any time been so engaged for a period of six months, were registered in April this year. The National Advisory Council for the recruitment and distribution of nurses and midwives, recently appointed by the Minister of Labour and National Service, are to advise on how women selected for nursing after interview, can best be used in the present emergency. Then we propose to draw the attention of education authorities to the increased shortage of nurses and ask them afresh, to interest suitable girls in secondary schools in undertaking pre-nursing courses. We also propose to urge local authorities, if this Bill becomes an Act of Parliament, to provide and, by every means stimulate, interest in pre-nursing courses and continuation classes, and also to ask for further pre-nursing courses at central institutions. We are now carrying through negotiations with the hospital authorities for the purpose of providing the necessary training facilities to enable us to give the proper training to those who are recommended.</p>

<p>We have had negotiations with the voluntary hospitals.

Having pointed out these things, I am sure that I am voicing the views of the Secretary of State when I say that he is deeply indebted to the House for the manner in which it has received this Bill and for the helpful Debate that we have just had. We shall go to the Committee Stage

<p>If we ourselves have neglected to debate and sort out our ideas in good time before the peace, the net result could be disagreement between the Allies when Germany could emerge the main beneficiary. Germany is the cauldron of world trouble. In less than a century she has been responsible for five major wars. Again and again when the world was settling down to happier times, everything has been upset by the inbred aggressiveness of the Teutons. In her inglorious history Germany has demonstrated that the reason for her existence is war. The German Empire always has been, and always will be, thoroughly bad and a menace to civilisation.<br/>
There is a growing school of thought in this country, a particular school of thought led by Lord Vansittart, whose realisation of this is as practical as their solution is impracticable.</p>

<p>I am coming to that in a minute. Their policy of preventing the Germans from starting yet another war is to educate them so that they will be good boys in the future. I appreciate the fact that the Minister of Education is here to-day, and I am hoping that he is at this stage thinking about who is going to educate a matter of 80,000,000 embittered people. What a fantastic job, to attempt to educate a whole race to be peaceful, a race that for centuries has had the instinct for war


deep down in its nature. That instinct was even further ingrained by the humiliation and desire for revenge after the last war. How much more will it be ingrained after their defeat in this war. I believe it would be much easier to educate 80,000,000 baboons to give up baboon instincts.<br/>
If the tables were turned, do these Vansittart wishful thinkers imagine that the Nazis would be able to eradicate British instincts from Britishers? The Nazis were not going to be such fools as to try anything so impossible. They have the simpler plan of making the British Empire a part of the German Empire, when Germans would rule us and be constantly on the spot to see that no major trouble was caused. There is yet another school of thought to which I desire to draw the attention of the House, which concerns itself with post-war Germany. It has recently come into the limelight. It is made up of a group of Members of both Houses of Parliament, and, although Lord Vansittart is supposed to be connected with the group, I have not noticed that his name appears in their manifesto, with that of the hon. Member for Kidderminster (Sir J. Wardlaw-Milne) and other responsible sponsors. I also notice that this group avoided stressing the policy of "educating" the Germans. One is further heartened by hearing from them in that manifesto that
<q>a condition of peace must be the certainty that Germany shall not be in a position again to launch aggressive wars on the world.</q>
The group's main plan for ensuring that comes, so far as I can see, under the following heading:
<q>Germany shall be allowed no Army, Navy or Air Force until the Allied Nations decide otherwise.</q>
That looks very fine in print; but what happens if in, say, 20 years' time we get a Government in this country which, oblivious to the lessons of the past, weakly decides that the poor Germans shall no longer be suppressed; and if at that time, or even earlier, America gets bored by her European commitments, or it the Russians happen during that long intervening period to be at variance with the English-speaking nations? It is no good for an hon. Member to say that that is absurd, because it is exactly what happened after the last war, and if it could happen then, there is no reason why it should not happen again.

Therefore, I feel justified in saying that there is only one reasonably certain way of preventing Germany from starting another war, and I am very relieved to see that the group to which I have just referred has already take a big step in the right direction. They are already prepared&#x2014;again according to their manifesto&#x2014;to take away from Germany East Prussia&#x2014;for they say it never should have been a part of Germany&#x2014;and a large part of Western Germany&#x2014;understandable because that territory is made up of all those strategic Rhine Provinces. I wonder whether there are many Members of this House who noticed that only the other day Mr. J. E. Davies, a former United States Ambassador to Moscow, who I believe is there now, who is considered by a great number of people to be one of the greatest authorities on Russia, and who is esteemed by many Russians, said:
<q>After the war the Russians would naturally want back the territory that had been taken away from them by force after the last War.</q>
I would ask the House to notice those words, "after the last war," for I find that there is considerable ignorance as to the extent of the Russian territory which was lost to them after the last war. Alhough I am aware that the majority of Members of this House would know about it, it might interest quite a number of people outside to learn that territory Russia lost after the last war comprised practically the whole of Poland. Therefore, I think one is entitled to say, "If the Russians insist on that, what then is going to happen to Poland?" The Russians have already hinted in no uncertain way that after this war there is nothing to prevent Poland from being resurrected &#x2014;that is to say, the major part of Poland &#x2014;on former German territory. Actually the term used was, "The Poles could go West." But as that expression has a rather different meaning in this country very likely from what it has in Russia, I choose to put it in another way.<br/>
Anyhow, we have to face up to this situation, that it may come to this, that unless at the end of hostilities we intend to fight the Russians, we may have to take their advice about Polish frontiers. Assuming that something like that which I have envisaged comes about&#x2014;</p>

<p>The hon. and gallant Member said that most of Poland was taken over by the


Russians. I thought that Poland was allotted practically equally between Russia and the dual Government of Austro-Hungary and Germany.</p>

<p>I think that the hon. Member very likely misunderstood what I said. What I was attempting to convey to the House was the fact that it has been suggested that Russia would desire to have back those territories that -she possessed before the last war, and I was pointing out to the House that if all the United Nations agreed to that after the war, it would mean that practically all that territory which between the last war and this had been Poland's would go back to Russia.<br/>
If that occurs, such a slice out of Germany which would have to take place if the Poles were compensated in the manner suggested, together with the cutting off of East Prussia and a large portion of West Germany, as suggested by this influential group of British politicians, would not leave very much of Germany. I believe it has been demonstrated by the hacking up after the last war that if one takes away the limbs of a country, it is more humane, and it is certainly safer in the case of Germany, to obliterate the trunk as well.<br/>
The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster&#x2014;and I seem to feel that there were not many Members of the House who noticed it, otherwise there would have been some question in the House&#x2014;said, recently, according to the Press:
<q>Whatever else was the result of this war, let us make sure there will be no more German nation.</q>
I say quite deliberately that, in my opinion, he is right. Why not this time make a thorough job of it? Let us stop playing about with these theoretical and complicated palliatives which have been put forward by these various well-meaning groups of idealists. I personally am concerned about my two young sons, and I know there is only one sure way of preventing Germans of the future killing our children, and that is, by adopting the simple and straightforward policy of "No more Germany, no more war."
I am filled with apprehension, for I see these idealists in our midst getting dangerously busy again. May I remind this House that it was a mixture of idealism

and complacency that encouraged us after the last war to get slack with Germany? Our weak tolerance at that time has been rewarded by an exhibition of ruthless barbarism unprecedented in the history of the world. There have been mass murder from the air, the organised starvation of whole communities, bestiality towards little children and wholesale massacres. Germany&#x2014;and I stress as a country&#x2014;must no longer exist. This war is the culminating, grandiose atrocity by which she has not only forfeited her right to nationhood but has forfeited any right to a place in civilisation. This time we cannot afford any weakness; this time stark realism must guide us.</p>

<p>The hon. and gallant Gentleman comes here and makes a speech which cannot have anything but the worst possible import. What he says in this House goes out to the world. Every phrase he uses about postwar problems is sent by various means of publicity, through the ether maybe or the Press, to the Poles in this country and to the Russians in Russia&#x2014;to many peoples occupied with their various problems and who may be distraught beyond measure at the progress of the war in this or that direction. Yet the hon. and gallant Member thinks he can come here and give the House a dissertation in armchair strategy and by doing so seek to ameliorate present or future conditions. I would


like to ask him, How dare he come here and make the type of speech he has just made?</p>

<p>Certainly he has the right to make the kind of speech he likes, but at any rate he is most unwise and wholly wrong in coming down to this House to get the tremendous publicity with which is associated any speech made in this Chamber and making the kind of speech he has just made and giving vent to the sort of views he has given vent to.</p>

<p>Just because the Noble Lord is bare of any constructive ideas of his own, is that any reason why he should resent the constitutional rights of other Members or try to prevent them from putting forward what they sincerely believe to be the best for the country?

<p>The hon. and gallant Gentleman who raised this matter gave notice of his intention to do so to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, who is unfortunately not able to be present, and, in view of the fact that one of the matters to which he wished to draw attention related to the question of education on the international plane, my right hon. Friend asked me if I would say a few words on the subject in reply to what the hon. and gallant Gentleman had to put forward. In regard to the exchanges that have taken place and some of the wider observations on world events and strategy which have been brought up, I had better adhere to my own subject and leave those questions either to personal conflict afterwards when we rise or to the wiser deliberations of the statesmen who are responsible for those particular subjects. I should not regret reverting for a moment to those happy pursuits which used to engage me when I was at the Foreign Office, but I had better adhere now to the studies in which I am engaged. My own particular responsibility in this matter has been to take the chair at a conference which I called of the Allied Ministers of Education to examine the question how far education can help us in the immense tasks which lay before us at the conclusion of the war. The four meetings we have held so far have shown that there is a great opportunity for education to enlarge its sphere and to lay some of that basis of understanding without which any superstructure, either political or economic, cannot in future be properly erected. I think that some of our misfortunes and difficulties before were due to the fact that we were not based on proper foundations. That is why this subject of international understanding and the possibility of cultural conventions or treaties of understanding between nations being precedent to political understanding, which I am exploring with my colleagues the Ministers of Education, is one which I think may have fruitful results. If as a result of the hon. and gallant Member's initiative I can acquaint the House with these attempts, I shall have done something useful. We shall continue in our work, but we cannot do so in a hurry.

When we come to the question of the re-education of Germany, we come to a subject on which I have time to say a few short and sharp words. In my opinion and in the general opinion of my colleagues, the best way to start the reeducation of Germany is to show the enemy what things she cannot do. That can best be done by the imposition of an overwhelming military defeat upon Germany so that she may learn once and for all that those evil doctrines which have inspired her philosophy and her leaders for so many years and have had such terrible results shall not be able to occur again. Therefore, I would say without hesitation that as a preliminary to the question of how to re-educate an enemy country, and in particular Germany, there is no hesitation in this country or among the United Nations in saying that a complete and unconditional surrender must precede any such attempt. While we should teach first of all that war does not pay, we should also be wise to realise that the re-education of the people comes better from inside that people themselves. When I examine such excellent documents as the First Report of the Joint Commission of the London International Assembly and the Council for Education in World Citizenship, I would only draw that document to the attention of the House and ask it to study it. But I would warn the House that it would be advisable, in considering the question of imposing an external educational <i>r&#x00E9;gime</i> upon a defeated country, rather to approach the question from the angle in which I have approached it, namely, that we have to teach that nation that the philosophy of war, the philosophy of the <i>Herrenvolk,</i> does not and never will pay. We have then to attempt to eliminate within that country the evil forces, evil doctrines and evil influences that have brought about that philosophy. We may then hope eventually to start such a leaven within the country that a real self-education and re-education arises. I believe that is the only way, starting with an overwhelming defeat, to ensure the re-education of an enemy country.</p>
