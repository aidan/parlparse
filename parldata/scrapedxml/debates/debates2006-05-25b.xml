<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-05-25b.1675.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1497" speakername="Paul Holmes" colnum="1675"  time="013:48:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060525/debtext/60525-0010.htm#06052526000525">
	<p pid="b.1675.0/1">I, too, have one or two issues to raise in this Adjournment debate. Although they are based on constituency examples, each one is part of a national trend. I am sure that hon. Members present will nod in recognition of the issue that they too have in their constituency. They may disagree on how to deal with the problem, but almost everyone present will share it.</p>
	<p pid="b.1675.0/2">The first one is in connection with the national health service. Tomorrow I have my usual Friday afternoon constituency surgery. One of the people who has booked in to see me is a ward sister from Chesterfield's Royal hospital. She is one of 133 people in her position at the hospital who were summoned in on Tuesday last week to be told by hospital management that their jobs were being restructured and that they could all reapply for them, but that over the next few months one third of them would lose their jobs. In short, 43 ward sisters are going to be made redundant. The hospital is well run, and hopes to manage the process without too much stress and pain by absorbing the cuts in its normal nursing staff turnover of 8 per cent. a year, through natural wastage and turnover rather than compulsory redundancies, although in the end that method may have to be used. None the less, 43 ward sisters will lose their jobs in Chesterfield over the next year.</p>
	<p pid="b.1675.0/3">The hospital is undertaking a similar exercise by making an analysis of other staff sectors to try to shed jobs to save money. The House can imagine the trauma facing 133 ward sisters who have been told that a third of them will lose their jobs and that more job cuts will follow in other parts of the hospital.</p>
	<p pid="b.1675.0/4">Why is the hospital in that position? It seems to have done everything that the Government wanted since 1997. The hospital became a trust. I do not support trusts; I opposed the hospital's move to trust status at the time, for the same reasons as I opposed the concept of school trusts in the Education and Inspections Bill. Introducing free-market, cut-throat competition is not the way to improve or deliver health services or to educate our children. However, my local hospital became a trust, as the Government wanted, and it has been incredibly successful.</p>
	<p pid="b.1675.0/5">In each of the past three years, the hospital was awarded three stars by the Government&mdash;the top rating. Last year, it was also commended as the top hospital in the east midlands&mdash;the best in five counties. Since 1997, it has done everything that the Government wanted, so the job losses that are being imposed are not the fault of the hospital management nor of the excellent NHS staff who are hitting every target, even after the introduction of competition. The chief executive told me recently about the worry of losing patients to NHS providers elsewhere and to private sector treatment centres such as the one at Barlborough, just outside my constituency.</p>
	<p pid="b.1675.0/6">The hospital has made further improvements in departments that were already doing extremely well, such as ophthalmology. It can now treat more patients, to the benefit of the Chesterfield Royal but at the expense of other hospitals in the area which will lose patients and income, and thus face even greater problems, which is why I opposed trusts in the first place.</p>
	<p pid="b.1675.0/7">The hospital has done everything it was asked, and done it extremely well, yet now people will have to be sacked, and services for the people of Chesterfield will be reduced. Why? The hospital was expecting a cut of 1.7 per cent. in the tariff for providing medical services; in effect, that was the Gershon efficiency review saving that public bodies in general, including my local council, were expected to make on a yearly basis. However, at the last minute the calculations were abandoned and the Government told the hospital that the tariff reduction, or the cut in funding, would be2.5 per cent. Even worse than that last-minute increase in the deficit, the hospital was told that there would be a special technical adjustment to the tariff of another 2.5 per cent. In the space of only three or four weeks, a good, well-funded, well-organised and efficient hospital went from planning for a managed efficiency saving of 1.7 per cent. to trying to cope with a 5 per cent. cut in its funding.</p>
	<p pid="b.1675.0/8">That situation has been mirrored across the country, on a much bigger scale in some areas. Figures released today show that 12,000 job losses have been announced in the NHS since <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-01">1 March</phrase> alone, which makes the 43 announced so far in Chesterfield look quite small, although it is no comfort to those who are losing their jobs in Chesterfield that health trusts elsewhere, including areas close to Derbyshire, are suffering much greater losses imposed at only a few weeks' notice.</p>
	<p pid="b.1675.0/9">The situation is the result of the Government's rushed introduction of market-based competition and their insistence on hospitals hitting centrally imposed targets on waiting lists, whatever the financial cost. Trusts are reaping the whirlwind because they have overspent in various sectors to enable the Government to hit their targets. Reform has been forced through at breakneck pace to hit the appropriate media headlines and to help create the Prime Minister's legacy.</p>
	<p pid="b.1675.0/10">The same is happening in other parts of the NHS, such as dentistry. A stream of people have visited my constituency surgeries or written to me over recent months to tell me that it is impossible to find a dental practice in Chesterfield that will take on new NHS patients. After the introduction of the new contract, several dentists have completely opted out and no longer treat NHS patients. About half the people of Chesterfield were not enrolled with an NHS dentist and the figures have got worse over the past two months. It appears that they will get even worse over the next year. Again, that situation is common throughout the country.</p>
	<p pid="b.1675.0/11">It is time for a long-term, sensible planning regime in the health service, rather than emergency cuts. We should put a brake on this disastrous process and pause a while to consider what is being done to the NHS. Meanwhile, NHS staff in Chesterfield and elsewhere need reassurance about the job losses they face at present, and those in the pipeline for later in the year, which threaten them even though they are absolutely blameless and have done everything asked of them by the Government.</p>

	<p pid="b.1680.0/1">I am not sure that Ministers would go down to the wire on that. As that was said in the meeting that I attended, it was a sop to the Labour members of the Defend Council Housing group who were there. It was as if they were saying, &quot;It's okay. You don't need to worry. It's for a good reason.&quot; I am not sure whether, if one followed the small print, that would be how the decision was justified. As I say, it seems inexplicable that, last year alone, Chesterfield lost &pound;9.2 million from its council tenants&mdash;from right-to-buy money and from rents. If Chesterfield borough council had half that money every year, we would not have a problem with housing people in Chesterfield. Instead, the waiting lists get longer. Whenever that is explained, people cannot understand the logic of a Labour Government following such policies. I know that many Labour Members agree with what I am saying.</p>
	<p pid="b.1680.0/2">There is a fourth option, which is Liberal Democrat policy and Labour party policy. The Labour party reaffirmed the policy of equal access to funding for all councils and council tenants at the last Labour conference and the one before that. However, the Labour Government have reaffirmed each time that they will take no notice whatsoever of their own members or their own conference, and will carry on with their divisive, iniquitous and socially unfair set of policies.</p>
	<p pid="b.1680.0/3">I could bring up many other issues, but I have an eye on the time and bearing in mind that there are lots of other Members who wish to speak, I will not. I will mention one issue in passing. I had the privilege of taking part in an Adjournment debate on Tuesday, which was held by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1536" name="Patrick McLoughlin">the right hon. Member for West Derbyshire (Mr. McLoughlin)</phrase>, on the forced, compulsory merger of police forces to make an east midlands police force. I do not need to go into the details again because I went through them on Tuesday. I will simply summarise and say that we are seeing the merger of five county police forces into one super-force. That is happening all over the country. There was a sham consultation that was carried out to a ridiculous timetable. On <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-07">7 April</phrase>, the five police authorities in the east midlands told the Government that they did not want to merge voluntarily. On<phrase class="date" code="2007-04-11">11 April</phrase>, they were told that they were going to merge anyway. What was the point of the whole sham process that started last autumn when the Government knew what they intended to impose in their first place?</p>
	<p pid="b.1680.0/4">The changes are not going to be funded properly in any part of the country&mdash;certainly not in Derbyshire and the east midlands. Paying for the reorganisation will lead to reductions in the number of police officers on the beat. Above all, the change will lead to a loss of local responsiveness and accountability. I know the chief constable of Derbyshire. I can call on him easily. His base is not far away from Chesterfield. I know the chief superintendent of C division, which covers Chesterfield, and I am meeting her tomorrow to discuss all sorts of issues. How will I go on if the chief constable is in Northampton, or Leicester, or Nottingham? That will be just impossible&mdash;it is a nonsense.</p>
	<p pid="b.1680.0/5">Since a new set of Ministers has taken on most posts in recent weeks, I hope that we will hear some answers that suggest that the Government are going to change their inexplicable policies on these matters, although I fear that I hope in vain.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-05-25b.1689.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1382" speakername="Tony Baldry" colnum="1689"  time="014:28:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060525/debtext/60525-0012.htm#06052526000545">
	<p pid="b.1689.1/1">My right hon. Friend makes a good point. There are a smaller number of acute hospitals such as the John Radcliffe, and the Horton's viability as a general hospital will be undermined. Worse, when I met the primary care trust's acting chief executive the other day, it was made clear to me that the commissioners oppose community hospitals because they are so strapped for funds that they will move anything they can from the acute centre to social care, for which there is a means test administered by the county council. Community hospitals and community beds will, therefore, also disappear and acute services will be under great pressure.</p>
	<p pid="b.1689.1/2">One has only to look at the Oxford Radcliffe Hospitals NHS Trust website to realise that one of the consequences of the cuts is that &pound;38 million will have to be saved in surgery. That means that no one will get an operation for at least six months. The whole point of managing surgery becomes trying to ensure that, to save money, people wait for the maximum time, but are treated just within the Government target.</p>
	<p pid="b.1689.1/3">The position is bleak. As recently as Prime Minister's questions on <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-19">19 April</phrase>, the Prime Minister trumpeted an expansion of cardiac services at the Oxford Radcliffe Hospitals NHS Trust. The consequence of the cuts is that cardiac ablation therapy to control an irregular heartbeat&mdash;the treatment that the Prime Minister received&mdash;will no longer be available to most patients at the John Radcliffe hospital.</p>
	<p pid="b.1689.1/4">General hospitals such as the Horton are being undermined, the John Radcliffe has to reduce its services substantially, the acute hospital trust has to make massive cuts in surgery and NHS skilled staff are being made redundant. That is crazy. My constituents and the people of Oxfordshire find it insulting when Labour Members try to pretend that that constitutes an improvement in the NHS or in services for my constituents. It demonstrates that Ministers and Labour Members are increasingly living in a parallel universe. I partly understand the reason for that. Ministers will not visit hospitals such as mine. Their officials wheel them out simply to see showcase improvements, so they get a false sense of what is happening.</p>
	<p pid="b.1689.1/5">The funding formula is skewed against counties such as Oxfordshire so unfairly that I suspect that many Labour Members are genuinely misled into believing that there is more money in the NHS than is the case. However, they should reflect on the fact that so many of the cuts are being made in London and the south-east.</p>
	<p pid="b.1689.1/6">My constituents will try to respond through every possible democratic means. We have started a petition, which appears in today's newspapers such as the <i> Banbury Guardian </i>and the <i> Banbury Cake</i>. People can sign it online at <a href="http://www.saveourservices.com">www.saveourservices.com</a>. When, on one day, approximately 155 beds are lost at the Churchill hospital and 30 beds at the John Radcliffe, and we learn that Oxfordshire will have fewer qualified nurses than in 2002, I am sure that hon. Members understand why today is, for me, the blackest day since I became a Member of Parliament. I hope that the Government will reflect and realise that what they are doing to the NHS is unacceptable, and that the people of Britain will not accept it.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-05-25b.1696.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1921" speakername="Lyn Brown" colnum="1696"  time="015:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060525/debtext/60525-0013.htm#06052526000554">
	<p pid="b.1696.4/1">I want to discuss the case of a constituent of mine. Earlier this year,Mr. Singh came to my surgery to discuss his long-running dispute with Thames Water about the installation of a water meter at his property and the subsequent enormous rise in his family's water charges. He told me that Thames Water was not given permission to install the meter, and that it gave him the impression in previous correspondence that a meter would enable him to save money on his water bills. That has not happened. Since the fitting of the water meter, Mr. Singh's water charges have risen excessively: from &pound;159 per annum&mdash;the current rateable value for his house&mdash;to &pound;469 per annum, which is an increase of almost 300 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="b.1696.4/2">Mr. Singh's is not a wealthy household in the home counties. There is no huge lawn to water or a swimming pool. His is a small household, consisting of only two adults and one child. The family tell me that they have always been very conservative in their use of water. They have no dishwasher, seldom run their appliances and try to make the most effective use of water by waiting a week before doing their washing. Since installation of the water meter, their usage has had to drop even further as they try to reduce their bills to manageable levels&mdash;but to no effect. With mounting bills, they now restrict themselves to the absolute minimum level of water consumption. They are genuinely afraid to turn on their taps and appliances, for fear of a further rise in the water bill. Certainly, since the meter was installed their water bills have trebled, while their already low usage has decreased. Clearly, there is a problem somewhere.</p>
	<p pid="b.1696.4/3">In response to Mr. Singh's complaints, I wrote to the chief executive of Thames Water to express my and my constituent's concerns about the water supply, and to request Thames Water's assistance in investigating and diagnosing the error that was clearly occurring. I also asked whether it could provide Mr. Singh with the leak detection and repair service that it claims to offer its customers. I know that the House will be surprised and somewhat dismayed to learn that as of this morning, I have received only an acknowledgment of my letter of <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-17">17 March</phrase>. Perhaps it is not just water that is leaking from Thames Water's pipes.</p>
	<p pid="b.1696.4/4">We need to remember that Thames Water is the only privatised water company in England and Wales that continues to fail to meet its Ofwat targets for acceptable levels of leakages from its pipe system; indeed, it has failed to meet them for the past five years. I acknowledge that Thames Water has inherited some of the worst and oldest water pipes in the country, and that it is not easy to access and fix London's underground pipes, but the Ofwat targets are not excessive. Thames Water's own estimate of water leaked per year has in fact risen: from 688 million litres a day in 2000-01 to 915 million litres a day in 2004-05. That accounted for approximately a quarter of all the water leaked throughout England and Wales.</p>
	<p pid="b.1696.4/5">Let me be more specific. Each day, 915 million litres of precious water leak of out Thames Water's pipes. That amounts to 10,590 litres of water wasted per second. One third of the total amount piped into the water distribution system is lost.</p>
	<p pid="b.1696.4/6">I accept that totally eliminating water leakage is not economically practical, but Thames Water is not doing enough. Instead of concentrating its efforts and resources on reducing the waste of an increasingly precious and vital national resource, Thames Water could be accused of concentrating on squeezing further profits out of its customers. Instead of making its supply network as reliable and efficient as is practically possible, it focuses its considerable efforts on persuading householders to accept the installation of water meters, while also raising prices in an effort to reduce demand and ensure that it is able to fund dividend payments to its shareholders. Those dividend payments have been at least &pound;130 million a year for the past six years.</p>
	<p pid="b.1696.4/7">I fear that Thames Water's actions will have the effect of pricing many people out of the hygienic use and consumption of water. Should that continue, it may result in a public health problem. Let us remember that consumers of water have no realistic option to change their supplier if they are unhappy with the service provided, the cost charged or quality of product. The Government have already recognised fuel poverty as a real issue that affects many low-income households across the UK, and the prospect of compulsory water meters raises the prospect of water poverty.</p>
	<p pid="b.1696.4/8">Despite the miserable weather that we have had this week, the south-east appears to be entering a period of drought. We are beginning to see hosepipe bans and hearing talk of drought orders being enforced. Water customers are being asked to restrict their usage, while enormous quantities of water are wasted by inefficient infrastructure. Surely something can be done to pressure water companies to increase their renewal and improvement of the pipe network. Let us remember that those companies have a statutory responsibility to supply water to their paying customers. Why should customers accept conservation measures that assist a private profit-making company which seems more interested in returning profits to its investors than in fixing leaks that waste such enormous amounts of clean, precious water?</p>
	<p pid="b.1696.4/9">The case of Mr. Singh raises concerns about our water companies in general, and Thames Water in particular. It is their responsibility to provide an acceptable level of service to all their customers who, I repeat, have no alternative water supplier. How can Thames Water justify relying on customers to reduce their consumption while allowing a third of the water supply to leak out of its pipes? And how can it be right to promote water metering when it hits the poorest households in this country hardest, and risks pricing low-income households out of the opportunity to use fresh, clean water in 21st century London?</p>
	<p pid="b.1696.4/10">As water becomes a more scarce resource, it must surely be the right time for further Government measures to improve regulation of the water industry. The water industry must get its own house in order before it can lecture its paying customers on what they should be doing to solve this crisis. The water companies must remember that they are not only there to look after the interests of their shareholders: they must balance that with the interests of the public they are there to serve.</p>

	<p pid="b.1710.0/1">I should like to say to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1488" name="Bob Spink">my hon. Friend the Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink)</phrase> that if he has constituents or anyone else waiting for him, I shall take no offence if he chooses to go to be with them now.</p>
	<p pid="b.1710.0/2">We have had our usual interesting debate on a wide range of issues this afternoon. Health and antisocial behaviour matters have been to the fore, although housing, transport and urban planning issues have also been raised, among others. I want to focus exclusively on education, however, and on what is going on in our schools, and I make no apology for doing so in a week in which the Education and Inspections Bill has dominated the proceedings of the House.</p>
	<p pid="b.1710.0/3">The first issue that I want to consider is the provision of schooling for children with special needs. I am aware that the Education and Skills Committee is undertaking a report on this important subject, and we look forward with great interest to reading its findings when they are put before the House. In almost five years in the House, I have noticed a real increase in the number of people coming to my surgeries to tell me that their children are on the autistic spectrum or that they have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or any one of a range of learning difficulties. I have discovered from talking to other hon. Members across the House that this is a common theme.</p>
	<p pid="b.1710.0/4">There has been a real increase in the number of children with some form of learning difficulty having problems in accessing the curriculum properly, and this is a matter of great concern for Members on both sides of the House. I remember when <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1745" name="Charles Clarke">the right hon. Member for Norwich, South (Mr. Clarke)</phrase> was the Secretary of State for Education and Skills, he made a statement to the House on the subject. He expressed his concern at the way in which parents had to battle through the system to get the right provision for their children.</p>
	<p pid="b.1710.0/5">It is obviously deeply distressing for a parent to have a child with some form of learning difficulty or special educational needs, and schools need to do their very best to cope with those requirements. We have a system that fairly routinely forces parents to spend huge amounts of money to represent themselves, and it can take an enormous time&mdash;in some cases, many years&mdash;to get a proper resolution. When there are considerable differences in the type of provision available in different local authority areas, I think that there is great cause for concern. Particularly in view of how long it takes some parents to sort the issues out, we must remember that children have only one chance, and that if they miss vital years of their education without getting the right support, that is very wrong indeed.</p>
	<p pid="b.1710.0/6">As for the costs, I know of some parents who have spent up to &pound;5,000 or &pound;6,000 fighting and presenting their case to the local authority in order to get the right type of education for their children. I shall mention one specific case in my constituency. I have spoken to the parent, who is happy for me to discuss her case, which has recently been flagged up on the BBC education website. The parent, Michelle Chambers, has a six-year-old daughter with severe speech and language difficulties. Although the daughter is six, she has the language ability of a three-year-old child. When her mother recently accessed the school records, she was concerned to find out that her daughter had had to be physically removed from classrooms or restrained or taken to different parts of the school on some 37 different occasions between <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-13">13 January</phrase> and<phrase class="date" code="2007-03-21">21 March</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.1710.0/7">I am concerned about several aspects of that case. The parents were not automatically told what was happening by the school. I understand that the local education authority, Bedfordshire county council, fully investigated the case when it was raised by Mrs. Chambers and it tells me that the correct procedures were followed. It is worrying in itself if the national guidelines for schools mean that children can be treated in that way over such a long period without the parents being informed. That is deeply wrong and unfair to parents. If they are to be fully knowledgeable and involved in what is happening to their children at school, they must know the facts about what is going on.</p>
	<p pid="b.1710.0/8">I know from talking to hon. Members throughout the House that language and speech problems can present real difficulties for many people. Part of the medical provision comes through the local primary care trust, but the principal authority for the child's education is obviously the local education authority. Time and again, it seems that there is a gap between the PCT on the one hand and the LEA on the other, often with considerable finger pointing going on between the two. I am concerned that vulnerable children are literally falling through that gap. In my own area, Bedfordshire Heartlands primary care trust has a&pound;20 million deficit, which it has been ordered to rectify. It has recently had to remove one specialist, who provided help with speech and language training in Leighton Buzzard.</p>
	<p pid="b.1710.0/9"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1865" name="Michael Wills">The hon. Member for North Swindon (Mr. Wills)</phrase> spoke about local area agreements. When I first heard about them, I made it clear to my local authority that I would judge the success of that Government initiative on the practical basis of exactly what it would do to close the gap between the education service and the health service for these vulnerable children who have speech and language difficulties.</p>
	<p pid="b.1710.0/10">Special educational needs are a very great concern. I do not think that we have it right yet, because of the fact that parents must battle for so long. There is obviously great concern about the number of special schools that have been closed recently. I was sorry that that Labour and Liberal Members were unable to back us on new clause 5 during the consideration of the Education and Inspections Bill yesterday, although it would only have ensured that the Secretary of State for Education and Skills kept special schools open unless sufficient places of the right quality were available in nearby schools. The disappearance of special provision is certainly very worrying.</p>
	<p pid="b.1710.0/11">The second education issue that I want to deal with is bullying in schools. Last night I saw Dame Kelly Holmes referring to that on television. I think that she is heading a campaign this week. What has struck me recently is the great difference in practice in schools' anti-bullying policies&mdash;and I am pleased to see that the Deputy Leader of the House is agreeing with me. By law, every maintained school in the land must have an anti-bullying policy&mdash;as I know, because I am a governor of a local school&mdash;but there is all the difference in the world between a policy that is perhaps checked by the school governors who look at it, ensure that it is fine and then put it back into the file, and one that is enforced as the school's central purpose with the head teacher putting life and meaning into it.</p>
	<p pid="b.1710.0/12">When children arrive in the schools with the very best practice, they are told from the very start exactly what bullying is. It is any form of behaviour that is distressing or causes anxiety to other children at the school. It is very far from just being physical. It can manifest itself in all sorts of ways and often happens outside lessons: in the corridor while waiting for a lesson, in the lunch queue or in the playground, and so on. Again, as a country we have not really got to grips with bullying in schools. I should like children, perhaps at the end of each year, to write down confidentially and anonymously their experiences of what bullying was like in the school. Perhaps that way, the school and the LEA would have some idea of what was really going on, and the head teacher and the governors could be presented with that information.</p>
	<p pid="b.1710.0/13">I should like to commend a school in my constituency&mdash;Vandyke upper school in Leighton Buzzard&mdash;for recently getting every child, bar a very few children who were concerned about bullying but who did not want to sign the anti-bullying contract for individual reasons of conscience, to sign its anti-bullying policy in front of the whole school. Signing a policy is one thing&mdash;it was a good innovation&mdash;but the real issue is whether it is put into practice and enforced.</p>
	<p pid="b.1710.0/14">I am disappointed by the attitude of parents when they are told that their child is bullying other children. Perhaps that is not something that schools can do a great deal about, but it saddens and depresses me hugely sometimes. If most decent parents are told that their child is bullying other children, first they feel incredibly sorry and upset about the effect on the children who are being bullied, and try to contact the parents of those children to express their sorrow and give them complete reassurance that they will do something about it. Obviously, they then work with the school to try to ensure that their child's behaviour becomes acceptable&mdash;and, of course, to get to the bottom of what it is in their own child that is causing them to bully other children.</p>
	<p pid="b.1710.0/15">My experience recently, however, is that when parents are confronted with the fact that their child is bullying other children, their first reaction is often to think, &quot;Gosh, will it hurt my child's prospects? Will it damage their school report?&quot; I am tremendously saddened when that sort of attitude is prevalent among parents. Perhaps when parents sign home-school contracts&mdash;which, again, we debated yesterday&mdash;it could be impressed on them that they have a duty to be thoroughly responsible. If their child is bullying other children in any way, they have an obligation to try to deal with it and to assist the school, thereby ensuring that our schools are safe and happy learning environments for all our children, where education can take place properly. None of us should underestimate the distress caused to children when they suffer any form of bullying.</p>
	<p pid="b.1710.0/16">The third and final area that I want to touch on is the level of basic literacy in our schools, by which I mean our children's ability to read, write and do basic arithmetic&mdash;the three R's, as they used to be called. A couple of weeks ago, I went round an upper school in my constituency with the headmaster and was taken to the learning support area to speak to the outstanding lady who heads that unit. The children at the school are aged between 14 and 16, and that teacher told me that in her estimation, about a quarter of them have difficulty with reading and writing. I was shocked by that statement. We have had a number of debates on the Education and Inspections Bill this week, but it strikes me that that is a national outrage.</p>
	<p pid="b.1710.0/17">I do not seek to make party political points here, because I do not think that things were much better when we were in power. I will make a deal with the Deputy Leader of the House: I will not blame the Government now, if he will not come back and say that it was our fault when we were in power. This issue should shock and anger us all. Here we are, the fifth largest economy in the world and a major western industrialised nation, and in some cases&mdash;</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-05-25b.1715.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1461" speakername="Charles Walker" colnum="1715"  time="016:31:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060525/debtext/60525-0016.htm#06052528000117">
	<p pid="b.1715.0/1">Once again, I wish to raise the issue of the Hertfordshire Partnership NHS Trust, which provides mental health services. It is an important trust, which serves Hertfordshire and my constituency, and faces significant cuts this year and perhaps in coming years.</p>
	<p pid="b.1715.0/2">In case I sound churlish, let me say that the Government's record in mental health is moving in the right direction. Everyone, across the political spectrum, wants the best service delivered to some of society's most vulnerable people. Let me add the caveat, however, that the Government have probably slightly lost their way recently, especially in Hertfordshire.</p>
	<p pid="b.1715.0/3">As Members of the House and the wider public know, mental health problems come with a huge amount of stigma attached. One need only think of the headlines in <i> The Sun </i>when Frank Bruno underwent mental health problems&mdash;the headline &quot;Frank Loono&quot; was considered&mdash;and when Adam Ant had his problems. The behaviour of the media was disgraceful.</p>
	<p pid="b.1715.0/4">For that reason, I am glad that the Government are spending money on a campaign to raise awareness of mental health problems and to try to reduce the stigma&mdash;Shift. Unfortunately, that campaign receives funding of only &pound;1 million across England, which is 2p per head. That pales into insignificance when compared with the 15p per head spent in Scotland, although that is not a huge sum of money either. I am afraid that those figures are not in the same ballpark as the money spent on smoking cessation programmes, important though those are.</p>
	<p pid="b.1715.0/5">The Hertfordshire Partnership NHS Trust was founded in 2001 and has operated since without going into deficit; it has balanced its books. This year, however, despite its good financial record, it was asked to make savings of &pound;5.6 million&mdash;more than a 5 per cent. cut in its annual budget. I raised the issue in an Adjournment debate on <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-19">19 April</phrase>, when I mentioned several of the services to be closed. I will not rehash those points today; the House is aware of them and they are recorded in <i> Hansard. </i>However, those closures are against the proposals in the Government's White Paper &quot;Investing in Your Mental Health&quot;, which most Members of the House welcomed.</p>
	<p pid="b.1715.0/6">When I first raised the issue in that Adjournment debate, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1544" name="Rosie Winterton">the Minister of State, the hon. Member for Doncaster, Central (Ms Winterton)</phrase> said:</p>
	<p pid="b.1715.0/7" class="indent">&quot;The Hertfordshire Partnership NHS Trust's total increased investment in its mental health services is &pound;4.2 million over and above inflation for the three-year period from 2003 to 2006.&quot;&mdash;[<i> Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-19">19 April 2006</phrase>; Vol. 445, c. 204.]</p>
	<p pid="b.1715.0/8">That sounds good, until we remember that although the trust had an additional &pound;4.2 million, the Government are now asking for &pound;5.6 million back. What they gave with one hand they seem to be taking back with two.</p>
	<p pid="b.1715.0/9">When I raised that with the Minister, she said</p>
	<p pid="b.1715.0/10">:</p>
	<p pid="b.1715.0/11" class="indent">&quot;I will come to some of the specific points that the hon. Gentleman has raised.&quot;&mdash;[<i> Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-19">19 April 2006</phrase>; Vol. 445, c. 204.]</p>
	<p pid="b.1715.0/12">Unfortunately, she forgot to do so. Undeterred, I raised the same issue with the Secretary of State for Health&mdash;who, I may say, knows me by name, which is probably more than some of my own Front Benchers do, so I have a great deal of time for her. When I asked my question, she looked me straight in the eye and said:</p>
	<p pid="b.1715.0/13" class="indent">&quot;I shall come to that point in a little more detail in a moment.&quot;&mdash;[<i> Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-09">9 May 2006</phrase>; Vol. 446, c. 193.]</p>
	<p pid="b.1715.0/14">I had absolutely no reason to disbelieve the Secretary of State. After all, she calls me Charles in the Division Lobbies and always makes time for me. Unfortunately, she too forgot to return to the point.</p>

	<p pid="b.1716.1/1">Only yesterday evening I bumped into the Secretary of State during the vote on the Education and Inspections Bill as we supported the Government against their own Back Benchers. When I suggested to her that she might want to answer the question about what was happening to the money in a little more detail at a future date, she smiled very sweetly and moved on quickly.</p>
	<p pid="b.1716.1/2">I am extremely disappointed that my local mental health trust faces such huge cuts over the coming year. If we are to believe Government figures given during a debate on <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-07">7 February</phrase>, they account for a third of all the money being clawed back from mental health trusts in the United Kingdom. In response to a question asked by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1476" name="Andrew Lansley">my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley)</phrase>, the Minister of State, Department of Health said:</p>
	<p pid="b.1716.1/3" class="indent">&quot;11 of 84 trusts are making expenditure reductions that amount to &pound;16.5 million out of a total expenditure on mental health of more than &pound;6 billion&quot;.&mdash;[<i> Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-07">7 February 2006</phrase>;Vol. 442, c. 755.]</p>
	<p pid="b.1716.1/4">Well, &pound;16.5 million across 11 trusts does not sound a lot of money&mdash;in fact, I am sure that it is a little more than that&mdash;but my trust accounts for a third of that amount, &pound;5.6 million, with the other 10 trusts have to make cuts of &pound;1.1 million each. I cannot believe that that is just or fair, particularly given that the Hertfordshire Partnership NHS Trust has never been in deficit in the five years for which it has been in operation. It has always balanced its books. What message do those cuts send to other trusts throughout the country that are struggling to balance their books? Not a very positive one.</p>
	<p pid="b.1716.1/5">Perhaps the Hertfordshire trust has been a little na&iuml;ve. Why did it even bother to balance its books over the past five years? Perhaps it should have just gone into deficit, like so many other trusts. I am concerned about the fact that the trust is being asked to bail out other parts of the health service. That seems to contradict what the Secretary of State for Health believes. When I asked her about this&mdash;no, I did not ask her, actually; she just said it&mdash;she announced:</p>
	<p pid="b.1716.1/6" class="indent">&quot;we are reforming the way in which the NHS is run so that every hospital&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1716.1/7">&mdash;I assume that she meant &quot;trust&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="b.1716.1/8" class="indent">&quot;takes responsibility for organising the best care within its budget. We will not expect others to bail them out.&quot;&mdash;[<i> Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-09">9 May 2006</phrase>; Vol. 446, c. 196.]</p>
	<p pid="b.1716.1/9">That is simply not the case. As I have explained, my local mental health trust is being asked to bail out hospitals and trusts that are in deficit to the tune of &pound;5.6 million. It is being penalised, and there seems to be no justice in the way in which it is being treated.</p>
	<p pid="b.1716.1/10">Of course, the Government will say that they have put local decision making in the hands of local health communities. That does not apply in this case. After all, it is the Government who fund the NHS, via the taxpayer. It is the Government who expect trusts to achieve financial balance, and demand that they do so. And it is the Government who, in this instance, are in essence asking for their money back.</p>
	<p pid="b.1716.1/11">I have raised my concerns with a number of charities, including Rethink, which as most Members know is a leading mental health charity. In its briefing, which was sent to Members of Parliament only a couple of weeks ago, it states:</p>
	<p pid="b.1716.1/12" class="indent">&quot;We believe that this is a national pattern in which wider health deficits are being addressed by shifting resources out of mental health.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1716.1/13">That is a fairly damning and worrying statement that should concern everyone in this Chamber and at the Department of Health, and all those outside this Chamber who would doubtless like to be here now. Mental health cuts are the deepest cuts. Mental health has traditionally been underfunded, so every pound taken from it can almost be multiplied by two or three when one contrasts that service with the better-funded areas of health care, such as cancer and heart disease.</p>
	<p pid="b.1716.1/14">I wrote to the Minister of State, Department of Health, the hon. Member for Doncaster, Central to ask her whether she was aware of the scale of the cuts and of the damage that they would do to local mental health services in Hertfordshire. She kindly responded on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-05">5 May</phrase>, saying:</p>
	<p pid="b.1716.1/15" class="indent">&quot;In deciding what proposals should be considered, the PCTs took account of...efficiency savings that could be made and that would avoid an adverse impact on front-line services&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.1716.1/16">Well, the cuts in Hertfordshire will have an impact on front-line services&mdash;a very severe one. The hon. Lady also said that PCTs took account of</p>
	<p pid="b.1716.1/17" class="indent">&quot;proposals that were in accord with the principles and priorities set out in the recent consultation on mental health services&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.1716.1/18">I assume that she was referring to &quot;Investing In Your Mental Health&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.1716.1/19">I have spoken to national charities and charities in the local health community, and they are absolutely convinced that the cuts will impact on people's health and increase the risk of suicide, and might lead to additional suicides. The hon. Lady went on to say that proposals were considered</p>
	<p pid="b.1716.1/20" class="indent">&quot;that did not worsen any inequality in the delivery of services across Hertfordshire.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1716.1/21">I am afraid to say that those proposals will lead to huge inequality in the delivery of services and have an enormous impact on many people's lives.</p>
	<p pid="b.1716.1/22">I ask the Secretary of State to intervene in this matter. She is a decent woman, and if she took the time to look at what is going on and to consider the fact that a trust that has never been in deficit in five years is being penalised for the deficits of others, she might change her mind. As Rethink said, the Department of Health is complacent about these cuts and the impact that they will have on some of the sickest people in society&mdash;people who are ignored by, and who feel marginalised by, society. These are vital, critical services for local people, and central to their well-being.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-05-25b.1726.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1700" speakername="Theresa May" colnum="1726"  time="017:08:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060525/debtext/60525-0017.htm#06052528000124">
	<p pid="b.1726.1/1">Of course, the Government came into office with the mantra, &quot;Tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime.&quot; What we have is lots of legislation on crime, but nothing on the causes of crime.</p>
	<p pid="b.1726.1/2">The picture that the hon. Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington drew was echoed by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1408" name="David Evennett">my hon. Friend the Member for Bexleyheath and Crayford (Mr. Evennett)</phrase> in an effective contribution that painted a vivid picture of the problems in his area and the lack of activity by the previous Labour council. I congratulate the Conservative group on Bexley council on its excellent results in the local elections on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-04">4 May</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.1726.1/3">Antisocial behavi<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1488" name="Bob Spink">our was also raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink)</phrase>. Sadly, the problems identified by my hon. Friends are experienced elsewhere. Last Saturday afternoon, I spoke to residents in South road and High Town road in Maidenhead about the problems they experience from gangs congregating near Grenfell park and from people walking past their houses after they have left bars. They are often young people who have been binge drinking, a problem to which my hon. Friend the Member for Bexleyheath and Crayford drew attention.</p>
	<p pid="b.1726.1/4">My hon. Friend also mentioned police community support officers. I agree that we need more police on the streets but, failing that, we need more PCSOs. A recent petition that I and others ran in Woodley in my constituency got more than 600 signatures in favour of a PCSO there. It is only a pity that the Liberal Democrat-controlled Woodley town council has been reluctant to find the &pound;15,000 necessary to part-fund a PCSO out of the &pound;1 million it takes each year from local residents.</p>
	<p pid="b.1726.1/5">My hon. Friend rightly said that those problems are quality of life issues and that we must have zero tolerance of crime and antisocial behaviour. It is only by not accepting that sort of behaviour and by insisting that something be done about it that we can hope to overcome the problem. If we shrug our shoulders and pass on, saying, &quot;Well, it's only antisocial behaviour,&quot; the problems are exacerbated.</p>
	<p pid="b.1726.1/6">Local policing will not be helped by the Government's moves to create large regional forces. As the hon. Member for Chesterfield said, those moves are often rejected by local forces. The Government's consultation on that has been shown to be a complete sham by the number of police forces that do not want to be merged and yet those mergers are going ahead.</p>
	<p pid="b.1726.1/7">On a different subject, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1921" name="Lyn Brown">the hon. Member for West Ham (Lyn Brown)</phrase> spoke about water supply, in particular leakages, but also the impact of increased costs on many people. There is no doubt that rises in the costs of utilities, together with rises in council tax, have hit many people hard, especially those who are on fixed incomes. She also referred to the water shortage in the south-east. Obviously, repairing those leaks would have a significant impact on that, but I suspect that she and those of us who spend part of our time in London should say a word of gratitude to my hon. Friend the Member for Wantage, who told us that his constituency is going to have a reservoir which will help to solve London's water problems.</p>
	<p pid="b.1726.1/8">On the subject of water shortages, last night, I visited the 2nd Cox Green girl guides in my constituency. I answered questions about my experience as a Member of Parliament, and I encouraged the girls to think about politics as a career. I was asked a range of questions, but as we sat with the rain beating against the window, one girl could not help but ask why there was a hosepipe ban.</p>
	<p pid="b.1726.1/9">I suspect that water shortages are less of a problem in <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1960" name="Alan Reid">the constituency of the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute (Mr. Reid)</phrase>. He raised a number of issues that affect his constituents, most of them arising from the geographical position of his constituency. It is right to remind the Government of the problems experienced by rural areas, where the considerable distances that people have to travel make it more difficult for them to access services. They must pay high petrol prices, but the Government's attempts to drive people on to public transport simply do not work in such areas because, as he pointed out, public transport is not available. As a result, people in rural areas end up paying more.</p>
	<p pid="b.1726.1/10">The hon. Gentleman spoke about the Royal Mail and the removal of the post office card account. He and other hon. Members will know that in recent months that has been raised time and time again in business questions, but the Government continue to duck the issue. May I remind the Deputy Leader of the House that the chief executive of the Post Office has said that the removal of the post office card account would result in the Post Office operating 10,000 fewer branches? The Government, however, have refused to address the future of the Post Office. They cannot continue to set their face against the issue. They must address it, as the removal of the card account will have a significant impact on the future of Post Office branches.</p>
	<p pid="b.1726.1/11"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1647" name="Diana Johnson">The hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, North (Ms Johnson)</phrase> gave us an entertaining picture of the political scene in Hull, with particular reference to school meals. May I suggest that before she worries about cross-party consensus she should try to achieve consensus in her own party? She obviously feels strongly about healthy eating, which she regards as the answer to childhood obesity. I believe that there are two sides to the problem: it is not just about what children eat but about how much exercise they take. Sadly, under the Government, there has been a drop in physical activity in many schools. For many years, children have become increasingly sedentary, whether they are watching television, surfing the net or playing computer games, so we must ensure that they take more physical exercise and run around. In business questions, I said that the cramming of houses into smaller spaces reduced the size of gardens, so children did not have much space to run around and enjoy physical activity. I am sorry that that met with laughter from Government Members, as the policy of cramming too many small houses on to a site reduces gardens and open space, which will have an impact in future.</p>
	<p pid="b.1726.1/12">Reduced access to public parks will have a similar impact. No recess Adjournment debate would be complete without a contribution from my hon. Friend the Member for Castle Point, who said that public parks in his constituency were important, as they gave youngsters space to run around. Other members of the population could walk and sit in them, and their enjoyment would improve their quality of life. He raised, too, matters of conscience on which he has strong views, particularly abortion and the use of human embryos. However, he raised one issue that was new to me&mdash;the creation of animal-human hybrids&mdash;and I hope that the Deputy Leader of the House listened carefully to the points that he made.</p>
	<p pid="b.1726.1/13">In yesterday's debate on the Education and Inspections Bill, we raised special needs education, particularly special schools, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1399" name="Andrew Selous">my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Bedfordshire (Andrew Selous)</phrase> pointed out. He referred to the problems experienced by many parents of children with special needs when trying to access the right provision for their children. The process means that parents often have to spend a long time fighting for such provision for their children. For some, that ends up in tribunals, and often in paying for support at the tribunal. I shared my hon. Friend's concern about the case that he raised in relation to the daughter of his constituent, Mrs. Chambers. The fact that information can be kept from parents should be a concern for us all in the House.</p>
	<p pid="b.1726.1/14">I am grateful to my hon. Friend for raising the issue of bullying, which is a problem for far too many children. Like him, I do not believe we do enough to prevent and stop bullying. Sadly, whereas good practice in schools can improve the situation, bad practice can at best achieve nothing and at worst can make matters worse. We must do more to identify good practice with regard to bullying and to spread that good practice.</p>
	<p pid="b.1726.1/15">My hon. Friend also spoke about basic literacy in our schools. It is a serious matter, not just because of the impact that illiteracy has on children's lives as they go through school and the fact that it holds them back in further learning, but because of the problems that it causes when they reach adulthood in getting a job and in basic living&mdash;understanding Government forms or reading instructions on convenience food or medicine bottles&mdash;let alone how it affects their overall quality of life. My hon. Friend is right: we in the House should be more angry about the matter than we are, and I commend him for highlighting it.</p>
	<p pid="b.1726.1/16">Quality of life was also a theme in <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1736" name="Norman Lamb">the contribution of the hon. Member for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb)</phrase>, who spoke about a number of constituency cases, notably that of his constituent Tony Thorpe, who was not eligible for redundancy payments following the closure of RAF Coltishall. The hon. Gentleman ably set out his constituent's case and the apparent unfairness of the current regulations. He also spoke about the treatment of North sea fishermen in the context of the work on the BBL pipeline. I trust that the Deputy Leader of the House listened to those specific points.</p>
	<p pid="b.1726.1/17">The hon. Member for North Norfolk mentioned a Tesco store in Sheringham. I remember Sheringham from my childhood. I remember playing crazy golf on the beach at Sheringham with much joy and delight, at least to me, if not to those watching and playing with me. The hon. Gentleman's comments about the Tesco store raised important points about the planning system, particularly about negotiations between the council and Tesco.</p>
	<p pid="b.1726.1/18">I cannot comment on the individual case because I do not know enough about the details, but there is an issue with regard to the planning system because it depends on public confidence. All those involved in the planning process have a duty to behave in a way that ensures public confidence in the system. It is an issue that I often raise with reference to the enforcement of planning conditions. If developers believe that they can get away with breaching or ignoring planning conditions, the whole system is brought into disrepute.</p>
	<p pid="b.1726.1/19">My hon. Friend the Member for Wantage, who squeezed his way into the debate at the end, spoke about a variety of issues. I have mentioned the transport issue. For areas of economic vitality, infrastructure is crucial. The Thames Valley Economic Partnership has pointed out that because the Thames valley is economically vibrant and doing well, transport infrastructure is not put into it. Of course, the opposite is true. If transport infrastructure is not put in, the economic vibrancy will start to fail.</p>
	<p pid="b.1726.1/20">My hon. Friend mentioned the Diamond synchrotron and other incredibly impressive scientific work being done in his constituency. Last week at the TVEP dinner, I had the benefit of listening to somebody from the Rutherford Appleton laboratory in his constituency, who waxed lyrical for some time about space exploration and the impressive scientific work being done there. He also told us one important fact: in 2029 an asteroid will come very close to earth. The good news is that in 2029 it only comes close to earth. The bad news is that in 2036 it may very well hit the earth. Like everybody at the dinner, those in the Chamber are probably making a mental calculation of where they will be in 2036 and whether that matters to them. I leave them to do that.</p>
	<p pid="b.1726.1/21">Several hon. Members mentioned the NHS. It has been raised consistently in business questions since I became shadow Leader of the House in December. The hon. Member for Chesterfield was the first to mention it in this afternoon's debate when he spoke about job losses at his local hospital, which is not a failing but a three-star hospital that has consistently delivered Government policy. Both the current and the previous Leader of the House have constantly criticised me in business questions for referring to job cuts in the NHS. I reiterate that they should get out and find what is happening in the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="b.1726.1/22">As several hon. Members said, real job cuts are taking place. There are 43 fewer ward sisters in the Chesterfield royal infirmary, 600 jobs are going in the Oxford Radcliffe Hospitals NHS Trust and 450 jobs will be lost in the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital NHS Trust. Cuts are also happening in mental health trusts, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1461" name="Charles Walker">my hon. Friend the Member for Broxbourne (Mr. Walker)</phrase> outlined when he mentioned the Hertfordshire Partnership NHS Trust. Berkshire Healthcare NHS Trust has to save &pound;10 million. It hopes to do that without cuts in services, but how can it without affecting services?</p>
	<p pid="b.1726.1/23">My hon. Friend the Member for Broxbourne referred to his somewhat cosy relationship with the Secretary of State for Health, which he appears to have developed on several occasions in the Division Lobby. He gave the impression that he had spent rather a lot of time with her there. Although I appreciate that we have joined the Government in the Lobby on a small number of occasions recently, my hon. Friend has either been spending more time there than with us&mdash;I doubt that&mdash;or he is a fast worker. However, job cuts in the health service are a serious matter. They will affect patient care, not only the lives of those whose jobs are taken away.</p>
	<p pid="b.1726.1/24">The hon. Member for Chesterfield specifically mentioned financial planning and what happens when the Government pull the rug away from under one's feet half way through the system. In the Thames valley area, the rules changed six months into the financial year and it was therefore little wonder that the trusts found themselves in financial difficulties. Yet the Government keep saying that mismanagement in the trusts leads to the deficits. That is often not the case, and the Government's actions cause the problems.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-05-25b.1737.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1588" speakername="Mark Harper" colnum="1737"  time="018:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060525/debtext/60525-0019.htm#06052531000120">
	<p pid="b.1737.2/1">I first want to place on the record my thanks to Mr. Speaker for selecting as the subject for this Adjournment debate health services in the Forest of Dean and Gloucestershire. The background to the debate is that on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-10">10 May</phrase>, which was rightly named &quot;black Wednesday&quot; by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1515" name="Geoffrey Clifton-Brown">my hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown)</phrase>, 12 hospitals or similar facilities and hundreds of beds and jobs were threatened with closure by the local health trust.</p>
	<p pid="b.1737.2/2">As those closures will affect all the Gloucestershire constituencies, we tried to start an all-party campaign against them. Four of the six Gloucestershire MPs&mdash;<phrase class="honfriend" id="unknown" name="MultipleMatch">my hon. Friends the Member for Cotswold and for Tewkesbury (Mr. Robertson)</phrase>, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1494" name="Martin Horwood">the hon. Member for Cheltenham (Martin Horwood)</phrase> and myself&mdash;are opposing <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1850" name="David Drew">the closures. I see that the hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew)</phrase> is in the Chamber, and I know that he, too, has many concerns about the closures. We are stronger when we are united; it is just unfortunate that we have been unable to get all six Gloucestershire Members on board for a united campaign.</p>
	<p pid="b.1737.2/3">In my constituency, both the community hospitals&mdash;the Dilke Memorial hospital and the Lydney and district hospital&mdash;face closure, and the closure of Colliers Court, which deals with mental health, is also proposed. I am very grateful to our local press, which has run strong campaigns on this issue. <i> The Forester</i> and its editor, Viv Hargreaves, ran a &quot;Save our Services&quot; campaign, and <i> The Citizen</i> and its editor, Ian Mean, ran a &quot;Save our Hospitals&quot; campaign.</p>
	<p pid="b.1737.2/4">So that the Minister completely understands why people in Gloucestershire are so concerned about these closures, it is worth considering briefly one or two of the recent headlines in the local papers. <i> The Citizen </i>ran &quot;A Black Day for Health Care in the County&quot;, <i> The Forester</i> ran &quot;Meltdown in the NHS&quot;, and the <i> Forest of Dean and Wye Valley Review</i> ran &quot;The Bitter Pill&quot;. As recently as yesterday, one paper ran the headline, &quot;Take Your Medicine&mdash;the only way to beat off the threat to the Dilke and Lydney hospitals is to bring down the Government.&quot; That is perhaps going a little too far for the moment, but that headline certainly represents the strength of feeling in my constituency. In the light of the tremendous public concern, the broadcast media have also been excellent. ITV, the BBC and our local radio stations have covered the issue very well. I want also to pay tribute to local campaigners who have rallied to defend our services; there are too many to thank individually.</p>
	<p pid="b.1737.2/5">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-11">11 May</phrase>, my hon. Friends the Members for Cotswold and for Tewkesbury and I wrote to the Secretary of State for Health a letter that we, with a delegation of nurses from Gloucestershire, hand-delivered to the Department of Health. We are still waiting for even a holding reply. People in the office of my hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold spoke to the Department last week and at the beginning of this week, but we cannot expect even the reply to a request for a meeting until next week&mdash;during the recess.</p>
	<p pid="b.1737.2/6">The Secretary of State has already had a meeting with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1595" name="Parmjit Dhanda">the hon. Member for Gloucester (Mr. Dhanda)</phrase>, and I had thought that the Department was perhaps playing party politics. Then I discovered during yesterday's Westminster Hall debate on community hospitals that the hon. Member for Stroud, too, has written to the Secretary of State and has not had an answer. We expect a reply soon, and with no disrespect to the Minister present, we also expect to have a meeting with the Secretary of State. I would be grateful if the Minister gave some indication of when we will get a reply, and a meeting.</p>
</speech>
<gidredirect oldgid="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-05-25b.1738.0" newgid="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-05-25c.1738.0" matchtype="perfectmatch"/>
<gidredirect oldgid="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-05-25b.1738.1" newgid="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-05-25c.1738.1" matchtype="changes"/>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-05-25b.1738.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1588" speakername="Mark Harper" colnum="1738"  time="018:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060525/debtext/60525-0019.htm#06052531000122">
	<p pid="b.1738.1/1">I am very grateful to the hon. Gentleman for raising that point; we would welcome his joining us in our meeting with the Secretary of State. That interesting information perhaps highlights the concerns that constituents have when they see that the various areas within a strategic health authority are not being treated fairly and equally, which is all that they are asking for.</p>
	<p pid="b.1738.1/2">The White Paper on community hospitals makes it clear that community hospitals that are under threat of closure should not be lost in response to short-term budgetary pressures. Both the Dilke and Lydney community hospitals in my constituency are threatened with closure for exactly that reason, and I want to know what the Government intend to do about that contradiction.</p>
	<p pid="b.1738.1/3">I raised that issue with the Prime Minister yesterday, and instead of answering my question he changed the subject. I hope that the Minister will do better. The Prime Minister is quick to claim credit for any good news in the NHS, as he attempted to do in his response to me yesterday, but if he is personally responsible for all that goes well, it follows that he must take responsibility for what goes badly. If he is responsible for new hospitals opening, he is also responsible when community hospitals are closed.</p>
	<p pid="b.1738.1/4">It is not only hospitals that we must be concerned about, but the services available in the community. I received an e-mail yesterday from a GP in my constituency, who pointed out that there is a complete embargo by the PCT on replacing staff who leave and on employing new staff. In the West Gloucestershire PCT, which covers my constituency, six health visitor posts and two community nursing posts are being held unfilled. That does not fill us with confidence that services that are being cut in hospitals will be replaced by services in the community.</p>
	<p pid="b.1738.1/5">The Minister will know that I continue to raise, through parliamentary questions, the issue of the policy of the Department of Health on deficits in the NHS. The cuts proposed in Gloucestershire have been prompted by deficits, but there is a contradiction at the heart of Government policy, and I hope that the Minister can clear it up. The January 2006 operating framework for 2006-07 said:</p>
	<p pid="b.1738.1/6" class="indent">&quot;All NHS organisations should plan to recover deficits for previous years and balance their books for 2006-07.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1738.1/7">However, the Secretary of State wrote to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1476" name="Andrew Lansley">my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire(Mr. Lansley)</phrase> on <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-12">12 April</phrase>, stating that the Department expected</p>
	<p pid="b.1738.1/8" class="indent">&quot;all organisations that are overspending to show improvements during 2006-07, and by the end of the year everyone should have monthly income covering monthly expenditure.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1738.1/9">Those two statements outline different policies and both cannot be true. My hon. Friend tried to get an answer to that conundrum at Health questions on <phrase class="date" code="">16 May</phrase>. The Secretary of State was absent, for a good reason, and the Minister of State, Department of Health, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1678" name="Andy Burnham">the hon. Member for Leigh (Andy Burnham)</phrase> skirted around the issue and did not answer the question.</p>
	<p pid="b.1738.1/10"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1922" name="Andrew Murrison">My hon. Friend the Member for Westbury (Dr. Murrison)</phrase>, in winding up for the Opposition in the debate on community hospitals in Westminster Hall yesterday, pressed the matter again. The Minister of State intended, I am sure, to answer the question yesterday, but unfortunately ran out of time. I plan to give the Minister adequate time to deal with the question in this debate, and it is critical to my constituents and others in Gloucestershire that she does.</p>
	<p pid="b.1738.1/11">The strategic health authority for Avon, Gloucestershire and Wiltshire is operating under the impression that financial balance must be achieved across the year and all historic deficits must be cleared. That message is being driven down to the primary care trusts. Moreover, Gloucestershire&mdash;to reinforce the point made by the hon. Member for Stroud&mdash;is losing &pound;6 million this year, which is being taken away to bail out other areas, and we are expected to cut services to fund that. If the Minister does not confirm the position set out by the Secretary of State in her letter to my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire, the cuts bandwagon will continue rolling and will pick up speed.</p>
	<p pid="b.1738.1/12">I now come to consultation. The health White Paper also says:</p>
	<p pid="b.1738.1/13" class="indent">&quot;PCTs taking current decisions about the future of community hospitals will be required to demonstrate to their SHA that they have consulted locally and have considered options such as developing new pathways, new partnerships and new ownership possibilities. SHAs will then test PCT community hospital proposals against the principles of this White Paper.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1738.1/14">I have to say that many people in my constituency have a very cynical view of consultations. They believe, with some justice, that decisions are already taken, that lip service will be paid to their views and then the PCTs will plough on regardless. Just yesterday, I heard that an official from the PCT turned up at the Dilke hospital, and when asked what he was doing, said that he was there to oversee the closure. That is before the consultation process has even started.</p>
	<p pid="b.1738.1/15">The Department's own guidance says that</p>
	<p pid="b.1738.1/16" class="indent">&quot;there is a statutory duty for NHS bodies to consult the local overview and scrutiny committee on a substantial change...committees should also note the duty to 'consult and involve' patients and the public conferred on NHS organisations&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.1738.1/17">The NHS has also issued guidance on service changes. It says that proposals for reconfiguration of services should involve the development of options with people, rather than for them. They should also focus on the redesign of services, and not their relocation, and take a whole-systems view that explores the contribution of all health and social care providers, working together to build sustainable solutions for the whole community. None of that has happened. The proposals for cuts came out of the blue and at short notice. They took everybody by surprise.</p>
	<p pid="b.1738.1/18">The Department's guidance also states that the local NHS body must also make it clear when the consultation period will end. Full consultation should last for a minimum of 12 weeks. In their headlong rush to cut services, the PCTs are determined that consultation should last only five weeks, but I can see no justification for that. Moreover, the PCTs are also threatening us. The chief executive of the West Gloucestershire PCT told <i> The Citizen</i> newspaper on<phrase class="date" code="">23 May</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="b.1738.1/19" class="indent">&quot;We have no option but to speed up our plans to change services...Every month that goes by without savings being made increases the level of savings required later in the year.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1738.1/20">That is blackmail, pure and simple. It is not acceptable to me or to my constituents to say that more services will be cut if we demand a proper consultation period. I hope that the Minister will spell out the Government's view of the matter, as I am sure that the PCT will take note of it. Does she agree that the people of the Forest of Dean and Gloucestershire are entitled to a consultation process of at least 12 weeks, or does she support the blackmail strategy adopted by the PCTs?</p>
	<p pid="b.1738.1/21">I wanted to talk about whether the changes are &quot;substantial&quot;&mdash;a description used but not defined in the relevant regulations. I do not have time to go into detail, but some of the proposal headings deal with changes in service accessibility, the impact on the wider community and especially on transport, the number of patients affected and the method of service delivery. I therefore contend that the proposed changes are indeed substantial.</p>
	<p pid="b.1738.1/22">In addition, I want to put it on record that if the overview and scrutiny committee considers that the proposal is not in the interests of the health service in its area, it may refer the decision to the Secretary of State. If the consultation process lasts only a meagre five weeks, I strongly urge the committee to do just that.</p>
	<p pid="b.1738.1/23">The NHS guidance also says that, when the overview and scrutiny committee considers whether a proposal is in the interest of the local health service, it should also consider the extent to which patients, the public and stakeholders more widely have been involved in planning and development. Only by securing full involvement activity will an NHS body be able to take a considered view of whether its plans are in the interests of the health service for which it is responsible. I contend that so far, none of that activity has taken place.</p>
	<p pid="b.1738.1/24">One other aspect is worth mentioning. The Minister will know that existing PCTs will be dissolved in September this year&mdash;a fact that does not exactly promote long-term thinking, as existing board members and senior managers will, understandably, be worried about their future. I, and a number of my hon. Friends, would prefer such decisions to be taken by the people who will be around to implement them and deal with their impact. They should not be taken by people who will be able to wash their hands of the whole thing in September and move on to something else.</p>
	<p pid="b.1738.1/25">The Department has answered my parliamentary questions by confirming that the new PCT to be established in Gloucestershire from <phrase class="date" code="">1 October</phrase> will not be bound by any decisions that have not been implemented by that date. I think that it would be better to wait, and I would be grateful if the Minister would say whether she and the Government agree.</p>
	<p pid="b.1738.1/26">It is worth spending a little time on explaining why the cuts, especially to the community hospitals, have generated such anger in the Forest of Dean. Local people feel a tremendous sense of ownership of their hospitals, and for a very good reason. Both hospitals have friends organisations that have raised tremendous sums, and that money has been spent on new equipment and on financing new buildings. When the PCT threatens to close hospitals that have been built, at least in part, by the community's own efforts, there is justifiable anger.</p>
	<p pid="b.1738.1/27">I do not have time to go into tremendous detail, but it is worth noting that the friends of Lydney hospital have raised about &pound;840,000 since 1990. The money has been spent on equipment for the hospital, and in several instances has contributed to significant hospital building. When the A and E department was built the friends contributed &pound;225,000, and when GP beds were being developed the friends contributed &pound;280,000. The community truly views that hospital as its own, and views with anger the proposal to close it.</p>
	<p pid="b.1738.1/28">Gloucestershire's share of health funding is only 88 per cent. of the national average. The demand for health care in Gloucestershire does not reflect that. The change in the formula in 1997 increased the weighting for deprivation and reduced the weighting for the age of the population. I do not expect that to be fixed now, or even that the Minister will comment, but it is useful to put down this marker for the 2007 comprehensive spending review, when it can be addressed.</p>
	<p pid="b.1738.1/29">A delegation of GPs from my constituency came to see me yesterday after they had a meeting with Lord Warner at the Department of Health. They are working on a set of alternative proposals for the Forest. I understand that the proposals were of great interest to the Minister. However, if we do not slow down this headlong rush to cuts, it will be too late to implement those proposals, because some of the facilities will already have been closed.</p>
	<p pid="b.1738.1/30">Yesterday, when the Minister of State, the hon. Member for Leigh, replied to the debate on community hospitals, he said,</p>
	<p pid="b.1738.1/31" class="indent">&quot;People want services to be available closer to where they live, and they want health and social care to become more seamless with more personalised and integrated care.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1738.1/32">He continued:</p>
	<p pid="b.1738.1/33" class="indent">&quot;the White Paper laid out clearly our intention to move toward more local and community provision.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1738.1/34">It seems to me that the proposals of the primary care trust move in the opposite direction.</p>
	<p pid="b.1738.1/35">The Minister also said:</p>
	<p pid="b.1738.1/36" class="indent">&quot;It is incumbent upon every one of us, as leaders in our communities, to lead that debate&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="b.1738.1/37">that is, the well-informed debate called for by the NHS Confederation. I am pleased to have played my small part today in holding this one. He also said that during the summer a statement would be made about the amount of capital that the Government would make available for new community facilities. It would be criminal if that statement was made after the facilities in Gloucestershire had already been cut.</p>
	<p pid="b.1738.1/38">In response to the hon. Member for Stroud, the Minister said that the Government were planning</p>
	<p pid="b.1738.1/39" class="indent">&quot;an announcement on the White Paper in due course, which will apply to all kinds of services...it will cover the breadth of services. We want PCTs to look carefully at the White Paper; it is not just words, and we want them to see clearly the direction of travel and provide the kind of services that his constituents and mine want on the ground.&quot;&mdash; [Official Report, <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-24">24 May 2006</phrase>;Vol. 446, c.511-513.]</p>
	<p pid="b.1738.1/40">I agree with that, but if the Minister who is here today wants that vision to take shape in Gloucestershire, it is not enough to say the words; she needs to act.</p>
	<p pid="b.1738.1/41">At the moment the primary care trusts are heading in the opposite direction. By the time the Government make any announcement, the cuts will have been made. I urge the Minister to intervene and send a clear instruction to the strategic health authority and the primary care trust to stop, listen and think again. If she does that, she will have my thanks and that of my hon. Friends. If not, the people of the Forest of Dean and Gloucestershire will not forgive her, or this Labour Government.</p>
