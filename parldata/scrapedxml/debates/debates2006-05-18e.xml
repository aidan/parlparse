Is it not a shame that the Government are apparently examining only one measure of animal welfare, although if they were to follow the lead of our territorial Governments and Assemblies in Scotland and Wales, they would be looking at more measures?

	<p pid="e.1116.1/1">The Government recognise the importance of good animal health and welfare standards in the farming industry, but we are confident that farmers in England already achieve animal welfare standards that are in excess of the minimum legal requirements. That is a matter of good stock management and it makes sound business sense. We try to target scarce resources not towards existing good practice in that area, but to incentivise new ways of making agriculture more competitive and sustainable. We can use other measures in axis 1 to improve the skills base of people in the industry to ensure that we direct resources towards animal welfare.</p>

	<p pid="e.1116.2/2">The Minister's Department shares membership with the Department of Trade and Industry and Post Office Ltd. of a tripartite committee on the development of the rural post office network. Does he agree that many other Government Departments are sadly undermining the future of the post office network by, for example, removing the TV licence, taking benefit payments out of the network and threatening the future of the Post Office card account, and are thus driving people on to the roads to go out of their villages and into towns to access essential services?

	<p pid="e.1116.4/1">The Government recognise that access to essential services through the post office network is critical for the countryside and people living in rural areas. However, we must recognise that the network is not being used as it once was by people in both urban and rural areas. Customers have voted with their feet. The loss to the network started long before 1993, the changes regarding the Post Office card account and the direct payment of benefits. If the Government are to act responsibly, they must ensure that they get the maximum benefit to people through services. However, they must examine new ways of delivering those services, such as through the internet, as the customer demands that we should. We need to meet customers' needs in the way in which they want us to.</p>

	<p pid="e.1116.5/1">I welcome the Minister to his new role. I think that the closest that he has come to farming in the past is Farm road, which is a small lane in his constituency.</p>
	<p pid="e.1116.5/2">Has the Minister read pages 33 and 34 of the consultation, which propose that animal welfare payments are excluded from the new programme? Has his Department failed to understand that that money could be used to improve animal welfare, as well as to reduce the advantage of cheap imports from foreign countries that put a low value on animal welfare? Given that the programme in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will support animal welfare, why is England being left behind?</p>

	<p pid="e.1117.0/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for his welcome to my new duties. If one were to consider a Minister having a farming constituency a sufficient condition of all going well in the countryside, rural communities would never have suffered the outbreaks of BSE and of salmonella in poultry that they experienced under Tory grandees. Let Ministers be judged on their actions, not on their provenance.</p>
	<p pid="e.1117.0/2">The hon. Gentleman failed to listen to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1850" name="David Drew">my response to my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew)</phrase>. Far from excluding animal welfare from the rural development programme, we have specifically stated ways in which we can deliver on that agenda through training and access to skills under axis 1 and axis 3. After the Curry commission, the Government's clear focus is, rightly, on establishing environmental standards and stewardship at the heart of our efforts. That is the future of farming and farmers in this country.</p>

	<p pid="e.1117.3/1">Emissions from international aviation and maritime transport were not included in the 1997 Kyoto protocol.

	<p pid="e.1117.4/1">I am sure that the Minister is aware of the recent work done at Manchester university that shows that if international pollution from sources such as aviation and shipping is included in the calculation of emissions, the UK has made no reduction in carbon dioxide emissions since 1990. Will he commit to working with his European partners to establish an EU framework to reduce the emissions involved in international pollution? Does not that problem underline the fact that although all of us must do what we can as individuals to combat environmental pollution, ultimately the answer lies at international level and in global agreements?</p>

	<p pid="e.1117.5/1">My hon. Friend is entirely right. I am aware of the research conducted by Manchester university. The issue that he describes is the reason why the Government are so committed to taking action internationally. As I said, we want the aviation sector to be included in the EU ETS, and one of the achievements of the UK presidency last year was to get the Environment Council in December to agree that the Commission would make proposals this year on aviation's inclusion in the scheme. We shall continue to press the Commission on that.</p>

	<p pid="e.1118.1/1">I shall be happy to meet the hon. Gentleman. The aerospace industry is critical to the north-west and the region that he represents. I recently had the opportunity to go round the Airbus factory in Toulouse, where I saw the new A380, which is being flown into Heathrow today. It is an enormous piece of engineering and a tribute to British expertise&mdash;for example, the Rolls-Royce engines are far more environmentally friendly than their predecessors. It is something of which we can be proud.</p>

	<p pid="e.1118.2/1">My hon. Friend will be aware that the aviation industry is widely reported to support the establishment of an emissions trading scheme within the EU, but he will also know that there is no prospect of replacing aviation kerosene with a low or zero-carbon fuel. There is therefore a danger that, under an emissions trading scheme, the aviation industry will simply purchase credits from other sectors that have succeeded in making cuts, without doing so itself. Does he agree that much greater pressure must be brought to bear to boost scientific research into aviation fuels and engines, so that the industry itself can contribute to significant cuts in the future?</p>

	<p pid="e.1118.3/1">I know that my hon. Friend takes a deep interest in these matters. He is right to say that more research into improving fuel technologies is needed. That work is happening now, but that does not detract from the fact that we want aviation to be included in the EU ETS and, as a Government, we shall continue to press for that.</p>

	<p pid="e.1118.4/1">May I first express my condolences to the family of Eric Forth? It is shocking that someone who made such a lively and vigorous contribution to the proceedings of the House should be struck down in such a way. I will miss sparring with him, not least on the issues that we are discussing today, such as climate change.</p>
	<p pid="e.1118.4/2">Does the Minister agree that an 8 per cent. fall in revenue in four years against a 35 per cent. rise in the number of air passengers makes a mockery of air passenger duty, and that it should be restructured so as to be based on emissions to encourage full flights? Will the hon. Gentleman undertake to raise this matter with his colleagues, including the Chancellor of the Exchequer? Does he agree that the issue is symptomatic of a failure properly to examine the potential environmental impact of green taxes across the board? Will he urge his Treasury colleagues to bring forward a comprehensive review of environmental tax incentives?</p>

	<p pid="e.1119.0/1">No, I cannot agree with the hon. Gentleman on green taxation policy. As a Government, we have made major improvements. We shall continue to review matters such as air passenger duty. We should not underestimate the achievements that have been made. The UK is one of the few countries that is on target to meet its Kyoto commitments. I am proud of that fact. The climate change programme that we published in March sets out a range of actions. We have set a direction of travel for the UK that is leading the world. We need now to continue to push internationally to get other countries to follow the same policies as those of the United Kingdom. That action is needed urgently if we are to tackle the greatest problem facing the planet in the long term.</p>

	<p pid="e.1119.1/1">The whole House has been shocked by the news about Eric Forth. I join with those who have sent condolences to his wife and family. He was a formidable parliamentarian and he will be greatly missed.</p>
	<p pid="e.1119.1/2">May I further illustrate the scale of the challenge that is posed by aviation emissions? Everyone knows that the problem at present is quite small, but statistics show that emissions are growing by about 12 per cent. a year. Assuming that we meet the 60 per cent. total emission reduction target by 2050, and using figures based on public transport forecasts and those of the Treasury, aviation emissions are on track to represent about 60 per cent. of the UK total by 2050. That calculation is supported by the Environment Audit Committee and by the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution.</p>
	<p pid="e.1119.1/3">So far, the Government's position, first, has been to leave aviation emissions out of the calculations, which is clearly untenable. Secondly, they hope&mdash;we have heard about this again this morning&mdash;that aviation can be included in the troubled EU emissions trading scheme.

	<p pid="e.1119.2/2">The hon. Gentleman is right that we want to see aviation fuel as part of an emissions trading scheme. We need to take action on aviation fuel. That is why, through the United Nations framework convention on climate change and the International Civil Aviation Organisation, the United Kingdom is pushing to ensure that international action is taken. International industries need international solutions. That is why it is so important that we take this action. It is right that aviation fuel represents about only 5 per cent. of UK emissions, but the use of it is planned to increase. That is why we need to take urgent action. We need to commit ourselves internationally.</p>

	<p pid="e.1120.3/1">Mr. Speaker, I hope that you will allow me to associate the entire ministerial team at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs with the shock and dismay expressed by Members on both sides of the House about the untimely death of Eric Forth. He was utterly committed not just to his constituency, but to the House of Commons, and he was an important example to us all.</p>
	<p pid="e.1120.3/2">Officials effectively applied for an extension for the payment deadline to the European Commission in April, but I am relieved to report to the House that, according to the latest figures, 87 per cent. of payments have now been disbursed to 76 per cent. of claimants. Four DEFRA Officials, including chief executive Mark Addison, have been temporarily loaned to the Rural Payments Agency for different periods to strengthen the agency's capacity to deal with the current problems associated with the single payment scheme.</p>

	<p pid="e.1120.4/1">We welcome the Secretary of State to his new post, but I hope that he appreciates that farmers began to feel unloved when we had three farm Ministers in five days. Why were part-payments not made to farmers in January and will they receive any compensation for the interest on their debts and borrowings? There is another mystery to resolve. In April, officials wrote to the European Commission asking for an extension but, at the same time, the previous Secretary of State told the House that all was well. Those two facts are irreconcilable, but perhaps he can try to reconcile them.</p>

	<p pid="e.1120.5/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for his welcome. There was no technical reason why partial payments could not have been made in January, but all the advice that Ministers received was that the scheme was on track. When it became clear that it was off track we had to take emergency measures. I hope that farmers in his constituency have received partial payments, as 31,000 have been made. By the middle of April, it was appropriate to approach the European Commission&mdash;officials have done so, and we await a reply. Our priority is obviously to make sure that the payments are made. There are about 3,700 large claims that are still waiting to be made&mdash;the figure is down from the 5,000 a week ago&mdash;and a remaining 20 per cent. payment must be made to the 31,000 farmers who have received partial payments. Finally, there is the question of small claims of less than &euro;1,000. More than half of the claimants in that category&mdash;about 40,000 or so&mdash;have received payment, but we want to make sure that the rest of them do so.</p>

	<p pid="e.1121.0/1">As a farmer, I have dealings with the Rural Payments Agency and I can tell the new ministerial team that it is hopelessly bureaucratic, over-staffed and astonishingly inefficient. The debacle over the single farm payment has caused hardship for many farmers across the country, and they are in serious difficulty. The chief executive has been moved, my neighbour and friend, Lord Bach, has been sacked and, bizarrely, the previous Secretary of State was promoted. However, the whole organisation needs a shake-up. Will the new ministerial team look at the way in which the RPA functions and shake it up from top to bottom? As Ministers are new to the job, they have a good opportunity to make the agency work for the benefit of agriculture, the environment and the farming industry.</p>

	<p pid="e.1121.1/1">Given that our priority is to get the money out to farming communities, the last thing that we should do is give the organisation a great big shake. The priority is to get the money out properly, but it is right, as I said in my statement last week, to learn the lessons of the difficulties of 2005. I make no attempt to hide the difficulties that continue to challenge us in 2006, but I am determined, with the new chief executive, to ensure that we establish a dependable organisation with which farmers such as the hon. Gentleman can deal efficiently.</p>

	<p pid="e.1121.2/2">Indebtedness in British agriculture now stands at &pound;9.3 billion, which is an increase of &pound;8 million on the figure 12 months ago. Increased borrowing involves increased costs in interest rates and arrangement fees, which the industry can ill afford. English farmers are a special case, because almost every other European nation managed to make the payment at the beginning of the payment window. Will the Secretary of State make arrangements to meet the EU Commissioner soon to work out a special compensation scheme so that English farmers do not bear the cost of the Government's crass incompetence?</p>

	<p pid="e.1121.3/1">I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will be pleased to know that I shall be attending my first Agriculture Council on Monday&mdash;a treat reserved for the lucky few. I gather that it is a process designed to convince those of us of strong pro-European credentials that we could not be more right, and that the European Union is the most perfect organisation to deal with. I will meet the Commissioner on Monday. It is important that we give out a message from our Department that we are proud of the work of British farmers, that the British food that they produce is top quality, and that we are determined to work with them to support the environment in which they live and to ensure not only that the farming payments are made, but that the diversification that they have led over the past few years continues. For me, farmers are at the front line of the fight against climate change and we must ensure that they are supported in their activities.</p>

The Hunter review is going through. We are determined to learn the lessons, but in the two meetings that I have had so far, my priority has been to make sure, first, that the partial payments go out to provide relief, and secondly, that we have a clear sense of priorities to tackle the outstanding claims. The fact that those 5,000 complex cases that I reported last week are now down to about 3,700 is a sign of progress made by the staff of the agency.</p>

He takes over at a time when the distrust of the Government by farmers is probably at its lowest ebb since 1947&mdash;<i> [Interruption.]</i> I am delighted that hon. Members take such pleasure in the distrust of the Government by farmers. The partial payments are welcome, though long overdue, and the Minister has just said that the 5,000-odd complex cases have been reduced to 3,700, which I am glad to hear, but those&mdash;they are all large farmers&mdash;have received nothing. Also, as the Secretary of State will know, by last Monday farmers were required to claim this year's for payment on their entitlements, even though the vast majority have not had their entitlements validated, so their difficulty in filling in an accurate form is obvious. As he has asked for the extension to the payment window, why does he not also ask for an extension to this year's claim date, as Poland has already done, so that those claims can be based on validated entitlements, otherwise he will face thousands of individual disputes next year about why claims have been incorrectly submitted, based on false evidence and false information from the Rural Payments Agency?</p>

I include the United States in that&mdash;notably many of the states of the US, which are keen to participate in international action. That is significant. I can confirm to my hon.

	<p pid="e.1125.7/1">First, let us be clear about the Prime Minister's comments. He was referring to the fact that, if present policy remains unchanged, we shall become heavily dependent on imported gas, moving from being 80 to 90 per cent. self-reliant to being 80 to 90 per cent. dependent. He said that that meant that the replacement of nuclear power stations, along with a big push towards renewables and a step change in energy efficiency, engaging businesses and consumers, were all back on the agenda. The energy review is looking at all those issues and it will come up with a balanced result. Biomass can be part of the overall picture. Sir Ben Gill's report says that it has the potential to provide 6 per cent. of our energy needs by 2020, and that is very much to be welcomed. The figure is only 1 per cent. at the moment, so we have a long way to go if we are to achieve that, but important developments are taking place with biomass and biofuels that give us optimism for the future.</p>

Members might have seen the hysterical scare stories I yesterday's newspapers about the amount of carbon dioxide being released from Drax power station. Up to April, however, the power station was co-firing coal with biomass up to a rate of 25 per cent. However, the regulations that were imposed from <phrase class="date" code="">1 April</phrase> this year have reduced the biomass element of the co-firing to 15 per cent. Will my hon.

One of the main difficulties is gaining access to the national grid, which takes an extraordinary amount of time compared with the time it takes to get the initiative developed.

	<p pid="e.1127.3/1">There are a number of points about grid access and access charges that are important and which we are looking at as part of our future policy on biomass, but my hon. Friend is right to point out that there is a growing industry here and growing interest in biomass. There is also an interest from growers in growing energy crops, whether it be Miscanthus or short rotation coppice willow. We need to ensure that we can help to drive the market in those renewable energy projects. The introduction of new building regulations from April this year, as well as new procedures and tougher standards as part of that, can be helpful in getting more companies and public sector organisations to consider biomass energy part of their energy solutions.</p>

It would be improper for me to comment on an individual planning application, although I remind him that the Government have changed the planning guidance to make it more difficult to build out-of-town supermarkets of the type to which he refers. I was also pleased this week to see the major supermarkets, including Tesco, almost falling over each other in an attempt to prove their green credentials&mdash;not unrelated, I think, to the Government's recent publication of our new sustainable food and farming policy.</p>

	<p pid="e.1130.6/1">I do not want to be too hard on the hon.

If he had read my written statement last week, he would have seen the explanation: there were 5,000 particularly complex cases in which partial payment was not possible, but we had given priority to ensuring that those cases were dealt with properly. If he had been here earlier, he would have heard me say that the number of cases is no longer 5,000, but is now 3,700.

	<p pid="e.1131.7/1">That was a disappointing reply. Is it not a fact that the number of UK food miles has increased owing to the inexcusable chaos of single farm payments in the Department? Leicestershire farmers are struggling, at the mercy of their bank managers and unable even to pay for fertilisers to make their crops grow. Has that not increased the UK food miles problem?

	<p pid="e.1131.8/1">It is stretching a point to breaking-point to say that the single farm payment is responsible for the increase in food miles. We are trying to work closely with the industry to improve resource efficiency, which will enable us to address the food miles problem. Clearly, one issue is people driving to supermarkets and shops to buy their goods, but we must also consider the carbon dioxide emissions produced by HGVs. The more that we can improve efficiency, the better will be the impact on the environment. That is why the champions group has been set up, which we hope will help us to achieve our target of a 20 per cent. reduction by 2012.</p>

	<p pid="e.1132.1/1">I am not sure whether including food miles on the label would be that beneficial. When one reads on a label that the produce's country of origin is Kenya, and that produce is beans, one can draw one's own conclusions. I am very attracted to the idea that we should buy more local produce, and farmers' markets, to which reference has been made, are an extremely worthwhile initiative in that regard. The more that we can buy local and source local, the better will be the impact on the environment.</p>

The party pretends to be green, but it is hardly surprising that when it gets into office it is the old slash and burn Thatcherite Tory party, especially on waste and environmental issues. I will look at the matter he raises, and he is right to say that we need better strategic planning for waste infrastructure in London.</p>

	<p pid="e.1135.2/1">Before announcing the business for the week ahead, I wish to express my sorrow at <phrase class="honfriend" id="unknown" name="None">the sudden death of the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Mr. Forth)</phrase>. The Conservative party has lost one of its stars and this House has lost a great parliamentarian. He brightened this place with his ties, his waistcoats and his love of country and western music, but above all with his personality. Eric served this Parliament with great distinction in many capacities, including on Committees, on the Speaker's Panel, in the Chamber and holding court in the Tea Room, offering advice to all comers, including myself&mdash;and very sage advice it was. But the House will recall particularly with great warmth Eric's weekly encounters with the late Robin Cook, when Robin was Leader of the House and Eric was the shadow Leader of the House. Each sharpened his wit on the other, to the great entertainment and elucidation of the rest of us. Our sympathies and prayers go to Eric's wife, Carroll, his three children, his friends and all his constituents.</p>

	<p pid="e.1135.3/1">I thank the Leader of the House for giving us the business for the coming week and I echo the sentiments he expressed about <phrase class="honfriend" id="unknown" name="None">my late right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Mr. Forth)</phrase>. It was with deep shock and sadness that I and my right hon. and hon. Friends learned this morning of Eric's untimely death. Eric was a former shadow Leader of the House and his skirmishes each week with the late Robin Cook became legendary. Eric was above all a great parliamentarian, who loved this place and all it stood for. Never a man to pull his punches and not always beloved of the Whips or, dare I say it, Front Benchers, he was a great asset to this House. More than that, many in this House across all parties have lost not only a great colleague, but a friend. The life of this House will be the lesser for his passing. It was a mark of the man and his personality, to which the Leader of the House alluded, that the staff of the Tea Room expressed their tremendous sadness this morning, too. He had been a friend to them, not just to Members of Parliament. We have lost a great parliamentarian and we all mourn his loss. Our thoughts and prayers are with his wife, Carroll, and his family, friends and constituents.</p>
	<p pid="e.1135.3/2">I am sure that the Leader of the House is aware of the importance of a good conclusion to the Doha round of world trade talks, not only for this country, but for the whole developing world. May we have a debate on world trade so that we can explore the Government's position and ensure that they are putting sufficient pressure for the right conclusion of this round of trade talks on the European Trade Commissioner?</p>
	<p pid="e.1135.3/3">This week, it has been announced that 573 jobs will be lost at NHS Direct, in addition to the thousands of jobs being lost in hospitals across the country. May we have a statement from the Secretary of State for Heath on the future of NHS Direct?</p>
	<p pid="e.1135.3/4">However, that is not the only part of the NHS that is suffering financial problems. For example, the Thames Valley strategic health authority already gets 21 per cent. less funding than the average, and it has admitted that that has resulted in fewer operations and less patient care. In a presentation to the board last week, the SHA's chief executive revealed that introducing a national standard tariff across the NHS would mean that it would cost Thames Valley PCTs &pound;70 million extra a year to provide the same services&mdash;there would be no gain in activity or in the services provided. That is just one example, so it is little wonder that people ask where all the money has gone. Therefore, may we also have a debate on the future funding of NHS trusts and the impact of the standard tariff?</p>
	<p pid="e.1135.3/5">That is the NHS that the Health Secretary said had had its best year ever&mdash;where on earth has she been? But that is not the only area where the Government are in denial. The head of the civil service has said of the Immigration and Nationality Directorate's work on asylum that it has &quot;been performing particularly well&quot;, and the Prime Minster wrote to the incoming Home Secretary advising him to &quot;continue and accelerate&quot; the success of the Government's immigration and asylum policies.</p>
	<p pid="e.1135.3/6">That is the same Home Office where only 16 per cent. of officials have confidence in senior management. The director of enforcement and renewals at the immigration and nationality directorate was asked by the Home Affairs Committee how many people were in Britain illegally. He said:</p>
	<p pid="e.1135.3/7" class="indent">&quot;I haven't the faintest idea&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="e.1135.3/8">When asked how many people had been removed when all their appeal processes had been exhausted, he said:</p>
	<p pid="e.1135.3/9" class="indent">&quot;We don't track individual cases&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="e.1135.3/10">Therefore, can we have a debate on the chaos in the Government's prisons and immigration polices?</p>
	<p pid="e.1135.3/11">Perhaps that is why, in a recent speech, the Prime Minister revealed that he was asking the Chancellor to examine how the Treasury could be involved in ensuring the protection and security of the public. When asked if that meant that the Home Secretary would have to refer to the Chancellor before making any decisions, the Downing street spokesman said:</p>
	<p pid="e.1135.3/12" class="indent">&quot;No. The Home Secretary and the Chancellor will have a normal relationship&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="e.1135.3/13">Presumably, that will be in contrast to the relationship between the Chancellor and the Prime Minister. Up until now, the Chancellor has been the roadblock to reform, so can we have a debate in his future role in public sector reform?</p>
	<p pid="e.1135.3/14">Finally, in an article in the <i> Eastern Daily Press</i>, the sacked former Home Secretary said of the recent reshuffle:</p>
	<p pid="e.1135.3/15" class="indent">&quot;I thought the point was to give a clear sense of redirection for the Government but, in the end, it hasn't worked out like that.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="e.1135.3/16">So the former Home Secretary says that the Government lack direction, the Health Secretary is in denial, and the Home Office is in meltdown&mdash;no wonder this is a Government in paralysis.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-05-18e.1137.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1423" speakername="Jack Straw" colnum="1137"  time="011:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060518/debtext/60518-0004.htm#060518114000605">
	<p pid="e.1137.0/1">I shall deal in turn with the points raised by the right hon. Lady. We are doing a great deal to apply pressure where that is required, as I can confirm from my five years as Foreign Secretary. We took the lead in the EU in pushing for an end to unacceptably high and restrictive subsidies to farmers across Europe. My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary used to be Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and was in the lead in negotiating the deal on the future of the common agricultural policy.</p>
	<p pid="e.1137.0/2">In addition, we are also pushing the US and other key partners in the Doha round, and especially the much larger states from the non-aligned movement, such as India and Brazil. Those states must also make some movement, and especially in respect of non-agricultural market access. I assure the shadow Leader of the House that there will be an opportunity to debate these matters in the regular six-monthly debate due to take place just before the European Council in mid-June. That will be a full day's debate, and I hope that she and the rest of the House will take that opportunity to discuss the matters that she has raised and other key foreign policy issues coming up before the Council, such as Iraq, Iran and the funding of Hamas.</p>
	<p pid="e.1137.0/3">The right hon. Lady asks about the health service. She is not correct in claiming that thousands of people will lose their jobs under changes in NHS funding. She asks where the money has gone. It has gone, first, on dramatic increases in the number of clinical staff in the health service. Overall, there has been an increase of 85,000 in the total number of nurses in the health service, including an increase of nearly 3,000 in the health area covering her constituency.</p>
	<p pid="e.1137.0/4">Secondly, the money has gone on ensuring that nurses and other clinical staff are better paid. The number of nurses has increased by well over a quarter since 1997 and, alongside that, the pay of nurses, in real terms after inflation, has also increased by over a quarter.</p>
	<p pid="e.1137.0/5">Thirdly, the money has gone on new hospital buildings, to an astonishing degree, including in my constituency and in most constituencies in the country. Fourthly, it has gone on equipment. That is why there are difficulties with the health service&mdash;there always will be&mdash;but overall, on the question of whether the health service is doing the job for which the taxpayer is paying, yes it is, which is why levels of patient satisfaction are higher and why overall, on any measure, patients are receiving better care faster, and mortality and morbidity rates all show improvement.</p>
	<p pid="e.1137.0/6">The right hon. Lady asks about asylum and immigration. Asylum numbers are significantly lower than when we came into office in 1997. I have every reason to remember the catastrophic record of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1587" name="Michael Howard">the right hon. and learned Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Mr. Howard)</phrase>, who had ordered a computer system, failed to finance it properly and, at a time when numbers of asylum seekers were rising, slashed by 1,200 the number of staff in the immigration and nationality department dealing with asylum seekers. On top of that, he had declared an amnesty in which 30,000 of those people were allowed to stay in the country without further proper inquiry.</p>
	<p pid="e.1137.0/7">Numbers are now down, and we have passed the tipping point where the numbers leaving the country are higher than the numbers applying to stay. We have reduced the time taken to process applications from20 months to about two months.</p>
	<p pid="e.1137.0/8">On the number of illegal asylum seekers, the Prime Minister reminded the House yesterday of the following:</p>
	<p pid="e.1137.0/9" class="indent">&quot;'There are no official estimates of the number of illegal immigrants into the United Kingdom. By its very nature, illegal immigration is difficult to measure and any estimates would be highly speculative.'&quot;&mdash;[<i> Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-17">17 May 2006</phrase>; Vol. 446,c. 991.]</p>
	<p pid="e.1137.0/10">That is what the right hon. and learned Member for Folkestone and Hythe said in 1995. There are slightly better estimates these days, following work by Professor Salt for the research and information directorate of the Home Office, who estimated that the total number of people who are wholly illegal was between 310,000 and 500,000. Those are not asylum seekers; we know how many asylum seekers there are.</p>
	<p pid="e.1137.0/11">I am glad to see the shadow Home Secretary sitting next to the right hon. Lady. Whatever other promises he makes at the next election about how life will be so much better when he becomes Home Secretary&mdash;that every prisoner will become compliant, every criminal will stop committing crime and, probably much easier to achieve, that there will be no illegal immigrants because they will be scared off by the disaster of the Conservative Government&mdash;I strongly advise him not to claim that he will be able to produce an accurate estimate of the total number of illegal immigrants. That would be very unwise, as he knows. Why? Because people who are wholly illegally in this country, as in every other country, have escaped immigration control and thus, by definition, do not appear on any database. No country in the world has accurate figures for wholly illegal immigration: not the United States and not the country held up as having the greatest and most efficient system of law and order in Europe&mdash;if not the highest respect for human rights&mdash;namely, France. The French have hundreds of thousands of people who are &quot;sans papiers.&quot; They do not know the numbers and they do not take much interest in them.</p>

	<p pid="e.1139.1/1">From these Benches, may we join the tributes to Eric Forth? Business questions was his natural stage, and one on which he always excelled. Even at his most provocative, he was never less than entertaining and never less than perceptive. No one was ever in any doubt what Eric Forth thought about anything, and behind the undoubted style there was real substance. He was an ornament to the House, and he will be sorely missed.</p>
	<p pid="e.1139.1/2">May we have an urgent debate on nuclear power in this country? It is clearly no good waiting for the results of the energy review, because the Prime Minister has transparently decided to pre-empt the results of that review. Therefore, given the reservations that have been expressed, quite openly, by a former Minister in the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the fact that the Treasury has said that the costs are likely to be eye-wateringly large, is it not time that the whole House had an opportunity to debate the matter?</p>
	<p pid="e.1139.1/3">If and when orders are introduced for the regionalisation of police forces&mdash;given the difficulties that have been experienced over recent days in Wales, that may not happen&mdash;can they be brought before the whole House, so that all hon. Members have the opportunity to raise the issues that are relevant to our constituencies?</p>
	<p pid="e.1139.1/4">It was two weeks ago, I think, that the Government was reshuffled, but still no list of ministerial responsibilities is available. Can the Leader of the House sort that out? We apparently now know what the Deputy Prime Minister is doing, but it would be nice to see which Ministers feel that they have which responsibilities, so that we can perhaps hold them to account rather better than we would otherwise.</p>
	<p pid="e.1139.1/5">Lastly, may we have a debate on the Human Rights Act 1998? Two weeks ago, the problem was the then Home Secretary; now it seems that everything is down to the exercise of the Human Rights Act. Frankly, the Prime Minister has been saying some very silly things about that Act over recent weeks. Given that some of us believe that the finest achievement of the Leader of the House, when he was Home Secretary, was to introduce the Human Rights Act, may we have a debate to defend the reputation of that Act and of the right hon. Gentleman?</p>

	<p pid="e.1139.2/1">On nuclear power, I cannot promise when there will be a debate on the issue, but the energy review will be published and then, in due course, there will be a debate on this country's future energy needs, including the role that nuclear power should play. Let me point out to the hon. Gentleman that people forget that nuclear energy currently plays an extraordinarily important part in energy generation.

	<p pid="e.1140.1/1">I am very happy to explain, but afterwards. That is 20 per cent. of total electricity generation. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1824" name="David Heath">The hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath)</phrase> will know that, because of the decline in North sea production of gas in particular and oil, unless we take other steps to rebalance the generation of energy, including nuclear power, we will become quite unnecessarily reliant on overseas sources of energy. He will also know that the idea that renewables could possibly replace the loss of generating capacity from nuclear power is simply not the case. Even in a country such as Germany that has huge numbers of wind farms&mdash;far more than I think would ever be found acceptable here; its generation of electricity by wind is only a third of that generated by nuclear power in this country.</p>
	<p pid="e.1140.1/2">On the regionalisation of police forces, the orders will go through the House in the normal way. I cannot recall the procedure exactly, but I think that many of them will be taken upstairs. On the reorganisation of police forces, I know, as a former Home Secretary&mdash;everybody in the House knows it&mdash;there is simply no necessary connection between the efficiency of a police service, the degree to which the service is delivered at a local level and the overall size of the constabulary. Moreover, the current boundaries were in effect settled following the royal commission report on the police in the early 1960s. Forty years on is not too short a time to reconfigure police force boundaries to take account of the dramatic changes in our social structure in the meantime.</p>
	<p pid="e.1140.1/3">On a list of ministerial responsibilities, there are in the Library of the House and available on the website letters that my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister has sent to each departmental Minister setting out responsibilities. The detailed list of ministerial responsibilities will be published in the normal way. However, having watched oral questions every day since I became Leader of the House, I cannot say that the absence of the list has caused any difficulty whatsoever to either Ministers or Members.</p>
	<p pid="e.1140.1/4">On the Human Rights Act, the hon. Gentleman says that it was the finest thing that I ever did as Home Secretary. If he does not mind, I would like to say that it is one of the finest of a long list. Future historians of the Home Office may say that the finest thing that I ever did as Home Secretary was to survive four years.</p>

On the issue of accuracy, all journalists, including those at the BBC, have a responsibility to ensure that quotations are attributed accurately.</p>

	<p pid="e.1141.2/1">As Eric Forth's neighbouring MP in Bromley, may I just say a few words in addition to the very fine tributes by the Leader of the House and the shadow Leader of the House? As they have said, he will be mainly remembered as a stout defender of the role of the House of Commons and a great House of Commons man. Not everyone in the House may realise, as I did as his neighbour, that, in many ways, he was an old softie at heart. The comments made by the shadow Leader of the House about the reaction in the Tea Room reinforced that. He was a very good neighbour to me and when I faced some difficulty in the last general election, he was the first to come and help out. He was there early in the morning; no nonsense, getting on with it and saying, &quot;I will deliver anything you want.&quot; The House may like to know that, in Bromley, he was regarded with great affection, as well as great respect, for an outstanding independence of spirit. He will be greatly missed.</p>

	<p pid="e.1142.0/1">My hon. Friend has put the position of the NHS in Leicester in context. There has been a significant improvement in funding in Leicestershire. The number of nurses is up 1,600 in the health authority area, there are nearly 700 more doctors, including 250 more consultants, and a lot of capital investment. I cannot promise him a debate on the Floor of the House, but there are many opportunities to raise the matter on the Adjournment, including in Westminster Hall, and I hope that he will take them.

He came to the Opposition day health debate and noted my disgust that the Secretary of State for Health refuses to grapple with the situation in Shropshire in which early-stage breast cancer sufferers with Cheshire, Staffordshire or Welsh addresses can get Herceptin on the NHS paid out of their taxes, while those with a Shropshire address have to pay &pound;47,000. I have raised the matter on several occasions at business questions. Will the Leader of the House please try to get the Secretary of State to come to the Chamber and answer questions directly, or, even better, effect a meeting between me and the Secretary of State? We now have the horror of breast cancer sufferers being camped out overnight at the primary care trust offices. The situation is dreadful and, in a civilised society such as ours, intolerable, so I would be most grateful if the new Leader of the House would intervene on it.</p>

	<p pid="e.1143.1/1">As the hon. Gentleman mentions, I was indeed present for the Opposition day debate on the health service. I listened carefully to the opening speeches made by the Opposition spokesman and by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health. The hon. Gentleman's criticisms of the way in which my right hon. Friend responded to the question are not justified. As I sat next to her, she tried to address the difficult issue. I understand the hon.

However, if I am wrong about that, I will of course write to him and put a note about that in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="e.1143.1/2">Everyone in the House has to recognise that when new drugs are developed or are specific to not only conditions such as cancer, but certain stages of cancers, there will be fine judgments to be made about when and where they ought to be used.

Gentleman's criticism was uncalled for, I will discuss the matter further with my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State.</p>

	<p pid="e.1144.2/1">As a matter of fact, I was very enthusiastic about having such a debate. As I told the House last week, I was putting in requests to the former Leader of the House for a debate on Iraq, Iran and the middle east more generally. Iraq has been discussed on the Floor of the House on many occasions, although, as far as I recall, the right hon. and learned Gentleman is correct in saying that a formal debate on Iraq has not been flagged up over the past year. There will be an opportunity next week further to discuss Iraq in the context of the Armed Forces Bill. As I said in reply to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1700" name="Theresa May">the right hon. Member for Maidenhead (Mrs. May)</phrase>, there will be another opportunity to discuss it in the middle of June in the debate on the European Council.

Under the UN framework convention on climate change, the UK has a commitment to mitigate emissions and make progress on adaptation&mdash;dealing with effects. The Government have a good and enviable record on mitigating emissions, but their record on dealing with effects and adapting to the inevitable climate change that is coming is, frankly, woeful. We have done almost nothing to adapt to the situation. Greenhouse gases and the greenhouse effect have been known about for more than 30 years and the European Union is to produce a Green Paper on the matter by the end of the year, but we are in danger of fiddling while the world burns.

However, I resist his criticism of our record. I cannot recall any Government in the industrialised world who have been more in the lead on trying to tackle climate change than the British Government. Our right hon. Friend the Prime Minister put the matter right at the top of the G8 agenda, not because it was an easy subject or comfortable for other G8 partners, but precisely because the subject was difficult and he believed that all G8 partners needed to do more on climate change&mdash;he actually forced them to do so. I could give my hon. Friend all the numbers. He said that we have cut emissions. Our scheme reduced emissions by 1.5 million tonnes between 2002 and 2004. However, this is an international problem. Even if we were to abolish our emissions altogether, without international action by other parties, including, especially, the United States, China and India, we would be making only a marginal contribution. We are in the lead and the matter is a profound priority for the Government.</p>

A man was arrested in London last year who had a lab in his kitchen that was capable of producing 1 million tablets a day.

	<p pid="e.1146.3/2">A former Member of this House who is still a Member of the other place was given a lengthy prison sentence for acting irresponsibly and endangering people's lives, but when company directors act irresponsibly and not only endanger people's lives, but cause their employees and other people to lose their lives, they are given a paltry fine, which is probably tax deductible. What are the Government doing to end that unfair and inconsistent practice and to right that wrong?</p>

Whether we should amend the law in respect of corporate manslaughter is a separate issue, and my hon. Friend may be aware that our right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for the Home Department has plans to do that. He is considering legislation, but is anxious to ensure that it is fair both to victims and potential victims and to company directors.</p>

	<p pid="e.1147.0/1">May I thank the right hon. Gentleman for his handsome and generous tribute to my right hon. Friend the late Eric Forth? As others have said, the important thing about Eric Forth is that he was deadly serious about defending the rights and freedoms that over the generations this House has hard won from over-mighty Executives, and he believed, rightly, that we should do that better. We shall genuinely miss him.</p>
	<p pid="e.1147.0/2">The Leader of the House will, I am sure, have heard that I am to chair a big public meeting in East Grinstead tomorrow night as part of the formal consultation on the Government's wicked plan to impose excess further housing in the south-east of England. Does he agree that, by any stretch of the imagination, the scale of the developments is clearly in breach of the Government's own benchmark for sustainability? Given <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1857" name="Peter Ainsworth">the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for East Surrey (Mr. Ainsworth)</phrase> yesterday in his urgent question on the water supply, and given the inadequacy of the roads and railways and the fact that public services in the area are extremely overstretched, will the right hon. Gentleman ensure that we in this House have a chance to debate the infrastructure's inability to keep up with the Government's plans for increased house building in the south of England, particularly in Mid-Sussex?</p>

	<p pid="e.1147.1/1">First, I thank the hon. Gentleman for his tribute in respect of Eric Forth. The reason why the tributes have been so full is that Eric Forth cared about this place. In my judgment, caring about Parliament is not a matter of sentiment; it is absolutely fundamental to the working of our democracy and to good government.</p>
	<p pid="e.1147.1/2">Of course I had heard that the hon. Gentleman is to speak at the meeting tomorrow night. I am pleased to say that the news had even reached Blackburn, and I believe that train reservations are in hand.</p>
	<p pid="e.1147.1/3">I noticed a flicker of a smile cross the hon. Gentleman's lips as he described the plans as &quot;wicked&quot;. Let me say to him and to other Members&mdash;particularly Opposition Members&mdash;who represent rural and suburban constituencies in the south-east that nothing would please Environment Ministers more than if no plans were necessary to increase the number of available houses in the south-east. The truth is, however, that demand for housing in the south-east greatly exceeds supply. I wish that many of the hon. Gentleman's constituents would recognise the attractions of the north-west, including my Blackburn constituency, and move there, but they are not going to. The choice for the Government, for him, for his local authority and for every other Member of the House is between allowing a dramatic and continuing increase in house prices to squeeze out the very people who need to live in those areas, and ensuring a sensible increase in housing so that prices decrease and those who live in those areas are able to stay there. That is the choice, and the debate is not helped by the use of extravagant adjectives. Every house in the country was new at one time.</p>

	<p pid="e.1147.2/1">Eric Forth was a close personal friend and I am deeply distressed by his early passing. Hon. Members right across the House have rightly paid generous tribute to him, and that is well merited. May I ask the Leader of the House, who gave a most generous personal tribute, to arrange a debate on how the authority of this House and the authority of the Government and the Executive might be rebalanced? There could be no better tribute to the late Eric Forth than to redress the balance between the Executive and Back-Bench Members of the House of Commons.</p>

	<p pid="e.1148.0/1">I know of the close friendship between the hon. Gentleman and Eric Forth. Both could often be found in the Tea Room talking about over-mighty Governments, particularly during the period of the Major Government.</p>
	<p pid="e.1148.0/2">The hon. Gentleman, as a former Chairman of the Procedure Committee and a member of the Modernisation Committee, will know that there are many opportunities to debate that subject. He will also know that, in a public session of the Modernisation Committee yesterday, we received evidence from three academics, one of whom made the point that the accountability of Ministers to Parliament had been strengthened significantly in the past 50 years, not least through the introduction 25 years ago of the Select Committee process. I am strongly in favour of improving the accountability, and the perception of accountability, of Ministers, but we must not believe that the position has worsened in the past 50 years when, in fact, it has got significantly better.</p>

	<p pid="e.1148.1/1">On BBC2's &quot;Newsnight&quot; last night, the Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Nationality said that it would take at least 10 years to clear the backlog of illegal immigrants in this country. Residents of my Kettering constituency and elsewhere think that it is scandalous that those in government who are supposed to defend our country and protect our borders seem to be completely unable to do so. I join <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1700" name="Theresa May">my right hon.

	<p pid="e.1148.2/1">There are plenty of occasions to debate that issue, but if the Opposition feel really exercised about it they have a number of Opposition days coming up, which I am sure that they will put to good use. <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ] </i>I see the Opposition Chief Whip confirm that. I am always happy to suggest subjects to the Opposition for their debating time.</p>
	<p pid="e.1148.2/2">I point out to the hon. Gentleman that my hon. Friend the Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Nationality gave that time scale because of the time that it will take to introduce the e-borders arrangements, so that we have accurate data on the numbers going in and coming out of the country.</p>
	<p pid="e.1148.2/3">I hope that the hon. Gentleman tells his constituents that in 1996 the then Home Secretary, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1587" name="Michael Howard">the right hon. and learned Member for Folkestone and Hythe(Mr. Howard)</phrase>, decided to abandon disembarkation controls in Dover and other ports, which covered about 40 per cent. of those leaving the country. He also got rid of all the staff and the budget for them. When I became Home Secretary, it was clear that there was no point in maintaining embarkation controls in respect of the other 60 per cent. because people who wanted to leave illegally would go through the other ports. The system that the Conservatives had maintained meant that even when disembarkation cards were taken off people, they were put in a room and nothing was done with them.</p>
	<p pid="e.1148.2/4">We must change the system, and that is what the Government are seeking to do. I wish that there had been slightly more help from the Opposition in respect of part of these arrangements, especially on identity cards.</p>

	<p pid="e.1149.0/1">I associate myself and my hon. Friends with the glowing tributes to Eric Forth. When showing new Members round the House, I would always point out Eric Forth, and the description &quot;colourful character&quot; would always feature.</p>
	<p pid="e.1149.0/2">I do not know whether the Leader of the House saw the programme on the BBC over the weekend that showed that 52 per cent. of the British public believe that Scottish Members should no longer be able to become Prime Minister. I am certainly sure that it was not missed by No. 11. Does not this show that the public are way ahead of the House and the Government in their thinking about the role of Scottish Members? Should we not have a proper, grown-up debate about the role of us Scots MPs so that we get up to speed with the public on this issue?</p>

	<p pid="e.1149.1/1">The hon. Gentleman has a particular view&mdash;he would like to see Scotland separated from the rest of the United Kingdom. That is not the view taken by the vast majority of people in Scotland, nor is it the view taken by the vast majority of people in the United Kingdom. We should celebrate our Britishness. A Prime Minister is the Prime Minister for the entire United Kingdom&mdash;that is Great Britain, including Scotland and Northern Ireland.

	<p pid="e.1149.3/1">The petitions proposal is not an original proposal from me; it has been around for a while. I understand that the Scottish Parliament has a good system in place for dealing with petitions that are signed by a significant number of Members. It was my instinct to raise the matter before the Modernisation Committee and, subject to what colleagues on that Committee and other Members believe to be right, to ensure that we take more seriously petitions that are often painstakingly drawn up, with the support of many constituents and other people throughout the country. I think that that is straightforward.</p>
	<p pid="e.1149.3/2">An inquiry is taking place into the future of early-day motions. That is a matter for the House and certainly not one for the Government. It is a tricky issue because they are used for serious national issues, serious constituency issues and trivial issues such as the success or failure of Burnley football club.</p>

	<p pid="e.1150.0/2">Now that the Government have reinstated structures in the national health service that they got rid of eight years ago, can we have a debate to reflect the real concerns of health practitioners in our constituencies who are concerned about the culture of continual change in the NHS.

	<p pid="e.1150.1/1">I welcome all debates on the national health service&mdash;on what we have done nationally and on what happens locally. I hope very much that in such debates, Opposition Members, including those who are new, will be honest enough to talk about the state that the NHS would have been in had Conservative spending plans continued, and had the Government accepted their advice when each year&mdash;almost without exception&mdash;they voted against the spending plans proposed by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer. If Conservative spending plans had continued, there would not have been the dramatic increase in the numbers of nurses, doctors and other clinicians&mdash;there has been an 85,000 increase in the number of nurses. There would also not have been a dramatic increase&mdash;it was increased by more than a quarter&mdash;in the real pay of nurses. Instead, there would have been the same stagnation in the health service, and, as a result, there would have been lower delivery of care for the hon.

The proposal is made in the context of the Government's response to the 28th report of the Senior Salaries Review Body, which provides that the award to the senior civil service, to which Members' pay is linked under the formula agreed in 1996, is being staged in a similar way.</p>
	<p pid="e.1152.3/2">Under the decisions taken in 2003 and 2005, annual uprating of the additional salaries for Select and Standing Committee Chairmen is also linked to the senior civil service pay bands. The motion accordingly provides that the increase in these salaries too should be staged.</p>

The principle of linkage to the senior civil service pay bands, agreed by the House in 1996, followed earlier systems of linkage. It was intended to avoid the need for a major debate on Members' pay on every occasion when pay needed to be adjusted. However, the system agreed does not cover the present situation, because the pay bands to which our pay is linked would have risen by the full 2 per cent. from <phrase class="date" code="">1 April</phrase>. If nothing further were done, our pay would rise by 2 per cent. from that date, even though this would not be the case in practice for most of the senior civil service.</p>
	<p pid="e.1152.3/4">When he proposed this staging of the senior civil service pay increase, my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister announced that it was to</p>
	<p pid="e.1152.3/5" class="indent">&quot;reflect what is affordable within expenditure plans.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="e.1152.3/6">I accept that the total saving to the public purse from the staging of the pay of Members of Parliament itself will be relatively small. It amounts to less than &pound;230,000 in basic pay, and a little more than that if other factors&mdash;employers' national insurance contributions and Exchequer pensions contributions&mdash;are included.</p>
	<p pid="e.1152.3/7">I hope that colleagues agree that we ought to play our part and show restraint, as we are asking the senior civil service, to whose pay ours is linked, to show equal restraint.</p>

	<p pid="e.1153.0/1">As the House knows, the Senior Salaries Review Body has made some critical recommendations on Members' pay, and it has established comparators in both the public and the private sectors. Does the Leader of the House accept that Members' pay is 20 per cent. behind the comparators to which it has been linked by the SSRB? Is that fair in the short, medium or long term for hon. Members? Will it encourage good, competent, able, intelligent people to put their names forward as Members of Parliament?</p>

	<p pid="e.1153.1/1">I accept the point that the hon. Gentleman is making, and I shall deal with the wider review of Members' pay that will take place next year. As comparable pay in the private sector has risen much faster than pay for senior civil servants, they too are out of kilter with the comparators, so I accept the strength of that argument.</p>
	<p pid="e.1153.1/2">In its review next year the SSRB must take account of the extent to which pay levels act as a disincentive, deterring good people in all walks of life from serving in the House. It is important that Members of Parliament be paid properly, and&mdash;as members of all parties aspire to hold office&mdash;that should include Ministers. At the same time, however, I am struck by the high calibre of members of all parties who entered the House in 2001 and 2005, notwithstanding the pay and the cynical press that Members of Parliament generally receive. However, if pay does not keep pace with the comparators, particularly as the pressure on Members of Parliament to serve full-time is much greater than it was when <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1699" name="Nicholas Winterton">the hon.

	<p pid="e.1154.5/1">Hang on a sec. It is perfectly possible to construct a pay system in which Members are paid according to age and time spent in the House. Whether that is acceptable to the public purse, and above all to hon. Members, is another matter. There has been an improvement, however, as Chairmen of Select Committees and equivalent bodies, including members of the Speaker's Panel, receive additional remuneration. The only people who do not receive such remuneration are members of the shadow Cabinet, who have to work extremely hard and are not paid properly for that work. However, that is an incentive to leave the shadows and enter Government. I hope that everyone accepts the case for staging, which is the subject of the motion.</p>
	<p pid="e.1154.5/2">May I deal with the two motions on payment for Chairmen of the Select Committee on the Crossrail Bill, both of which make the same proposition? The House decided to introduce payments for the Chairmen of the main Select Committees in 2003, following a debate in 2002 on the principle of payment arising from a report of the Modernisation Committee and from a subsequent report by the SSRB on the amount payable. In July 2005 we decided that that should be extended to nearly all the remaining permanent Committees. We decided, too, that a system of payment should be introduced for members of the Chairmen's Panel who chair Standing Committees.</p>
	<p pid="e.1154.5/3">The main purpose of the decision to pay Chairmen of Select Committees was to promote recognition of another career choice in the House as an alternative to service as a Minister. It reflected a recognition of the importance of Select Committees in underpinning a modern democracy, and a general agreement that the chairmanship of many Committees involves a heavy work load and substantial responsibility. The House would wish me to take the opportunity to say how much we value the work of Select Committees and to thank the various Chairmen for their commitment. The decision to pay Chairmen was by no means unanimous, but the House as a whole has shown that it supports the principle by subsequently extending the list of Chairmen who receive the additional salary.</p>
	<p pid="e.1154.5/4">Chairmen of non-permanent Committees have not been paid, partly because they do not fit the criteria as clearly as other Chairmen. By definition, such Committees are relatively short-lived, although the Select Committee on the Armed Forces Bill, which was ably chaired by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1664" name="George Howarth">my right hon. Friend the Member for Knowsley, North and Sefton, East (Mr. Howarth)</phrase>, has just reported after four months and more than 20 sittings. It would be difficult to identify in advance which Committees should be covered and which should not. However, where there is an exceptional case, I hope that colleagues agree that we should reflect that in arrangements for the payment of salaries.</p>
	<p pid="e.1154.5/5">The Select Committee on the Crossrail Bill appears to be such a case. It first sat on <phrase class="date" code="">13 December</phrase>, and it sits up to four times a week when the House is sitting. Until last week it had sat on 36 days, so as it typically sits twice a day, it has many more sittings than other Committees. It may continue to sit&mdash;but perhaps not at the same rate&mdash;until the autumn. The House will agree that its work load is higher than that of many other Committees whose members are paid an additional salary. It is higher, too, than the work load of other ad hoc committees.</p>

	<p pid="e.1155.0/1">Undoubtedly members of Committees considering private legislation&mdash;the Crossrail Bill Committee is such a Committee&mdash;undertake an awful lot of hard work, but I find it difficult to distinguish the additional work by Chairmen from that of the membership, as they both seem to do exactly the same job in the same circumstances.</p>

	<p pid="e.1155.1/1">It could be said that assiduous members of Select Committees do the same job as, say, the Chairman of a Select Committee who happens to be coasting. There is no precise science. All Members who are doing their duties in the House work very hard&mdash;far harder, I may say, than they get credit for, regardless of party, from many sections of the press. But there is a difference between chairing a Committee and being a member of it. There is plainly a difference in responsibility. I hope, therefore, that the hon. Gentleman does not seek to make the best the enemy of the good, and will accepts that there is an exception to the general rule to be made here.</p>
	<p pid="e.1155.1/2">I express <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1708" name="Alan Meale">my gratitude to my hon. Friend the Member for Mansfield (Mr. Meale)</phrase> for the work that he has done as Chairman of the Select Committee on the Crossrail Bill. Had he simply been coasting, had he not been taking his responsibilities seriously, I would not have tabled the motion and Members on both sides would not have accepted it. I accept that to add this Committee to the list of Committees whose Chairmen receive an additional salary will set something of a precedent. We will have to look at other cases as they arise, and it is not inconceivable that another Select Committee on a Bill may at some future point justify similar treatment. However, I do not envisage that we will have for some time another ad hoc Committee involving the work commitment for its Chairman that that one involves. It is a matter for the House to decide, but I think it is right to put the motion forward to provide an opportunity for the Chamber as a whole to make that decision.</p>

	<p pid="e.1156.0/1">I support all three motions before the House relating to Members' salaries and the pay of Chairmen of Select Committees.</p>
	<p pid="e.1156.0/2">I am grateful to the Leader of the House for having recognised that the staging of Members' pay does not in itself constitute a very large saving for the Government. However, as others, with whom we have been compared and linked in respect of the decision on our pay, are being asked to take their pay in stages, it is appropriate that we undertake the same level of restraint as we expect of them.</p>
	<p pid="e.1156.0/3">The Leader of the House referred to the wider issue, partly in response to a question from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1699" name="Nicholas Winterton">my hon. Friend the Member for Macclesfield (Sir Nicholas Winterton)</phrase>. The pay of Members of Parliament is a difficult matter, with which Governments and Members have grappled over the years. We have not necessarily found the best way to deal with Members' pay. It is Members who vote on our pay, and voters raise questions about it. They are often encouraged in that by members of the press, whose salaries are not revealed to the electorate or to their readership.</p>
	<p pid="e.1156.0/4">There is an issue that we need to address, and the SSRB triennial review will consider the wider aspects when it reports.

	<p pid="e.1156.2/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that clarification. I am sure the Leader of the House has noted the point and the motion number, to ensure that the process goes ahead and there is no way that the triennial review can be stymied by a prime ministerial decision.</p>
	<p pid="e.1156.2/2">The wider issue is important. The right hon. Gentleman referred to the need to encourage high-calibre people to want to become Members of Parliament, and to the fact that these days this is a full-time job. That is not necessarily a view that will be shared by all my colleagues, or in other parts of the House, but my personal view is that it is a full-time job and we should treat it as such, as I have always done. That presents a challenge to those who are employed in areas where salaries are above those of Members of Parliament, which in the past may not have been the case. It is no longer the case that higher salaries are paid only to those in a significant role in business or banking, or who are barristers or in similar professions. A head teacher of a secondary school, for example, almost certainly earns more than a Member of Parliament.</p>

	<p pid="e.1157.1/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend. There are a number of areas of employment where salaries are higher than those of Members of Parliament, which would not have been so in the past. People of very high calibre still wish to be Members of Parliament, but sometimes that involves them and their families making significant sacrifices to enable them to give their service to the country. We need to consider the issue.</p>
	<p pid="e.1157.1/2">I crave the indulgence of the House to raise one further point that cannot be accommodated by the SSRB triennial review, but which is a matter for all parties&mdash;the cost of standing as a candidate for election to Parliament. That can be a significant cost, particularly to someone nursing a seat for three or four years, if they are selected well in advance of an election. That presents a challenge to parties too, to ensure that we encourage high-calibre people to enter the House, as we are all keen to do.</p>
	<p pid="e.1157.1/3">On the pay of Chairmen of Select Committees, the right decision was taken by the House. It was an important step offering Members a different career structure, so that they do not have to become Ministers to feel that they are progressing and earning extra salary. The Leader of the House mentioned members of the shadow Cabinet. Having been a member of the shadow Cabinet since 1999, I, perhaps more than others, am conscious of the point. Members of the shadow Cabinet assume that burden with no extra pay over and above that of Members of Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="e.1157.1/4">The key issue is that the role of Select Committee Chairman offers an alternative career. In earlier exchanges during business questions, the Leader of the House referred to the introduction of the Select Committee system in the House. That has been one of the great strengths of the House over the past 25 years, and it is important that we recognise the value of that through the pay of Chairmen of Select Committees.</p>
	<p pid="e.1157.1/5">On the Crossrail Bill, I entirely understand <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1824" name="David Heath">the intervention by the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath)</phrase> about the fact that all the members of the Committee take on a substantial burden because of the number of meetings of the Committee. I say openly and honestly that I would not like to be a member of that Committee. I intend to give evidence to it because Crossrail affects my constituency, but it is a detailed issue and a significant burden to meet and take so much evidence from those who have submitted petitions against the Crossrail Bill.</p>
	<p pid="e.1157.1/6">It can be argued that for members of any Select Committee there is a burden if they do their job assiduously, which I know members of Select Committees do, but the Chairman of such a Committee has an extra burden to bear, and it is appropriate that the Select Committee on the Crossrail Bill be added to the list of those whose Chairmen who are paid. The Leader of the House made a valid point when he said that we cannot guarantee that in future other Committees will not need to be added. Now that he has finally been allowed to become Chairman of the Modernisation Committee, after a little local difficulty, he will know that, as became clear from the evidence taken yesterday, one of the current issues concerns the role of Select Committees, Standing Committees and Special Select Committees in the future. If the Modernisation Committee proposes changes to the way in which the House handles legislation and the legislative process, so that the balance between Select Committees and Standing Committees and their various responsibilities evolves, we may need to look again at the whole question of whom it is appropriate to pay.</p>
	<p pid="e.1157.1/7">I welcome the fact that Select Committee Chairmen are now paid&mdash;that has been an important move for the House&mdash;and I endorse the adding of the Chairman of the Crossrail Bill Committee to the list of those whose salary is increased in recognition of the extra work that they are doing.</p>

Indeed, I am very clear that in fact and in perception we must be extraordinarily careful that we do not seem to be giving ourselves preferential treatment above those who serve in the public service or the private sector beyond this place. For instance, when we discussed the enhancements made to the pensions of right hon. and hon. Members, I was opposed because I felt that it was a clear example of an occasion when we were protecting our interests rather better than we were able to protect those of many other people.</p>

	<p pid="e.1158.2/1">I did not take it, but that is neither here nor there. I do not want to parade that as an example of virtue&mdash;it was simply the way that I felt about the issue.</p>
	<p pid="e.1158.2/2">We must also, however, be fair to Members of Parliament. We have to reflect the comparators that are set down and ensure that Members' salaries are commensurate with the responsibilities that they take on. It worries me when Members' pay falls way behind those comparators. I agree with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1700" name="Theresa May">the right hon. Member for Maidenhead (Mrs. May)</phrase> that the job of a Member of Parliament should be to represent people in this place, not to go off and do some other job down the road. It always surprises and sometimes shocks me when somebody leaves high office, or even shadow responsibilities, and the first thing that the newspapers say is, &quot;What job is he going to do now?&quot; The answer is the job of a Member of Parliament, which is still their prime responsibility. It worries me that so many Members feel the need to top up their salaries in all sorts of ways. I cannot believe that that is to the advantage of their constituents. Of course, every individual has to take a view for themselves.</p>
	<p pid="e.1158.2/3">The Leader of the House cited the quality of the recent intake of Members. I agree. I think that we had an extraordinarily talented intake on both sides of the House this time.</p>

	<p pid="e.1159.1/1">Even the hon. Gentleman who says, &quot;Hear, hear&quot;, whom I perceive to be one of the new intake, will recognise that we have had some very talented individuals joining us. However, although that may be a seductive argument for saying that we can therefore allow market forces to do their work and allow salaries to dwindle, it is wrong. It would be a complacent view, and an unfair one. Greater self-sacrifice is required, not only by Members but by their families, which is sometimes inappropriate. Having for several years led a county council with an annual turnover of about &pound;500,000 on the basis that total expenses were about &pound;4,000 per annum, I know how difficult it is to make such sacrifices in order to achieve one's political objectives.</p>

	<p pid="e.1159.3/1">That is by far the simplest way of dealing with it, and it takes the matter out of the political argument, which is as it should be. I would hope that it takes an objective and independent view, not one clouded by the misconceptions of bundling up all our office expenses&mdash;for example, staff and computers&mdash;into our salary and saying that they are perks for the individual concerned. All those factors are removed from the equation and we have an objective view.</p>
	<p pid="e.1159.3/2">I entirely support the contention of the Leader of the House in the first motion. Given that the Government have determined that civil service pay should be staged, it would be wrong of us to seek an advantageous position, and we should accept that recommendation.</p>
	<p pid="e.1159.3/3">That brings me on to the payment of the Chairman of the Select Committee on the Crossrail Bill. I have genuine problems with that. I hasten to add thatthat has nothing to do with either the person or<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1708" name="Alan Meale">the qualities of the hon. Member for Mansfield(Mr. Meale)</phrase>, and everything to do with the apparent lack of discipline and control over the process&mdash;a process that I generally welcome. Those who chair Select Committees of the House undertake a very substantial job and generally do so with a great deal of assiduity and sheer hard work. I can readily accept that there should be a career structure within the House and that it should be rewarded, but I have always been reluctant for it to be greatly expanded. I agree with the right hon. Member for Maidenhead that we are rapidly approaching the situation whereby the only people who will not be paid extra are those who do a great deal of the work of the House by speaking from the Conservative and Liberal Democrat Front Benches on each and every Bill and attending Standing Committees to speak as required, and do so without any extra emolument at all. I hasten to add that I am not seeking that extra emolument, but merely pointing out that it is a rather perverse situation.</p>
	<p pid="e.1159.3/4">We now have payments for the Chairmen on the Chairmen's Panel who chair our Standing Committees. Again, I do not argue with that. It is a gradated structure. However, naming a specific temporary Committee sets an unhelpful precedent. The motion makes no provision&mdash;although it is clearly implied&mdash;that the payment should cease at the point at which the Select Committee reports. However, I have a more substantial objection. I do not know whether the hon. Member for Mansfield is a member of the Chairmen's Panel&mdash;if so, he is receiving a payment as such&mdash;but I suspect that he is not. That is surprising. Hon. Members who are put on a Select Committee on private legislation undertake a truly horrendous task. It is very time-consuming and difficult work that is usually, frankly, given as a punishment by the Whips Office for some misdemeanour, and I have the greatest sympathy for those who undertake it. But the fact remains that that hard work is shared by all the members of the Committee. It is not like being the Chairman of a departmental Select Committee. Those Chairmen do a tremendous amount of work outside the Committee, meeting individuals, preparing for meetings and guiding the reports that the Committee produces. They do a whole array of further work, but I do not believe that that is the role of the Chairman of a private Bill Committee. The work of those Committees is shared by all their members.</p>
	<p pid="e.1159.3/5">I do not intend to show any disrespect to the hon. Member for Mansfield, who I know is doing very good job of work, but he is not there all the time, and I believe that up to four other Members have also chaired that Bill Committee. So it seems odd to reward only one member of the Committee, quite substantially under the terms of this provision, for doing that temporary job. Furthermore, it is not clear to me from my reading of the resolution whether this is an annualised payment in line with those of other Select Committee Chairmen, on whether there is a pro rata element related to the timing of the Bill. It would be helpful to know that.</p>

If there was a genuine election within the membership of the Committee, that would be one thing. However, if there was an instruction to the effect that someone had been favoured with the chairmanship of the Committee and was to receive a substantial emolument as a result, that would change the view of the House on what exactly is going on.

	<p pid="e.1161.3/1">The hon. Member for Mansfield would be paid rather less if he were a member of the Chairmen's Panel.

	<p pid="e.1161.3/2">The anomaly is that this Bill Committee is described as a Select Committee but it is not a departmental Select Committee&mdash;<i> [</i><i> Interruption.]</i> The Leader of the House objects to my use of the word &quot;anomaly&quot;, so I shall retract it.

	<p pid="e.1162.0/1">With the leave of the House, I should like to reply to the debate. I am glad to hear that there is general approbation for the first motion, which is to restrict our pay increase to just 1 per cent., and widespread agreement with the second and third motions on the Chairman of the Crossrail Bill.</p>
	<p pid="e.1162.0/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1700" name="Theresa May">The right hon. Member for Maidenhead (Mrs. May)</phrase> raised a fundamental point about how we settle our pay, in saying that we have always had difficulties because we have to vote on our own pay. This is almost unique, except for those who run a company that they wholly own. I remember the debates that took place on this matter in the late 1970s and early 1980s, when the system was much worse than it is today. In those days, there was no linkage, which was just awful. The system of linkage is much better, because it provides a clear benchmark. I am not sure whether we could devise a better system, although&mdash;to pick up <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1699" name="Nicholas Winterton">the points made by the hon.

	<p pid="e.1163.4/1">One second. Somebody outrageously suggested that places on hybrid and private Bill Committees are reserved for punishments by the Whips. I am sure that that is still true in the Conservative party; it is no longer true in the Labour party and the Government, because we now have a caring, sharing Whips Office that does everything by gentle persuasion. However, it certainly was true, as I remember&mdash; <i> [Interruption.]</i> The right hon. Member for Maidenhead says that her Chief Whip is also very nice. He, of course, gets paid, unlike members of the shadow Cabinet.</p>
	<p pid="e.1163.4/2">As a shadow Cabinet member for 10 years, it always rankled that I was expected to work my socks off and speak on behalf of the party while not being paid a penny, whereas our Chief Whip, who was expected simply to dragoon people into the Lobby and not speak at all, was paid a large sum. There we are; it just gets one used to life in government.</p>
	<p pid="e.1163.4/3">If I might detain the House for a moment on the issue of punishment by the Whips, I remember that such punishment took place in the 1980s in respect of a close friend of mine, with whom I shared an office, the late Allan Roberts. He was a good parliamentarian, but an outrageous rou&eacute; and bon viveur, and was the Member for Bootle until his sad death in 1990.</p>
	<p pid="e.1163.4/4">Allan had been offending the Whips in a variety of ways and was told that he had to serve his time by going on a private Bill Committee. As so often, he got into trouble; he failed to turn up to the private Bill Committee and was told that he would be fined about &pound;50 for each failure. He came to me, and I had to try to bail him out&mdash;not for the first time, let me say, nor indeed the last.</p>

This is a new situation, and I hope he accepts that this is a fair way to proceed. I am grateful to those on the Conservative Front Bench for their support.</p>

	Association of Former Members of Parliament

	<p pid="e.1165.1/1" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move,</p>
	<p pid="e.1165.1/2" class="indent" pwmotiontext="yes">That this House welcomes the formation of the Association of Former Members of Parliament in response to the Resolution of the House of 2nd May 2001; notes that it now has a membership of over 330 former Members; acknowledges the work done by the Association and its Executive Committee; and welcomes the financial and other assistance accorded to the Association by the House of Commons Commission.</p>
	<p pid="e.1165.1/3"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1484" name="Eric Martlew">My hon. Friend the Member for Carlisle (Mr. Martlew)</phrase> will speak in greater detail on this issue, because he has been chairing a working group on support for former Members. Those of us who have been lucky enough to survive in the House over many elections, as I have, will have friends who are no longer Members. Some retired at an appropriate moment&mdash;we wish them all well in their retirement&mdash;but many either got squeezed out because of gratuitous boundary redistributions or lost their seats. That happened to a large number of my colleagues in the 1980s, and it also happened to Conservative colleagues in the 1990s and at the 2001 election.</p>
	<p pid="e.1165.1/4">Many of those who lost their seats were assiduous Members of Parliament. They had given up careers and quite high incomes, and often put great strains on their families, but they suddenly found themselves outside the House and at a loss as to their future. That is a risk that we all accept when we are elected to the House, but I have often been struck by the lack not of support in terms of pensions, which are reasonable these days, although not for people who retired some time ago, but of psychological support and recognition of the contribution that those people made to the running of the House.</p>
	<p pid="e.1165.1/5">Shortly before the 2001 election, our former colleague, Joe Ashton, who was just about to retire, led an informal cross-party group looking at what could be done to assist the position of former Members of Parliament. My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary, who was then Leader of the House, facilitated a short debate in May 2001, just before the general election, which led, in effect, to the establishment of a working party to report to the Speaker. The motion identified the desire of former Members to stay in contact with each other and the possible benefits of availability of sources of personal advice and assistance for those who might have got into difficulties.</p>
	<p pid="e.1165.1/6">As I say, my hon. Friend the Member for Carlisle will go into more detail, but I understand that the association has more than 330 members, including a former Prime Minister and a former Speaker. Any such association needs some material support, but I understand that our association funds most of its activities from subscription. However, some modest financial support and assistance in kind have been made available by the House of Commons Commission. That will continue.</p>
	<p pid="e.1165.1/7">The Commission considered that</p>
	<p pid="e.1165.1/8" class="indent">&quot;in due course the view of the House should be sought on this assistance, so that it can be put on a steadier footing&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="e.1165.1/9">The main purpose of tabling the motion is to allow the House to give its view. We are being asked to give broad endorsement of the Commission's approach, but not to take responsibility for specific decisions, which remain a matter for the Commission. I am extremely happy to give that endorsement. I hope that the House as a whole does so to.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-05-18e.1166.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1700" speakername="Theresa May" colnum="1166"  time="013:16:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060518/debtext/60518-0008.htm#060518114000709">
	<p pid="e.1166.0/1">I am also happy to give that endorsement. Any large organisation has clubs, societies and groupings for former members of staff, which are for people who retire in the natural way of things. Of course, many Members of the House lose their jobs, and that can come as a great shock to them. Politics is a brutal business in that sense. Therefore, the proposal seems entirely sensible. Indeed, it seems a little odd that it took so long for a grouping or association of former Members to be formed.</p>
	<p pid="e.1166.0/2">I pay tribute to the work of all those former Members and Members of the House who have been involved in getting the association up and running and in ensuring that it is provided with the support it needs. I am entirely happy to endorse that important, albeit limited, support that the Commission has agreed the House may give.</p>
	<p pid="e.1166.0/3">I would like to make a further point. There are many ways in which Members of the House can continue to learn from former Members. On a specific issue, I am very grateful for the support that Dame Marion Roe is giving to those of us who are trying to encourage more women into the House, particularly on the Conservative Benches. She is giving practical support and advice to women. It is good of former Members to be willing to do that. We should never forget the experience that they have, which can be of benefit to current Members and to the House generally.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-05-18e.1166.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1484" speakername="Eric Martlew" colnum="1166"  time="013:17:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060518/debtext/60518-0008.htm#060518114000710">
	<p pid="e.1166.1/1">I am delighted to speak to the motion. On <phrase class="date" code="2001-05-02">2 May 2001</phrase> we had the original motion before the House. Of course, if it had not been for the outbreak of foot and mouth disease, the debate would never have taken place. After it, the Speaker asked me to form a working group to see whether we could get an association up and running.</p>
	<p pid="e.1166.1/2">I was flattered by that and I wondered whether the Speaker realised that I had a background in human resources&mdash;I used to be personnel manager for a large multinational company. So, I delved into this a little further, but the reality was that I was one of only three Members who were sitting on the Benches when the debate took place. I was the obvious candidate.</p>
	<p pid="e.1166.1/3">The work has gone well, but when I was appointed to the post, I wondered why we had never had a formal association. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1700" name="Theresa May">The right hon. Member for Maidenhead (Mrs. May)</phrase> has asked that question today from the Conservative Front Bench. Throughout the world, Parliaments similar to ours all have their associations. I then realised that the reason for us not having an association for former Members is down at the other end of the building. In fact, we have an association, and it is called the House of Lords. It has been there for many centuries, but only elite former Members went to it. If what I hear is to be believed, it will be even more difficult for Members of this House to get to the other House, so I am sure that the need for the association will increase.</p>
	<p pid="e.1166.1/4">The working group reported to the Speaker and the then Leader of the House, and it was successful. The association of former Members now has, I think,340 members, including two former Prime Ministers and 32 former Cabinet Ministers. They need no advice from us about how to run their business, as many of them have run the country, some of them well and some not so well.</p>
	<p pid="e.1166.1/5">As the Leader of the House pointed out, there was a need for this association, and the main need was for fellowship. This place is a closed community, and suddenly finding oneself on the outside is difficult when most Members live in their constituencies and are unlikely to meet one of their work colleagues walking down the street. Some successful social gatherings have taken place, and I want to put on the record our thanks for the support of Speaker Martin in that regard. The Administration Committee, which was at first reluctant to accept the demands of the association, has also been helpful.</p>
	<p pid="e.1166.1/6">Progress has been made. When the association was started, a former Member had to have completed15 years' service before being given permission to come into the House without having to go through security and wear a label with a date on it. That has now improved greatly. Former Members found it shaming to have to go through that procedure and felt that their contribution merited better. An office has been provided, which is welcomed by the association. The small amount of financial support provided helps to pay the association's postage costs. It has been fortunate to employ a part-time secretary, Sally Grocott&mdash;&quot;employ&quot; is perhaps not the right word, as I am not sure that she gets paid or gets paid regularly. As she knows the House&mdash;her husband is Chief Whip in the other place&mdash;she has been a tower of strength to the association.</p>
	<p pid="e.1166.1/7">The driving force behind the association, however, has been Joe Ashton. I have worked closely with him and he tires me out. Given the amount of energy that he puts into his role, he probably retired too early. The association has been fortunate to have him. Nothing is ever good enough for Joe, so we must go further and faster. He now has an all-party, mixed-gender executive that represents various regions of the United Kingdom. The House would be proud to form an executive on such a basis were it ever able to do so. Members are aware of its success, because it produces a newspaper, &quot;Order Order&quot;, three times a year, which is now circulated with <i> The House Magazine</i>.</p>
	<p pid="e.1166.1/8">The association has asked me to raise one or two issues. First, it has asked me to raise the issue of the pension fund trustees. I served for many years as a pension fund trustee and, believe me, it is not a glamorous committee. It is perhaps a bit like that on the Crossrail Bill, but the chairman does not get paid. The law says that there should be pensioner trustees. At present, we have a pensioner trustee, who was not nominated by the association but is a member of it. The association has asked whether it can be consulted in future about the retired trustee on the pension fund, which is a reasonable request, and whether there could be more than one retired trustee on the pension fund. I hope that that suggestion will be communicated through the usual channels back to the fund trustees.</p>
	<p pid="e.1166.1/9">Secondly, the association asked me to raise the issue of the Members' Fund, of which, for my pains, I am also a member. I am conscious that the vast majority of Members of Parliament know nothing about the Members' Fund&mdash;they just know from their payslip that they make a &pound;2 contribution to it every month. In reality, it is a fund for assisting former Members of Parliament or their spouses and family&mdash;the assistance is normally to spouses and family who might have fallen into some kind of financial difficulty. The laws on the fund were passed by the House in about 1935 and need revising. Members of the association understand that. If the laws are revised, however, they would like a retired association member to be a member of the Members' Fund.</p>
	<p pid="e.1166.1/10">I also want to raise the issue, on which the Leader of the House touched, of how we treat Members who lose their seats. Some work has been done on that, and I thought that I had secured an agreement with the usual channels that when a Member loses a seat, he or she can use part of the winding-up allowance to get expert help on returning to the labour market. A Member of Parliament who has been out of his or her profession for 10 years will find it difficult to get back into the labour market. The multinational company for which I worked would bring in consultants to assist those who had been made redundant with their CVs and advise them on their career prospects and future direction. That does not happen here. My understanding&mdash;which was wrong, as it did not happen&mdash;was that Members, if they so wished, could use part of the winding-up allowance for those purposes. I hope that that will have been provided for by the time of the next general election.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-05-18e.1168.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1900" speakername="David Winnick" colnum="1168"  time="013:17:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060518/debtext/60518-0008.htm#060518114000711">
	<p pid="e.1168.0/1">Does my hon. Friend agree&mdash;this did not apply to me, although I lost my seat, and I was fortunate enough to be in employment within a week&mdash;that the process can be pretty undignified when a Member loses a seat? Several former Members, no doubt on both sides of the House, have needed to get permission from the authorities to come here and collect their papers and so on, perhaps a few days after a general election. A more dignified approach is required to deal with those who have lost their seats, not only to help them in the way that my hon. Friend has suggested, but to make it easier for them to collect papers and do other things that one would do normally when leaving one's employment.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-05-18e.1168.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1484" speakername="Eric Martlew" colnum="1168"  time="013:17:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060518/debtext/60518-0008.htm#060518114000712">
	<p pid="e.1168.1/1">I totally accept that, and I understand that the matter is being considered. I have heard the process described as being similar to what happens when an employee has been instantly dismissed&mdash;someone will come to the person's office, help him or her to gather their papers and see them off the premises. That cannot be right. Of course, there is pressure of time&mdash;the work of the House starts again soon after the general election, and desks and so on must be available. However, the issue must be treated more sensitively. The issue in relation to passes is similar. Often, Members have felt ashamed to come back into the House through the security system. Since we have made changes, the House is a much more welcoming place to former Members.</p>
	<p pid="e.1168.1/2">My final point is that the amount of money made available to the association is probably less than &pound;2,000. I realise that that is public money, and we must be careful with it. However, outside this place, a civil service retirement association or a large company would be more generous. When the House of Commons Commission considers the matter, I hope that it will see its way to being a little more generous.</p>
	<p pid="e.1168.1/3">I am grateful that this motion is on the Order Paper today. I am sure that all Members of the House realise that, sooner or later, they will be a former Member. I am not planning to lose my seat at the next general election, but one can never tell. We should take credit for what we have done. Some members of the association complain about the pensions and salaries that we receive and compare them with the amounts that they received, and they are right to do so; but we did set up the association. They had the opportunity to set it up, and did not do so.</p>
	<p pid="e.1168.1/4">When we are former Members, the association will make leaving this place better for us. We have already made it a great deal better for our colleagues and friends who left at the last election.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-05-18e.1169.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1824" speakername="David Heath" colnum="1169"  time="013:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060518/debtext/60518-0008.htm#060518114000713">
	<p pid="e.1169.0/1">I want to express not just congratulations but thanks to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1484" name="Eric Martlew">the hon. Member for Carlisle (Mr. Martlew)</phrase>, and to all who have been instrumental in setting up the association and making it work as it has. It represents an important advance in what we do for former Members. I also agree with what the hon. Gentleman said about further steps that could be taken. It is extraordinary that although we spend all our time here referring to each other, quite properly, as &quot;the hon. Gentleman&quot; and &quot;the hon. Lady&quot; in accordance with the formalities of the House, the moment a seat is lost the Member is apparently no longer an hon. Gentleman or an hon. Lady, and cannot be trusted to clear his or her desk in good order. That is an indignity that we do not need to visit on those who are inevitably distraught at their position.</p>
	<p pid="e.1169.0/2">In too many instances, the structures of the House are based on the assumption that someone who leaves is a member of the landed or money gentry to whom attending the House has been merely a pastime for a certain number of years, who can simply return to his estates or his job in the City, and to whom nothing really matters. That is not how things are in the real world. Most Members of Parliament nowadays burn their bridges when they come here, setting aside their former professions, trades or jobs, and when they end their time in the House they often face an uncertain future. It is important to provide such people with a proper transition.</p>
	<p pid="e.1169.0/3">The hon. Member for Carlisle suggested that some of the winding-up funds should be used to pay for professional advice on employment opportunities. I think that a good employer would supply such funds not from a winding-up allowance, but as a matter of course. I think that the House should provide the largest amount that it can sensibly provide, not because I want Members of Parliament to have a particular advantage but because I want us to be in a similar position to someone leaving a major company. We have all seen major redundancies in our constituencies, and we have all urged employers&mdash;some of them good employers, some not so good&mdash;to provide relocation packages so that people can find new ways into work.</p>
	<p pid="e.1169.0/4">I entirely endorse what was said by the hon. Member for Carlisle, and entirely concur with what was said by the Leader of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1700" name="Theresa May">the House and the right hon. Member for Maidenhead (Mrs. May)</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="e.1170.0/1">I support the motion. My wife Virginia is either a member or a potential member of the association. I have enjoyed reading the newsletter, and think that the editor deserves praise.</p>
	<p pid="e.1170.0/2">I do not agree with some of what has been said, but the debate is relatively limited. I think that we should all be prepared to clear our offices when an election comes, and I do not think that we need too much time in which to do it. I do not like the idea that Members of Parliament are doing a job better than any other that they could do. I am glad that we are past the times when only the poor and the rich could become Members of Parliament, and that now middle-income groups can do so.</p>
	<p pid="e.1170.0/3">I agree with the general points made about the importance of the solidarity and support that people receive, but I think we should bear in mind the position of spouses or partners of former Members of Parliament, especially former Members who have died. I remember a case about 20 years ago, when someone who had been the daughter-in-law and wife of distinguished Members was not be recognised when she came back here several weeks after her husband's funeral and memorial service. Although they are not members of the association, I hope that some attention will be paid to those who have been married to politics for many years.</p>

	<p pid="e.1170.3/1">I am sorry that I was missing for a few minutes. I was in touch with&mdash;not Joe Ashton, although he has been in touch with me a great deal lately, which is why I have risen to speak&mdash;but the cardiologist. Just at the moment, that is a bit more important.</p>
	<p pid="e.1170.3/2">Joe Ashton was a Whip between 1976 and 1979, when we had no majority. Well, we did have a majority, but then Stonehouse went missing. He was on a Florida beach, then he turned up in Australia. Then he crossed the Floor, and Joe Ashton was given the job of being one of the Whips keeping our majority intact. They were heady days and all the rest of it, but we formed a relationship. Joe's job was to try to get me into the Lobbies. It did not always work, but I told him all those years ago that I would do him a favour some time. I got on the phone to him when he retired. It has not been mentioned yet, but Joe had a very serious illness. We had many long discussions about how he was getting on. At the time I could see that despite the grim fight that he was undertaking, there was no doubt that the proposal that he had helped to put to the House way back in 2001&mdash;I think that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1484" name="Eric Martlew">my hon. Friend the Member for Carlisle (Mr. Martlew)</phrase> said that it was on <phrase class="date" code="">2 May</phrase>&mdash;was still very much in his mind. I promised him on numerous occasions that I would raise it if necessary, in accordance with what he wanted. What I did not know was that Joe had also been briefing my hon. Friend the Member for Carlisle, who has presented most of his propositions today.</p>
	<p pid="e.1170.3/3">Reference has been made to the composition of this place in the old days. Many Members then had formerly worked in factories or the pits. I can speak with some knowledge about pension entitlements in those days. The pension from the pits was only voluntary even in my day, and there was no pension at all when I started working as a miner. Many people who became Members of Parliament received no pension. It is true that they could have money shifted from one place to another, but people who had given20 years' service were receiving about &pound;100 a month&mdash;people who had worked in factories, pits and all <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1824" name="David Heath">the rest. The hon. Member for Somerton and Frome(Mr. Heath)</phrase> was right to say that many Members did not leave with a great deal of money. It is true that the composition of this place has changed dramatically. There are no longer 700,000 miners; you would have a job to find more than 5,000. That is why it is important to remember what the position used to be.</p>
	<p pid="e.1170.3/4">My hon. Friend the Member for Carlisle mentioned nominees for the parliamentary contributory pension fund and the Members' fund. That is what Members are striving for, as of right. If the Commission would consider it, I am sure that my old pal Joe Ashton, Bill Michie and all the rest who helped to form the association will be very pleased. Help with the cost of the magazine would also be appreciated, and Joe also told me that he would like to have the names and addresses of all the Members who had left, so that they could keep in contact.</p>
	<p pid="e.1170.3/5">So those are the proposals. My hon. Friend the Member for Carlisle dealt with them previously and explained precisely what was needed, and I hope that the Commission can deal with the matter. I have done my job. I made a promise to Joe donkeys' years ago that there would come an occasion when he would be glad of my presence. I may not be in the Lobby, but I am speaking up for his association.</p>

	<p pid="e.1173.2/1">I am delighted to have secured this debate today on a subject of pivotal importance to my constituency. In fact, although it is of real importance to a number of constituencies throughout the country, nowhere will the effect of the sale of British Nuclear Group be more acutely felt than in Copeland and in West Cumbria generally.</p>
	<p pid="e.1173.2/2">I want to begin by establishing the unique importance of British Nuclear Group to the Sellafield site, Copeland and West Cumbria. I know that the Minister is well aware of these issues, but they bear repeating. British Nuclear Group is by far the largest company operating on the Sellafield site. It employs more than 7,000 people directly, and the site itself employs over 11,500 people. Employment at Sellafield sustains another 5,000 jobs in the wider local community, so in real terms the site is responsible for approximately 17,000 jobs. Such employment accounts for the majority of the West Cumbria economy and well over 60 per cent. of the economy of Copeland.</p>
	<p pid="e.1173.2/3">Take-home wages from the Sellafield site are in excess of &pound;210 million per year. The site provides, as the Minister knows, high quality, highly skilled, highly valued jobs. Expenditure from the Sellafield sitegoing into the regional supply chain is in excess of&pound;600 million a year. It provides the lifeblood of the local service industry companies, the hospitality and retail industries, and the bespoke, high-value engineering industries to be found not only in Copeland, but in Allerdale, in <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1942" name="Tony Cunningham">the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Workington (Tony Cunningham)</phrase>. Local supply chain procurement by BNG is essential in West Cumbria, an issue to which I shall return.</p>
	<p pid="e.1173.2/4">In addition to that contribution to the local economy, in the past 15 years BNG has committed&pound;20 million to the West Cumbria Development Fund&mdash;a local economic regeneration body&mdash;which, in turn, has helped to lever in a further &pound;10 million worth of European Union funding. BNG has also demonstrated a concerted willingness to work in partnership with the local communities within which it operates, and, crucially, with the trade unions. In my view, it is the trade union members on any nuclear site who are the ultimate arbiters of safety. That is certainly the case at Sellafield, and I am grateful and pleased that the relationship between them and BNG is as strong as it clearly is. It is against that background that my interest in BNG must be understood. I must also state for the record that I am a former employee of the company at the Sellafield site&mdash;a fact of which I am extremely proud.</p>
	<p pid="e.1173.2/5">On <phrase class="date" code="">30 March</phrase>, the then Secretary of State for Trade and Industry announced the Government's endorsement of the proposal of the board of British Nuclear Fuels Ltd. to sell BNG. This was expected, and given the remit of the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority under the terms of the Energy Act 2004, completely understandable. The NDA and the UK as a whole require the development of competition within the nuclear decommissioning industry in the UK, in order to achieve the best value for money for the taxpayer. Although I completely accept the logic of that and the need for competition, I hope that the Minister can explain what, if any, consideration was given to the formation of a public-private partnership for UK decommissioning before the owner-contractor model was chosen.</p>
	<p pid="e.1173.2/6">Accompanying the Secretary of State's announcement, the NDA made the wise announcement that it would grant BNG a new five-year contract to operate the Sellafield site. That contract will keep the company, or its new owner, at the site until at least 2012. The Secretary of State said that he expects the sale of BNG to be completed by the autumn of 2007. For my constituents, that means that, from next autumn, there will be a new, dominant company operating the Sellafield site. It is essential that, that new company understand my community and become an active partner within it.</p>
	<p pid="e.1173.2/7">I have to say at this juncture that neither the Leader of the Opposition nor the shadow Secretary of State for Trade and Industry have shown the faintest glimmer of an understanding of what any of this means. Following the Secretary of State's announcement in March, the shadow Secretary of State issued a press release claiming that that announcement meant that the nation's nuclear liabilities were being put into the private sector. I can only assume that he has not read, let alone understood, the 2004 Act. Those liabilities have remained, and will remain, within the public sector under the ownership of the NDA. That embarrassing lack of understanding does not bode well for the shadow Secretary of State's time on the Conservative Front Bench, or, indeed, for the Conservatives' approach to the nuclear industry in general.</p>
	<p pid="e.1173.2/8">The Leader of the Opposition recently hand-picked one of the country's most vocal and misleading opponents of the nuclear industry to be his energy and environment adviser. That adviser has repeatedly misled the nation about the health and well-being of my constituents, among whom he has spread fear, anxiety and anger. His claims have no scientific or factual basis and constitute little more than malicious scaremongering. So today, I call upon the Leader of the Opposition&mdash;sadly, he is not here&mdash;to ensure that his high-profile advisers publicly withdraw their comments, or to otherwise sack them.</p>

	<p pid="e.1174.0/1">Does the hon. Gentleman agree with me that, where nuclear power stations do exist, local communities have come to accept them and value the contribution that they make to such communities, and to the wider generation of electricity throughout the country?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-05-18e.1174.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1511" speakername="Jamie Reed" colnum="1174"  time="013:41:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060518/debtext/60518-0009.htm#060518114000721">
	<p pid="e.1174.1/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for that contribution. He is absolutely correct; indeed, I could not have put it better myself. Speaking as a member of a local community surrounding a nuclear facility, I can say that that is precisely what such communities believe.</p>
	<p pid="e.1174.1/2">I return to the litany of errors committed by Opposition Front Benchers. Only this week, the new Leader of the Opposition notably failed to back calls for a new programme of nuclear power generation in Britain. I deeply regret his turning his back on the industry at its time not only of greatest need, but of greatest opportunity. More importantly, at a time when climate change has emerged as perhaps the definitive political challenge of our time, it is a tragedy that Conservative Front Benchers should fail to back the single largest carbon dioxide-free producer of energy&mdash;energy that is available not only to Britain, but the world. I implore the Leader of the Opposition to reconsider, and I will happily sit down with him and his shadow Secretary of State&mdash;and, indeed, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1461" name="Charles Walker">the hon. Member for Broxbourne (Mr. Walker)</phrase>&mdash;and convince them of the nuclear case. This issue is above and beyond party politics. I hope that all parties in the House will be able and mature enough to devise a national consensus on energy policy, and I urge the Conservatives to join me in calling for new nuclear power generation in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="e.1174.1/3">Last week, during a trip to the USA, I visited the Hanford nuclear facility in Washington state before meeting representatives of the Hanford area on Capitol Hill. I learned a lot from that visit, and it is appropriate to compare and contrast the British and American approaches to the nuclear industry. It is important to do so because there are significant differences between the two. Let me make it clear at the outset that I am a passionate pro-American, but that cannot and will not influence my views on what I believe to be right for the Sellafield site and my community.</p>
	<p pid="e.1174.1/4">It is important to understand and be aware of the US nuclear regulatory framework and working practices, because a US-based company is almost certainly going to buy BNG. There may or may not be some involvement from French interests, and a number of consortiums might attempt a purchase. Should a consortium bid for, and succeed in buying, BNG, I could not support the break-up or carve-up of the Sellafield site. That has been done before&mdash;notably by BNFL during the 1990s&mdash;and it resulted in a deterioration in working practices and managerial accountability structures. Such an approach also compromised safety, so I would need to be convinced that it is now workable. At this stage, I have seen nothing to convince me that it is, and I firmly believe that the Sellafield site is best served by one operator.</p>
	<p pid="e.1174.1/5">In the event of the successful purchase of BNG by a US-based company, I would expect that company immediately and wholeheartedly to embrace the British nuclear industry's working and regulatory practices, and to adopt the British corporate social responsibility culture. That means the adoption of a local supply chain purchasing policy, a close and productive relationship with the trade unions, the establishment and implementation of significant socio-economic development plans for the areas in which it operates, and an effective and satisfactory approach to working terms and conditions&mdash;including already amassed pension entitlements&mdash;that is acceptable to the existing work force. Fundamentally, it means doing things our way. Above all, it means working safely. The safety of the Sellafield work force and the safety of my community is non-negotiable, whatever other inducements might be proposed.</p>
	<p pid="e.1174.1/6">The British nuclear work force is the best nuclear work force in the world. I can say that with confidence as I have up close and personal experience of it. Standards of safety in the UK industry are better than elsewhere in the world, technological development and applied scientific and research application is among the best in the world, and productivity standards are now approaching the best there are as well. It is those attributes that make our nuclear workers, our nuclear scientists, our nuclear engineers and our nuclear working practices among the most sought after in the world.</p>
	<p pid="e.1174.1/7">Speak to any US multinational with a developing interest in buying BNG&mdash;and I have spoken to some&mdash;and they will explain that an association with the British nuclear industry is the key to opening up the vast nuclear clean-up and decommissioning markets in Russia, former Soviet Union states and eastern Europe. BNG's recent record illustrates that, as the company has successfully decommissioned and cleaned up more than 50 redundant nuclear facilities world wide. The company is also on a sound financial footing, with signs of real further improvements in financial performance this year and in years to come.</p>
	<p pid="e.1174.1/8">The company's profitability has not been achieved at the expense of either productivity or safety, a feat attributable not only to management, but the knowledge and experience of the shop floor. Last year, Sellafield's vitrification plant delivered a record-breaking 503 canisters against a predicted target of 450. By contrast, the US vitrification programme is billions of dollars over budget and in complete disarray. The Sellafield MOX plant recently delivered a second batch of four MOX fuel assemblies to NOK&mdash;Nordostschweizerische Kraftwerke AG&mdash;in time for its summer reactor reload, and last week signed a new &pound;200 million-plus contract with another continental utility. Those are causes for celebration.</p>
	<p pid="e.1174.1/9">In January 2006, the company completed the clean-up of historic liquid waste from one of the oldest plants at Sellafield, preventing more than 44 yearsof liquid emissions and saving the taxpayer up to&pound;300 million in potential new building costs. Only last week, I was discussing problematic clean-up issues with the US Department of Energy. It highlighted a particular problem in the US with technetium. That is an issue solved by BNG some time ago&mdash;I am delighted to say that I was involved in the project&mdash;which piqued a great deal of interest among the US Department of Energy officials. If anyone from BNG is listening to this debate or reads the report, I advise them to get down to the patent office as soon as possible, because a significant sum could be made from their unique technological skills and expertise. The market applications are huge.</p>
	<p pid="e.1174.1/10">With regard to safety&mdash;we should bear in mind the fact that Sellafield is the largest construction site in Britain and one of the largest in Europe&mdash;the current days-away case record rate is 0.23 against a target of 0.28, which is lower than any similar rate among any US contractors currently operating in that country. BNG Project Services has a days-away case record rate of zero and has worked almost 3 million man hours without a single lost-time accident. I could go on, but the point is made. The British nuclear industry places safety above everything else and it is a matter of fact that foreign contractors will have to emulate that safety culture if they want to operate in Britain. We lead the world in that regard and others have a great deal to learn from us.</p>
	<p pid="e.1174.1/11">I cannot guess at the value of BNG in financial terms. However, when assessing the revenue of any potential sale, I ask that the Government consider more than the financial value of the sale. Value is measured in more than money and the highest bidder for BNG may not necessarily be the best bidder for my community. It is imperative that the highest financial bid should not bring with it the highest actual cost to my constituents or any part of the UK in the areas of safety, environmental performance and socio-economic investment and development. Public acceptability of a particular contractor must be considered in the process of any sale, and weight must be given to that in devising the criteria against which potential BNG purchasers are judged.</p>
	<p pid="e.1174.1/12">It must be said, one year after the establishment of the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority, that its presence in my constituency and West Cumbria generally has been enthusiastically received. It has proven already to be a genuinely involved, listening community partner, which has already demonstrated that it has the interests of the West Cumbria community uppermost in its thoughts and actions.</p>
	<p pid="e.1174.1/13">I thank my hon. Friend the Minister for the budgeting process of the NDA. I was concerned to discover in the US that the budget for nuclear clean-up is done on a year-by-year basis, so the budgets are set annually. They are therefore subject to the vagaries of the political process&mdash;cut in some years and expanded in others. In the UK, my hon. Friend and the Department have provided a comprehensive, stable framework for nuclear decommissioning and clean-up to take place, and I am grateful for that.</p>
	<p pid="e.1174.1/14">I understand that the NDA will devise the BNG sale criteria, no doubt in conjunction with BNG, BNFL and the DTI. What I now require is significant involvement from the West Cumbrian community in determining what those criteria should be. The socio-economic obligations for both the NDA and its contractors are laid out in the Energy Act 2004, and I now hope to explore with the aforementioned groups the United States National Defence Authorisation Act 1993, especially section 3161, which helps to define the socio-economic obligations of US contractors operating in nuclear decommissioning environments. My hon. Friend will know of the importance of the West Cumbria Strategic Forum and I believe that it would be appropriate if that body were involved in establishing the sale criteria.</p>
	<p pid="e.1174.1/15">Finally, the future of British Nuclear Group is of fundamental importance to West Cumbria. It is vital that its sale be conducted properly, transparently and with the interests of those communities where BNG currently operates upheld at the centre of this process. The successful bidder must be the one who understands the ambitions and aspirations of its host communities and the working practices of the UK nuclear industry. I thank my hon. Friend for his patience and time, and look forward to his response.</p>

	<p pid="e.1178.0/1">I am grateful for the opportunity to speak in this debate, despite being late, and I apologise to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1511" name="Jamie Reed">my hon. Friend the Member for Copeland (Mr. Reed)</phrase> for missing the first few minutes of his speech. I was taken by surprise, but I should have learned that about this place.</p>
	<p pid="e.1178.0/2">I wish to make three quick points. I represent a constituency at the other scale of things from my hon. Friend, in as much as the Berkeley site has been undergoing a fairly organised run-down for some months. The decision to dispense with the nuclear laboratories came as a bit of a shock, but it is pleasing to see that the work will go on. I welcomed the comments by my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister yesterday. In defending the nuclear industry, I have always sought to make the point that it is nothing if it is not its work force. That is the basic integrity of the industry. One can have sites and systems, but without the people, one has no industry. It is vital that we keep those people in place.</p>
	<p pid="e.1178.0/3">So my first point is that it is vital that we keep the presence of the industry in many different parts of the country. That is why I have always fought for Berkeley to be considered, if not as the site of a new nuclear power station&mdash;because of problems with the River Severn&mdash;but to retain the research and development facilities. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will say something about that.</p>
	<p pid="e.1178.0/4">Secondly, we have the issue of the ownership of the sites by the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority. Much as I can see the benefits of separating the providers of services from the ownership of the sites, there are some concerns about possible conflicts of interest. Given that Berkeley is the first decommissioned nuclear power station in this country, a proposal is imminent for the further decommissioning of the old power site, which would be a first in the world. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will accept an invitation when the proposal is introduced to come and see how it would take the nuclear industry forward, in terms of solving the waste problem and the issue of the new generation.</p>
	<p pid="e.1178.0/5">My third point is about the relationship of the BNG, whatever form it takes, and other parts of the nuclear industry. It is vital that we do not see contractualisation as the answer to everything. I am concerned that we have no overall picture of what the nuclear industry could look like in five years' time. British Energy, BNFL, AMEC and the various other parts of the industry may have had their weaknesses, and the introduction of foreign investors may or may not be a good thing, but there needs to be clarity about the industry's structure. Without that, we will not be able to build the new generation of nuclear power stations, even if that is what we decide to do.</p>
	<p pid="e.1178.0/6">Finally, I totally concur with my hon. Friend the Member for Copeland that BNG is an important company that has been much abused in the past. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will give us some food for thought. and hope for the future.</p>

	<p pid="e.1178.1/1">After the previous debate on MPs' pay, it is good to turn to the calmer and less controversial waters of nuclear energy.</p>
	<p pid="e.1178.1/2">I welcome the opportunity to comment on the future of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1511" name="Jamie Reed">the British Nuclear Group. My hon. Friend the Member for Copeland (Mr. Reed)</phrase> is a great commentator on nuclear policy, and his expertise and experience are always worth listening to. In addition, he has a great reputation in his community, as I witnessed when I visited Sellafield some months ago.</p>
	<p pid="e.1178.1/3">The former Secretary of State, who is now Secretary of State for Education and Skills, announced our intentions in a written statement to the House on<phrase class="date" code="">30 March</phrase>. That statement made it clear that we had approved the BNFL board's recommendation that it should sell BNG through a competitive sale process commencing in April 2007 or earlier. However, there has been much media speculation about how the competitive sale will be conducted. Some of that speculation has been accurate and some of it less so, and my aim today is to provide some clarity on the matter.</p>
	<p pid="e.1178.1/4">I recognise that this debate takes place against a backdrop of some interest in the future of nuclear energy. I shall not say too much about that wider issue, save that I am conducting an energy review on behalf of my Secretary of State and the Prime Minister, and that it will report on these critical questions by the summer.</p>
	<p pid="e.1178.1/5">My hon. Friend the Member for Copeland rightly made some very positive comments about BNG and the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority's achievements since it commenced operations just over a year ago. I should like to echo those sentiments. BNFL did an admirable job in restructuring itself and preparing the ground for the NDA. The management and staff at BNG have coped very well with the transition. I am tremendously encouraged that the NDA's stewardship of the UK's nuclear clean-up has already yielded significant efficiency savings at BNG's sites. It is a very good start, but of course we are looking for very much more.</p>
	<p pid="e.1178.1/6">That is why we believe that a competitive sale is the right route. After careful deliberation, the BNFL board determined a sale to be in the company's best commercial interest and to represent BNG's best chance of operating successfully in the commercial market created by the Energy Act 2004, thereby providing long-term stability for staff. Most important of all, though, the company also convinced us that it would be good for the taxpayer because it is good for the nuclear decommissioning and clean-up programme.</p>
	<p pid="e.1178.1/7">I shall be happy to discuss with my hon. Friend the reason why the option of a public-private partnership was not pursued, but essentially it was because BNG would not have the required critical mass.</p>
	<p pid="e.1178.1/8">The decision for Government was not straightforward, and was taken only after extensive consultation with key stakeholders. We were especially keen that the sale should not impact negatively on the NDA's mission, and we have moved forward carefully to ensure that we have fully considered the issues. However, I am absolutely confident that we now have the right result, and one that will contribute to improved clean-up performance for the NDA by introducing external expertise more quickly.</p>
	<p pid="e.1178.1/9">The NDA's competition timetable reflects its broader strategy to prioritise the tackling of the highest hazards. Rather than run its own separate competition for Sellafield, the NDA was able to accommodate the sale by letting a new five-year contract for that site. That will commence next year, at the point when the new owner acquires BNG. The NDA and BNFL will thus work closely throughout the competitive sale process. The aim will be to ensure that the successful bidder is the best available to improve performance substantially, particularly at Sellafield. Therefore, the selection criteria will be focused mainly on issues such as safety, reducing high hazards, driving down costs through better planning and more innovation, accelerating clean-up and improved managed capability.</p>
	<p pid="e.1178.1/10">This debate is not the occasion to discuss the problems involved in nuclear decommissioning, but it is worth noting that they represent some of the really big challenges facing this country in the coming half century. Over the summer, the expert group CORUM will present a report with proposals on what might be called the final resting place for nuclear waste. Those are critical issues.</p>

	<p pid="e.1180.0/1">Does my hon. Friend agree that decommissioning represents a global rather than a purely national challenge? Increasingly, global relationships will have an impact on the nuclear industry. We have expertise in some areas, but will also have to borrow expertise from other parts of the world. Likewise, other countries will want our expertise in decommissioning.</p>

	<p pid="e.1180.1/1">I agree with my hon. Friend. The BNG sale enables us to assess the best bidders and to draw on their expertise, but he is right that Britain has great skills when it comes to nuclear energy. Indeed, we are very good at energy as a whole and we need to seize the chance to become one of the leading countries in nuclear power.</p>
	<p pid="e.1180.1/2">In assessing bids for BNG, the main emphasis will be on achieving value by making sustainable clean-up improvements in the longer term. We will keep in mind the fact that a sustained 10 per cent. efficiency improvement equates to a &pound;200 million saving on the NDA's annual budget, which can be ploughed straight back into more work. Clearly, however, there is still some way to go and it is much too early to speculate about the commercial basis on which BNFL, working with the NDA, will organise the sale process.</p>
	<p pid="e.1180.1/3">It is expected that the competitive sale process will start in April 2007 with completion up to six months later. Details will be updated on the NDA and BNFL websites, but it is currently expected that pre-qualification will occur at the end of the summer. Before the new year, the new draft contract will be shared with pre-qualified bidders, the regulators and other stakeholders on a fully open and transparent basis.</p>
	<p pid="e.1180.1/4">The sale will comprise BNG and all its subsidiaries on an integrated basis: project services, Magnox and spent fuel services will all be included. Following a successful exit from its legacy contracts, BNG America, the US clean-up subsidiary, has already been sold with no continuing liabilities. Magnox has been included on the understanding that its inclusion does not disrupt the Magnox competitions due to start in 2008, or possibly 2009. Given the short time gap between completion of the sale and the start of the competitions, the new owner of BNG will not be expected to make significant changes to the running of the Magnox stations during that period.</p>
	<p pid="e.1180.1/5">BNFL and the NDA have been maintaining a close dialogue with the unions and staff over proposals for BNG and that will continue, with the involvement of the Department as appropriate. I recognise that such fundamental change creates tremendous uncertainty for the work force, so I use this opportunity to reaffirm unequivocally that any BNFL employee whose employment is transferred to a private sector employer will receive the relevant pensions protections set out in the Energy Act 2004; or, where they do not apply, in the Cabinet Office statement of practice for staff transfers in the public sector.</p>
	<p pid="e.1180.1/6">The sale of BNG is entirely consistent with the BNFL strategy review held in 2003, which concluded that UK clean-up should be BNFL's priority. It envisaged that BNG would need to find partners to operate successfully in the new market being created by the NDA. The review also concluded that other parts of BNFL should be run for value and to minimise risk to the UK taxpayer. The sale of Westinghouse has already been announced. In addition, we are considering the future of BNFL's research and development arm, Nexia Solutions, and BNFL is exploring ways of realising value from its shareholding in Urenco.</p>

	<p pid="e.1181.0/1">An important issue came up in my broad-ranging discussions in the US last week with Ron Ault from the AFL-CIO&mdash;the US equivalent to the TUC&mdash;when we were talking about companies that might have an interest in BNG and which could have a direct impact on the lives of people in <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1850" name="David Drew">my community and those of my hon. Friends the Members for Stroud (Mr. Drew)</phrase> and for Workington (Tony Cunningham). Mr. Ault said of one company that it would rather climb a tree than do a deal with labour&mdash;meaning the unions&mdash;and that, at any cost, it would pick a fight with the trade union movement at whichever site it was asked to operate. I shall not name the company, save to say that it has run into terrible difficulties at the Hanford vitrification plant. What is my hon. Friend the Minister's view on the relationship that American companies must have with UK working practices and UK working bodies and representatives on UK nuclear sites?</p>

	<p pid="e.1182.0/1">I have already paid tribute to the skills of our work force in the nuclear industry. Those skills need to be safeguarded and we need to think about the future when, as with other parts of the energy sector&mdash;oil and gas&mdash;demographic trends mean that the average age of workers is increasing. We need to attract new people to those industries. It is critically important that whoever takes over BNG has a proper understanding of what these days we call the human relations side of business. I should rather climb a tree myself than jeopardise those important relationships. In any case, such companies would have to contend with my hon. Friend, which would be a formidable challenge.</p>
	<p pid="e.1182.0/2">I hope I have provided clarity on the issues surrounding the BNG sale and the rationale for approving the board's decision. In summary, the Government have been persuaded that it is good for the company, its people, the NDA, decommissioning and, ultimately, the taxpayer. I thank my hon. Friend and other colleagues for their contributions to this short, early, but useful, debate.</p>
