<p>My Lords and Members of the House of Commons

<q><i>We recall with great pleasure the State Visit to Nepal followed by visits to New Zealand and Australia earlier this year, as well as the recent State Visit to the People's Republic of China and the visit to Hong Kong.</i></q>
<q><i>My Government have attached great importance to relations with countries in the Far East.

<q><i>My Government and the Chinese Government have made good progress in carrying out the Sinn-British Joint Declaration on Hong Kong.</i></q>
<q><i>My Government have enhanced the United Kingdom's defences and played a full part in the Atlantic Alliance. My Government have worked vigorously for balanced and verifiable agreements on arms control in respect of nuclear, chemical and conventional weapons, keeping in close consultation with the United Kingdom's allies. They were active at the Stockholm Conference on Disarmament in Europe which reached agreement in September. They have continued to seek improved relations with the Soviet Union and the countries of Eastern Europe.</i></q>

<p>My Lords and Members of the House of Commons
<q><i>My Government's policies have been successful in reducing inflation to levels not seen for almost 20 years. The output of the nation continues to expand and the number of people in work continues to grow.</i></q>
<q><i>In order to give more help to the unemployed, my Government have through the Wages Act removed some outdated obstacles to the creation on new jobs and have expanded existing employment and training measures including the introduction of the national Restart programme for the long term unemployed and the expansion of the Community Programme and the Enterprise Allowance Scheme. The "Action for Jobs" information campaign has been introduced to ensure that employers, employees and unemployed people know what help is available to them.</i></q>
<q><i>My Government continue to attach the highest importance to the education and training of young people and to improving the links between school and work. The new two year Youth Training Scheme was launched successfully and the Technical and Vocational Education Initiative has been expanded to a nationwide programme offering the opportunity of participation to all those between 14 and 18 years of age at school.</i></q>
<q><i>My Government have taken additional initiatives to encourage enterprise and improve the performance of the economy. The basic rate of income tax has been further reduced.</i></q>
<q><i>Continuing my Government's programme of encouraging greater industrial efficiency and promoting wider share ownership, legislation has been enacted to provide for the setting up of new regulatory arrangements for the gas supply and airports industries and for the sale of shares in British Gas and the British Airports Authority to the public. An Act was also passed to enable the Atomic Energy Authority to operate as a trading fund from 1 April 1986 with a capital structure and borrowing powers. The remaining warship yards of British Shipbuilders have been sold as have my Government's</i>

<i>residual shares in Cable and Wireless. The National Bus Company has begun to sell its undertakings to the private sector including sales to managers and employees.</i></q>
<q><i>An Act has been passed to enable building societies to increase the range of services offered to the public and to provide a new statutory framework for their supervision.</i></q>
<q><i>Legislation has been passed to extend and reform the regulation of investment business. This will protect the interest of investors while encouraging the continued development of strong, efficient and competitive financial services.</i></q>
<q><i>Legislation has been enacted to improve the management of schools in England and Wales and to promote the professional effectiveness of teachers.</i></q>
<q><i>An Act has been passed giving further effect to my Government's policies towards agriculture and the countryside.</i></q>
<q><i>Legislation has been passed to encourage the sale of publicly owned flats to their tenants and the wider involvement of private business in the ownership and management of council housing, and to improve the planning system.</i></q>
<q><i>Legislation has been enacted to prohibit expenditure on party political publicity by local authorities and to require local authorities to make a rate by 1 April each year.</i></q>
<q><i>An Act has been passed to reform social security.</i></q>
<q><i>In Northern Ireland, the security forces have continued the fight against terrorism with courage and dedication. My Government has entered into an Agreement with the Government of the Republic of Ireland which it believes can benefit all the people of Northern Ireland and help achieve greater peace and stability.</i></q>
<q><i>For Scotland, measures have been passed to extend the rights of public sector tenants, facilitate the private ownership of public sector housing and improve the building control system, and to improve legal aid arrangements.</i></q>
<q><i>Further progress has been made in the consolidation of statute law. Legislation has been passed for England and Wales to set fair time limits for cases involving latent damage; provision has been made to settle conflicts of law relating to child abduction within the United Kingdom, and to reform the law of land registration and the administration of funds by the Public Trustee and other authorities.</i></q>
<q><i>An Act has been passed to enable the courts in England and Wales to confiscate the proceeds of drug trafficking, and to penalise those who assist traffickers to retain the benefit of such proceeds.</i></q>
<q><i>An Act has been passed to reform the law relating to public order.</i></q>
<q><i>Legislation has been enacted to establish improved arrangements for the protection of animals used for experimental and other scientific purposes.</i></q>
