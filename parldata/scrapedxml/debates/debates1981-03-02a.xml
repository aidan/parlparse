<p>Is my hon. Friend aware that much public sector housing in Wales is in urgent need of repair? Does


he not agree that one of the ways in which local authorities can fund the necessary repairs is by ensuring that as many council houses as possible are sold, because they will be able to use their capital receipts to that end? Will he publicise the desirability of people applying to buy their council houses before 3 April this year so that valuations for purchase purposes will be as at August of last year?</p>

<p>My hon. Friend is right on all points. It is important that council tenants should exercise their right to buy and apply before 3 April because the valuation they are given will then be as at 8 August last year. The housing authorities can, of course, supplement their allocations by the net proceeds of council house sales.</p>

<p>Does the Minister realise that this policy is irrelevant to most of the people of Wales, and is certainly irrelevant to Wales' basic housing problems? During the next few years local authorities, if the Government achieve their targets, will be selling more houses than they will be building. The Opposition believe that it is rubbish for any Minister to tell the House that there is already too much public sector housing in Wales. What foundation does the hon. Gentleman think he is laying for the next generation by blindly adding the prospect of homelessness to the prospect of joblessness?</p>

<p>The first phase of Ysbyty Gwynedd will provide most of the services found at a modern district general hospital with the exception of obstetric, gynaecology and paediatric services, which will continue for the present at the St. David's hospital, Bangor. The Gwynedd health authority intends, however, to move these services to Ysbyty Gwynedd and is currently preparing plans to do so in the second phase construction. Completion of the main contract for Ysbyty Gwynedd phase I is expected in May this year, and the commissioning programme provides for the hospital coming into use early in 1982.</p>

<p>I welcome my hon. Friend's statement and the fact that the Government are spending more in real terms on the National Health Service than have any previous Government. However, is he aware of the great strength of feeling in my constituency that there should be at least one community hospital on Anglesey? Will he do everything possible to convince my right hon.

<p>I appreciate my hon. Friend's views, but he will know that the Caernarvon and Anglesey hospital, which Ysbyty Gwynedd is to replace, served both counties and was highly regarded on both sides of the Menai Strait.

<p>Does the Minister accept that to get the maximum benefit out of the new hospital requires a substantial increase in joint care planning between the health authority and the social services department in the area of Gwynedd, a function that is way behind in Wales compared with most parts of England? What initiatives will the Government take to ensure that joint care planning gets off the ground in Gwynedd?</p>

<p>The area health authority and the county social services department have a co-terminosity by which I lay great store, because I believe that from that co-terminosity co-operation will spring.

<p>In view of those desperately serious figures will the Minister assure us that when the Secretary of State returns from Japan he will make a report about his visit with particular reference to inward investment and giving an up-to-date view of the Nissan-Datsun project? On the latter, does the Minister accept the potential of my constituency as a site for Nissan-Datsun, given the nearness of RTZ's aluminium smelter and Ferodo's Caernarvon factory, which should be factors in its favour?

<p>The question of a statement is one for my right hon. Friend. We all share concern about the unemployment figures and the human suffering that is involved throughout the Principality. We are aware of the high level of unemployment in the Shotton area. Nissan will not be directed as to where it should go but will make its own choice of location. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State is involved in a mission to Japan, and he has met representatives of the Nissan company, although he has not visited it. He told the company that there were suitable sites in Wales and that it would be warmly welcomed to the Principality if it chose to go there. I am sure that that welcome covers the Shotton area. My right hon. Friend emphasised that he was speaking as a United Kingdom Minister and that the same level of help and co-operation would be found in other regions.</p>

<p>I fully support the efforts of the hon. Member for Flint, East (Mr. Jones) to attract Nissan investment to his constituency. However, is not the principal attraction of Wales, or the United Kingdom generally, as a place for Nissan to invest the fact that it will provide access to the whole of the European market? Is not that advantage gravely prejudiced by threats from the Labour Party to take us out of the EEC?</p>

<p>There is no certainty that the Nissan company will set up in the United Kingdom. It is engaged in a feasibility study. It is certain, however, that it would not choose to establish investment in an area outside the EEC.

<p>Is not the terrifying reality that 1,000 jobs are disappearing in Wales every week&#x2014;200 every working day? Is it not a measure of the massive scale of the Government-induced disaster in Wales that even if we succeed in securing the Nissan car project that will merely offset four weeks of the Government's job destruction, and that it will not do that until the mid-1980s? What do the Government intend to do now&#x2014;not in the mid-1980s&#x2014;for the 146,000 people who are unemployed in Wales?</p>

<p>No Minister can ever be satisfied so long as there is inadequate housing anywhere in Wales. But, unavoidably, housing has had to bear its share of the necessary reductions in public expenditure. We have tried to ensure that local authorities and housing associations have a sufficient allocation in 1981&#x2013;82 to enable them to undertake worthwhile programmes. Moreover, local authorities now have wide discretion to use their total capital allocations as they see fit. But, of course, the provision of public sector rented accommodation is but one approach to meeting housing needs.</p>

<p>With permission, I will make a statement on my visit to the United States.<br/>
I visited the United States from 25 to 28 February, accompanied by my noble Friend the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary. I had talks in Washington with President Reagan, Vice-President Bush, Secretary of State Haig, Defence Secretary Weinberger and other members of the President's Cabinet. I also met members of both Houses of Congress. In New York I had a meeting with the Secretary-General of the United Nations.<br/>
The reception given to us in Washington was warm and generous, testifying to the health of the Anglo-American relationship and also to the excellent understanding that President Reagan and I had established even before either of us assumed our present responsibilities.<br/>
My talks with President Reagan and members of his Cabinet covered all the most important aspects of the international scene. The discussions were particularly timely, since the new Administration are still formulating their policy on many of the issues raised. At this early stage in the new Administration's period in office there was, of course, no question of new commitments being entered into by either side.<br/>
We exchanged views on East-West relations as a whole and, in particular, on the speech that President Brezhnev delivered a week ago. We agreed that it contains, besides much that is unacceptable for Britain and America, certain points that need to be explained and explored. That applies, for instance, to President Brezhnev's remarks about arms control, which both President Reagan and I see as a necessary complement to defence and deterrence.<br/>
On the Middle East, I explained the objectives of the European initiative stemming from the Venice declaration of last June. I pointed out that the initiative was intended not to compete with American efforts but to complement them. On Southern Africa, we agreed to keep closely in touch, especially in relation to Namibia&#x2014;a problem to which the United Nations is increasingly turning its attention.<br/>
On El Salvador, the Americans expressed their concern about the developing conflict and in particular made clear their opposition to the support that the guerrilla movement is receiving from external sources. My noble Friend and I indicated that the British Government shared the American view of outside interference in the internal affairs of El Salvador. We explained that we condemned violence from whatever quarter it came and that we considered that the people of El Salvador should be able to determine their own future peacefully and democratically.<br/>
The President and I discussed the threat to the stability and security of the Gulf and South-West Asia following the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. I said that Britain shared the determination of the United States and of our other Allies to prevent Soviet encroachment in the region. We discussed the possible creation of a rapid deployment force, which would be available for use, if necessary, in an emergency in this or other areas of the world. The matter will be the subject of consultation. I made it clear that if such a force were created the United Kingdom would be ready to contribute to it, in the same way as, in

conjunction with the United States and France, we have already stationed naval units in the Gulf in response to the situation arising from the Iran-Iraq war.<br/>
In my discussion with Defence Secretary Weinberger I pointed out that this year and last the United Kingdom had increased its defence spending in accordance with the NATO target. The Defence Secretary and I agreed that there should be better balance in defence purchases between this country and the United States. That would lead to more effective use of the Alliance's resources.<br/>
On all the matters that we discussed President Reagan and the members of his Cabinet whom I met expressed their intention of consulting even more closely and frequently than in the past not only with Britain but with America's other allies. Indeed, that is already happening. I naturally welcome the American intention, and I hope that my own visit will have contributed to deepening the understanding on which such consultation must always be based.</p>

<p>I thank the right hon. Lady for agreeing to the demand that we made last week that she should make a statement today on her visit, but she could not speak on behalf of a united nation when she went to the United States unless she had changed both her tone and attitude on a whole range of issues on which she expressed views in the United States.<br/>
In the United States the Prime Minister gave several homilies on our domestic affairs, but does she appreciate that the most friendly advice that she could have given to the United States was not to follow her example? Is it really the case that, as her communique and today's statement seem to indicate, she did not at any time raise with the President the possibility of concerted action by the United States Government, the British Government and others on measures to defeat the slump? Did they not have any discussions on that subject?<br/>
Does the Prime Minister understand that on several matters of foreign policy that she mentioned, including El Salvador, the neutron bomb&#x2014;I am sorry that she did not refer to that in her statement&#x2014;and the measures that she is apparently contemplating for dealing with the situaton in the Persian Gulf, one of the obligations and duties of a British Government should be to warn of the perils that might follow if certain courses are adopted? The right hon. Lady says that she is against intervention in El Salvador, but is she against United States' intervention? As for the Gulf, does not the Prime Minister think that it would have been better if, before making her statements, she had discovered what would be the reaction to some of those statements in the places involved?<br/>
Does the Prime Minister appreciate that one of the greatest dangers for the United States would be to intervene at the wrong time, in the wrong place, on the wrong side? Does she not understand that that is truly the lesson of Vietnam, which she does not seem to have learnt?<br/>
On the question that the Prime Minister raised about detente and discussions with other Powers, we all appreciate that for detente to be successful there must be responses from the Soviet Union and others and we appreciate that, for almost the first time, the Prime Minister has had to emphasise the need for arms control, but does she not think that she would have assisted the


cause of detente more if she had not indulged in so much bellicose demagogy in the United States on the very matter on which demagogy is most out of place?</p>

<p>The right hon. Gentleman says that I could not speak for a united nation. I want to make it clear that I could never speak for the leader of a party that believes in unilateral disarmament. So long as that is the case, I am afraid that the view of the United States is that the defence of this country would not be safe with such a party; nor would the defence of the West.<br/>
In regard to domestic affairs, we discussed with a number of people, including the President, the problems of world recession. It is clear that United States industrialists believe that there will be expansion during the second half of this year, as we also hope and believe will happen. We were very much aware that the origin of the world recession was a sharp increase in the price of oil that has occurred over the last 18 months. This matter occurs frequently. It is discussed between Heads of Government, including Heads of Government in Europe. The question is easier to pose than to find a solution to when there are regular meetings of OPEC and the price is raised. As the right hon. Gentleman will be aware, the price of North Sea oil in this country was fixed by the previous Government to be at world price. That is in statute.<br/>
With regard to El Salvador, we made a statement before we went. That statement is available in full. We made it clear that we fully understood the strategic importance of the region of Central America to the United States. For the rest, I stand absolutely by the statement that we published, which was welcomed in the United States.<br/>
On the neutron bomb, no proposal has been put before us. The United States has said that any further move will be the subject of consultation with the allies.<br/>
With regard to a rapid deployment force, I point out to the right hon. Gentleman that in a way we were ahead of the rest of the world. In the last defence White Paper, in the chapter on wider defence interests, we raised a similar subject, although not under that identical name, when we recognised that some of the threats were arising outside the NATO area, that the NATO Alliance could not respond under NATO command outside the area, and that members of the Alliance might therefore have to make particular arrangements. A whole chapter in the defence White Paper deals with the matter. In the debate on 28 October it was referred to again by my right hon. Friend the present Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster when he was Secretary of State for Defence. There is nothing new in that. The possibility of a rapid deployment force is being considered. I would point out that if we have one, at least we can respond to requests when trouble arises the world over. If we have not, we cannot, and by that time it will be too late to create it.<br/>
I recognise what the right hon. Gentleman said about detente. I would say that it must be fully reciprocated. I am sorry that the right hon. Gentleman does not wholly share my view. He makes certain comments about arms control. I again point out that the NATO decision on theatre nuclear forces was accompanied by a recommendation that talks on arms control of TNF should be entered into immediately. One such meeting was held. There have not so far been any further meetings. We both recognise, together with our European allies, the importance of that.<br/>
On TNF, we also recognise that the Soviet Union is well ahead of this country, the whole of Europe and the United States. It is about time that we ourselves, in order to deter, had a similar capability, unless that of the Soviet Union is to be substantially reduced.</p>

<p>On one or two of the matters mentioned by the right hon. Lady important questions arise that we shall wish to debate fully in the House. She refers to the rapid deployment force. If we were so far ahead of the rest of the world on the subject, as she said, why could we not have undertaken proper consultation with the countries involved? Why are those countries the first to be protesting at what she and, apparently, the President said?<br/>
On the subject of El Salvador, the right hon. Lady says that she stands by the statement that she made earlier. That statement itself, of course, was not satisfactory. Will she say now whether she is opposed to United States intervention in El Salvador, or is it only one-sided intervention to which she is opposed?<br/>
On the question of detente and the statement made by Mr.. Brezhnev, can the Prime Minister say when it is likely that some progress will be made in establishing a real conference in which these matters can be discussed? Did she make any real progress on such matters in her discussions in the United States?</p>

<p>We stand absolutely by the statement that we made on El Salvador before going to the United States. The first point is to try to stop the large supplies of arms to the guerrillas. I cannot comment on each and every activity of the United States. It would be most improper to do so.<br/>
With regard to what the right hon. Gentleman says about the capacity to operate outside the NATO area, I refer him to the part of the"Defence in the 1980s" White Paper, which says:
<q>the Government believes that the Services should also be able to operate effectively outside the NATO area, without diminishing our central commitment to the Alliance&#x2026; certain improvements in the Services' worldwide capability are being considered".</q>
The document goes on to detail them, and adds:
<q>Such improvements can be achievedat relatively modest cost, yet they give the Services significantly more flexibility to undertake tasks outside the NATO area. What is needed is the ability for all three Services to combine in providing a force of appropriate size and capability as may be necessary.</q>
It seems to me that if people are really concerned, and truly concerned, in protecting the freedom of the West. since that freedom may be challenged anywhere in the globe, unless one considers the creation of a rapid deployment force one denies the capacity to meet that threat. I can quite understand that the right hon. Gentleman may never wish to have a capacity to meet a threat. We wish to try to consider having such a capacity. We believe that one has to be prepared before such a threat arises.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman mentioned conferences about detente. We had the Madrid conference, but because the Soviet Union is still in Afghanistan in full force it was not a success. The best thing that could happen for the future of detente would be for the Soviet Union to withdraw from Afghanistan, and soon.</p>

Members on the Conservative Benches have been urging for some years that the defence of the West depended on defending the periphery, particularly the Gulf and Southern Africa? Is she aware that we well understood the difficulty of her Government in giving effect to our advice so long as the American Administration were vacillating, as they have done in the past? Will she allow me to offer my congratulations to her on having grasped, at once, the opportunity to align ourselves wholeheartedly with the new American Adminstration in saying that we would not only support but would join in the defence of our essential interests in the Gulf, Southern Africa or wherever it may be in defending the freedom of the free world?</p>

<p>This has been a subject of considerable debate for some time. It is clearly not possible to defend outside the NATO area unless we have a capability to do so. We were already making certain modest changes in that direction ourselves. It would seem right that we, with our allies, should discuss the possible creation of such a force. That is exactly what we learnt when we visited the United States. Of course, its use would also depend on consultation with States in the area.</p>

<p>Since I was one of those who criticised the Prime Minister for the lack of a statement after her visit to Ireland, may I welcome the fact that she has made a statement today and is open to questioning? Does the Prime Minister recognise that her apparent accord with President Reagan is profoundly disturbing? It is right to be suspicious of Soviet activities and to demand withdrawal from Afghanistan, but does the right hon. Lady recognise that a growing generation is deeply worried about the waste of resources on the arms race by both sides of the Iron Curtain and by the habit of world leaders of keeping each other at arm's length and in personal ignorance and mutual hostility?<br/>
Will the right hon. Lady and President Reagan recognise that the way to defeat the march of world Communism is not by giving aid and comfort to other totalitarian regimes in El Salvador or Southern Africa but by demonstrating that the free democracies have superior values? Will she accept that her Government have singularly failed to do that, with cuts in overseas aid and broadcasting and increases in fees for overseas students, particularly from poorer countries? Does she accept that the process will not be helped by the hint of a return to the role of an uninvited world policeman?</p>

<p>I find it very alarming indeed that the Liberal Party, too, seems to be retreating from the first duty of defending our own freedom and that of the Western Alliance. It plainly does not have the guts to devote the resources. There would be no freedom and there would be no Western way of life if we were not prepared to defend it. If we did not, and trouble arose, we should

be the first to be criticised. Some of us lived through that period before. So long as this Government are here we shall never retreat to a failure to defend again.<br/>
Of course we should like to be able to defend at a lower level of balance. However, I wish that some people who feel as strongly as we do would direct their criticism to the Soviet Union, which devotes 13 per cent. of its gross national product to increasing armaments year after year after year.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman mentioned the defeat of the march of world Communism. Our first duty to freedom, as well as defending it, is to proclaim our own.</p>

<q>Her Majesty's Government have now had an opportunity to study the information provided by the United States Government about arms supplies to insurgent groups in El Salvador.

<q>Her Majesty's Government note, with concern, the continuing violence inside El Salvador and the suffering and hardship this causes to the people of that country. We condemn such violence from whatever quarter. Her Majesty's Government look to the Government of El Salvador to take all possible steps to protect the Salvadorean people from violations of basic human rights and, in particular, to exercise firm control over all Government institutions and organisations.</q>

<p>I know that some Conservative Members below the Gangway do not care a damn about the murders in El Salvador, but we do. Since the right hon.

That is perfectly clear, and I do not understand why the right hon. Gentleman persists in further cross-examination.<br/>
Of course one is concerned about the murder, violence and hardship in El Salvador, from whatever quarter they come. We made that perfectly clear in our statement. We continue to make it perfectly clear that the people of El Salvador should again be able to be free to decide their own future.

<p>I wish to raise a problem that has faced one of my constituents, Mr. Edward Penney of 18 Lancaster Avenue, Horwich, regarding his claim for disablement benefit.<br/>
Edward Penney first claimed disablement benefit in March 1976, on the ground that he had been suffering from a prescribed disease known as byssinosis since 1 December 1976. He had had to leave his job in the weaving and winding shed of a cotton mill because he was physically unable to carry on, and he had been advised by his chest specialist to stop working. He was 52 years old.<br/>
He was first examined by a pneumoconiosis medical board&#x2014;PMB&#x2014;in June 1976. His claim was rejected, and the report concluded that he was suffering from acute bronchitis and high blood pressure. Subsequent examinations by Mr. Penney's general practitioner and his chief specialist disagreed with that diagnosis. Mr. Penney then reapplied for disablement benefit following the advice of the chest specialist at Bolton, who considered that Mr. Penney was suffering from a condition that was a direct result of working with cotton dust.<br/>
The second time Mr. Penney was examined by the PMB, following his application in September, there was one doctor&#x2014;according to my constituent, the other left after a few moments&#x2014;and the entire examination lasted approximately 10 minutes. The conclusion was that Mr. Penney's condition was due to cigarette smoking. There was no mention of blood pressure. For this examination neither Mr. Penney's general practitioner nor his consultant chest specialist was consulted in any way, and there was no report of the examination. There was only a rejection of the claim.<br/>
At this stage Mr. Penney was informed by an official at the disablement benefit office that there was no right of appeal to an independent medical tribunal. Fortunately, Mr. Penney had better information, having seen a newspaper clipping announcing new measures whereby a claimant could appeal from January 1977 provided he had applied for disablement benefit and had been rejected four times over a two-year period.<br/>
Mr. Penney applied again. He was examined by the PMB in April 1977. His claim was again rejected and the PMB this time considered that he was suffering from"obstructive airways disease".<br/>
I was contacted by Mr. Penney at about this stage, and I intervened by writing to the DHSS, asking why neither details of Mr. Penney's medical background nor consultation with his general practitioner or specialist had been sought by the PMB. The response to this was that the hospital case notes and chest X-rays had been obtained, but the reason given why neither the chest specialist nor Mr. Penney's GP had been contacted was:
<q>It is the practice of these boards to obtain all the medical evidence which they think may help them in reaching their conclusions. It is entirely for them to decide what evidence they should obtain &#x2026; These boards are independent statutory authorities and neither the Secretary of State nor any other Minister can comment on or intervene in their decisions".</q>
However, despite this reply, a subsequent letter from the DHSS stated:

<q>Although a right of appeal to the Medical Appeal Tribunal against the diagnosis decision of the Pneumoconiosis Medical Board exists only in certain limited circumstances, the claimant does not have such a right of appeal. However, in view of the letter dated 19th April 1977 from Roger Stott, MP and the letter dated 10th May 1977 from the claimant, the Secretary of State for Social Services has directed that the decision of the PMB of the 28th April 1977 should be referred to the Medical Appeal Tribunal".</q>
Before continuing with the subsequent sequence of events that finally led to Mr. Penney's successful claim in 1980, I should say that several points have already emerged.<br/>
The first is the range of conflicting medical opinion. There is also the fact that Mr. Penney, his general practitioner and his chest specialist, who had been looking after him for years, had never been personally consulted. One would expect, surely, that any medical board that had the power to determine whether an applicant could or could not receive financial support because of his disabilities should be fully informed of the applicant's medical history. In Mr. Penney's case, during the course of his second examination and subsequent examinations, two independent specialists regarded as experts were consulted. Both of these experts found that Mr. Penney's symptoms were a result of working in a cotton mill.<br/>
Dr. Flindt, a lecturer in occupational medicine at the university of Manchester said:
<q>in advanced cases it is virtually impossible to unscramble which symptoms and signs are due to byssinosis alone &#x2026; Byssinosis is an unsatisfactory diagnosis, depending as it does primarily on the patient's history, but in his case it is my opinion that there are insufficient grounds for not giving him the benefit of any 'doubt'. A decision not to accept a patient as having byssinosis is of little importance when disability is minimal, but in his case it is substantial.</q>
The second expert opinion was sought from Dr. Mann at the Halifax infirmary. His opinion was:
<q>In my view Mr. Penney is suffering from byssinosis. This is an extremely difficult diagnosis to establish in that there are no pathagnomonic appearances on the chest X-ray, and one is entirely dependent on the patient's history and occupational exposure.</q>
If Mr. Penney's case were an exception, if by some peculiar quirk his byssinosis symptoms did not conform with the majority, perhaps one would let the matter rest, but this unfortunately is not the case, as is shown by the findings of the TUC.<br/>
The TUC has been examining the question of the determination of industrial disablement benefit on account of pneumoconiosis. Its conclusions are based on a large number of cases over a number of years and therefore cannot be accused of being biased or taking one exceptional case. The TUC says:
<q>The view has been expressed that both on the basis on which and the methods by which diagnosis decisions are made are far too restrictive, and the burdens of proof placed on the claimants are too great. It has been proposed that less weight be placed on radiographic evidence and that claims be determined on the basis of examination of a claimant's occupational history and actual disability, having regard to the balance of probabilities of his symptoms being associated with pneumoconiosis.</q>
Surely the fundamental point is that Mr. Penney suffers byssinosis as a result of working in the cotton industry for 29 years. Whether his symptoms do or do not exactly conform with strict and narrowly defined criteria of the disease byssinosis misses the humanitarian point.<br/>
The TUC also found:
<q>Examples have been cited where there are wide differences of opinion between the diagnosis of the PMB doctors and independent chest specialists consulted by the Union"&#x2014;</q>
as was the case with Mr. Penney.<br/>
There is a strong case&#x2014;here is the kernel of my argument&#x2014;for demanding a reappraisal of the criteria and methods used for determining whether claimants suffer from these industrial lung diseases. Particularly, there should be a more comprehensive examination of the sufferer's medical history, as it seems that these diseases cause certain problems of classification, X-rays are not always reliable, and symptoms vary from patient to patient. It is interesting to note that there have been considerable problems in diagnosing these diseases even after a post mortem has taken place. Time does not permit me this evening to go into the evidence that I have to substantiate that claim. The"benefit of the doubt" decisions have to be made in these cases.<br/>
The PMB system should work for and not against the sufferers and their dependants. One wonders how many sufferers of byssinosis with less persistence than Mr. Penney have been unsuccessful in claiming their rights to disablement benefit when one sees that in 1979, of the 268 PMB examinations, some 75 were diagnosed as having an industrial disease.<br/>
My second major point is in connection with the lack of information that would seem to be available about the full complexities of the claim system, especially as regards appeals. Mr. Penney is a member of a small union which was able to finance the first specialist independent report but simply did not have the resources or the knowledge fully to pursue Mr. Penney's case.<br/>
Mr. Penney, following his first medical tribunal, went to see a solicitor whose name he had come across from a television programme. As far as he and I were concerned, following a letter from a Minister at the DHSS, he had absolutely no right of appeal on medical grounds. The solicitor took up his case and recommended another independent specialist report. Dr. Mann, of the Halifax infirmary, requested a further appeal, which was granted. Mr. Penny, through his persistence and hard work, obtained his first appeal, but how many other people in a similar position would have won through? The first appeal was granted, it would seem, because Mr. Penny went to his Member of Parliament. The second appeal was granted through a solicitor he found by chance through a television programme, after Mr. Penny and I, his Member of Parliament, had been informed that no such appeal was possible.<br/>
The slowness of the procedure was also deplorable. On receiving the letter in November 1978, which said that the appeal had been granted, Mr. Penny did not receive word to appear before the board until 22 March the following year. The appeal failed, but Mr. Penny did not receive official notification of the results until 18 May. That followed a letter from the solicitor and inquiries by Mr. Penny at the disablement benefit office. Mr. Penny's general practitioner, however, had, paradoxically, been informed of the results on 26 April. There seems no logic in a system that does not consult a claimant's general practitioner about his health but informs the general practitioner first, rather than the claimant, of the results of any decisions.<br/>
In August 1980, Mr. Penney received several years' back pay of benefits, when it was finally determined by the doctors on the pneumoconiosis medical board that he was suffering from byssinosis. The doctor at the time could not understand what the problem had been for the

past four years. After four years, the man had gone through four medical examinations and two appeal procedures. He had the tenacity and personal courage to transcend the bureaucratic brick wall that had been placed in front of him.<br/>
This is one of the most disturbing cases that I have come across as a Member of Parliament. I hope that this debate will go some way towards redressing the balance in favour of those unfortunate people who suffer from this crippling industrial disease. They face an unprecedented and unmitigated response, both from the medical profession and from the DHSS. If this debate does nothing more it will have read into the record one man's personal suffering over five years and one man's personal triumph.</p>

<p>I am grateful to the hon. Member for Westhoughton (Mr. Stott) for the clear expression of his concern for the victims of occupational diseases in general and, particularly, for those disabled by byssinosis, the cotton workers' disease. It is a concern that is shared by both sides of the House. I also congratulate the hon. Gentleman on the way in which he has pursued his constituent's case over the last five years.<br/>
In the International Year of Disabled People it is most important that we should not forget those whose disabilities have been caused by their work, and that we should make every effort to ensure that they receive the special benefits designed for them. Therefore, we owe the hon. Gentleman a debt of gratitude. Perhaps I may set the hon. Gentleman's case in context by saying a few words about byssinosis itself&#x2014;for it is a condition that is not generally well known&#x2014;and also about the way in which claims for the disease are handled under the industrial injuries scheme.<br/>
Byssinosis is a respiratory disease that occurs in workers who have been exposed to the dust from cotton or flax. Cotton dust is its most common cause and the disease is most prevalent among those people employed in cotton chambers, blowing rooms and carding rooms though the final processes of cotton production&#x2014;spinning and finishing&#x2014;can also cause the condition.<br/>
The chronic cough of some flax and hemp workers was mentioned in a treatise on occupational medicine as long ago as 1700. Even so, knowledge of the causes and effects of the disease has built up only very gradually, and even now is far from being complete.<br/>
Cotton byssinosis was first recognised as a compensatable industrial disease in Great Britain in 1940. That, of course, was in the days of the Workmen's Compensation Act. The cover was continued under the industrial injuries scheme introduced in 1948 and it has since been extended to cover workers in flax, so industrial injuries benefits are now available to anyone who has been employed since July 1948 in, as the regulation puts it,
<q>any occupation in any room where any process up to and including the winding or beaming process is performed in factories in which the spinning or manipulation of raw or waste cotton or of flax is carried on".</q>
Byssinosis presents particular problems of diagnosis. Its onset is gradual and it is not characterised by any abnormality of the chest that can be shown up by X-rays. Diagnosis in the early stages depends entirely on the medical and occupational history. The hon. Gentleman's remarks showed that most clearly.<br/>
The first symptoms usually occur after several years in employment, when the sufferer complains of tightness in


the chest on return to work on a Monday morning or following a holiday. By Tuesday, he usually feels normal and continues to do so for the rest of the week.<br/>
Fortunately, in many cases there may be no further progression, but in some the sufferer may notice, after some years, that the chest tightness persists till Tuesday or Wednesday. Finally, it lasts right through the week, although it is still usually worst on Mondays. Eventually the condition may become severe, with breathlessness on every day and a persistent cough and difficulty in breathing. While the early symptoms of byssinosis are reversible, permanent damage may occur with time, and the severe stage of the disease is indistinguishable from that of emphysema and chronic bronchitis.<br/>
Because of these difficulties of diagnosis, byssinosis claims under the industrial injuries scheme have always been dealt with by a special medical adjudication system. It is the same as that used to decide pneumoconiosis claims and claims for some other, less common, respiratory diseases. The reason is simply that ever since compensation was first provided for industrial lung diseases in 1919 it has been recognised that their diagnosis was best left to specially appointed doctors.<br/>
Under the industrial injuries scheme, these doctors are the members of the pneumoconiosis medical panels from whose members the pneumoconiosis medical boards are formed. It is their statutory duty to decide whether a claimant is suffering from byssinosis&#x2014;or pneumoconiosis, as the case may be&#x2014;and, if so, to assess the resultant disablement. They are completely independent of my Department, and no Minister can interfere with them in the exercise of their jurisdiction. The panel, based in Manchester, specialises in byssinosis and the extent of its experience may be gauged from the fact that it examined 400 such cases last year. I understand that the boards conduct an X-ray examination and test lung function in all cases unless it is thought medically undesirable to do so. They also consult records of hospital and general practitioners' treatment in appropriate cases and, of course, any evidence presented by claimants. The boards' decisions on diagnosis may be overruled by the more highly qualified medical appeal tribunal&#x2014;the MAT&#x2014;to which claimants may appeal under certain conditions.<br/>
The medical appeal tribunal, too, is an independent statutory body. It consists of a chairman, who is an experienced lawyer appointed by the Lord Chancellor, and two medical members of consultant status. In pneumoconiosis or byssinosis cases they are specialists in diseases of the chest. In addition to appeal cases, the MATs can also deal with cases referred to them by the Secretary of State under powers conferred by the Social Security Act where he thinks that a medical board's decision ought to be reconsidered.<br/>
Medicine is not an exact science and it is inevitable that differences of medical opinion will occur from time to time. But it is essential, under a statutory scheme for awarding benefit, that machinery should exist for making authoritative, final decisions on medical questions. MAT decisions on matters of medical fact are therefore final. As Mr. Justice Diplock, as he then was, said in the Divisional Court in 1958, the tribunals
<q>use their own expertise to reach their own expert conclusions on the matters of medical fact and opinion involved.</q>

Social security law does, however, make provision for the review of a diagnosis decision of medical boards and MATs if a board is satisfied by"fresh evidence" that it
<q>was given in ignorance of, or was based on a mistake as to, some material fact.</q>
For the benefit of non-lawyer Members, I should explain that"fresh evidence" in this context has been held by the courts to mean evidence that has come to the applicant's knowledge since the original decision was given and that could not by reasonable means have come to his knowledge before that time. In support of the finality of MAT decisions, the review provisions require that the tribunal's leave be given before one of its decisions may be reviewed. For completeness's sake, I should add that an MAT decision may be set aside by a social security commissioner if he finds it erroneous in law.<br/>
There is, of course, no restriction on the number of new claims that a peron may make, but a favourable decision on a new claim cannot cover a period covered by an unfavourable decision on an earlier claim unless that decision is reversed on appeal or review.<br/>
I turn to the case of Mr. Penney the vicissitudes of which the hon. Member has vividly recounted. Mr. Penney first made a claim in respect of byssinosis in March 1976. A pneumoconiosis medical board examined him but decided that he was not suffering from byssinosis and his claim was disallowed, as were subsequent claims later, in 1976 and in 1977. In 1978 he appealed to a medical appeal tribunal. He had no right of appeal at that time, but his case was referred to the MAT on behalf of the then Secretary of State. The tribunal upheld the decision of the 1977 board that byssinosis was not present.<br/>
However, an independent medical report was submitted to the medical appeal tribunal later that year and the tribunal granted leave for its decision to be reviewed by a pneumoconiosis medical board in accordance with the provision that I have already mentioned.<br/>
A fourth pneumoconiosis medical board therefore examined Mr. Penney in March 1979, but did not diagnose byssinosis, so his claim was once more disallowed. However, when Mr. Penney appealed to a medical appeal tribunal it declared, in February 1980, that the board's decision was a nullity because it appeared not to have treated the case as an application under the fresh evidence provisions but to have considered it as though it were a new claim.<br/>
Mr. Penney therefore made an application to be seen by another pneumoconiosis medical board, which, having considered all the available evidence, decided in 1980 that he was suffering from byssinosis. The board also reviewed the adverse decisions of the medical appeal tribunal of 1978 and was thus enabled to backdate its decision to that of the original claim in 1976.<br/>
The board assessed Mr. Penney's disablement at 50 per cent. from 2 March 1976, 60 per cent. from 2 March 1978, and 70 per cent. from 2 March 1979. I understand that the appropriate disablement benefit is now in payment and that Mr. Penney is also receiving the supplement known as special hardship allowance because his illness caused him to give up his job.<br/>
In retrospect, Mr. Penney must indeed feel that he has had to travel a long and very hard road to obtain benefit. I can readily understand that the adjudicating machinery that I have described and the way in which it operates may seem complex and confusing, or even frustrating, to him and to other claimants, particularly when they are in any


case beset with the problems of ill health. Of course, no system that deals with such difficult questions, on which experts conscientiously hold different opinions, can satisfy all those who pass through it.<br/>
We nevertheless believe that the basis of the adjudicating system is the best that can be devised in the present state of our knowledge. But we are constantly on the look-out for methods of improvement, just as we are always trying to find ways in which we can communicate more clearly to claimants for these and other benefits what is available and how to make a claim and, if necessary, an appeal. We are also always ready to consider any points that those who, like the hon. Member, have a genuine interest in the handling of industrial injuries benefits, may put to us.<br/>
As I have explained, I cannot interfere with or comment on the decisions of independent adjudicating authorities in

particular cases, but I hope that I have at least been able to explain something of why these authorities exist and how they work.<br/>
I am glad that this case eventually had a happy outcome, but lessons may be learnt from the history of Mr. Penney's illness and what he went through. I shall take careful note of the remarks of the hon. Gentleman, and particularly what he said about the slow progress of the case. While I can make no promises tonight, I can assure him that we shall look into it and see what might be done in the future.<br/>
I thank the hon. Gentleman for bringing the matter to the notice of the House. It is a valuable contribution to advancing knowledge about this most difficult disease to diagnose.</p>
