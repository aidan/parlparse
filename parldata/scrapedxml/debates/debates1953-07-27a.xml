<p>As soon as possible after the recent change of Government in Hungary, Her Majesty's Charg&#x00E9; d'Affaires at Budapest was instructed to raise the case of Mr. Sanders with the new Minister for Foreign Affairs.

<p>As the right hon. and learned Gentleman now knows that his hon. Friend misled the House on 17th June in seeking to whitewash the American companies and to criticise the B.B.C., would not it be more handsome if he was candidly to withdraw the previous statement?</p>

<p>But does the right hon. and learned Gentleman deny that his hon. Friend has in fact, admitted, whatever the Ambassador said, that the statement made in the House on 17th June was incorrect and unfair to the B.B.C.?</p>

<p>I do not think that that is the position at all. Dealing with the wider aspects of the case, the fact is that the Ambassador said that the treatment of the Coronation in the United States was a most profound manifestation of sympathy and good will towards Britain, and we had much better leave it at that.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1953-07-27a.862.2" speakerid="unknown" speakername="Mr. Morrison" colnum="862" time="">
<p>Will the right hon. and learned Gentleman say whether they compared notes with the B.B.C. in the light of the statement of the Ambassador? Has he not seen the reports in reputable American newspapers, such as the "New York Times" and the "New York Herald-Tribune," which were critical of the way in which a number of American networks handled the Coronation? Is it fair that the Under-Secretary should have condemned the British Broadcasting Corporation when there is heaps of evidence the other way? Why does not the Government be really impartial and fair when dealing with the B.B.C? Ought not the Minister of State to impress upon the Ambassador in Washington, or upon the Embassy in Washington, that it is very important that they should give fair and impartial reports?</p>

<p>The suggestion that the Ambassador in Washington does not give fair and impartial reports is hardly worthy of the right hon. Gentleman. My hon. Friend, in his statement, admitted that there had been one or two isolated instances that might be regarded as lapses of taste. So far as representations to the B.B.C. are concerned, the right hon. Gentleman himself on the last occasion said that the Government should be very careful how they made such representations.</p>

<p>I appreciate that the right hon. and learned Gentleman wants to do his best to preserve Anglo-American relations, but should not the truth have precedence in this matter? The Under-Secretary said that there had been one or two isolated instances, yet the very reputable "New York Times" and other reporters made the categorical statement


that they were callously repeated throughout the day in the interjection of "commercials."</p>

<p>I do not accept that for a moment. I think that the episode has to be taken as a whole, and the view of Her Majesty's Ambassador is one which appears to be justified by the evidence. Taking the thing as a whole, I think it was very well treated.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1953-07-27a.863.1" speakerid="unknown" speakername="Mr. Morrison" colnum="863" time="">

<p>As I stated on 24th June, proceedings in this case are being conducted in accordance with United States law and judicial processes.<br/>
I am advised that the disabilities to which the hon.

<p>The recent statements by the President and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Government of the Republic of Korea on their attitude to a truce have been published already in the Press, and no useful purpose would be served by repeating them in the form of a White Paper or in HANSARD. The question of the publication of communications which have passed between the South Korean and United States Governments is one for those Governments to decide.<br/>
Her Majesty's Government hope that the South Korean Government will abide by the assurances which they have given that they will respect an armistice. If these hopes were, unhappily, to prove false, the steps which would be necessary to restore the situation would depend so much on the circumstances at the time that it would not be profitable to hazard any forecast of them in advance.</p>

<p>No representations have been received. The report adds little to the allegations already made public during the Committee's hearings and dealt with in the answer given by my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary on 17th June.<br/>
The important facts are that, whereas Her Majesty's Government welcome the development of trade with China in non-strategic goods&#x2014;and there must be ships to carry these goods&#x2014;they have taken energetic measures to prevent strategic goods reaching China, either from the United Kingdom or Colonies or in our ships.<br/>
Her Majesty's Government are, of course, only responsible for United Kingdom and colonial flag ships. They do, however, deny bunkering facilities to ships of other nations carrying strategic goods, and co-operate vigorously with other

friendly countries to prevent the circumvention of the controls recommended by the United Nations.</p>

The talks were purely exploratory. They ranged over the whole field of economic and financial questions of mutual interest. We were not negotiating or aiming at specific results. M.

<p>I have another point of order, Mr. Speaker. May I have your guidance about this? Just now the Lord Privy Seal said that the Marquess of Salisbury would be answering for himself in another place. I think that that was the gist of his remarks. During the debate on foreign affairs the other day, the Chancellor of the Exchequer said the same thing in reply to a question by me when I think you yourself were in the Chair. The problem which arises is this. This is the House of Commons, and two Ministers of the Crown have said on two different occasions that somebody will be answering in another place for himself. Is there no Minister in this House who is responsible on these issues and who is prepared to give an answer?<br/>
Two right hon. Gentlemen on the Front Bench opposite have said that somebody else in another place is to

answer. This raises a very serious constitutional principle, and I submit that you, Sir, as the Speaker of the House of Commons, have the duty to see that the rights and privileges of hon. Members in this House are safeguarded. I am seeking to safeguard the interests of all hon. Members in this House, and I would very much like your Ruling on this point because it raises widespread constitutional issues which are involved as a result of the acting Foreign Secretary being in another place.</p>

<p>In so far as that is a point of order, the position seems to me to be this. Ministers do answer for Government policy on matters of this character, but where the conduct of a Minister is particularly attacked and that Minister happens to be in another place there seems to me to be no impropriety whatsoever in him giving an explanation in his own House. It would certainly be quite wrong for him to give it here.</p>

<p>With your permission Mr. Speaker, and with that of the House, I will now make a statement, in reply to Questions Nos. 19, 22, 23, 26 and 28, on the conclusion of the Armistice in Korea, which is also being made in another place by my noble Friend the acting Foreign Secretary.<br/>
I am glad to be able to confirm to the House that the Korean Armistice Agreement was signed in the presence of representatives of the United Kingdom, the British Commonwealth and other United Nations countries whose forces are fighting in Korea, at 2 a.m. British Summer Time this morning, at Panmunjom, with provision for a cease-fire 12 hours later.<br/>
After over three years of war including two years of negotiation, the fighting has, according to our latest information, now ceased along the front and the two armies will withdraw from their forward lines to permit the formation of a demilitarised zone in accordance with the terms of the Agreement.<br/>
I know that this news will be received with heartfelt thanks in all quarters of the House. It is not out of place to recall the extent of the United Nations achievement. For the first time since the formation of the United Nations, member States have taken up arms in collective

resistance to aggression, and the joint action has been successful. Anyone who doubts that assertion should remember the military situation in August, 1950, when the total evacuation of Korea by the United Nations forces seemed to be inevitable. Since that time the forces of aggression have been driven back beyond the line from which they started.<br/>
These results would not have been possible but for the courageous decision of President Truman and the late United States Administration in June, 1950; and it is also right to remember that immediate support was pledged by the late Government of this country sustained by all parties, by members of the Commonwealth and by other member Governments of the United Nations.<br/>
The fighting has, unfortunately, been accompanied by heavy casualties. The United States have borne with great fortitude the main burden among the members of the United Nations. We pay our heartfelt tribute to their fighting men and to their military leaders. The contribution of this country and of the Commonwealth, although less extensive, has also been one in which we can take pride. All three fighting Services have distinguished themselves. There have been renowned exploits like the heroic fight of the Gloucestershire Regiment, at the Imjin River, to which the world has paid warm tribute. There also has been a notable example, in the Commonwealth Division, of co-operation between the countries of the Commonwealth.<br/>
Tomorrow is the second anniversary of the formation of that Division. Today, we think of those who have given their lives and renew our sympathy with their relatives. We remember the sick and the wounded and also our prisoners of war, most of whom have been so long in captivity, and we rejoice with them and their families that they can now look forward to early release.<br/>
The people of Korea have suffered the most of all. Their land has been devastated: but the soldiers of the Republic of Korea have fought bravely side by side with our own, and the civil population has not flinched in adversity.<br/>
There is one other body of people to which I should like to pay tribute on the signing of the Armistice. I refer to


General Harrison and his team of negotiators. Often criticised, with his difficulties frequently not understood, General Harrison has patiently and resolutely persevered in his task of reaching an agreement. As I have told the House on a previous occasion, I had the opportunity of long discussions with him last year, when in Korea with the Minister of Defence, and I was greatly impressed by his earnestness and his broad common sense. I think that General Mark Clark and he deserve our thanks and our congratulations upon this result.<br/>
And now for the future. We know that there have been misgivings in South Korea about the future. We believe that this Armistice was essential for the well-being of the whole Korean people. The fighting, whilst it continued, was an absolute bar to any improvement in the general situation in the Far East. We are not yet, of course, through our difficulties, but now that the fighting has ceased we can once more look forward with hope, and we shall enter on the next stages of the meeting of the General Assembly and of the forthcoming political conference with determination that a solution shall be found to the Korean problem which will lead to the peaceful unification of Korea.<br/>
We cannot tell how long we shall have to keep our forces in Korea. Today our main feeling, I think, in all quarters of the House, is one of determination that this Armistice should form a turning point for the better in the Far East. In any case, we shall do our duty by the world causes of which we are the servants.</p>

<p>I beg to move,
<q>That an humble Address be presented to Her Majesty praying that the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland (Constitution) Order in Council, 1953, be made in the terms of the Draft laid before this House on 14th July.</q>
I am afraid my first duty this afternoon is to go through a number of items in the Order in Council, particularly from a legal standpoint, and I am afraid that I must ask hon. Members to follow me through one or two rather technical points. I shall conclude by making some remarks which I hope the House will not think out of place about the lines on which we shall try to promote partnership after Federation has become a fact.<br/>
The document is divided into two parts. The first part, which is the Order in Council proper, consists of 15 sections containing all those measures necessary to set up the Federation and to enable it to begin its work in the interim period. The Annex to the Order in Council consists of 99 Articles and two Schedules and contains the permanent provisions of the Constitution, under which it will continue to work after the interim period has passed. The tables at the end of the document, pages 55 and 56, show, paragraph by paragraph, how each of the provisions of the Federal Scheme has been translated into the constitutional instrument.<br/>
I think I should point out here that in paragraph 42 (2) the Federal Scheme lays down that the Governor-General will be required to reserve certain types of Bill by the Royal Instructions which he will receive. This provision is therefore omitted from the Constitution. I am advised that it would not be possible or constitutionally correct to present to the House a copy of the Royal Instructions since these cannot be made by the Queen until after the Order in Council has been made, but the House can be assured that these provisions will be inserted.<br/>
May I turn now to the more general features of the Statutory Instrument? By comparing the scheme with the document, hon. Members will see, I hope, that

we have fully carried out our promise that the Statutory Instrument would faithfully reflect the Federal Scheme, but I think the House will expect from me some general explanation of how the four main points on which the Africans require reassuring, and upon which undertakings, were given in the final communiqu&#x00E9; of the Victoria Falls Conference, have been met. In this, as in most constitutional instruments, I believe, the documents specify expressly the things which the Federation can do, without enunciating a list of the things which it cannot do.<br/>
The Constitution is framed and constructed so as to preclude the Federation from dealing with matters outside the field specifically allocated to it in the Constitution, and I hope the House will agree that it is the only sensible way of proceeding. It has been proved by experience to be the best way of dealing with these matters. We lay down exactly what the Federal Government can do, we then have the Concurrent List where, if the Territorial legislation should conflict with the Federal legislation, then the Federal legislation governs; and everything else in the field of government not contained in the Federal or the Concurrent List is automatically and solely in the field of the Territorial Governments.<br/>
I hope the House will agree that it would be clearly unwise to attempt to define all the things which the Territorial Governments could do and all the things which, by the nature of the Constitution, the Federal Government cannot do. That would, of course, require a list of all the existing and potential government functions which fall within the ambit of the Territorial Governments and I think it would be beyond the wit of man, and even beyond the wit of those supermen, the Parliamentary draftsmen, to ensure that every government function and every possible activity had been laid down by attempting to define all the things that Territorial Governments could do. Inevitably some would be left out, and that would be embarrassing. The plan is to circumscribe the functions of the Federal Government and of the Concurrent List, and all other government functions which remain undefined are solely within the power of the Territorial Governments.<br/>
I think it appropriate that I should deal in particular with the four main subjects which the right hon. Gentleman the


Member for Llanelly (Mr. J. Griffiths) has referred to in our debates sometimes as the "four fears." I hope we have already done something to make the word "fear" too harsh an expression. I prefer to say that they are matters upon which the Africans are entitled to reassurance. First, of course, is that the Protectorate status of the two Northern Territories should be preserved. For the reasons I have already stated, the Constitution does not contain any express provision to the effect that the Federation will not have power to interfere with the Protectorate status of the Northern Territories. That would not be an appropriate or effective way of safeguarding their status.<br/>
The effective way, which we have adopted, is to safeguard the Protectorate status of the Northern Territories by constructing the Federal Constitution in such a way that these Territories remain separate and distinct political entities independent of the Federation within their respective spheres, and continue to be under the responsibility of the Secretary of State for the Colonies and, too, subject to the authority of Her Majesty in Council under the Foreign Jurisdiction Act. This, I can assure the House, the Federal Constitution certainly does. I say in the clearest terms that it will not be competent to interfere with the constitutional position of either of these Territories, or, for that matter, of Southern Rhodesia. So much for the Protectorate status.<br/>
The effective method of preventing amalgamation except in certain circumstances is to secure, as the Federal Constitution does, that Her Majesty's Government and, in certain circumstances, Parliament, have the last word on constitutional amendments. This Government and future Governments will be under an obligation not so to amend it unless they are satisfied that a numerical majority of the people concerned are in favour of it. These intentions are clearly set forth in the Preamble, the fourth paragraph of which makes it quite clear that without a numerical majority of the people amalgamation is ruled out. The effective safeguard, however, is that Her Majesty's Government and Parliament have the last word on constitutional amendments.<br/>
I now turn to the third matter, which is that of political advancement. I cannot repeat often enough what I have said

in this House before, that the Federal Constitution gives the Federal Government no power either to retard or to accelerate the political advancement of Africans in any of the constituent Territories; no power to interfere with the Territorial Governments on this matter. I am thinking particularly, of course, of the two Northern Territories.<br/>
For example, as the House probably knows, we shall be discussing alterations of the Constitution of Northern Rhodesia in September this year&#x2014;in six weeks' time. These discussions will be carried out and decisions reached without its being necessary to obtain any agreement from the Federal Government. Of course, they will be only an interim Government then, but the same will apply when the Constitution is in full vigour. It would clearly be only sensible that their views should be sought, but I assure the House that their concurrence is not necessary for anything we may decide. I give that as an illustration to bring home the point.<br/>
I turn now to the fourth matter, which is, of course, land. This is a matter which must be more directly mentioned. Here, again, we have fulfilled the undertakings about the inviolate character of African land. The Federal Government must have the power to acquire land for public purposes. It would be a farce if the Federal Government could not, for example, acquire a wayleave for a power line or, for that matter, a research station, but this power is to be specifically limited. It can be exercised only subject to the existing Orders in Council and subject to other legislation relating to African land in all the three Territories, and no land so acquired can be used for European settlement.<br/>
Thus the four major measures upon which Africans are apprehensive have been successfully dealt with in the Constitution, and our promises have been fulfilled at every point.<br/>
I was reading a reply which I made in the debate on 24th June to an intervention by the hon. Lady the Member for Flint, East (Mrs. White), and although what I said was technically correct I think it gives a misleading impression, for which I apologise to her. The Preamble is embodied in the Order in Council, but since it has no legal force


it would be misleading to describe it as part of the Constitution. I rather think that was the hon. Lady's point. I think she may have gained the impression from my answer to her question that a more direct constitutional device than that which we have employed was contemplated. I hope she will take it from me that what I said is technically correct and still remains a true description of the effect which has been secured by framing the Constitution as we have.<br/>
I must leave to my hon. and learned Friend the task of answering the questions which I do not cover, because clearly the House would not expect me to go into this in much detail, but there are one or two matters about which, I think, I should try to inform the House in advance of any questions which hon. Members may wish to raise.<br/>
The first concerns Chapter V of the Constitution and the judiciary powers within the Federation. There has recently been some mistaken criticism on the ground that these proposals abolish the right of appeal&#x2014;or, perhaps, I should say the right to ask for appeal&#x2014;to the Privy Council in this country. That is not the position. I may explain in this way. A litigant first has to exhaust his local remedies before coming to the Privy Council. If, after an appeal to the Federal Supreme Court, he is not satisfied, then it will be open to him to ask for leave to appeal to the Privy Council, either as a right under Federal law, or, if the Federal law confers no such right, by special leave of Her Majesty in Council.<br/>
I have one matter to clear up upon the African Affairs Board. It was urged by the Opposition at one stage of our discussions on the enabling Measure that the Board could be restrained by the courts from construing the definition of differentiating measures in a particular way despite the fact that Article 74 of the Constitution provides that if a Bill is, in the opinion of the Board&#x2014;and these are the operative words&#x2014;a differentiating measure, then the machinery for reserving it must come into force.<br/>
I have taken further legal advice upon this matter, and since all that the scheme requires is that the Board should be of the opinion that the measure is differentiating, it would not be open to the

courts to question the opinion; the courts could not lawfully restrain the Board from expressing its particular opinion or declaring any opinion. The reason is that once it has formed its opinion it has an unrestricted right to make its report under Article 74 of the Constitution.<br/>
Before I leave the details, I should draw the attention of the House to the definition of the Federal Legislature's powers over external affairs. They are concerned only with such external relations as may from time to time be entrusted to them by Her Majesty's Government. They are also entrusted with the carrying out of existing treaties, conventions and agreements with other countries or organisations. This power is subject to two limitations. It does not include relations between the United Kingdom and any of the Territories, and under Article 34 it is not competent for the Federal Legislature to make laws to carry out anything in an international agreement that relates to something within the legislative powers of the Territories without first obtaining the consent of the Territory.<br/>
Lastly, upon defence, I may say that the effect of this item will be, speaking broadly, that the Federation will be able to provide for such matters in connection with defence as it can afford to pay for. The item does not, however, give the Federation the power to declare war.<br/>
There is nothing, I think, that I can usefully add upon the Order in Council, but I think that I should say a word about the time-table. If the draft Order in Council is passed today, it is our intention to present the draft Order to Her Majesty at the first Privy Council after the Affirmative Resolution&#x2014;that would probably be about 1st August. At the same time, Ministers would present to Her Majesty a further Order in Council, naming an appointed date for the coming into force of these provisions set out in Section 1 (2) of the Order in Council, and we should also make the necessary arrangements for the appointment of the Governor-General.<br/>
The effect of this would be to bring into force what are called the interim measures necessary for setting up the interim administration, between the passing of the Constitution and the


holding of the Federal elections. The interim administration we should hope to do by September. The further step, which brings the whole Constitution into vigour, will be when the Governor-General appoints, by proclamation, a date for the permanent provisions of the Constitution to come into force. Shortly after this, the First Federal elections will be held, and the Federal Assembly will meet. The approximate date for both these events will be 1st January, 1954.<br/>
I apologise to the House for having taken them along some of the dusty parts of the highway, but it is a highway which, I believe, leads to a noble goal. All these safeguards and checks in this as in every other Constitution preserve to Africans and to the Europeans who live beside them in these Territories, first of all the position as it now is, and then the hope of great advancement. It goes further, because in one stroke of the pen it gives greatly increased African representation at the centre in the Federal Legislature by giving Africans or those elected to represent them a quarter of the Legislature. They have not got that in any of the three Territories.<br/>
Furthermore&#x2014;I am thinking specially of Africans&#x2014;I must remind Africans, particularly in the Northern Territories, that if they attach so much weight to the word and shield of Her Majesty's Government when they are spoken or wielded today, they have now got many of the unwritten safeguards with which we exercise our power written into the Constitution.<br/>
It has always seemed to me&#x2014;I have said this before&#x2014;that it is paradoxical, although flattering to us, to attach an unbounded confidence in the unwritten word of Her Majesty's Government, because Her Majesty's Government could, after all, if it were the wish of the majority of this House, impose all kinds of conditions upon African life which would differentiate against Africans or be detrimental to them. It is, I say, anomalous to attach such an unbounded confidence in the unwritten good intentions of the British Government, and at the same time attach no confidence whatever to those safeguards and to the exercise of those powers which are inherent in the Government when they have been

written specifically into the Constitution, and when the intentions behind them have been repeatedly enunciated by Her Majesty's Ministers in this House.<br/>
Although this Constitution marks, as I say, a definite advancement for Africans, it cannot by law assure partnership between the races. We cannot by law ensure that there is no racial discrimination. Indeed, the facts of today are that there are not enough Africans fitted for these responsibilities&#x2014;fitted to take more responsibility than they are being asked to take under the Constitution. But I affirm, again, that it would be intolerable if we all thought or if we all worked to leave it at that.<br/>
I state with deep sincerity, as I have stated before, that the first task after the Federation comes into being is, by education, to create first of all leaders for African opinion in sufficient numbers for the Africans to be worthily represented: that is, leaders upon whom Africans will rely and who will be competent to state African views. There is one instrument by which it can be done, by education&#x2014;by primary and secondary education and by higher education in a university.<br/>
Even if that university were exclusively African, it would go a long way towards achieving our first objective, but I see no reason why we should not try to do two things at once; first to create a larger class of Africans with the equivalent of home university degrees, and also to secure that while they are gaining these degrees they will have a multi-racial university, and that the two main races concerned should work closely together during the formative period of their lives. The plans for a multi-racial university, which I announced to the House in the debate on the Third Reading, have been advanced since that date, and notably by the gracious speech which Her Majesty the Queen Mother delivered during her tour in Salisbury.<br/>
I go on from universities and education to the crying need for creating a class of craftsmen and artisans among Africans. Criticism may have been heard in the past that our education has been too much the education of doctors and lawyers. No reflection is intended on any hon. or hon. and learned Member, but perhaps we have a little overdone this.</p>

<p>I think that we have to try, and we are trying, to pay more attention to the education of such people as surveyors, architects, electrical engineers, civil engineers and so forth. The subject of building up an artisan class is a little different from this, but the need for that class is no less urgent. I hope that I am not out of place if I say some of the things which I think we ought to do after the Federation becomes a fact.<br/>
Bound up with this matter there is, of course, the promotion of trade unions and co-operatives. I think that the House knows where Her Majesty's Government stand upon these matters. I think that it is hardly necessary for me to say that, with some experience of industry in this country, I have never departed from the view that it is impossible to build up a healthy economy on any modern lines without a strong trade union movement. I have seen nothing in my industrial experience which has not reaffirmed that view. Wherever we can avoid it, it is most undesirable for a Government or for any other machinery to interfere in the arrangements between the employed and their employers on wages and working conditions.<br/>
But this is, in many of these Territories, still only a goal. In many of the Colonial Territories the trade union movement is in its infancy. The leaders are inexperienced and the membership often insufficient to represent the body of the industry. Employers, too, have not yet fully realised their common interest in a good system of collective bargaining and are themselves not organised, but so far as the Government can use its influence now, when the Federation is just coming into force, it will be to promote sound organisations both of workers and employers. It is necessary, too, in some cases to have wages councils and negotiating machinery other than that based on voluntary bargaining if the practical needs of the workers are to be organised. I regard these as interim measures whilst we are advancing towards, I hope, a clearly stated objective.<br/>
Equally, I take the same stand on the subject of co-operative societies. It may

be that some hon. Members who are particularly interested in co-operative societies pitch their hopes of them too high. If they do, I think this is a very constructive fault, and in my experience progress has been advanced quicker by optimism, or, if I may say so, by wishful thinking, than by pessimism and by thoughts that see only the dangers and never the benefits.<br/>
I think it is quite clear that in many of these countries, and in the three of which we are thinking particularly, capital formation and the command of working capital will be slower than the opportunities open to capital. I am thinking particularly of capital formation among Africans. Just as the joint stock company in the early days of our industrial history replaced the family craftsman and the individual workman, and thereby brought the small and, at that date, ineffective saving of the people into a mobilised force of capital, so we may expect that the co-operative movement can perform a great service in bridging the gap between the savings of the peasant cultivator or proprietor and his needs at a time when he cannot, from his own funds, provide the necessary capital for the improvement of his land and for sowing, growing and harvesting his crops, either by hand tools or, at a later stage, by mechanical means. Nor should the position of co-operative societies in distribution be neglected and our thoughts be turned only to producer societies. In distribution, both in grading and marketing, and above all in efficient bulk selling, the peasant-producer will gain by having co-operative societies.<br/>
I am merely touching on these matters because I believe they are the ones which, when the Federation comes into being, will particularly engage our attention. I do not want to continue too long on the subject, nor to labour the point; I wish only to indicate a number of directions in which our idea of partnership can be fostered once the Federation is formed.<br/>
That leads me to say, in conclusion, a word about racial discrimination. There is no law which can be passed which can compel harmony in racial relations. There are many things that can be done, and have been done, in this instrument to secure in the constitutional and legal field that this discrimination will not form part either of government or of the law, but


they cannot regulate personal relations&#x2014;if I may use the term&#x2014;between one race and another, nor between one person and another. Nor has the Mother of Parliaments in many centuries of experience yet been able to frame a law which will ensure that a man and his wife live in amity and affection all the days of their life.<br/>
But we are here dealing with a practical dilemma which cannot be eliminated by emotion, however much we may admire and, indeed, share the emotion. The first horn of the dilemma is this. Once imagine that the r&#x00F4;le of the European is to remain permanently dominant&#x2014;for example, suppressing in advance any African representation&#x2014;then one of the first principles of democracy, government by consent, would at least be eroded and might be destroyed. On the other hand, the other horn of the dilemma is that if Africans are now to have the representation in the Legislature and in the Executive to which, under a modern system of democracy and franchise and in a fully literate society, their numbers can be shown to entitle them, then European influence would be destroyed, and the progress which has been so marked during the last 50 years would be arrested.<br/>
It is not only the flow of capital into these countries of which I am thinking. I am also thinking of the intrusion and expansion of our ideas of law and order, of the equality of all before the law; it is the banishment of superstition and witchcraft and its replacement by what the Bible calls charity, greater than faith and hope. Swamp the European minority at this time, and we shall sweep away the bridge across which alone can pass the ideas of our modern civilisation into that Continent.<br/>
I say again that there is nothing in our record which should lead any hon. Member to suppose that, in the exercise of these powers and of these functions in this Federation, the humanity and experience of the British race, which has written democratic institutions into the pages of history will suddenly be thrown aside in Central Africa. Look at the free institutions of the world; one finds that they often derive from the example and practice of this country and of this House. The race that invented Magna Carta and enshrined Parliamentary institutions after the Revolution of 1689 is not one which

is likely to reverse the trend which it has imparted all over the world. Surely we are not now trying to form governments, institutions and laws upon systems which have always been repugnant to our ideas.<br/>
There are other reasons, and we must acknowledge them&#x2014;perhaps we must sometimes deplore them&#x2014;for certain discrimination between the races, because the races are very different. The more backward have to be protected. Nor can we expect that those whose civilisation is age-long will readily accord a spontaneous equality to those who are beginning to learn some of the first lessons of an ordered and civilised society. Only harm is done by pitching our aspirations for no discrimination between the races too high at the present moment or by suggesting that there is some magic formula by which one of the great problems of these countries can be solved in the twinkling of an eye.<br/>
But if the present discrimination, which, as I say, may in some respects be inevitable, is believed to be an integral part of European thought regarding the Africans, then the chances of building a multi-racial society will indeed be small, and the essay upon which we are now starting to build such a society will fall in ruins about our heads and about the heads of those whom we are trying to lead towards democratic institutions.<br/>
But I have faith that the spirit which has animated our race in the past will continue to animate it in the Federation. I believe that today marks a milestone in African history. It marks the moment when we have a chance of building these countries up into political maturity, into economic prosperity and into human tolerance, and of founding a society which respects and cherishes men of any race who can play their part in the march of human progress.</p>

<p>From the very outset of our debates upon the proposal for Central African Federation my right hon. Friends and I have indicated to the House that we recognise very fully the economic advantages which could flow from the closer association of the Governments and peoples of the three Territories, but we have also from the outset insisted that, if those advantages were to be ensured now and in the future in Central Africa, any scheme should be


able to meet three tests. The three tests have been the theme of many of the speeches that we have made from these benches in the course of our long debates.<br/>
First, we have laid down that, at the present stage of African development in the three Territories, any scheme of Central African Federation must contain safeguards which are adequate to the purpose of protecting their interests.<br/>
Secondly, we have also indicated, not only in this case but also in the case of other multi-racial societies, that until such time as conditions are established in which we can be reasonably certain that the Territory will develop into a multiracial democracy, it is essential that any scheme for federation or any contitutional provision in connection with a multiracial society should leave sufficient power in the hands of Her Majesty's Government to ensure that it develops in the way we desire. In the context of Central Africa, we have laid down that it is essential not only that the Protectorate status of the two northern territories should be enshrined in the Constitution but also that there should be provided in the Constitution adequate power for Her Majesty's Government to continue to fulfil its responsibilities as a protecting Power.<br/>
Thirdly, we have laid down that within the Federal structure and the provisions of the Constitution there should be an opportunity for the Africans to advance economically, socially and politically towards full equality with the other races which inhabit those Territories.<br/>
Those are the three tests which we have applied, and because we were convinced that the scheme put forward by the Government and agreed to between them and the Central African Governments failed to meet these three tests adequately, at varying stages we registered our protest in the Division Lobby against the scheme. That scheme is now embodied in the Order in Council, and the Secretary of State for the Colonies has moved a Motion asking the House to approve that Order in Council.<br/>
That draft Order contains in substance and in essence&#x2014;I reserve for the moment the right to ask questions about the details&#x2014;the scheme that we have already discussed in the House. We took the

opportunity of discussing it fully during our debates on the enabling Bill, and because the scheme embodied in the Order in Council is in substance the scheme which we found unsatisfactory for the reasons I have given, we feel that we must continue our protest against it in the Division Lobby tonight.<br/>
Before referring to some of the things that the Secretary of State said, I want to deal with some changes in the text of the Order in Council which cause it to differ from what appeared in the Federal Scheme. I want to mention one or two such changes, and no doubt some of my hon. Friends will want to mention others. So if I refer only to one or two, it is not to be assumed that they are necessarily all. I hope that the Under-Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations will make a note of the points I am going to raise, and will deal with them when he replies.<br/>
The first of these is contained in Article 14 (2, (<i>d</i>)), of the Constitution. The last words of this Article are as follows:
<q>&#x2026; or has within the said five years been awarded, such a sentence of imprisonment the execution of which has been suspended. &#x2026;</q>
It seems to us that those words have been added to the Order in Council and were not in the Federal Scheme. I have searched for them in the time at my disposal and have not found them. Perhaps we could have an explanation of that.<br/>
The second change is the provision that was in the Federal Scheme, page 20 paragraph 28 (4). This has relevance to the specially appointed European members who are to sit in the Federal Legislature with special responsibilities for African interests. In that paragraph we find these words included:
<q>Such a member will be appointed for the duration of a parliament, that is to say he will (like a Specially Elected Member) vacate his seat upon a dissolution of the Federal Assembly; and his seat will also become vacant in such other circumstances as would cause the seat of a Specially Elected Member to become vacant.</q>
The point I want to put to the Under-Secretary is that in the Federal Scheme there was provision for the specially appointed member to be appointed for the duration of the Parliament. That seems to be absent from the Order in Council, and I should like to ask why:<br/>
The provision in the Federal Scheme that the specially elected member was


appointed for the duration of a Parliament gave him a sense of security of tenure which would enable him effectively to discharge his responsibilities towards the Africans and to protect their interests, for which purpose he is specially appointed to the Legislature. If that drops out, are we to understand&#x2014;this is rather an important point&#x2014;that the specially elected European member who represents African interests is to sit in the Legislature at the discretion of the Governor without any security of tenure at all, and can be dismissed or pushed out at any time?</p>

<p>I appreciate that the words have been left out, but if the right hon. Gentleman will look at Article 15 of the Order in Council, he will see that
<q>The specially elected European member &#x2026; shall vacate his seat in the Federal Assembly on a dissolution of the Assembly.</q>
That is the same thing as his being appointed for the duration of the Parliament, as stated in paragraph 28 (4) of the Federal Scheme. The actual words are:
<q>Such a member will be appointed for the duration of a parliament, that is to say he will &#x2026; vacate his seat upon a dissolution of the Federal Assembly.</q></p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1953-07-27a.913.3" hansard_membership_id="5227" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/32551" speakername="Mr. Griffiths" colnum="913" time="">
<p>The paragraph to which the hon. and learned Gentleman has called attention indicates the circumstances in which a specially elected member shall vacate his seat. It clearly lays down dissolution as one of those conditions, but that is not the point that I was making because it is obvious that every member of the Legislature vacates his seat at a dissolution. I repeat my question. In the Federal Scheme a specially elected member was to be appointed for the duration of the Parliament; why has that been dropped out of the Order in Council? Perhaps the hon. and learned Gentleman will look at that.<br/>
The only other point to which I should like to call attention&#x2014;reserving for my hon. and right hon. Friends the right to put other points on this matter&#x2014;arises on

Article 29 of the Order in Council. I will read the part in question, and then I will put my query. I am referring to paragraph (6) of that Article, which reads:
<q>For the avoidance of doubt it is hereby declared that, subject to paragraph (3) of article eighty and paragraph (2) of article eighty-two of this Constitution, a law of the Federal Legislature may make provision for part only of the Federation or may make different provision for different parts of the Federation.</q>
I should like to be told what law was envisaged that would apply to one part of the Federal Territory and not to the other, and would apply in different ways to different parts of the Territories that are brought together in this Federation. It may be that a provision of this kind is desirable and I am sure that in the framing of this Constitution there was some law in mind. What kind of provision was thought to be necessary?<br/>
We did our best in the Committee stage of the enabling Bill to try to embody in it some Amendments to improve the scheme from our standpoint and, in particular, to strengthen the safeguards for Africans. All our Amendments were rejected. The invariable answer given by Ministers speaking from the Box opposite, even when we put forward Amendments which were within the terms of the scheme embodied in the White Paper, was that the Government could not accept those Amendments, even though they were desirable, even though on merit the Government would not be against them, because the Federal Scheme was the result of negotiations with the three Governments in Central Africa.<br/>
Have there been negotiations since then? Have the Central African Governments been consulted about these changes? The hon. and learned Gentleman says they are minor changes, but if it has been possible, since the days not so long ago when we had discussions in the Committee stage, to get into touch with the Governments in the Central African Territories and agree upon changes of words&#x2014;in our view changes of some material importance&#x2014;and embody them in the Order in Council, then the Government might have taken an opportunity of consulting them about some of the Amendments which we put forward and which would help the scheme considerably.<br/>
At this stage I shall not discuss the Constitution in detail, but will say a few general words, since this is perhaps the last opportunity we shall have to discuss this matter. In the Second Reading debate my right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition used words which have been quoted here and, indeed, misquoted in other places. He said:
<q>&#x2026; if this becomes the law of the land it is the duty of all of us to try to make it work to the best of our ability. &#x2026;</q>
That is the statement of a democrat and one which we accept, but I urge the House to consider what my right hon. Friend said immediately afterwards. He made this appeal to the right hon. Gentleman:
<q>&#x2026; even at this eleventh hour I urge that it is worthwhile delaying so that we may get some tangible proof of a new relationship which will bring the Africans into harmony with the scheme."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 6th May, 1953; Vol. 515, c. 427.]</q>
We made that plea several times in the course of the debates upon this matter and it was rejected by the Government both in debate and in the Division Lobby.<br/>
None of us can doubt, however, that the other need for which my right hon. Friend pleaded and which he urged in that debate still remains, namely, the need for a tangible proof that there will be a new relationship in Central Africa. I think it will be common ground between us all that it is upon the creation and the development of such a new relationship that this scheme offers any prospect of developing towards the eventual multi-racial democracy which is the declared policy of this country in its Colonial Territories. This afternoon, therefore, I want to suggest some further tangible proof which can be brought into being in the months between now and September when the first Appointed Day will be fixed, and also between now and 4th January of next year when the scheme will come into full operation if this House approves the Order in Council by approving the Motion this afternoon.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman the Secretary of State has referred to two of these tangible proofs. The first, which we welcome wholeheartedly, is the decision to establish a multi-racial university in Central Africa. We welcomed it when

the announcement was made, we welcome it now, and we hope that every step will be taken to bring it into being at the earliest moment. Secondly, we welcome the initiative taken by one of the companies in the copper belt to open discussions with the European Mineworkers Union with a view to seeking their agreement to remove some of the racial discrimination which now exists and which is embodied in an agreement between the union and the company.</p>

<p>I am sorry, one group of companies. I have noticed in the Press with interest and appreciation that one meeting has already taken place, that it has been adjourned for a week, and will then be resumed. I hope it will succeed.<br/>
If we are to build modern democratic communities in Africa and Asia, the creation of an artisan class is essential. Artisans represent the middle of a modern democratic community and without them it cannot be built. At present in the copper belt, and in other industries in Central and East Africa, one of the obstacles to the creation of an artisan class amongst Africans and to their advancement is racial discrimination. After all, becoming an artisan is part of industrial advancement, and if they are to play their full part it is essential that all the barriers now standing in the way of their technical progress and industrial advancement should be removed.<br/>
I appreciate that this is not an easy job. We have here, as in so many aspects of life in Africa, what I described at a conference last week as a curtain of fear; that is to say, the white worker is afraid that his standards and his privileges will be overwhelmed if the African advances, and the African becomes resentful because there is withheld from him the opportunity of advancing in accordance with his ability. I agree with the Secretary of State that, if it can be done by agreement between the two unions concerned and the firms in question, so much the better. The matter has been under discussion for a long time now and efforts have been made, in Northern Rhodesia in particular, by my predecessors and myself to bring the


sides together in order to reach a voluntary agreement. Unless we can get that now, I do not think we can go on much longer allowing this kind of agreement to prevent the development of Africans, upon which the success of everything we are trying to do in Africa depends. However, we welcome the steps that have been taken so far.<br/>
Now I come to make one or two other suggestions, and I make two in particular: to the Federal Government when it comes into operation, and to its leaders now before it comes into operation. The first suggestion is that they should now make a firm declaration that when the scheme comes into operation, the African Affairs Board will be used to the full to safeguard African interests. Inadequate as we think are the powers of the African Affairs Board in the present scheme, weak as we think its composition is as compared with the original scheme, it is the centre of this Constitution and it still remains the one instrument by which Africans can be ensured that their interests are protected.<br/>
The Secretary of State knows that if we are to have this new relationship, it is essential to have a firm declaration from the leaders in Central Africa that when the Federation comes into existence, they will make the fullest use, not only in the letter but in the spirit, of the African Affairs Board, and are determined to see that its powers are used to the maximum in order to safeguard African interests.<br/>
One of the factors that has added to African fears in the past few months, whilst we have been discussing here and whilst they have been discussing this Federal Scheme out in Central Africa has been the statements that have been made seeking to denigrate the African Affairs Board and seeking to undermine it and to say that it does not mean very much. It means, and will mean, everything to the Africans. I hope that we get a firm declaration of the intention to use the Board's powers to the maximum, for that is important and essential.<br/>
My second suggestion concerns the time when they come to discuss the franchise. The Secretary of State ventured a definition of partnership in an earlier debate and said that he would regard partnership as being established in Central Africa when a European would be elected in a constituency in which the

majority of voters were Africans and an African would be elected in a constituency in which the majority of electors were Europeans and whites. We are very far indeed from that state of affairs yet in Central Africa.<br/>
When the Federal Legislature meets, one of its earliest tasks will be that of considering and of formulating the Federal franchise. It may be, perhaps, the first major measures that they will have to consider, and the first major Bill they will have to pass. Here is the opportunity of expressing partnership in something bigger than words, in a franchise. Here is the opportunity of providing, right at the very beginning, a franchise that will contain within itself, not only the hope, but the certainty, that in due time there will develop in Central Africa a real, effective partnership. I express the hope that upon those two matters, in particular, the leaders in Central Africa will give firm declarations, for I believe that those firm declarations would do much to allay the anxiety and the fears of the Africans, which are still widespread and still very deep.<br/>
Finally, I wish to say a few words about what can be done in the ensuing six months by the Secretary of State, by Her Majesty's Government and by this Parliament in regard to the Protectorate status of Nyasaland and Northern Rhodesia. I urge one or two things upon the Secretary of State. First, I notice that in the Order in Council there are set out in very specific terms guarantees for the Paramount Chief and people of Barotseland. Those provisions are made in an Order in Council because one of the forebears of the Paramount Chief made an agreement with the British Sovereign and Government at the time. That agreement is preserved and protected in specific terms within this Order in Council.<br/>
I ask the House to consider this. We do this for the Paramount Chief and we do it for his country, his Protectorate, specifically and specially. But the Paramount Chief of Barotseland is not the only one who has agreements with Her Majesty's Government: there are others, too. The Secretary of State, the House and the country know perfectly well that there is still continuing deep anxiety and deep hostility to this scheme in Nyasaland and that that hostility is based upon the


fear that their Protectorate status will be impaired and that the agreements which their forebears made with the Government here are not adequately protected.<br/>
I ask the Secretary of State whether, even now, at what is nearly the twelfth hour, it is not possible to write into the Constitution some protection for the chiefs and people of Nyasaland equivalent to those that are written into it for the Paramount Chief of Barotseland. In principle, I see no difference whatever. I hope, therefore, that that will be considered.<br/>
We all know perfectly well that in Nyasaland there is still deep anxiety and deep opposition, and that the people are still afraid. The Secretary of State has carried out fully the undertakings given at Victoria Falls and afterwards that the Protectorate status in general terms shall be preserved in the Constitution; but we have gone beyond that in the case of the Paramount Chief of Barotseland. We have done it specially for him. In view of that, and in view of the continuing anxieties in Nyasaland, I hope that consideration will be given to making such a provision in this Order in Council; or if that is impossible&#x2014;and it will be once the House decides this evening&#x2014;I hope that consultations will take place between the Secretary of State, Her Majesty's Government and the Government of Northern Rhodesia to see what other steps and measures can be taken in Nyasaland to give further assurances to the people in Nyasaland. None of us is under any illusion that those further assurances are very necessary bearing in mind the present and continuing anxieties in Nyasaland.<br/>
Now I come to the second point that I ask the Secretary of State to consider. He has told us that in September there are to be discussions between him and the representatives of Northern Rhodesia, in particular representatives of the Africans there, about further political changes in the Constitution of Northern Rhodesia. I fully agree with the Secretary of State that in the circumstances it was desirable that these discussions about future constitutional changes in the Territorial Government in Northern Rhodesia should be held over until after the question of Federation had been settled. Once it is settled, the talks can

begin, and they are due to begin. I gather from what the right hon. Gentleman said, during September. I do not want to prejudge those discussions, but I make an appeal to the Secretary of State.<br/>
This is a further opportunity to give tangible proof of partnership. It has been said from both sides of the House when this matter has been discussed and argued, that in this scheme most of the matters which intimately affect Africans are left within the province of the Territorial Government. If that is true&#x2014;and I appreciate it&#x2014;I urge upon the Secretary of State that it makes it all the more desirable that the relative position of the Africans in the Constitution of Northern Rhodesia should now be improved; that they should have added representation in the Executive Council and in the Legislative Council.<br/>
This is an opportunity to the European elected members and to the Government in Northern Rhodesia to indicate that within what is left of the powers of the Territorial Government, the Africans will be more fully safeguarded and more fully represented. I hope, therefore, that there will be early consultations with the Africans upon political advancement within the Territorial Government. Now is the opportunity, in the context of Federation, to give them that increased representation upon the Executive Council and upon the Legislative Council.<br/>
Another point I would urge is that it is more than a year now since the Governor and the Government of Northern Rhodesia published a statement on partnership. I do not propose now to read the proposals in that official statement, but it is more than a year since it was issued and no really tangible step has been taken to implement a single one of the proposals. While we have been speaking of partnership and this official statement of Government policy has been in existence, not one really tangible step has been taken so far as I am aware. If any step has been taken, I have not heard of it. I urge that the proposals be implemented now and certainly in the next few months.<br/>
If the House approves the Motion today and the scheme comes into operation, that does not end our responsibilities. We shall still have responsibilities


in this House. We shall still have responsibilities for the Federal Government and for the Federal Legislature and I hope that before the end of this debate the Under-Secretary of State will answer this question. Has he sought any advice from the appropriate quarter as to whether, within the terms of this Constitution, it may be permissible to ask Questions in this House about the activities of the Federal Government and the Federal Legislature? Will it be in order to discuss how the Federal Government and Federal Legislature are working from time to time? Will it not still be a Government in respect of which we have not only responsibilities but opportunities of ensuring that those responsibilities are being carried out by Her Majesty's Government?<br/>
In seven to nine years we shall have to review this matter and what the House and the country do then will depend on what happens in the meantime. None of us can look upon the African scene in these days without anxiety. In the next seven years, up to 1960, the fate of Africa will be determined one way or the other. It has been said of Africa that it is the only remaining uncommitted Continent in the world. We want it to take the democratic way. There are others in Africa who want it to take another road.<br/>
The democratic road can lead to one end&#x2014;a society in which all men have equal opportunity and are not only equal before the law, as the Secretary of State said, but equal in all phases of their life, in industry, in society and in their political life. That is the end to which we must work. If Central African Federation develops towards that multi-racial democracy, it can succeed, but if it does not, it will fail.<br/>
We have been asked to exercise an act of faith in the people of Central Africa. It is more than an act of faith. They may very well have the future of Africa in their hands. There is this upsurge of national consciousness in Africa and elsewhere; it is a great dynamic force which, if we seek to keep it back, will sweep us out of the way; but if we make ourselves its allies, it can go along the democratic road. That is the challenge; I hope they may be equal to it.</p>

<p>I hope the House will forgive me for intruding on what has become, for all practical purposes, a family affair limited to a small number of Members. I hope I shall be allowed to follow some of the remarks made by the right hon. Member for Llanelly (Mr. J. Griffiths).<br/>
I hope I do not trespass on the time of the House in doing this, but, first, I should like to pay a small and, perhaps, belated tribute to the former hon. Member for Sunderland, South, the late Mr. Richard Ewart. Although I was of a different political opinion from him, although I differed deeply and fundamentally from him on political grounds and although I only knew him slightly in the course of one General Election campaign, his deep sincerity in his cause and in what he believed to be right was something which would never fail to impress people of all parties. I should like to take this opportunity of paying this tribute to him and recording my appreciation of the work of the late hon. Member for Sunderland, South.<br/>
Hon. Members, I hope, will forgive me for interrupting this debate because on several occasions I have sat listening to hon. Members on both sides of the House who, to my mind, have been going over the same arguments again and again. If one may make the comment from very nearly without this House, it seemed to me that the relative positions of either side of the House were these. We were at an historic moment for Africa&#x2014;the right hon. Member for Llanelly made that quite clear&#x2014;and the attitudes of the two sides of the House were also quite clear. One seemed to be a bold, trusting and confident attitude, confident in the ability of the people living in the Territories concerned to carry out development plans and to increase the responsibilities of the Africans living in those Territories.<br/>
On the other hand, there seemed to have been a frame of mind among hon. Members opposite a timid and controlling frame of mind which pleaded over and over again for delay&#x2014;delay which I believe would be fatal to this great plan which was initiated by right hon. Members opposite and developed by this Government. It seems to me that to call for further delay at a time such as this, at


this time of decision, would be fatal to this great plan and to the future of any development in Africa itself.<br/>
I was greatly saddened by the initial remarks of the right hon. Member, saying that there would, in fact, be a Division on this issue. He has referred to "the curtain of fear" and has referred to African fears about political advancement. I believe that the majority of those fears are quite unwarranted and unfounded. I am quite willing to place my trust in the ability of those who live on the spot to develop partnership. However much we may talk in this House about partnership and about great and noble ideas, it is those who have to live on the spot with the problems who in the end will have to solve the problems.<br/>
I believe very sincerely that now is the time for decision and that to continue opposition to this new Constitution at this moment would do no more to stimulate the political fears of Africans, which are quite unwarranted and unfounded. In debates which have gone before we have heard of a request for gestures, for demonstrations of some tangible proof that this Government and Europeans in Central Africa are moving along and thinking along what probably we would all like to call the right lines. We have heard reference today to the establishment of the inter-racial university. What we have not heard about is the formation of the new Federal Party, which is welcoming within its ranks Europeans and Africans on equal terms. That seems to me the line of advance which is taking place throughout Central Africa today.<br/>
The right hon. Member referred to discussions going on with certain mining companies and the trade unions. We welcome these discussions. They are all part of a developing theme that partnership can be brought into existence not solely by the high and lofty ideals of this House but by those living, working and practising on the spot, who are living with these problems and trying to solve them.<br/>
I should like to follow the remarks of the Colonial Secretary that any development of partnership must in the long run be based on education and, in the next stage, on technical education. These seem to me to be practical lines for advance which can be supported by the House and which are being pursued on

the spot. It seems to me that dividing the House this evening on an issue like this will draw out the political differences which may exist&#x2014;whether they are warranted or not may, I believe, still be open to debate&#x2014;which will perhaps set this new child off to an unfortunate start. I, and, I think, those who are sincerely wanting the right solution in Central Africa, have hoped that support could have come from both sides for this venture and that it could have come in the form of a welcome to the new State which is being created.<br/>
I believe this to be a great new British venture in democratic development and that it will only be a successful start on a future pattern for partnership if we get the support of Members on both sides of the House. I express again my regret that there should be a Division on this issue because it seems to me that that continues a sore which may develop into a running sore. If we can do anything in this debate to reduce differences and make partnership into a reality the debate will be serving a useful purpose. For my part, I welcome the introduction of the new Constitution. I believe that it serves the present needs of European and African in Central Africa, and that through this Constitution partnership can be achieved.</p>

<p>It is a pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Sunderland, South (Mr. P. Williams), and on behalf of us all, to congratulate him on his maiden speech. He won a victory for his party at Sunderland, and I am sure that in this House he will continue to give good service to his party and service to the country too. We on this side of the House were particularly pleased to hear his gracious observations about his predecessor, who was so dear to us all. I hope that we shall on many future occasions see that&#x2014;was it a Celtic?&#x2014;fire I seemed to observe burning? and that he will take part in what he called this family affair. I am sure that all Members of the "family" will be very glad indeed to welcome him He spoke in a forthright manner about this Order and his speech was certainly none the worse for that.<br/>
I wish to make my criticisms of the proposals. I should like first to refer


very briefly to the method which has been adopted in bringing these proposals into operation. They have been made without the concurrence of the people most closely concerned and affected by their operation, namely, the Africans. I can understand that happening in the circumstances. What I completely fail to understand is that when this happened particular care should not have been taken to see that the Committee stage of the Measure in this House was a reality and not a sham.<br/>
These proposals were simply pushed through the Committee stage by majority vote, by the operation of the party machine, and we had not a single Amendment accepted in Committee. I gather that there have since been discussions between the Government and Sir Godfrey Huggins and Sir Roy Welensky&#x2014;I do not know; perhaps we shall hear about them. We should like to know whether the proposals put forward in the Committee stage were discussed with those gentlemen, and, if so, what has been the result of those discussions. If I may return to the definition of "differential measure," does Sir Godfrey Huggins accept the interpretation of that provision which was given by the Under-Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations?<br/>
I pass from procedure to what to my mind are the major criticisms of this scheme. First, and the point has already been mentioned by my right hon. Friend, there is no positive provision in the Federal scheme for the development of the Africans. That has been mentioned and developed in previous debates, and I shall not spend any time over it now.<br/>
Secondly, there is a division here between the central powers and the territorial powers, as there must be in every Federal organisation, but the danger, the peculiarity, of this particular division is that there is allotted to the Federal organisation matters of general interest affecting property and peoples in the various Territories as a whole whereas there are allotted to the Territorial Governments matters of particular concern to the Africans and the Africans only. In other words we have a separation of powers between the Federal and the territorial organisations on lines of racial interest and racial Government. I do not want to exaggerate it unduly but there is a danger there.<br/>
It is a peculiar principle of demarcation to adopt between a Federal and a territorial Government and one which, so far as I know, has never been adopted before in any other federal organisation. If the Federal Government were to fall into the hands of people who were affected by Afrikaner ideas, this might very well play completely into their hands and lead easily to an aparteid form of discrimination, and government.<br/>
The third point, which I have previously mentioned at an earlier stage in our debates, is the extraordinary provision in the Constitution for the police and responsibility for enforcing the Federal laws lying with the Territorial Government. We have the British Government still sovereign in the last resort in respect of the Federation, then at a lower level a Federal organisation set up under the Federal Constitution, and finally the territorial organisations in two of which the British Government are responsible for administration. So we have the British Government as the sovereign authority, and at the bottom the British Government again as a territorial authority in two of the Territories, responsible for enforcing the laws passed by the Federal Legislature. The British Government is under this Constitution underwriting the settlers, with their majority control of the Federation, as against the African population.<br/>
We have seen what has happened in Ireland in the past. There we had the unhappy experience of the British Government underwriting an ascendancy against the native population. I hope we shall not have that experience repeated here. It is a very real danger in the extremely anomalous position which arises from the form of Constitution adopted in Central Africa.<br/>
I wish to come now to the more hopeful aspects of this scheme. In my view it is a misbegotten and a misshapen scheme but from the very deformity and defects in the scheme there may come some good. The defects are so obvious that I trust everybody will administer this scheme with the most tender care. It depends entirely on the way it is to be administered.<br/>
There are two important safeguards in the scheme. First, there is this country's power of veto. The other


is the power to which I have already referred, the power which resides in the Government of this country, as the Government responsible for those two Northern Territories, for the policing and enforcing of laws in those Territories. The very fact that it is, in the last resort, British police, British power, British force, which is responsible for order in the Northern Territories makes it quite impossible for the veto in this Constitution to be regarded as merely a nominal constitutional device which may never be put into operation.<br/>
I am sorry the veto is to be exercised apparently by the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations rather than by the Colonial Secretary. I think that is a mistake. I hope we all realise that because of our responsibility for order in the Northern Territories, because of our responsibility for policing the Northern Territories, we in this House have vital interests in the exercise of the veto where appropriate occasion arises.<br/>
I would reiterate the question asked by my right hon. Friend the Member for Llanelly (Mr. J. Griffiths) about whether there will be opportunities in this House to question the Commonwealth Secretary about the exercise, or the non-exercise, by him of the power of veto which lies in this Constitution and if not, why not? Why should not we in this House call the Commonwealth Secretary to account for the way in which he exercises the power imposed on him under this Constitution? I trust we cannot at this stage be told that that is merely a purely nominal matter and that, of course, he would not exercise it any more than he would exercise it if such power were obtained in the case of a country which had already achieved Dominion Status.<br/>
The positive powers we have handed over to the settlers. We retain only purely negative powers. I think that a great mistake. All the powers of positive initiation and action, of positive responsibility for the development of the African within the Federation Constitution as contrasted with the territories themselves, we have handed over to the white population. What is needed now is an actual practical demonstration by the white population of the fact that they will take seriously the development of the Africans toward responsibility, toward democracy and a

full participation in the democratic Government of the country to which they belong.<br/>
What then should be our future attitude? I would put it briefly in this way. We in this country should do everything possible to encourage and develop the policy of partnership. I welcome the observations made this afternoon by the Colonial Secretary. They seemed to me to be a new departure on his part, and if the settlers administer this scheme in the spirit of the speech he made today it would go a considerable way to allay fears and anxieties about it.<br/>
Not only should we encourage the settlers to take practical steps towards partnership, but also we should encourage the Africans to respond to these steps wherever they are taken. I hope sincerely that we shall have mutual co-operation between settlers and Africans within these Territories. In the last resort&#x2014;I hope it will never arise&#x2014;it is our responsibility, as the Government of this country, as the House of Commons, as the power responsible for the Northern Territories and for enforcing the Federal laws in those Territories, and as the Sovereign Power, to exercise the Veto and every power we have to prevent Central Africa from becoming another South Africa. Let us make no mistake about that, though I hope the occasion will never arise for any such action. Our attitude towards the scheme in the future will, as my right hon. Friend indicated, depend entirely upon the practical steps taken in Africa toward winning the allegiance of the Africans and establishing a true multi-racial community within Central Africa.<br/>
There is one reference I would make to the rather wider issue of policy connected with this Central African development. It is the general attitude which we in this country should adopt towards the development of Dominion Status. As we all know, Dominion Status was based on the Durham Report written some 130 years ago. That report was made as a means of satisfying the cry "no taxation without representation" in a world where communications were bad. It was the only means of reconciling democracy and distance. Nowadays the distance has disappeared, but the problem remains for this country to ensure democracy through-


out the Colonial Empire&#x2014;without necessarily adopting in every single case the solution of the Durham Report.<br/>
In the <i>laissez faire</i> days it was common for constitutional lawyers to talk of the development of the Empire as fruit ripening until the time when the ripe fruit would fall from the tree. What we are here doing, what we have been doing in Central Africa, is not to wait for the ripe fruit to fall from the tree. We have been hacking off the unripe fruit. We have been putting into force this Central African scheme, contrary to the will of the vast majority of the inhabitants in that area&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>

<p>It was dealt with very fully by my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Neepsend (Sir F. Soskice) in his closing speech during the first debate on this issue.<br/>
I am in favour of local government for local affairs, but we have reached the state in communications and the development of our Empire when what is needed is a closer integration of the various parts of the Empire, where the emphasis should shift to integration rather than disintegration. Our problem is to make the Empire as it is democratic without necessarily in every case decentralising. This involves a great deal of deep thinking. Nobody can produce a solution overnight. It requires a slow and practical application.<br/>
I am fully aware of the dangers involved, but I hope that every opportunity will be taken, by the Colonial Office in particular, for closer consultation with the inhabitants of all these Colonies to see, by conferences like one which has taken place within the last 12 months, that we gradually develop the Empire democratically by practical steps without necessarily in every case leading along the Durham Report line of development.<br/>
This is a huge problem. In Central Africa at this stage it was premature to have introduced Federation before the vast majority of the inhabitants wanted it. I sincerely hope that it will succeed. It

will be a disaster for us, for Africa and for the world if it fails. I hope that we do everything possible to make it succeed; but the key to it all lies with the settlers in Central Africa. If they will give practical demonstration of a sincere wish to develop the Africans and to have partnership and friendship with them, I am certain that they will have a response from the Africans and from all sides in this House as well.</p>

<p>I was not sure when the debate started whether we should be entitled to roam rather widely, as we seem to be able to do, on this matter. My hon. Friend the Member for Sunderland, South (Mr. P. Williams) made an excellent maiden speech on this the last day of the debates on Federation, a day which is making a page of history. I had hoped that the Opposition would have taken the line which the leader of the opposition to Federation in Southern Rhodesia took. He opposed it until the end. After the referendum which decided for Federation he gave the scheme his blessing and said that he would endeavour to make it work. I had hoped that the Opposition would have taken the same line. It is a great disservice to Federation that we should have controversy today and a Division at the end of the debate.<br/>
Today we have heard much the same as we have heard on previous occasions. The hon. and learned Member for Leicester, North-East (Sir L. Ungoed-Thomas) more or less attacked the settlers and Sir Godfrey Huggins. We have heard similar attacks on many occasions during the last five or six debates on this question. The hon. and learned Gentleman spoke about the veto which Her Majesty's Government would still have on anything in Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland. I would remind him that the Government of the day have had the right of veto over the Southern Rhodesian Government for the last 30 years, but the steps which that Government have taken have been such that the United Kingdom Government have never felt it necessary to exercise the veto. Why after 30 years of good service it should now be thought that the people of Southern Rhodesia have changed, I fail to see.<br/>
A great deal has been said about partnership. I was sorry to see that "The


Times" took up the question and was critical. Criticism has been made throughout the debates that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for the Colonies has not said what he meant by the term. It is not for us in this House to say what is meant by partnership. The people who have to work the partnership are those in Central Africa. They have proclaimed in no uncertain voice what they mean. But, apart from what they have said, let us look at the history of the matter during the last 60 years. I will deal with Southern Rhodesia because that is the territory which has been attacked more than any other.<br/>
Partnership does not necessarily mean advancement in the political field. Partnership which is most beneficial is partnership in the economic field. I suggest that Southern Rhodesia have done more to further partnership than has been done in any of the Colonial Territories. Criticism has been made of various activities there. We have heard a great deal of criticism about education. I was sorry to see that Miss Margery Perham, in a letter to "The Times," criticised what had been done in the field of education. The position is that there are over 2,000 primary native schools for 200,000 pupils. There are 7,000 teachers and all but 350 are Africans. They are now starting not only a multi-racial university but also an African university. If those are not practical steps towards partnership, I do not know what the word means.<br/>
Let us consider the employment position and the building up of the artisan class which has been advocated. In Southern Rhodesia there are 1,000 more Africans self-employed than there are Europeans. Surely some of them must be artisans. There are some Africans in Southern Rhodesia who earn over &#x00A3;1,000 a year by running their own bus services. I suppose that some of them are also artisans. The police force is largely African. There is a rapidly increasing number of African clerks. A wide range of Government posts are open to Africans in education, health and agriculture. These are practical steps towards partnership.<br/>
The housing situation has also been the subject of criticism. I refer now to something which was seen by the hon.

Member for Wednesbury (Mr. S. N. Evans) and myself&#x2014;I think that he was with us&#x2014;when we went to the township of Umtali. We saw a swarm of Africans building houses for themselves under the supervision of one European. They were completing houses at the rate of one a day. In the last four years they have built houses for 11,000 Africans. They had there a sports field for Africans which would be the envy of many of our provincial towns.<br/>
The Director of Education there said that the citizens were proud of their township; they were law abiding; and crime was practically non-existent. How many towns in England could show the same record? This again is a practical example of working partnership. When speaking of education I forgot to add that what is being done for the African ought to be recognised in this country. The African is not merely taught academic subjects: he is also given technical training. The deputation saw Africans being given technical training in many useful subjects. This also is a case of partnership.<br/>
Then there is the question of health. The hon. Member for Gravesend (Sir R. Acland) mentioned in one of our debates that he had received a letter from the wife of a missionary who had been told by somebody who had been told by someone else of some terrible thing which had been done in a hospital which was unnamed. We visited hospitals when we were over there. What is the position? They have over 10,000 hospital beds, a ratio of one to every 230 Africans. There were 250,000 in-patients and 3,500,000 outpatients treated in 1950. Surely, that is something of which Southern Rhodesia can be proud, and we should not criticise her hospital service.<br/>
I want to mention the common roll. Here, again, I think that the way to get partnership is through the common roll, which has been criticised because it has been said that, as soon as too many Africans qualify for the common roll, the qualification will be raised. That may be so, and I do not think that Sir Godfrey Huggins has disputed the fact, but what he has also said, and what I think he is right in saying, is that he wants to see the day when the common roll is so constituted that white and black on that common roll vote according to policy and not according to colour. That day will come, in due course.<br/>
It cannot be said that Africans on the common roll have no effect on the decision in their elections. There are only a few hundreds of Africans who have taken the trouble to register, although there are several thousands who could qualify to be entered on the common roll. If every African who is qualified to enter the common roll did so and exercised his right of voting, Africans today could bring about a great effect on decisions taken.<br/>
There are only two parties out there, and it is up to the Africans to get their names on the register, and, when the opportunity comes, to vote for that particular party which they think will best further their own interests. If they had taken their opportunities in the past, Africans could have influenced considerably the voting at the last election.<br/>
I know that great play is made about the qualifications, which are laid down for black and white equally. I am not sure that the provision of certain qualifications before the vote can be exercised is not a good one. Even in this country, if we had some slight qualifications, if only to the effect that an elector should be able to write his or her name and could count up to 10, before exercising the right of voting, it would not be a bad idea.<br/>
With regard to opposition from the Africans, I could quote a large number of cases of influential Africans in Southern Rhodesia who are prepared to help to make Federation a success. They have declared their intentions to that effect, and they have welcomed the scheme. I know that isolated people are against it, but there are plenty of Africans in Southern Rhodesia who want to, and who will, make Federation work. I have no doubt myself that, if we leave Central Africa to manage its own affairs, the Africans, black and white, will manage them just as well as, if not better than, we can from a distance of 6,000 miles.<br/>
It has been asked whether we in this country should have the right to put down Questions about the way in which the Central African Federation scheme is functioning. I sincerely hope that my hon. and learned Friend, when he replies to the debate, will say that we shall not have that right. I think that carping criticisms and innuendoes in Questions in this House do a great deal of harm to partnership between black and white in Africa. When our people go out to Africa, they do not change their colour,

and, consequently, they are still as democratic as we are, and it would be a very good thing if we realised that and left them to their own devices. Western civilisation has given Africans the chance of rising from blood-stained chaos, and has helped them along the road from squalor, disease, and cruelty. I hope, that from now on the carping criticisms which we have made in the past will cease.<br/>
I have every confidence in Sir Godfrey Huggins, Sir Roy Welensky and Sir Malcolm Barrow. They are liberal-minded and broad-minded men who realise that there is a great future in Africa for both black and white, but that there will be no future at all for them if they do not both pull together. I therefore hope that tonight the House will give the people of Central Africa the opportunity of carrying on and minding their own business, while we in this country mind ours.</p>

<p>I was glad to hear the Secretary of State for the Colonies recite the list of qualities that exist in Southern Rhodesia. I am very glad to hear it, because there are some on the other side about which I want to say a few words. I am glad to find that there are some virtues, because I am hoping that some of the difficulties and disabilities that exist there may be removed, so that there may be a better chance of Federation becoming a real success.<br/>
First, I should like to ask a question of the Under-Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations. The Colonial Secretary made a statement the full import of which I did not gather, but it was to the effect that any question of amalgamation would be decided by numerical majority of the people. What people? Does that include the Africans?</p>

<p>I am very pleased to hear it, because I listened with a certain amount of pleasure to the right hon. Gentleman's speech today. I think that if he had been as careful about his approach to this question in the past as he has been today, he might have created a better atmosphere both in this House and among the Africans, too. However, I wish to congratulate the right hon. Gentleman on having improved.<br/>
On the question of numerical majority, it appears that the right hon. Gentleman himself does believe in the majority deciding these things, because he said with some pride that amalgamation will not be decided without a numerical majority. Why could he not have decided the question of Federation on the same basis? Why not approach the Africans to see if we can get a majority? The hon. Member for Leominster (Mr. Baldwin) has just said that there are Africans who are ready to take advantage of the opportunity, and who have indicated their willingness to help Federation, and they are Africans who know something about it.<br/>
Why not settle the dispute and avoid a lot of criticism? The right hon. Gentleman could do it if he could obtain a concensus of opinion in the two parties, and decide by a majority, in which the Colonial Secretary believes. I think it was a mistake that he did not do that, and I am sorry, because he might have avoided a lot of the trouble that has cropped up since.<br/>
I now turn to some of the things upon which I should like to comment. I think that if Southern Rhodesia, particularly&#x2014;and this is the nigger in the woodpile&#x2014;eliminated some of the disabilities which Africans suffer, it would make for the success of this scheme. The right hon. Gentleman mentioned the question of trade unions, in which I was interested, but the reference to trade unions which I find in the White Paper says this:
<q>Save as provided in paragraph (2) of this article, the Federal Legislature shall not have power to make laws with respect to&#x2014;
<ol>
<li>(<i>a</i>) trade unions or other like associations; or</li>
<li>(<i>b</i>) the settlement of disputes between employers and employees,"</li>
</ol></q>
They only have power in regard to trade unions in the case of Federal employees. Presumably, the question of trade unions will lie with the Territorial Governments, but this is one of the main causes of complaints against Southern Rhodesia. Let me read what is stated in the White Paper on the Central African Territories (Cmd. 8235), paragraphs 73 and 74:
<q>In both Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland, African trade unions are legally recognised and some successful organisations exist. In Southern Rhodesia, no legal provision exists for the recognition of African trade unions. &#x2026;</q>

<q>The Southern Rhodesia Government considers that African labour has not yet become sufficiently stabilised, and the African himself is not yet sufficiently advanced, to be capable of organising and managing trade unions successfully with a due sense of their proper purpose.</q>
If that is so, then they seem to do it in Northern Rhodesia, and, to some extent in Nyasaland, and in a good many of the other African Territories also. If they can do it in those territories, some of which are no further advanced, particularly with regard to industrialism, than is Southern Rhodesia, why cannot they do it in that Territory? If the Southern Rhodesian Government want to prove that they desire to do everything possible for these people, why do they not remove these causes of friction and irritation among the people there?<br/>
This kind of excuse has always been used against trade unions. It was used in this country. But trade unions have grown up and had shown their usefulness, and today even Ministers on the Front Bench opposite have nothing but praise for them&#x2014;at least on some occasions. I hope that the Southern Rhodesian Government will take heed of what has been said in this House this afternoon and will eliminate the causes for the unrest.<br/>
Then there is the question of the wages paid to African labour in Southern Rhodesia. If an industrial democracy is to be developed in Southern Rhodesia, there will be a dependence on Africans for the necessary labour. If the Government there want to give the African a sense of being well treated, they must not only provide him with work, but they must let him see that he is having a fair deal. I suggest that it is difficult to make any man believe that he is having a fair deal when he is drawing the kind of wage paid in Southern Rhodesia today.<br/>
The average wage paid to a native agricultural worker is 32s. 6d. a month, and I think I am right in saying that in some parts of Africa the working month used to be something like 30 working days. It is quite true that a food allowance is paid in addition, but, even with that, the wages remain miserably low. Hon. Members will remember that only a few weeks ago a huge increase in wages was given in Northern Rhodesia, where the workers have trade union representation and where the trade unions played a big part in getting that increase.<br/>
Is the reason why Southern Rhodesia do not want trade unions because they wish to continue to pay these miserably low wages?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1953-07-27a.937.0" hansard_membership_id="832" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/28746" speakername="Mr. Baldwin" colnum="937" time="">
<p>I am sure that the hon. Gentleman wants to be fair. Is he aware that wage rates in Southern Rhodesia are higher than in any of the three Territories and that there is a big migration of labour from Nyasaland into Southern Rhodesia?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1953-07-27a.937.1" hansard_membership_id="12574" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/19263" speakername="Mr. Paling" colnum="937" time="">
<p>I am aware of that, and, also, that there is no work of this kind for these people in Nyasaland. But Southern Rhodesia is relatively well advanced in this, and if she gave trade unions the right to negotiate wages she might eliminate some of the present trouble.<br/>
I now want to say a word or two about the land question. The Colonial Secretary went to some trouble to say that the land of the Africans was to remain inviolable. I am glad to hear that, but I doubt whether it is enough. In Southern Rhodesia there are some 130,000 white people in about 75,000 square miles, whereas there are millions of Africans living in about 50,000 square miles. The land of the Europeans there has been protected to a very large extent. Listen to this:
<q>As to the European area, the Act states (Section 26 as amended by Section 3 of Act No. 14 of 1945) that</q>
<q>'Subject to the exceptions provided in this Act&#x2014;
<ol>
<li>(<i>a</i>) no native shall acquire, lease or occupy land in the European Area;</li>
<li>(<i>b</i>) no owner or occupier of land in the European Area, or his agent, shall&#x2014;</li>
<ol>
<li>(i) dispose or attempt to dispose of any such land to a native;</li>
<li>(ii) lease any such land to a native;</li>
<li>(iii) permit, suffer or allow any native to occupy any such land"."</li>
</ol></ol></q>
That is protecting the Europeans all right. Is the same measure of protection to be given to the African? Is he, in particular, also to be allowed access to this land in Southern Rhodesia? That is one of the questions that need answering and one of the things to which the Southern Rhodesian Government can attend. If they want to create this multiracial community and to live in peace with the Africans, then I suggest that they should attempt to deal with some of these things now without waiting for Federation to be put into operation.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman this afternoon talked about the university, which is something everybody welcomes, but, again, listen to this:
<q>Restrictions are imposed on Africans in Southern Rhodesia regarding the possession of liquor and they are not admitted to European hotels save by special arrangement. Separate accommodation in trains, buses and taxicabs is provided for them. They mix freely with Europeans in shops, but are not admitted to European cinemas. In the larger centres there are separate entrances and counters for Africans in post offices and banks. Africans are debarred from participating in State lotteries and from betting.</q>
Looking after their morals, I suppose. These are the kind of things that operate in Southern Rhodesia, and if they and the other Territories want to make a success of Federation they should attend to them.<br/>
I was pleased to hear the guarantees read out by the Colonial Secretary this afternoon. Does the right hon. Gentleman remember&#x2014;he probably does&#x2014;a Tory Colonial Secretary stating that In any dispute between Africans and Europeans the interests of the Africans should be paramount. Have they been? Can anybody say that they have been or are paramount today?<br/>
Speaking in the debate on 6th May, the right hon. and learned Member for Montgomery (Mr. C. Davies) said:
<q>What stronger guarantee could we have than was contained in the Order in Council setting up the new State of Southern Rhodesia and giving it self-government? It is a tremendously strong one, but it did not afford protection to the Africans. When we look at the Order in Council of 1923, Clause 28, we And that nothing shall become a law, but that it shall be reserved by the Governor</q>
<q>'whereby natives may be subjected or made liable to any conditions, disabilities or restrictions to which persons of European descent are not also subjected or made liable.' "&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 6th May, 1953; Vol. 515, c. 445.]</q>
How does that read in face of the colour bar? What protection, up to now, have these guarantees been to these people?<br/>
Whenever this business of federation has been discussed, particularly in Southern Rhodesia, some people have shown by their speeches a cynical disregard for all these things. If they want to make a success of this, let them begin now and show some proof that they want to make Federation succeed.</p>

<p>The right hon. Member for Dearne Valley (Mr. Wilfred Paling) has spoken with the sincerity and strength of feeling which we expect from him. If there was as much cause for indignation as his speech suggested, it is rather surprising that the Government of which he was a Member was the first to raise this question of Central African Federation. He touched on the differences of trade union policy between the two Northern Colonies and Southern Rhodesia, and there is some substance in what he said. Let me remind him, however, that although trade unions are not legally recognised in Southern Rhodesia, the trade union on the railways does receive <i>de facto</i> recognition. I think that both sides of the House, and no one outside the House more than Sir Godfrey Huggins, will have savoured his reference to Southern Rhodesia as "the nigger in the woodpile."<br/>
The Order in Council which we are asked to approve brings to an end discussions that have been going on for a generation. Although our debate has been calmer and more formal than previous debates, the decision that we are taking is of the utmost significance to the whole future of the African Continent and perhaps even of the Commonwealth. I do not want this evening to go into a detailed argument, but to consider for a moment what responsibilities we have assumed, and what are the next steps we have to take.<br/>
It is fair to say that in the years between the wars the three Central African Territories were a peaceful portion, I might almost say a passive backwater, of the Commonwealth and Empire. With the war, all that changed. The intensive development of the Copper Belt and the post-war migration of European settlers and European capital, revolutionised the social and economic conditions in the three Territories. At the same time, political developments in the South African Union and in West Africa projected their shadow over European and African alike in Central Africa.<br/>
These developments were producing a situation which would have crystallised sooner or later around some issue or other. They were brought to a head by

the action of the right hon. Member for Llanelly (Mr. J. Griffiths) in raising the question of Central African Federation. Had he not moved in this matter the situation would perhaps have remained dormant a little longer, but not for much longer. The moment he moved, he set in train a process which neither he nor anybody else could have stopped.<br/>
The thing that struck me most when I went out in 1951 on the all-party Parliamentary delegation to Central Africa was that a point had been reached where a decision had to be taken one way or another. If the Governments of the United Kingdom and of Southern Rhodesia decided to go ahead with Central African Federation the project would go through, but if one of those two Governments decided against it, the project would be killed stone dead. The decision was not an easy one to take, as I think hon. Gentlemen opposite who fought this matter out at some length upstairs will agree.<br/>
There were a few of us on this side who thought from the beginning that Central African Federation was right, and a few hon. Members opposite who thought from the beginning that it was wrong; but most of the House approached this question in a mood of uncertainty and inquiry. It was very natural that they should. The economic and social considerations all pointed in favour of Federation, as the right hon. Member for Llanelly said a few moments ago. But the political considerations were more uncertain. Vocal African opinion and a substantial minority of European opinion were against Federation. The experts were divided. There was the great problem whether we, as democrats, should do what the majority of the people on the spot, the inhabitants, wanted, or whether, as trustees, we should do what we thought best for them.<br/>
In face of these perplexities and uncertainties it would have been awfully easy for the Government to have hesitated and to have tried to postpone a decision. To have done so would have been very popular politically, both with the Opposition and certain sections of opinion in the country; but it would have been thoroughly dishonest because it would have meant not the postponement of Federation but its abandonment.<br/>
It is sometimes rather invidious for back benchers to pour praise upon Ministers, particularly at a time when the Press is talking about a Ministerial reshuffle. Nevertheless I would congratulate the Government most heartily on having made up their minds on a very difficult matter, and having stuck to their decision once they made it and seen their decision through. All of us who have any experience of the Colonies will have heard provincial or district commissioners say at one time or another, "If only the Government had a policy." On this matter the Government have had a policy. They have known their own mind and have made their mind known. That is a great deal.<br/>
Central African Federation is, of course, only a beginning. We know the starting point of our journey and we think we know the direction in which we are moving; but whether we shall reach our destination of a great new British Dominion founded on a partnership of all the races no one can say. No one can say because the issue depends not on the contents of this Constitution but on how all the different parties concerned bear themselves in the years to come. We on this side of the House, and hon. Members opposite who have supported the idea of Federation, have put our trust in Sir Godfrey Huggins and Sir Roy Welensky. We believe that they are liberal-minded Englishmen who, had they lived in this country, might well have found their places in this House, on either side. I do not doubt that they will be worthy of our trust; but much will depend upon how far those who come after them will live up to the standards they have set and the principles on which their policies have been founded.<br/>
So far the signs have been encouraging. Reference has been made to the multiracial university and to the action of one of the mining companies in raising the whole question of breaking down the industrial colour bar. I would refer also to the decision of the same company to set up a chair of race relations at one of our great universities to stimulate inquiry into this difficult matter. Here I should like to make a suggestion of a different character.<br/>
One of the first decisions that the Federal Parliament will have to make will be to choose a Federal capital. It

does not seem a very great point, but there is an important symbolism about the location of a capital. I am told that the decision is likely to fall an Salisbury because it is the most developed and, from the European point of view, the healthiest situation. At the risk of being thought fanciful, I should like to press the claims of Livingstone. To call a country "Rhodesia" after Rhodes, and to call its capital "Livingstone" after David Livingstone and situate it by the noblest of African rivers and in sight of the greatest waterfall on earth&#x2014;these are things which might well inspire the imagination of all the people in Central Africa and perhaps of the countries outside it. "Rhodesia, capital Livingstone, by the Victoria Falls," would not be a bad entry for the encyclopaedia.<br/>
A heavy responsibility will fall not only on the Europeans in the Rhodesias but on the African leaders. Whether Federation is, in the long run, to advance or retard African development has been a matter at issue between us, between both sides of the House. Whatever view we take on that matter, there can be no doubt that one of the first results of Federation will be to extend the sphere in which Africans will be politically active, in so far as it creates new posts for Africans to work in politically. I should like to pay my tribute to the very responsible attitude adopted by the African trade unions. I hope that their example will be followed in due course by the African political leaders. They have not followed it yet, but we must not blame them too much. We have to remember the encouragement they have received in their tendency to resist from at any rate some hon. Members on the Opposition side of the House.<br/>
Another body which has a great responsibility is the Church. The Secretary of State for the Colonies, in opening this debate, said very truly that nobody can legislate for every aspect of inter-racial relations. This is something that individuals have to decide for themselves and carry out by moral and personal discipline and self-control and here the Churches might be more active than perhaps they have been in the last.<br/>
The ultimate responsible for this undertaking rests upon us here, upon the Government and the Opposition. For the Government the setting up of the


Federation will present altogether new problems&#x2014;problems of relations with a dependency which will be neither a Crown Colony in the old sense nor yet a Dominion in the accepted sense; a dependency which will need and will benefit from our influence and guidance, but which would bitterly resent our intrusion or our interference. Whatever views any of us may have taken on this controversy, I am sure that the new Governor-General will enter on his mission with the good wishes of all sides of the House.<br/>
May we hope, too, that the Opposition will accept the new situation and do their best to make it work? May we hope that they will show patience and restraint before passing judgment on the first steps of the new Federation? I should like to pay tribute, if it is not embarrassing to them, to those hon. Members opposite who have supported the idea of Federation. It has not been always an easy decision for them to take. It has been unpopular with their own side and, what is even worse from their point of view, popular with our side. But if one day the party opposite again assume office it will have the salutary effect of making it easier for them to start good relations with the new Central African dependency.<br/>
I regret the decision of the Opposition to vote against the Government tonight, but having voted, I hope that whatever their fears for the future, they will at least accept that those here and in Africa who have advocated and devised the Federal Scheme have been inspired by the faith that in Central Africa there should arise a new state, in which men of different races who have made the country their home, shall live and work together in a genuine partnership, founded upon Cecil Rhodes's conception of equal rights for all civilised men.</p>

<p>I do not intend to intervene for more than a few moments. The sole question before us today is whether the House, by affirmative vote, will propose an humble Address to Her Majesty praying that Her Majesty will be pleased, by Order in Council, to bring this scheme for the future Government of Central Africa into being.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman the Secretary of State for the Colonies has fulfilled completely the promise that he undertook to this House from the outset, namely, that he would lay the Federal Scheme before the House for its information and that the matter should be debated by the House. It was debated and then he brought in an enabling Bill which then had to be taken through all its stages. That Bill contained the provision that the scheme could only come into effect on an affirmative Resolution by this House, and that is all that is now before us.<br/>
From the outset, when I first heard of this scheme two years ago, I have protested against this form of Federation. I have voiced my protest in this House and outside on every possible occasion. There is no more that I can say about it. This is now the beginning of a new era for Central Africa, in which there will be involved the fate of six million people. All I wish to add is that I sincerely hope that all my forecasts will be wrong and that the forecasts made by the Government will be right.<br/>
I hope, also, that these people, beginning upon their new career, will succeed in what is expected of them. No words of mine will be used to prevent them from succeeding. All that I can do now is to record for the last time my protest, but I do not utter any word which will make the position more difficult.</p>

<p>I am sure that the House will have listened to the last words of the Leader of the Liberal Party, the right hon. and learned Gentleman the Member for Montgomery (Mr. C. Davies) with relief and satisfaction. The climate in which this new ship of State is to be launched is of immense importance. We have had our debates, they have been prolonged and very searching and I, too, am sorry that my party are going into the Division Lobby tonight. I have been a good soldier all my life, but tonight I shall be a defaulter because I feel very strongly that Central African Federation will provide conditions in which African advancement can be accelerated. In no other way can what we all wish to see, the speedier improvement in the lot of the Africans, be brought about.<br/>
Therefore, although I shall not go into the Division Lobby against my party I shall certainly not go into the Division Lobby with them. [An HON. MEMBERS: "Shame."] The hon. Member for Preston, North (Mr. J. Amery) need not worry about those of us on this side who do not take the party line on this occasion. We belong to the most democratic party in the world. Our views upon this subject have been known for some time, and although I would not go so far as to say that they are welcomed in some quarters I do not think they are severely frowned upon.<br/>
It is very important that we should all realise, especially our friends in Central Africa, that the clock cannot be put back. There has been talk here today about the new artisan class springing up in Central Africa. If Africa is to make progress inevitably there will come into being a new African middle-class, consisting of technicians, managers and administrators. These will provide a new African middle-class and they must be conceded freely and gladly that position in society to which their talents, their energies and their character entitle them. Let us make no mistake about that.<br/>
It would be a grievous error if any of our friends in Central Africa looked upon the passage of this imaginative project through this House as providing them with a hammock in which they can relax for the next two decades. Rather must it be a springboard, because we who have supported the Government on this matter feel just as strongly as any of my hon. Friends about the necessity of this partnership of which there has been so much talk. We all require to make an act of faith at this moment.<br/>
I think, with all respect to my hon. Friend the Member for Dearne Valley (Mr. Wilfred Paling), that the Southern Rhodesians have taken time by the forelock. The no-colour-bar university is a tremendous stride forward. It will be one of the death blows to racial discrimination. I am sure that the question of the trade unions, which my hon. Friend raised with considerable feeling, he being a distinguished ornament of the trade union movement, will be taken care of in the not too distant future.<br/>
We must not forget that there are a certain number of Afrikanders in Southern Rhodesia whom Sir Godfrey Huggins was not able to ignore entirely if Federation

was to be accepted. Then there are the black Africans. I do not like talking about settlers and Europeans. We should talk about black Africans and white Africans. The black Africans must make an act of faith that the promises which have been made in this matter of partnership will be implemented. If I may say so to some of my colleagues, who have been very forthright in their criticisms, an act of faith is due also from them. This is a very bold project. A multi-racial society is the only hope of Central Africa.<br/>
Some of the speeches to which we have listened during the past 12 months have not been very helpful. Their inference has been that the black African has nothing to look forward to and no hope except through the direct intervention of United Kingdom influence. That is a bad thing. It casts a slur on our people, the people who, in Africa, found tribe exterminating tribe, the tyranny of witchcraft and the cruelty of slavery. In a comparatively short time our people have gained the confidence of the Africans by their fair dealing and their character, and they have created a measure of civilisation in Southern Rhodesia and have brought to these Territories a degree of prosperity hitherto unknown. These are the people about whom some very savage things have been said inside and outside this House.<br/>
I hope that whoever winds up the debate for the Opposition tonight will bless this scheme, as indeed the Labour Leader in another place did in very striking and statesmanlike language. I am surprised that his remarks have not been quoted in this debate. Speaking on 14th July the former Labour Lord Chancellor used the word "fervent." He said that there would be nobody more fervent in their good wishes for the success of this Measure than those on his side of the House. He said that great good could come out of the Bill. He hoped and expected that all men of good will would bless the Bill. He himself certainly blessed it. I thought that that was a very courageous and statesmanlike utterance, and I hope it will find its echo on the Labour Front Bench in this House tonight.<br/>
Whether black African suspicions of white Africans' intentions are justifiable


or not will soon be put to the test. I, personally, think that the white Africans will stand up to that test. I do not think there was ever a time when our white African brethren were more in a mood to move towards genuine partnership, and that is very important because there is no doubt that unless the barriers standing in the way of African social and economic advancement are removed the educated African will be a very ready prey to agitators.<br/>
I was very glad to learn of the cordiality with which these opening talks between the representatives of the mine owners and of the white African trade union in the Copper Belt had opened. I have thought, on occasions, that this trade union was a body like my friends at the N.F.U., and that they were in some danger of sacrificing real security for a security that would turn out to be illusory. I believe that the emergence of this African middle-class of which I have spoken is inevitable, and I think that all in Central Africa, including Mr. Dendy Young and our friends in the white trade union, would be wise to face this fact now.<br/>
I am glad that the Government have gone on with this scheme. I am glad not only because I think it will bring about speedier African advancement, but because I think it reveals signs in this country of a renewed grasp of the simple essentials of power. I believe that it marks a turning point in what, for me at any rate, has not been a very happy period. No nation can be great without the capacity for greatness. I believe that in partnership with the Africans&#x2014;using the word in its full sense, and speaking as one who will feel himself betrayed unless steps are taken in the direction of a real partnership&#x2014;we can, as was said by the hon. Member for Preston, North, create in Central Africa a multi-racial society which is an example to the world.</p>

<p>This is certainly not an occasion for anything of the order of a party speech. Indeed I think this debate has been noteworthy in the main for the absence of party contention. I suggest also that neither is it an occasion on which we should be reading lectures to those on

whom we are about to ask Her Majesty to confer this new Constitution. The way in which we give our blessing to this Constitution today is of tremendous importance.<br/>
I very much regret that the Opposition consider it necessary to vote against this Motion tonight. After all, Parliament has already passed into law the Act under which this Order in Council has been made. The right hon. Member for Llanelly (Mr. J. Griffiths) has said that the Order in Council carries out the scheme that has been prepared. He also asked several questions, but he left the House in no doubt that he agrees that is what this Order in Council is doing. If so, why vote against it?<br/>
The former Solicitor-General thought that closer integration between the various parts of the Commonwealth was something which we ought to have in mind in dealing with this matter of Central African Federation, but that closer integration must surely continue to be, as it has been in the past, a matter of consultation, of common feeling, and of overdeveloping common interest between the different parts of the Commonwealth.<br/>
I rather regretted the attitude of the right hon. Member for Llanelly. He seemed to be saying, "There are from seven to nine years in which this Constitution has time to prove itself. We are going to watch how the settlers behave during that period, and then we shall have another look at it." The hon. and learned Member for Leicester, North-East (Sir L. Ungoed-Thomas) said that all the time there is this threat of British veto. He laid emphasis on the question of the veto, and on the fact that the Territorial police, who are to enforce the Federal law, are to remain ultimately under the control of this House.<br/>
Surely that is not the right way to send forth from this House this Constitution? What we are doing here is to put into the hands of the people out there the responsibility for their future. Certainly the Secretary of State will be available to guide and to advise but, as my hon. Friend the Member for Preston, North (Mr. J. Amery) said, the more we try to force them along certain lines of action the less likely we shall be to get the kind of response that is desired here and throughout the Commonwealth.<br/>
The fate of this Central African Federation will lie fairly and squarely upon the shoulders of the people out there. There will be many difficulties to face. There is the great initial difficulty of bringing into line the voting systems of the three Territories. At the moment, one of the Territories has a common electoral roll and the other Territories have something more like communal electorates.<br/>
I want to express one slight misgiving in connection with that part of the Constitution which leaves to the Governors of the Territories of Nyasaland and Northern Rhodesia the task of designating one body for the election of the special African representatives. That seems to come too close to a system of communal representation which will be diametrically opposed to what&#x2014;judging by today's debate&#x2014;both sides of this House are aiming at, namely, a common electoral roll. I welcome the fact that a conference is to take place in September with regard to the electoral system of Northern Rhodesia, and hope it will bring nearer this aim.<br/>
In parting with this Order in Council, which is the culmination of so many&#x2014;some may even think too many&#x2014;of our debates, I want to add my fervent prayer that this Constitution will prove to be the beginning of a great experiment which will lead Africa towards greater prosperity and greater spiritual and moral welfare.</p>

<p>I venture to intervene at this stage for, amongst other reasons, the reason that we have on the Order Paper other matters, relating to the British Transport Commission (Compensation to Employees) Regulations, which I know many of my hon. Friends&#x2014;and, I feel sure, many hon. Members opposite&#x2014;are anxious to discuss. It therefore seemed to me that it might be convenient, if the House are nearly ready to come to a decision on this matter, to indicate the advice which, speaking from this place, I would venture to tender to my hon. Friends and to the House.<br/>
We have now arrived at the concluding stage of a series of, perhaps, the most momentous debates, in their import upon the future of millions of people, that we

have had for many years. This scheme for Central African Federation, if put into operation, marks an enormous change in the destinies of untold numbers of people. As has been said on many occasions in this debate, its failure could spell immeasurable disaster; its success would bring great good.<br/>
We on this side&#x2014;and when I say "we," I speak subject to some exceptions&#x2014;have sought to indicate, with deep sincerity, the forebodings which have haunted us for a long time as we have considered the form of this scheme. We now say, with equal sincerity, that we profoundly hope that those forebodings will turn out to be wholly unfounded. Nobody would be more delighted than my right hon. and hon. Friends who have voiced these forebodings if it should turn out, in the result, that they were without foundation; but we still entertain them.<br/>
Nothing has transpired during recent months and weeks which gives us reason to think that the view we have formed is the wrong view. There is still opposition to this scheme. Nothing has yet been done on a large scale to conciliate the fears which Africans undoubtedly entertain with regard to this scheme. The position remains substantially unchanged in that respect. We are greatly heartened at the project for the university which is to embrace all races. We are equally heartened by conversations which may seek to point the way towards some real implementation of the idea of partnership. Without exception, wherever we may sit in the House, we are all agreed that without real partnership this scheme is bound to fail. Therefore, anything which can lead, in however small a degree, to the idea of partnership is welcomed by us as much as it is by hon. Members opposite.<br/>
That is all speaking of the future, however, when this Order in Council has been approved by Her Majesty the Queen after we have resolved that it shall be presented to her. Events then must lie in the hands of those on the spot and those here who will shoulder responsibility for the future progress of this scheme.<br/>
What we have before us tonight is the question whether we should vote for the approval of the Order in Council. It is


on that point that I respectfully desire to tender my advice, which is the same as that which has already been tendered by my right hon. Friend the Member for Llanelly (Mr. J. Griffiths). When the law is finally formulated, it will be our duty, as good democrats, to abide by that law and do our best to make it prevail. As long as the Order in Council has not been approved, the law has not been finally formulated, because the Order in Council is part of that law.<br/>
Throughout the debates we have voiced our objections to the scheme, and the Order in Council is simply that very same scheme. It is almost exactly as it was presaged in the scheme in the earlier White Papers put before the House. Nothing has been changed; it is simply that scheme; and as we disliked that scheme, so equally we dislike the Order in Council. We have very carefully compared it with what was foreboded in the scheme. All the provisions concerning the Africans Affairs Board which we criticised, we hope searchingly, find their place in the Order in Council. All is exactly as the Government indicated it would be. There are minor changes&#x2014;changes of wording here and there which may be discovered on a nice comparison between the two&#x2014;but the scheme is simply reproduced in the Order in Council, and as we opposed the scheme, so we must now oppose the Order in Council.<br/>
We sought to remove the objectionable. features in the Committee stage of the enabling Bill, but none of them has been removed. That was the occasion for us to put forward our individual objections to the scheme, and we did so. We were met on each occasion, as my right hon. Friend has said, by the answer that the scheme had already been negotiated and that nothing could be done. Nothing was done, and the enabling Bill found its place on the Statute Book. Now, the child of the enabling Act is the draft Order in Council. Consistently with the attitude which they have hitherto adopted, I recommend to my hon. Friends that they must now oppose the Order in Council as they have opposed the scheme. The Order in Council is simply the scheme put in formal language. It is in no way improved.<br/>
May I add my word of welcome and congratulation to those offered to the hon.

Member for Sunderland, South (Mr. P. Williams). Glad as we were to hear his very valuable and sincere contribution, I would answer him, when he suggests that we would do well no longer to oppose the Order in Council, that this is the final stage in our debates and, just as we made clear our attitude towards the Government's proposals in previous debates, we must, consistently with that attitude, up to the eleventh hour and the last minute, and in conformity with the duty which we have felt upon us, register in the Division Lobby our disapproval and dislike of the scheme. I hope my hon. Friends will agree with me in doing that when the Question is put.<br/>
This is a moment of the utmost significance for vast numbers of people. We on this side of the House have done our best to make known what we regard as the real dangers inherent in the Government's proposal. We can do no more but go into the Division Lobby and, by our votes, for the last time record our protest.</p>

<p>I want to start by adding my congratulations to those from all quarters of the House to the hon. Member for Sunderland, South (Mr. P. Williams) on


his first speech in the House. He made a very valuable contribution and we look forward to hearing him frequently make equally valuable contributions in subsequent debates.<br/>
May I, at the outset, take up the question with which the right hon. and learned Member for Neepsend (Sir F. Soskice) ended his speech, namely, the attitude of the party opposite in deciding to divide the House against this proposed Order in Council? He justified that decision on the ground that it is necessary to register one more protest. I should have thought that the expression of his good will to the law, if it is passed, would have been more suitably given in not dividing and that it would have given a better send off to the law of Federation if, on this occasion, he had decided not to express yet one more protest. Everyone is quite well aware of his misgiving. I make that plea especially to the Leader of the Liberal Party. He has protested again and again. Surely his good wishes to this venture will be more suitably expressed by his voting in favour of the Order in Council.<br/>
I want to deal with three or four particular points which were addressed to me from the benches opposite. The first is the question on which I tried, perhaps unsuccessfully, to intervene earlier when it was necessary to look at two parallel texts&#x2014;namely, the omission of the words
<q>for the duration of a Parliament</q>
after the words in relation to the specially elected European member. The right hon. Member for Llanelly (Mr. J. Griffiths) said that by omitting those words it looked as if the European member would not be appointed for the duration of the Parliament. We are entirely at one in what we seek to do and I hope the right hon. Gentleman will be satisfied by the explanation.<br/>
Article 15 of the Order in Council, to which I drew his attention, gives a list of the cases in which the specially elected European member vacates his seat. One of these is when the Parliament comes to an end. If one of the reasons for vacating his seat was the cessation of the term of his appointment, it would has been stated there. The fact that it is excluded shows that the object of the scheme has been achieved in exactly the same way and, incidentally, in exactly the

same language as is used in Clause 28 (4) of the scheme. I drew attention to the fact that that passage goes on to say:
<q>that is to say, he will &#x2026; vacate his seat upon a dissolution of the Federal Assembly.</q>
I think that if the right hon. and learned Member for Neepsend is seized of the point he will probably agree that it is exactly the same.<br/>
The right hon. Member for Llanelly also raised the question of a suspended sentence and asked why there had been introduced in the disqualifications in the Order in Council, and not in the scheme, the words "a suspended sentence of imprisonment." The reason is that there would have been a contradiction between the qualifications for being elected and the reasons for vacating. If the right hon. Gentleman looks at the scheme he will see that it is provided that a specially elected European member shall cease to be a member if he suffers any sentence of imprisonment. That would cover a suspended sentence.</p>

<p>Would the term "a suspended sentence" include suspension without trial? Suppose a man were detained under emergency regulations without being sentenced. I take it that it is clear from the wording of the Article that such detention would not be included in the words used.</p>

<p>I think not. There must be a conviction, and then the sentence is suspended. I think the right hon. Gentleman will find it is necessary to bring the two qualifications or disqualifications into line.<br/>
I was asked either by the right hon. Gentleman or by the hon. and learned Gentleman the Member for Leicester, North-East (Sir L. Ungoed-Thomas) about the provision which said that the Federal Legislature could legislate for the different parts of the Territory, and he assumed we had special legislation in mind when this provision was put in. I can assure him that that is not so. It was put in, perhaps, out of a lawyer's caution, but I should have thought that that kind of provision might have been necessary, to apply different laws to different parts.<br/>
For instance, in the United Kingdom we may have to legislate differently for the East Coast when it suffers flood damage. Unless we have that provision


in it might be objected that laws were not of universal application. I do not think it is an important point at all. I am not saying that it should not have been raised, but I do not think that this particular section is of any other than technical importance. I think that in providing the legislative powers of the Federal Legislature it is right to say laws can be different in different parts of the country.<br/>
The hon. and learned Gentleman the Member for Leicester, North-East drew attention again to his point about the police, and he raised the argument again that it was wrong to provide that the police who, as he put it, were under the ultimate control of Her Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom should be called upon to enforce laws which were Federal. He based his argument on this contention that the laws which the Federal Government might pass might not be popular in the Territories, might be contrary to the policy of Her Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom, and that, therefore, we should have the Territorial police, under, as he said, the ultimate control of Her Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom, enforcing those laws.<br/>
I think that his criticism is misdirected. I should have thought that what has emerged at successive conferences is that one of the cardinal safeguards for the Africans and for the Territories and for the status of the Protectorate is that law and order is a territorial subject and that the police should be territorial, and that though the Federation might have the right to establish a police force at the request of the Territories the Federal police should not go into the Territories except at the request of the Territorial Governments; that would be the alternative to his proposal. The alternative to his proposal would be that the Federal police would have to go into the Territories, already be in existence in the Territories, be imposed on the Territories, for the enforcement of Federal laws to which the Territories objected.</p>

<p>The hon. and learned Gentleman will realise that I am not arguing for the establishment of the Federation police as against the Territorial police. I am merely pointing out the anomalous position that results, and

on this occasion as on the previous occasion I was pointing out that this raises the need for the Government of the United Kingdom and this House to have a really effective veto over the Federal Legislature legislation. That is the point I wish to make. I do hope that the hon. and learned Gentleman will come to the point as to how effective the veto will be, and of what control this House will have over its operation.</p>

<p>With great respect to the hon. and learned Gentleman, he has slid off the point which I wanted to make. [<i>Laughter</i>.] Yes, it is the point of the hon. and learned Gentleman. He is objecting to Territorial police. Unless his objection is to Federation as a whole there must be some police. The police must enforce the Federal law. If he does not want Territorial police, I will leave it to the House to judge what police he does want. It must be Federal police. Therefore, I suggest to the House that that is the point he has to face, and does not face even in his intervention. He said he was not proposing to have Federal police. Evidently he is not proposing to have police at all. Probably, that would make the Federation not work.<br/>
He did not put it on this ground, either: he did not say, "I am in favour of a Territorial police, but in the execution of their duties by the Territorial police we have to be very careful to see the Federal laws agree with the temper and wishes of the inhabitants of the Territories." I could have understood a point put like that, but on the previous occasion and on this occasion he came all out against Territorial police having the enforcement of Federal law. I face him squarely on that, and I say that it is intended that the Territories should have responsibility for law and order, and to that, under the system, any alternative is impossible.<br/>
Further to the subject of the hon. and learned Gentleman's intervention, the Constitution provides two cases in which what he calls the veto of Her Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom shall be entitled to operate. I would differ from the hon. and learned Gentleman as to the emphasis being on the Government in the United Kingdom keeping a tight rein on what the Federation does and does not do. We are anticipating and hoping that the working of the


Federal Constitution will be such that these clashes will not occur. As to a difference of opinion that may arise about some particular piece of legislation, it has been found from the experience of Southern Rhodesia that negotiations between the parties concerned avoid the clash, and I think it would be regrettable if from this debate the idea went out that the Government are anticipating that there will be serious divisions of opinion about legislation, and that the reserve powers of the Secretary of State will often be called into operation.<br/>
In this connection, both the hon. and learned Gentleman and the right hon. Gentleman asked about the responsibility of Ministers in answering Questions. It is not a matter on which I can give any authoritative answer or one on which I can bind the House or Mr. Speaker. I can only hazard what I think would be the position. The question of whether any particular Question can or cannot be answered is, naturally, for Mr. Speaker, probably seeking advice from the proper quarter; but I should have thought that the position is fairly clear and depends on well-established principles, and that in so far as Questions are about the responsibility of the Government with regard to the two Northern Territories and the Protectorates, those Questions would be answered by the Secretary of State for the Colonies, because they would be within the sphere of his responsibility.<br/>
With regard to Federation Questions sought to be put on those matters, I should think that they would be adjudged as being for the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations if they affect his responsibility, and could be put; where he has not got responsibility, not got control, the Questions would not be allowed to be put. I think that in one's experience of Questions about Southern Rhodesia that principle works very well. Naturally, there are always borderline cases which may cause particular difficulty, but the broad lines of the position are clear.<br/>
Where a Question is addressed to the Secretary of State, we will say for Commonwealth Relations, about his responsibility, or about the Governor-General or the Governor-General's responsibility to him, I should think, without expressing anything more than a personal opinion in

order to try to help, because I have been asked this question, in that case, as his responsibility would be involved, it is likely that Mr. Speaker would apply the principle and allow the Question.</p>

<p>Can the hon. and learned Gentleman say whether this veto is to be an effective veto or is to be treated as something nominal which, as a matter of constitutional custom or convention, will not, in fact, be exercised? That is what we are concerned about. We all hope that there will not be clashes. But will this veto be treated as an effective veto or merely as a nominal veto which, as a matter of constitutional convention, will not be exercised, and will it be possible to ask Questions in this House about the exercise of this veto?</p>

<p>The antithesis on the question about an effective or non-effective veto, I do not accept. The duty of Her Majesty's Government is to live up to their responsibility. If, for instance, legislation has been reported by the African Affairs Board to the Secretary of State, his duty is to examine the reasons given by the African Affairs Board, to consider all the circumstances, and to do his duty. I do not admit that any Government, either Socialist or Conservative, would do otherwise than do its duty according to the Constitution and according to the provisions which had been laid down.<br/>
I was also asked questions about the constitutional development in Nyasaland and Northern Rhodesia. The right hon. Member for Llanelly, in a very interesting observation about the future of the Continent, asked about the political advancement in these two Territories and whether anything was likely to be done, or what steps had been taken. I would remind him&#x2014;he knows this quite well, but for the information of other hon. Members of the House&#x2014;that in Nyasaland already extra representation of the Africans has already been provided, as a result, I think, of a state-


ment which was made in May or June. Provision was made for the appointment of one more African to the Nyasaland Legislative Council.<br/>
The situation in Northern Rhodesia is that the principle of extra African representation in the Legislative Council has been accepted. The talks will be resumed in September in the light of that principle and on that basis. So I think that the right hon. Gentleman can be satisfied that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for the Colonies is fully aware of the need for the gradual political advancement of the Africans in these two Territories, consistent, of course, with all the circumstances which justify that advancement.<br/>
I was also asked what negotiation had taken place since the enabling Bill and before the final draft of the Order in Council. The reason for those questions was, of course, the argument from the benches opposite that, if they had put forward sensible Amendments why could not those sensible Amendments be incorporated in the Order in Council by negotiations with the Government? I think that I am putting the argument fairly. I would, first, deny the premise of the right hon. Gentleman. I do not say that the Amendments may not be sensible taken in the abstract&#x2014;that is a matter for discussion. But what I do say is that in none of the cases in which Amendments were so forcibly argued by right hon. and hon. Gentlemen opposite on the occasion of the Committee stage of the enabling Bill was I personally satisfied, nor, I believe, were my right hon. and and hon. Friends, that those Amendments were an improvement to the enabling Bill.<br/>
In many cases they ran directly contrary to the whole framework of the scheme in which it was designed to have an enabling Bill, as has been done in other constitutional provisions, to allow Her Majesty's Goverment to bring out a constitution in the form of an Order in Council. Since the enabling Bill was passed, there have undoubtedly been negotiations in the sense that there have been meetings of officials to deal with the wording of the Order in Council. As the right hon. and learned Member for Neep-send said, the scheme is translated into legal language in the Order in Council.

There have been no changes of substance, because I am quite sure if there had been right hon. and learned Gentlemen opposite would have been the first to draw the attention of the House to any change in substance.<br/>
Two questions put to me by the right hon. Member for Llanelly and the hon. and learned Member for Leicester, North-East, show, as the right hon. and learned Member for Neepsend said, purely changes of wording, and it was on those changes of wording and some others to which hon. Members opposite have not drawn attention, but all equally ones of legal phraseology, that meetings of the officials took place to get agreement as to the slight technical changes.<br/>
That is the position tonight. We stand ready to go into the Division Lobby, unfortunately, at the wish and request of the party opposite on the matter of this Order in Council. Hon. Members opposite have, on the whole, made temperate speeches. They have wished the Federation well. I only regret that the right hon. Member for Dearne Valley (Mr. Wilfred Paling) saw fit to launch an indiscriminate attack which was an indictment of his own party when they were in power, because he made wild accusations about the Africans having been betrayed. They were wild accusations against his own Ministers when he was supporting them. It must be regretted that that kind of speech should go out to the world when we are trying this great experiment. We can only hope that the world will give it the amount of attention and the amount of weight which it deserves.<br/>
We come, at various moments of history, to a great constitutional departure in Commonwealth matters. The hon. Member for Wednesbury (Mr. S. N. Evans) alluded to the abolition of the slave traffic. This is a landmark in the administration of the Commonwealth. It is satisfactory to see that, as the Leader of the Socialist party in the House of Lords said, it does go forth with the approval of the party opposite in the sense of their approval to make it a working success. I would remind the House that the Leader of the Socialist party in the House of Lords said that it was to be worked by men of distinction for whom he had expressed great admiration, and he welcomed the appointment of the Governor-General.<br/>
In these circumstances, while regretting the decision of the Socialist Party to divide the House, I will ask them to note the size of the majority, to show that they have been mistaken perhaps as to the unanimity of hon. Members both on the Front Bench and behind them to support them in Federation, because, in my submission,</p>

<p>I beg to move,
<q>That the Draft British Transport Commission (Compensation to Employees) Regulations, 1953, a copy of which was laid before this House on 9th July, be approved.</q>
It would be convenient for the House if I gave an outline of these Regulations and made one or two observations which I have undertaken to the trade unions and others that I would make. Owing to the absence of my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary, it will also fall to me. by leave of the House, to reply to the points that may arise during the debate, and I hope that hon. Gentlemen will accept me on these two occasions.<br/>
In the debates on the Transport Bill, I said that we would do our best to have these Regulations submitted to Parliament before the process of dispersal started, and I said that in framing these Regulations I, as well as my Department, would consult the trade unions and other interested bodies to get a wide measure of agreement. I hope I shall be forgiven

if I remind the House that we are asking for a decision on these Regulations less than three months after the Transport Bill became an Act of Parliament, while in 1947, under the Socialist Government, the compensation Regulations for railways, canals and the London Passenger Transport Board did not appear until 11 months after the Act, and nearly three years afterwards for the road haulage employees.<br/>
I fully realise that the right hon. Gentleman the Member for East Ham, South (Mr. Barnes) was breaking new ground, and we have had the benefit of the work that was then done, but none the less I think those who have worked so hard in my Department and elsewhere to get these Regulations before the House quickly deserve the thanks of all of us.<br/>
I have consulted, as I said I would, the Trades Union Congress, the 12 unions and staff associations and, of course, the Commission itself. As those hon. Members who are interested in this highly important matter know, there have been a wide variety of compensation provisions since 1945 and 1948 under the various nationalisation Acts, and there has emerged a common pattern in most of those Regulations. I have very largely followed the common pattern in the case of the railways, improving it in at least three particulars. The Regulations are broadly based on the common pattern set by the Labour Government's Regulations, and indeed are expressed in exactly the same language.<br/>
The House may realise that the main features of these common patterns have been that there shall be an eight-year qualifying period in the industry, and the cause of claim shall arise within 10 years from the date of the statutory change; that the claim must be made within two years of the cause arising; that interim payments can be made while the claim is being assessed; that each payment can be up to two-thirds of the earnings less deductions in respect of other earnings and unemployment benefit; and that this interim payment is payable up to 13 weeks from the date of the claim, by which time the claim for compensation must be decided.<br/>
In connection with this, regard has to be had to the efforts to obtain alternative work, and in judging what is reasonable alternative work the relative security of one job and another is considered, and the extent by which the individual claimant has, in fact, sought alternative work. The long-term compensation up to 65 in the case of men and 60 in the case of women is an annual payment not to exceed one-sixtieth of the loss of pay for each year of service, plus one-sixtieth for each year of service after the age of 45 with a maximum of two-thirds, thus deliberately weighting the amount in favour of the older man or woman. The award, as the House has known in the past, can be reviewed within a period of two years, and after that it is final. There is provision now, as there has always been, for appeal to an independent tribunal.<br/>
All these features and others in previous Regulations relating to railwaymen we have preserved, and they are virtually the same as in 1948 and, as I have said already, are often in the same language. We have, however, improved in at least three particulars the position of any railway claimant who might be displaced or whose position might be worsened through the compulsory reorganisation imposed on the railways by the recent Statute.<br/>
In the first place, an aggrieved claimant could under our new Regulations go to the appeals tribunal direct and not through his employer, the British Transport Commission. Secondly, in computing the interim payment only two-thirds

of the earnings are to be set off instead of the whole of the man's earnings. This brings the interim payment for railway-men into line with what we are proposing for the road haulage workers. The object of this is to avoid penalising a conscientious man who may deliberately take a job at once at a lower rate of salary or wages while he is waiting for a better one. In allowing this principle for displaced road haulage workers, it seemed only fair to apply it also to railwaymen.<br/>
Thirdly, while the 1948 Regulations provide for the setting off of two-thirds of the actual unemployment benefit, in this case the full single man's benefit is to be set off, and this is done deliberately to avoid penalising a man with dependants. I think we can claim in the case of railwaymen that we have improved on the Regulations submitted to the House under the late Administration.<br/>
But the common pattern in the earlier Regulations in 1948 was not applied by the late Government to road haulage workers in general in the same way as it was to railwaymen. There were quite understandable reasons for this. There was no previous history of statutory compensation in the road haulage industry as there was in the case of the railways. The late Government proposed in the case of road haulage workers long-term compensation up to the age of 65 based on the years of service, but there was the considerable restriction that it was given only to those who could show that in their previous employment they had an expectation of compensation to retiring age in the event of discharge. That, as hon. Members know, was an exceedingly difficult thing to do. In fact only six people succeeded in taking advantage of that provision for long-term compensation, all the rest were limited to the short-term compensation, 13 to 26 weeks according to age and length of service; and to get that, a man had in most cases to have had substantially more than eight years' service.<br/>
When I became Minister I was conscious of the hardship caused to a number of individuals by this strict regulation. Some of them were those who had been their own employers before they had passed into the service of the Commission, others had not, but both groups had alike to prove that they had an expectation of compensation. Hon. Members who


listened to the speech made by my hon. Friend the Member for Solihull (Mr. M. Lindsay) on 25th July, 1952, in regard to the case of a certain man in the road haulage industry, Mr. Hurst, will know of some of the hardship that was caused.</p>

<p>The only point I am concerned with is that in developing the case of hardship, the Minister should also indicate that Mr. Hurst, or his firm, of which he was the major proprietor, was paid compensation amounting to over &#x00A3;200,000.</p>

<p>That was not compensation to the individual, but, as the hon. Gentleman knows, that matter was discussed at great length in the House and it is by no means as simple as the hon. Gentleman has suggested by that interruption. As I have said, we were not satisfied that this was fair, or that it was reasonable to expect people to have to prove an expectation of compensation in an industry where we all know that expectation existed only in a very few cases. My right hon. Friend the present President of the Board of Trade, in the debate on 28th June, 1950, made it plain that the Conservative Opposition, as it then was, did not regard that provision as fair.<br/>
So I thought that when we were drawing up these new Regulations, and taking account of the changed circumstances, it was right and proper to have provisions that were both wider in scope and less restrictive than had been the previous provisions. We have come to

the following conclusions in regard to road haulage workers. The first necessity for road haulage workers who may be displaced is to give them short-term assistance on a wider basis to tide over the interim period. It is our conviction that the majority of them will be absorbed in new employment and that the disturbance will be very small, but for those for whom there is an interim period there should be some short-term assistance with fewer restrictions and on a wider basis.<br/>
The terms of the proposed short-term assistance are set out on page 13 of the Regulations in the Explanatory Note. They follow, broadly, the short-term compensation provisions of 1950 but there are important improvements. The first improvement is that the resettlement payment is not confined to those with eight years' service. It will be possible to get it for employees with even less than two years' service if, for example, disposal should be started before the end of this year and they have been less than two years in the service of the Commission.<br/>
Another improvement is that the maximum duration of the payment now depends solely on age and not on the length of service. For example, a man of 45 can get the resettlement payment for 13 weeks, a man of 58 can get it for 26 weeks. That is based on our conviction that it is harder for an older man to get resettled.<br/>
The hon. Member for Swansea, West (Mr. P. Morris) urged me in the House in May this year, and some of the trade unions have done the same, to widen the basis of compensation so that anybody who was working for the Commission should be entitled to it. They argued that, at any rate until the Government White Paper came out, men might have been in some uncertainty as to the intentions of the Government, and they urged that we should take the date of 1st May, 1952, as the operative date.<br/>
We made it perfectly clear in the House as long ago as November, 1951, what were the intentions of the Government. My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary in the debate on the Address used these words:
<q>Whatever else hon. Members opposite may have doubt about, they cannot have any doubt about our intentions in this matter."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT. 12th November, 1951; Vol. 493, c. 720.]</q>


And then he proceeded to say what our intentions were. It seems to me, therefore, to be perfectly fair to say that no one entering the service of the Road Haulage Executive after that could do so with any conviction that he was entering secure employment. It would have been possible to make the date of entry 12th November, 1951, when that Government statement was made, but, as the last of the compulsory acquisitions did not take place until December, 1951, we are now providing that for resettlement payment a man must have been continuously employed since 31st December, 1951, and that is not unreasonable under all the circumstances.</p>

<p>There is no confusion on this point with the unions concerned. Everyone on the permanent staff&#x2014;and it was clearly understood by the unions in my talks with them what that means&#x2014;displaced from the Road Haulage Executive by the Act who has served since 31st December, 1951, is eligible, but for those not on the permanent staff a period of three years' service at the date of discharge is required as evidence that they are not transient employees but genuinely working for a continuous period with the Commission.<br/>
So much, for the moment, for the resettlement payments for road haulage workers. We have altered the provisions as to long-term compensation, for road haulage workers in the following particular. Remembering the hardship caused to people who could not prove that they had an expectation of compensation with their previous employer, in these Regulations I have abandoned the 1950 requirement that there must be such an expectation of compensation in their pre-nationalisation employment.<br/>
I felt it vital to do this, otherwise the Regulations, although they might look well, would be as ineffective in this way as the requirement of our predecessors in the same particular, but I could not at the same time retain the provision in the earlier Regulations in 1950 which allowed any service with any A or B licence work to count towards the eight years' qualifying period. Had I done that, men displaced by the Transport Act would have long-term compensation up to the age of 65, even if they had neither a right nor an expectation of any compensation in their previous employment and had never become settled in any employment, not even with the Commission. I do not believe that anybody facing the issue frankly would have thought that such a wide departure from the principles of compensation would be fair or proper.<br/>
To sum up in that field, to be eligible for long-term compensation, a man must at the date of loss of work have had eight years' continuous service, including service with his last employer before transfer to the British Transport Commission; but he need not have had an expectation of compensation with his previous employer. This will bring in a lot of people, and we regard it as a considerable advance on the provisions in the previous Act, whereby virtually no one was able to claim long-term compensation because an expectation of such compensation could not be proved.</p>

<p>I speak subject to correction by my hon. and learned Friend the Solicitor-General, but "whole-time service" means, I think, service of not less than 30 hours paid employment a week, during which period a man is not entitled to take any paid service with anybody else.

<p>We have expressly provided that military service&#x2014;compulsory National Service&#x2014;shall count as continuing employment.

<p>I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will not think it unfriendly if I say that he has, perhaps, conveniently forgotten. There were other Regulations in, I think, 1948 dealing with railway and canal workers and the London Passenger Transport Board, but it was not until 1950, I think, that we had the Labour Government's Regulations relating to road haulage workers. That is one of the mild charges that I made in justifying my claim that the present Government had been more prompt about it. The 1950 Statutory Instrument No. 1083 contained the Regulations which were brought in by the previous Administration three years after the disturbance.<br/>
There are three other points that I should like briefly to make. I have undertaken to certain interested bodies that I would make these observations. First, as the House knows, and as certainly the hon. Member for Swansea, West is aware, I am under a statutory obligation by Section 27 of the Transport Act&#x2014;I have been dealing with Section 28 up to now&#x2014;to bring in provisions in regard to pensions. There is one aspect of the pensions Regulations which has a bearing on compensation.<br/>
As the House may know, we are proposing to provide that a pensionable employee over the age of 40 shall be compensated for any loss he may suffer of opportunity to earn further pension by further service&#x2014;by discharge from the Commission's service, for example&#x2014;by supplementing the pension preserved for him under the separate Regulations that I propose to make under Section 27. If

a man is unable to continue longer and thereby eventually earn a greater pension, we are providing in the Regulations under Section 28 that for that particular loss of long-term pension he also can rank for compensation.<br/>
These Regulations relating to pensions are well advanced. I have sent them to the trade unions for their comments. They do not require an affirmative Resolution; they are subject to the negative procedure. It should be possible, if all goes well and we get a wide measure of understanding in the matter, for me to bring in these pension Regulations during the Recess. If anybody wants to debate them, the negative procedure can apply as soon as the House reassembles.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1953-07-27a.974.0" hansard_membership_id="12613" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/20838" speakername="Mr. Sparks" colnum="974" time="">
<p>The right hon. Gentleman, I understand, is explaining that if the pension rights of a displaced worker are better than any pension rights that he may acquire in a new employment, the difference will be made good to him by way of compensation. Will that be a permanent payment of compensation until such time as the displaced worker ceases to draw pension because of death, or will it be limited in period of time?</p>

<p>What I was saying was not quite that. I was saying that if a man, by discharge from the Commission's service, is prevented, as he might well be, from qualifying later for a larger pension which he had an expectation of getting, for that loss of eventual pension&#x2014;for the difference between what he gets and what he could have got&#x2014;he will be entitled to rank for compensation.</p>

<p>May I put a hypothetical case? Assume that a man has had 35 years' service, with every prospect of 40 years' service, but as a result of the Act has had to finish after 35 years' service; do I understand that, because of the prospective loss, the Government now say that they will give that man compensation for the additional five years?</p>

<p>On an immensely complicated matter of this kind it is always difficult to answer a hypothetical question, but I shall do my best to answer it in more detail when I wind up the debate. I can, however, say this. Subject always to the maximum amounts which are laid down for this annual payment up to the age of 65 for men or 60


for women, a loss of pension rights can be made good by a supplementary pension, as provided for in the Regulations that I shall make under Section 27. I should be a little loth without further thought to answer specifically on that point, although I hope I may be able to do so later.</p>

<p>The Minister made an important statement when dealing with the pensions Regulations that are to be made under Section 27. He said that his proposals had been sent to the trade unions and that he hoped to lay the Regulations during the Recess.

<p>I am not suggesting that the trade unions have had them for more than a few days.[HON. MEMBERS: "Oh."] Not at all. I am certainly not going to wear a white sheet about our speed either in the field of compensation or of pensions. We have dealt first with compensation. That has occupied the attention of those officers in my Department who are now applying themselves to pensions. I am only anxious to make it plain that I do not propose to wait until the House reassembles in October before I introduce the pension Regulations. If they are ready, I shall bring them in straight away, and then they are subject only to the negative procedure.</p>

<p>I thought it essential to make a general introductory statement, otherwise some of the things that required to be mentioned might not be said if I was not asked questions about it. I am here for the convenience of the House as long as the debate continues and when eventually I wind up the debate I shall try, with any legal help that may be forthcoming from my hon. and learned Friend the Solicitor-General, to deal with any points that arise.<br/>
The second thing with which I am anxious to deal is certain misgivings that have arisen about the phrase "suitable employment." The suggestion has been made that this might make men take inferior jobs or the alternative might be the loss of their compensation. All hon. Members interested in these things know-that this is a fairly common form of words in similar Regulations&#x2014;indeed, ins the Regulations introduced by the last Government. These words are also used in the National Insurance Act, 1946, for which again we have to thank the previous Administration. Section 13 of the National Insurance Act uses those words more than once. I shall deal with this when I wind up, if hon. Members wish. Section 13 (5) expressly provides against "suitable employment" being interpreted harshly in the period immediately following the loss of employment.<br/>
Finally, I have been asked by one or two of the unions to say a word about paragraph 7 of the Second Schedule, which governs the assessment of compensation. These conditions are almost the same as in the earlier Regulations, introduced by the last Government. They require the Commission to assess the amount of compensation according to the circumstances of the particular case within the maximum limits laid down in paragraph 8. In considering this compensation, the Commission must consider whether the conditions of any new employment compared with the previous, employment are better or worse&#x2014;for example, from the angle of security of employment&#x2014;and then deal with each case on its merits.<br/>
I am grateful to the House for the interest shown in these Regulations. I have taken a keen interest in them from the start. I regarded it as an inseparable part of my duty as Minister to see that they were introduced and that they were carefully drawn. I have had help from the Commission, the trade unions and not least from colleagues in my Department, who have worked very hard so that these Regulations should appear before the House rose for the Summer Recess. Whilst I shall be glad to answer any questions which may be raised, I think I can claim that in regard to railwaymen we have preserved all that was good and improved their conditions, and have considerably improved the conditions of the


road haulage workers. It is with confidence that I commend the Regulations to the House.</p>

<p>We are obliged to the Minister for the exposition he has given of Regulations that are not only complicated but, in some cases, very difficult to understand. I know the difficulties of draftsmen over these things, and I do not want to be too rough about them.<br/>
I wish to quote from the Second Schedule, paragraph 3 in particular, as an example. If I read that paragraph at a public meeting&#x2014;an assembly of road transport workers or railwaymen&#x2014;I think I would have a rough house. I am not sure that they would not say, "What is all this about; what does it mean? Talk English." I will read the paragraph:
<q>The amount of the resettlement payment payable to an applicant in respect of loss of employment shall be a sum which, when added to a sum equal to the aggregate of the following sums:&#x2014;
<ol>
<li>(i) two-thirds of any sums the applicant is receiving under a service agreement or contract; and</li>
<li>(ii) where he is or would if he made a claim thereto be entitled to draw unemployment, sickness or injury benefits, (he sum which would be so payable in respect of a person having no dependants,</li></ol></q>
<q>is equal to two-thirds of his current net emoluments immediately before his loss of employment.</q>
When one has read all that one begins to ask, "What is the chap going to get?" I think it is very difficult to answer. I rather gather that what it all comes to is that he cannot get more than two-thirds of his existing wage or salary. This is an example of drafting which I am bound to say will make it exceedingly difficult for the average workman concerned to understand the position. It may be said that he has his trade union officials who will understand it. I daresay they will. That, of course, demonstrates the great value of men belonging to a trade union. But what about the non-union chaps&#x2014;the special friends of the Conservative Party? How are they going to understand when they read this with no trade union officials to advise them? These are complicated and complex Regulations.<br/>
There is a point to which our attention has been drawn by one of the trade unions concerned, the Transport Salaried

Staffs' Association. They and, I believe, the Transport and General Workers' Union have had a communication from the Road Haulage Executive to the effect that, in view of the uncertainties and fluidity of the present situation, substantive promotions, permanent promotions, are not being made for the time being and that future promotions or upgradings will be on an acting or temporary basis. Of course that arose out of the utter insecurity and uncertainty created for all sorts of people&#x2014;not only in road transport but, to some extent, in rail transport as well&#x2014;consequent on the passing of the Transport Act. The Regulations refer to permanent employment. I should like the Minister to say in his reply whether this stipulation in the Regulations in certain respects as to permanent employment will be interpreted as meaning that the permanent employment of the officer or servant is his ordinary substantive rank and not the acting or temporary basis on the basis of which current promotions are to be made.<br/>
Clearly it is not the fault of the officer or servant that he is promoted at this time on an acting basis. I should have thought that he ought to be compensated on the rank he holds, even if it is on an acting basis, because the acting or temporary basis is not the fault of the Commission. It is not the fault of the Railway Executive, or the Road Haulage Executive, but is the consequence of the Act of Parliament for which this Government are responsible. The unions and the House are entitled to know whether in those cases compensation will be payable on the lower or substantive rank or on the so-called acting or temporary basis. I can understand the motives of the Commission and the Road Haulage Executive, but I should think that in all the circumstances compensation ought to be payable on the basis of the position to which the man has been promoted, even though it is only on an acting or temporary basis.<br/>
The next point is the qualification for resettlement payment. The right hon. Gentleman has dealt with the question of what date ought to be taken as the basis for the date upon which the employee was in the employment of the Commission, or one of its Executives. The choice is between 1st December, 1951, and 1st May, 1952. The unions have put their case to the Minister and


he has rejected it. I think the unions have a strong case for their point of view. This Transport Act, introduced by the Government, is the result of a fair amount of evolution. There were declarations in the Speech from the Throne and a debate in which statements were made, it is true, but there was more than one public declaration of policy. The final declaration of policy, if I recall rightly, was not made public until the White Paper of May, 1952.<br/>
Therefore workpeople, seeking employment with the Commission or one of its Executives were perfectly entitled to take the point of view, up to May, 1952&#x2014;it may be that they would have been rather unwise so to do in view of the nature of the Government and their policy, but a lot of people who go about the world are hopeful philosophers&#x2014;" It looks as if the Government are not clear in their own minds what they are going to do." That indeed is the case. "We do not know what provision they will make for this, that and the other, including compensation. Therefore, I shall give up the job I have and chance it on the basis of what appears to me to be a rather better job in the employment of the Transport Commission or one of its Executives." That is a rather understandable point of view. One might say that it was risky, but it was understandable.<br/>
I should have thought that justice requires that the date should be fixed not at the period of those early and somewhat speculative stages of Government policy, but at the point at which it had become firm policy in the White Paper of 1952. In those circumstances, therefore, we think that the union view was right and that the operative date in this connection should be, not 31st December, 1951, but 1st May, 1952. After all, the amount of money involved so far as the compensation authority is concerned is not all that great. I think that the Minister might make this concession in order that justice should not only be done but should appear to be done as well.<br/>
I turn to the length of the resettlement period, which is dealt with in Article 2 of the Second Schedule. The Minister has been at pains to argue that in some respects the Government have, in his judgment, done better than was the case

in respect of certain Regulations made under the Transport Act, 1947. I wish to put to the House the point that running through all the arguments that we shall have tonight and all the points that the Opposition will make and through nearly all the points which the trade unions have made to the Minister, the fact must be faced, and ought to be faced, that the circumstances of the operation under the Transport Act, 1953, are of a totally different order to the circumstances which obtained under the Transport Act, 1947.<br/>
The Minister has made play with the 1950 Regulations. That is all right; but those circumstances were not at all a tragic affair as compared with the situation which we now face. The only case which the Minister quoted of a grievance was that of a man who received compensation of over six figures, according to my hon. Friend.</p>

<p>That is grossly untrue. The individual with whom I was dealing received &#x00A3;800. This was not only debated in the House; it actually came before the Lord Chief Justice and other judges, when many harsh comments were made.

<p>It is the case that the compensation to the firm of which, presumably, he was a member&#x2014;[An HON. MEMBERS: "The principal proprietor."]&#x2014;the principal proprietor, was extensive and that he received some personal compensation on top. He went to the courts, I gather, but did not succeed. This case has been brought up when we are discussing the affairs of very humble workmen who have sometimes had difficulty in thinking in terms of three figures, let alone six, or some hundreds of pounds.</p>

<p>I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will pardon my intervening again, but I gave way a number of times when I was speaking. That again would be grossly unfair. I quoted that case because it was debated at length in the House. It was one of many cases in which no compensation other than what the Lord Chief Justice called a derisory figure was payable. There were only six people who contrived to get compensation at all. Yet the party opposite


made great play about the compensation which would be available. The Regulations were so drawn, however, that only six received compensation. I say that we have been fairer and more honest.</p>

<p>The right hon. Gentleman quoted this case of a man who was comfortably off&#x2014;comfortably placed, I understand. I think it is indicative of the psychological approach of Conservative Ministers that they are somewhat quicker to see an injustice in the case of well-to-do people than in the case of poor people. It may be that we on this side of the House are quicker to see an injustice in the case of poor people rather than in the case of well-to-do people. I should expect it to be that way, and that is a state of affairs which will continue.<br/>
The argument to which I was addressing myself was that under the Transport Act, 1947, the whole business was that of the absorption of a host of existing railway, road transport and other undertakings and the transfer of their ownership to a responsible public authority which would be acting in a public-spirited way. They would take over the properties and they would take the officers and servants of the existing private undertakings and would then consider the problem as a responsible public corporation owning and continuing to operate all those undertakings.<br/>
The British Transport Commission sought to reduce dismissals to the minimum, and to a great extent succeeded. Indeed, I am informed that under the 1947 Act about 1,000 claim forms were issued, which was a very modest number in all the circumstances. Approximately only 500 cases were eligible, and of those about 250 were in respect of loss of employment, the remaining 250 being for diminution of emoluments. So the claims were very limited, and it must be remembered that those claims&#x2014;only a few hundred&#x2014;were in relation to the 85,000 staff now employed by the Road Haulage Executive.<br/>
The truth is that in that operation a great responsible public authority was taking over the undertakings and the workpeople concerned and it was the natural desire of the public authority that dismissals should be reduced to the minimum; and that where they were inevitable and could not be helped compensa-

tion was paid. Moreover, in that case it is much easier to deal with the problem as a matter of wastage, as it is sometimes rather unkindly called, as the years pass; that is, men die or resign for one reason or another, and it is then possible for the public authority not to fill the positions thus made vacant if it is not necessary to do so. That is an infinitely less painful process than is likely under the Act of 1953.<br/>
What is happening now is not a transfer of undertakings and physical assets from private ownership to a great public authority; it is a transfer of physical assets&#x2014;and, let me add, of the human beings who go with the physical assets&#x2014;from a public authority to private concerns. But whereas under the 1947 Act, when the physical assets were taken over, the human beings were transferred as well, in this case the physical assets are to be sold with no obligation and no automatic corresponding consequence that the human beings who have been working with the physical assets will go with them into the new ownership.<br/>
Moreover, none of these private employers to whom the undertakings will be sold will be under the slightest obligation to employ any of the men who have been working for the undertaking. Therefore, if the Labour Party in this House, and their trade union colleagues outside, are asking for somewhat better conditions under these Regulations than was the case under the earlier Regulations, it really is to be expected.<br/>
I say, quite frankly, that there are some arguments which I have advanced tonight I would not feel obligated to advance were the transfer the other way, from private enterprise to public authority, because public authority is in an easier position to discharge the obligation and more trusted to be able to do so. As a matter of fact, some of these purchasers of the physical assets will not want to discharge the obligation, but some will not be able&#x2014;and therefore off it goes.<br/>
I notice that the right hon. Gentleman said he consulted the Trades Union Congress and the trade unions concerned, and we are all very glad that should be so. He consulted the British Transport Commission. But he did not say whether he consulted the Road Haulage Association, which I understand was consulted in connection with the policy, very fully


consulted. I do not know whether the right hon. Gentleman would care to tell us now&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>

<p>I thought that would be the answer, but now see where we are. Under the 1947 Act it was a transfer to a public authority which had to meet the compensation and the arguments for that compensation. In this case it is a transfer from public authority to private authority. On the Bill itself and the policy behind the Bill the Minister consulted the road hauliers and the Road Haulage Association. But here is a case where he ought to have consulted them. He should have said to them, "Now gentlemen, we are faced with this delicate and complicated operation which may be rather brutal if we are not careful, and I do not want it to be so. What arrangements can you enter into with me, as Minister, on behalf of your members to see to it that the minimum hardship and trouble is inflicted upon the chaps now employed by the British Transport Commission?"</p>

<p>That is quite another matter. The right hon. Gentleman has suggested I should have consulted them as to the terms of compensation which would have to be paid by the compensating authority. As to how the transition can be most smoothly accomplished that, of course, is a matter properly to be discussed with the Road Haulage Association and with many other bodies. I was accused of consulting them too much before setting up the Disposal Board. The Board and the Commission are now responsible. It would be clearly improper for me to engage in talks, either with those members of the Road Haulage Association on the Disposal Board or with the Association itself. If I did so, and the right hon. Gentleman prised out that fact, he would come running to this House as if he had unearthed another scandal.</p>

<p>I understand that what all that means is that the right hon. Gentleman has not consulted with the Road Haulage Association as to how they are proposing to discharge to the best of their ability a public duty and make this operation as painless as possible to the workpeople concerned.<br/>
We did criticise the right hon. Gentleman for having certain relationships with many of these gentlemen and some of the financial undertakings they have created. My hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, South-East (Mr. Callaghan) was very active in the matter, and I think he was right. But this is another story altogether. Where are these people going? From a public authority to private enterprise. And the private enterprise trade association, which the right hon. Gentleman was so careful to consult about the policy the Conservative Government should pursue regarding the possible reorganisation of transport, has not been consulted&#x2014;they who are to receive these assets&#x2014;as to what they can do to make the transition as smooth as possible.<br/>
This is typical again of the Conservative psychological approach. When it is a question of acting against the community&#x2014;[HON. MEMBERS: "Oh."]&#x2014;yes, in selling assets belonging to the community and handing them over to the friends of the Conservative Party, this trade association representing friends of the Conservative Party are fully consulted. When it comes to the poor devils of workpeople who are to be left in the air, or on the streets when the physical assets go, they do not consult the receivers of the physical assets to see what they are going to do to make this operation&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>

<p>&#x2014;can he tell us whether the trade unions concerned have had any negotiations with the Road Haulage Association recently as to wage agreements?</p>

<p>I do not know, and I cannot see what wage agreements between the unions and the Road Haulage


Association have to do with the policy to which I am now referring. Here the Minister is making Regulations under which it is his duty to make this transition as smooth as he can, and as least harmful and damaging as possible to the workpeople, and he has not consulted the very people who are largely concerned. But he has consulted the Commission.<br/>
Regarding the length of the resettlement period, and certain other matters, the Minister and the House should realise that we are now engaged in totally different transactions from those transactions under the Act of 1947. I will go further, I will even make a move in the Minister's direction. In the case of the Railways Act of 1921, which was a compulsory merger by Act of Parliament of some hundred or so companies&#x2014;[HON. MEMBERS: "One hundred and twenty."]&#x2014;over 100&#x2013;111&#x2014;separate railway undertakings into four main-line groups of companies, there were provisions for compensation.<br/>
In that case it was the transfer of what were in many cases small railway companies to four large companies. It was much easier, much more certain, that the four great companies would have a better opportunity to take care of the workpeople; that they would be more responsible and reasonable in providing compensation, or making the operation as easy as they could. I think my railway friends will agree that they did their best in that direction. But this is a different operation from that, which was a private ownership merger towards private monopoly on the railways.<br/>
This is a case where we are dealing with a large number of small operators who either will not be concerned with making this thing work justly, equitably or smoothly, or who will just not be able to do so because of the circumstances in which they are working. That must be realised. In those circumstances the likelihood of the men being without reasonable employment is much greater than under the Act of 1947, and materially greater than under the Railways Act of 1921. Therefore it seems to the trade unions, and to us on this side of the House, that in the circumstances of this operation the maximum period for resettlement payment should not be 13 weeks, and 26 in case of certain of the older men, but should be 52 weeks.

That seems to us to be a case worthy of consideration.<br/>
The unions have argued&#x2014;I admit this is rather more disputable&#x2014;again taking into account the special circumstances of the totally different operation from that under the Act of 1947, that the maximum payment should be, and could be, the full rate of pay at the time of the loss. In their judgment the proportion proposed in the Regulations is no longer adequate in view of the circumstances with which we are dealing under this Act.<br/>
I come now to the qualifying period of service for long-term compensation under Regulations 4 and 5. Again it appears to us that the qualifications for compensation should be less rigorous than they were in the Regulations made under the 1947 Act and that the qualification period for this purpose, as requested by the unions, should be not more than two or three years, instead of the eight years specified in Regulation 4 (2, <i>c</i>) and Regulation 5 (2, <i>b</i>). In the circumstances with which we are now dealing, that appears to us to be a reasonable thing to claim.<br/>
Moreover, the unions make a further claim, which I should have thought was fair and proper, taking into account the nature of the road haulage industry. These Regulations are rigid. Some of these men have been employed by the Commission and the Road Haulage Executive and before that as drivers of vehicles carrying A licences and sometimes carrying B licences. In this industry change of employment is more frequent than on the railways, for example. Men move about to better their employment. It seems to us, therefore, that the A and B licence service should be taken into account in calculating an employee's period of service and that the period of service required should be reduced in accordance with the terms which I have mentioned.<br/>
As to the scale of compensation payment dealt with in the Second Schedule, paragraphs 6 and 8, it is claimed that as in the case of the resettlement payment the maximum payment should be equivalent to the full rate of pay at the time of the loss. The Minister dealt with the next point on which I cannot follow why, if I may say so, he is somewhat sticky. It is the point about suitable


employment, namely that if the workman has a chance of suitable employment or if he gets that employment that serves to take him out of the compensation provisions.<br/>
The trade unions ask that the words "reasonably comparable" should be substituted for "suitable." I forget what the terms are in the Rent Restriction Acts, but I do not think that the word used is "suitable." My impression is that the phrase is "reasonable alternative accommodation" or "equivalent accommodation." No doubt we shall hear more about that when the Government bring in their legislation dealing with rent restriction, which I understand they are considering; but "suitable employment" is not as good a term as "reasonably comparable employment." We think that these words should be substituted for the words "suitable employment" in the Regulations.<br/>
I draw the Minister's attention, moreover, to the point that he actually uses these words "reasonably comparable" in Regulation 2 (<i>a</i>) which ends with the words
<q>&#x2026; and he is not offered by the Commission a reasonably comparable office or situation;. &#x2026;</q>
When the Minister replies, perhaps he will be good enough to tell us why the words "reasonably comparable" are used in that Regulation and yet he declines to use them in the other Regulation. I should have thought that if they stand up in that Regulation and the words are reasonable in themselves he might be willing to consider their use in the other case. The Minister has given a view of his interpretation of "suitable employment." I did not gather that he specifically stated that the words "suitable employment" are as wide or as good as "reasonably comparable," nor, of course, would it bind the courts of law if he did say that; but perhaps he will deal with the matter further later on.<br/>
Those are the points which we have wished to raise. It may be that some of my hon. Friends, particularly those who are associated with the industry, will wish to raise others. It is no good the Minister arguing comparisons between 1947, 1948 or 1950, and 1953. The circum-

stances are entirely different. The previous operation was a great public operation of absorption of private competitive undertakings. One of the reasons for absorbing them was that they caused no end of trouble in the matter of standards and conditions. They were absorbed by a great public authority which could be trusted to discharge its responsibilities in a responsible spirit, whereas in this case, though the Commission will pay out the compensation, they are not in control of the situation.<br/>
It is a situation in which these men are scattered and it is very uncertain what will happen to them because this is a transfer of assets from a great public authority to a whole host of individual proprietors of one sort or another. I beg the House to take that into account. It is a vital and essential difference between the situation under the 1947 Act and that under the 1953 Act.<br/>
We have given careful consideration to the question whether at the end of the debate we should divide or not. We agree that the Minister has met the unions and has had friendly consultations with them and that in a number of respects he has been able to make concessions. On the other hand, there are outstanding a material number of points and we apprehend that when this Act works in conjunction with these Regulations there will be an awful lot of un-happiness among many men and possibly women employed in this transport world who will feel pretty bitter and miserable about the whole thing. They will have difficulties because of insecurity of employment and there will be difficulties under the Regulations in respect of the points to which I have drawn attention.<br/>
On balance, we think it is reasonable that all these people should have the right to know and that the country should have the right to know when these troubles arise, which may cause a great number of difficulties, who supported this situation and who did not. In these circumstances we feel that the House ought to have a Division. Without saying that everything in the Regulations is wrong, but saying that there is enough in them which is unsatisfactory, in order to make clear who is responsible and who is not we propose to divide the House at the end of this debate.</p>

<p>I do not share the gloomy prognostications of the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Lewisham, South (Mr. H. Morrison), because I think that these Regulations mark a new step forward in the legislative history of this country. They place on the Statute Book for the first time recognition by a Government that they have a duty and a respect to pay to those who leave nationalised industry and go into private industry. Hitherto there has been nothing comparable with these Regulations on the Statute Book and therefore I welcome them. They are something new, just, and very valuable to the structure of this country. I am rather puzzled why the right hon. Gentleman should have regarded them with so much disapproval when obviously, from the point of view of himself and of every thoughtful Member of this House, these Regulations should be wholeheartedly welcomed.<br/>
There is one point in the Regulations which leaves me a little confused&#x2014;a matter which does not appear to have occurred to the right hon. Member for Lewisham, South. Let me first of all read the Explanatory Note, the first paragraph of which, to my mind, emphasises the whole purpose of these Regulations:
<q>These Regulations provide for the payment by the British Transport Commission of compensation to their officers or servants who suffer loss of employment or loss or diminution of emoluments or pension rights or whose position is worsened in consequence of the denationalisation of road haulage, the modifications of the functions of the Commission, or the re-organisation of the railways, provided for by the Transport Act, 1953.</q>
That seems perfectly clear. Then it says in the third paragraph:
<q>To be eligible for long-term compensation a claimant must at a given date have had eight years continuous service after the age of 18.</q>
I link that up with Regulation 3 (4, <i>d</i>) which reads:
<q>In this Regulation the expression 'whole time service' means employment after attaining the age of eighteen years&#x2014;(<i>a</i>) as an officer or servant; &#x2026; (<i>d</i>) on war service following immediately upon any of the preceding employments.</q>
My question to the Minister is this. Where a man&#x2014;obviously a young man&#x2014;has had his period of service with the railways or with the nationalised road

haulage undertaking interrupted by military service, is it quite clear that the military service is reckoned in lieu of service with the railways or with the road haulage undertaking? My point is that no man who serves his country in the Armed Forces of the Crown should be penalised because he has been so called up and has not remained at his work, as so many other railway or road haulage workers have.<br/>
I welcome these Regulations, and I am astonished that hon. Members opposite do not recognise that this is one of the most generous measures which could be provided.</p>

<p>It is a pity that the hon. and gallant Member for Buckingham (Sir F. Markham) did not grace this Chamber with his presence while the Minister was trying to explain these Regulations. If he had done so, he would have realised that the Minister said that he had moulded these Regulations upon something that the right hon. Member for East Ham, South (Mr. Barnes) had said when he was in the position now occupied by the right hon. Gentleman.<br/>
The other interesting feature is that he now tells us that when employees leave the nationalised industry to return to private employment, they are to be compensated. The simple fact is that it is because the Minister does not think that private enterprise will want them that he is providing compensation. If they can be found a job, there will be no compensation. I am not sure whether the hon. and gallant Gentleman is under the impression that they are to get compensation as well as a job, but if that is what he thinks, he has an awful shock coming to him one of these days, particularly in the constituency which he represents.<br/>
I think my right hon. Friend the Member for Lewisham, South (Mr. H. Morrison) is right. These Regulations ought to be resisted in the Division Lobby, because they are certainly not good enough in the circumstances in which these people are likely to find themselves. The Minister told us that he had had long consultations with the Trades Union Congress. Indeed, he told us that the period of cause of action is to be 10 years, but what he did not tell the House was that


in his original outline of the Regulations he provided for five years. It was only when the Trades Union Congress drew his attention to that, and asked for an unlimited period of cause of action, that he reviewed the situation. In that respect the Minister has not been honest with the House&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman has no right whatever to say that. In the course of negotiations on matters of this kind with the Trades Union Congress or with any other body, obviously there is a good deal of give and take. Certain suggestions are made; some are knocked down by one side or the other, and eventually an agreed compromise on some matters is reached while on others the parties do not agree. To refer to one period of my talks, and say that at every stage I should have said how my mind developed in the talks, is very unreasonable. I presented a complete picture to the House, and by that I stand.</p>

<p>I shall justify the charge before I finish. I say that the Minister has not been honest with the House. In his original outline he indicated a period of five years. The Trades Union Congress asked for unlimited time. But that is not the whole of the story. In the debate on 18th December, 1952, the Minister referred to a question which had been asked by my hon. Friend the Member for Swansea, West (Mr. P. Morris). This is what the right hon. Gentleman said:
<q>The hon. Member for Swansea, West asked about the period of action. The period of action is not laid down in the Act of 1947, but in the Regulations. The period is 10 years in the Labour Government's Regulations. I see no reason why it should be different, but that is the sort of point I should like to discuss with the various bodies I have mentioned."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 18th December, 1952; Vol. 509, c. 1663.]</q>
I charge the Minister with having put five years in the Regulations in order that he could appear to be making a concession to the Trades Union Congress.<br/>
The Minister went on to tell us that the date 1st May is not justifiable because of something that his right hon. and learned Friend the Home Secretary said in the House in November, 1951. He proceeded to read the first part of this extract, and I want to read the second part. The Home Secretary said:
<q>Whatever else hon. Members opposite may have doubt about, they cannot have any doubt about our intentions in this matter.</q>

Then he went on to explain what they were, and he said:
<q>They are set out quite clearly in our election documents. &#x2026;</q>
Was it not the Prime Minister who said, during the previous Administration, that the insertion of a promise in an election programme is not binding on any future Government? What reason have we to suppose that, because the Tory Party put something into their election programme, that policy will be followed by the Government, after the statement which the present Prime Minister made in 1950? What right has anybody to assume that a document prepared by the Conservative Central Office binds the Government to carry out the policy laid down when the party are elected to power? It is a new doctrine that because a political party inserted a statement in an election programme it must be taken&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>

<p>With due respect, the Regulations mention a date upon which a person must be in the employment of these authorities if he is to receive compensation. The Minister has argued&#x2014;and he quoted in aid the very passage from HANSARD which I am now quoting&#x2014;that the pledge given by the Home Secretary ought to be taken as a guarantee that at some time or other this Government would carry out that pledge, I am endeavouring to say that that is not the case.<br/>
In any case, it is advancing a new doctrine if a promise in a programme of a political party is to be taken as binding that party, when it becomes a Government, to do something at some future date. I have merely called in aid the speech made in this House by the present Prime Minister, when he was Leader of the Opposition, in which he said that putting a statement into a programme was no reason for carrying it out. That is not good enough. There is nothing in the speech of the Home Secretary which conveys anything at all, because he goes on to say:
<q>They are set out quite clearly in our election documents, and our intention is, as it has always been, to diminish the monopolistic powers of the British Transport Commission over the long-distance section of the road haulage industry, and to give an opportunity


to those private hauliers who wish to do so to return into a business from which so many of them have been ousted&#x2026;."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 12th November, 1951; Vol. 493, c. 720.]</q>
That is no indication of what the programme was.<br/>
I would remind the Minister of Transport that in the debate on the King's Speech on 6th November, 1951, there were merely these few words:
<q>Proposals will be made to facilitate the extension of private road haulage activities."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 6th November, 1951; Vol. 493, c. 53.]</q>
In those circumstances I suggest that there is no justification whatsoever for taking 31st December, 1951, as the date. I want to prove to the right hon. Gentleman, out of his own mouth, that he argued that the White Paper was a declaration of policy. On 21st May, 1952, there was a debate in which the right hon. Gentleman took part; indeed, he opened it. He said:
<q>I must ask the House to listen to an argument which may take a little time to evolve, but the purpose of the White Paper is to direct Parliamentary and public attention in advance of the appearance of the Bill to the broad issues of policy and principle involved.</q>
If he is to be honest with the people who are to be displaced in this industry, he should admit that that is the first intimation that anybody had of the detailed policy that was to be followed by this Administration and by his Department.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman went on to deal in detail with that policy. He said:
<q>In regard to the sale of road haulage assets, there are one or two observations I should like to make to the House. Her Majesty's Government will be glad to see the former owners of long-distance road haulage undertakings come back again into the business. We are particularly anxious to see again those people who were compulsorily acquired and to whom no compensation, however high, was really a return for what they have lost, people who had spent their whole life in a business they had themselves created and who gave local and personal service to their friends and neighbours."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 21st May, 1952; Vol. 501, c. 481&#x2013;491.]</q>
I suggest that the right hon. Gentleman must be honest with those people who, through this Act of Parliament, will be put out of work&#x2014;and I say those words deliberately&#x2014;because of the policy of the disposal of the road haulage industry which he proposes to follow and which is designed to that end. The first point I want to make, therefore, is that there is every justification for making 1st May, 1952, the operative date, and neither the

right hon. Gentleman nor the Government by any stretch of the imagination can justify choosing the date 31st December, 1951.<br/>
I want to say a few words about the resettlement period. The Road Haulage Executive have built up not only a whole series of trunk routes which we know include the principal towns of the country but also, in very many parts of the country, substantial repair and overhaul depots. Very many skilled people, some in supervisory capacities, are employed in these depots. I have tried to examine the scheme as carefully as I can, but I cannot see how these depots can remain in existence. They must inevitably be broken up. Large numbers of people, highly skilled in the motor engineering world, will inevitably find themselves out of a job.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman has argued from the beginning&#x2014;and, indeed, the Prime Minister said this in the White Paper debate in 1952&#x2014;that the small men were to come back into this industry. The right hon. Gentleman said these people who gave personal service were to come back into the industry. If they do, they are bound to displace large numbers of people, many the wrong side of 40 to get jobs easily. To tell men of that kind, highly skilled men, that at the end of 13 weeks or something between 13 and 26 weeks, through no fault of their own but through the deliberate action of the Government, they are to be placed on the scrap heap, or, at best, upon the lists of the employment exchange, is all that this Government can do for them seems to me to be betraying all the fine promises which the right hon. Gentleman and his colleagues gave when the Bill was being debated in this House and in another place.<br/>
I therefore suggest that the least the right hon. Gentleman can do is to give to the older people a 52-week resettlement period. If he brings the date forward to 1st May, 1952, and doubles the period of resettlement, he will to some extent, at any rate, mitigate the hardship which has been created.<br/>
I agree with my right hon. Friend the Member for Lewisham, South that this is an entirely different type of operation. He read out the number of claims that have been made so far as compensation is concerned. I had some experience during a previous period of reorganisa-


tion on the railways when the 120 companies were amalgamated into four under the Railways Act, 1921. I know that there were very many men in those days, middle aged, skilled at their jobs, who did not know what was to happen. They were skilled craftsmen. In the absence of a job in the railway service, and having to go into some other industry at the age of 45 or 50, they were good only for unskilled labour. That is the sort of thing to which large numbers of these people are today to be condemned.<br/>
I do not want to repeat what my right hon. Friend said earlier, but when the road haulage organisation was being built up by the British Transport Commission, it was the ambition and desire to create and build up a road haulage organisation covering the whole of the country. Very few of the people who desired to go with their vehicles were denied the right to go over to the new organisation. Has the Minister sought from the Road Haulage Association or from the prospective purchasers of transport units an undertaking that they will take over, to man the vehicles in their control, the equivalent number of men now working them in the control of the Road Haulage Executive who will be displaced?<br/>
Has he made any inquiries at all? Has he made any attempt whatsoever to safeguard the employment of those people? Or does he believe these Regulations are going to be good enough to satisfy people who are being thrown from pillar to post? Not because of anything they have done, not because of shortcomings on their part, but because of a promise made by the Tory Party to the Road Haulage Association, these people are now being thrown to the wolves.<br/>
Indeed, already anxiety is being felt. Here is a letter dated 18th July from a man in the employment of the Road Haulage Executive who does not know what is going to happen to him. He says in a letter to an hon. Friend of mine:
<q>I beg to take this opportunity of writing to you in an endeavour to seek your guidance in connection with the grave position I find myself in with the denationalisation of road transport. I am aged 45, married, with two children. I obtained grammar and technical school standards. My lifetime has been spent in transport, 28 years with Messrs. Pickfords and the last two years with the Road Haulage Executive. I attained an executive position in Messrs. Pickfords as a branch manager at"&#x2014;</q>

and he gives the name of the town&#x2014;
<q>and in November, 1951, obtained a transfer with no personal gain to myself to another group of the Road Haulage Executive, to assist in reorganising a depot which had been very badly controlled, with an adverse trading return amounting to thousands of pounds. During the last two years my endeavours have been rewarded and my depot is now a commercial proposition revealing a profit on each four weekly period. Sir, in the event of Pickfords and its subsidiaries continuing to operate as heretofore, has any provision been made for staff previously in their employ to be reinstated? I have been a contributor to a superannuation scheme introduced by Messrs. Pickfords for the past 28 years. My house is mortgaged with this firm, which, I trust you will appreciate, places me in a very unhappy position. I must be frank and say I was warned not to leave the employ of my previous employers, but my experience plus long spells of duties have proved an asset to the Road Haulage Executive. Thanking you in anticipation of a reply at your earliest convenience. &#x2026;</q>
This is one of the men whom the right hon. Gentleman says, because of something nebulous which was said by the Home Secretary in this House in November, 1951, ought to be satisfied with that. If that is the best which the right hon. Gentleman can do for these people whom he is displacing deliberately by the introduction of the Measure, I am very glad that I shall go into the Division Lobby tonight to vote against these Regulations.</p>

<p>I wish in a very few words to welcome these Regulations, and I do so because I am quite satisfied, notwithstanding the speeches that have already been made by the right hon. Member for Lewisham, South (Mr. H. Morrison) and the hon. Member for The Hartlepools (Mr. D. Jones), that there is no justification whatever for suggesting that these Regulations are not better drafted and more comprehensive than either of the two previous sets of Regulations dealing with compensation which have appeared under the Transport Acts. It really is preposterous that we on this side of the House should discontinue to hear the suggestion that the road hauliers must be bad employers if they are private hauliers.</p>

<p>I bow to your Ruling, Mr. Deputy-Speaker. I was led into digression by the hon. Gentleman. The point I want to make is that I am satisfied that these Regulations are better drafted and more comprehensive than the Regulations which arose out of the 1921 Act or the Transport Act, 1947. As the House is aware, I have certain experience of dealing in a legal capacity with the 1921 Act and the Regulations which arose under it. I think that the hon. Member for The Hartlepools will confirm that the Regulations under the 1921 Act were extremely vaguely worded and that many controversies arose on the compensation Clauses under those Regulations, particularly in the case of the South Wales Railways, with one of whom the hon. Gentleman was employed before both he and I were servants of the Great Western Railway Company.</p>

<p>I was saying that these are very much more satisfactory Regulations than those put forward under that Act. It is a fact that cases under those Regulations were dragging on right up to the beginning of the war, and I am told that cases are still from time to time arising, especially in connection with the South Wales Railways, because when a man retires he may claim that his conditions as to the age of retirement were worsened by reason of the amalgamation of 1921. These Regulations today are a great improvement on those because those Regulations had no time-limit on

the period under which the cause of claim could arise.<br/>
It was most unsatisfactory from the employers and employees point of view that there should be no time-limit. In the Regulations which we have before us there is a time limit of 10 years within which the cause of claim must arise, and that applies not only to the railways under Regulation 5 but to Regulation 4 which deals with long-term compensation for road haulage employees. In that respect the Regulations are a great improvement upon the preceding ones.<br/>
There is a second very good point. Regulation 5 is in very much the same terms as the railway Regulations arising under the 1947 Act which came into force in 1948, but besides Regulation 4 which deals with the long-term compensation for road haulage employees who have been in the employ of the Road Haulage Executive for eight years, we also have Regulation 3 which provides for resettlement payments as a temporary measure and is something new. I do not follow this argument of the hon. Member for The Hartlepools, who seemed to think that Regulation 3 was unfair because it applied only from a certain date.</p>

<p>Regulation 4 specifically provides permanent compensation. Regulation 3 is an interim measure to provide compensation for a man changing his job. One hon. Member said that it is nothing unusual for a man to change his job in the road haulage industry. It is nothing to do with the way in which the road hauliers treat their employees; it is the custom of the industry for men to change their jobs from time to time. Here we have a provision which will enable men to get something which they would not otherwise have in the ordinary course.</p>

<p>I do not want the hon. Member to mislead the House. Will he tell us what would happen to a man who got a 13 weeks' resettlement payment if at the end of the 13 weeks he had not found a comparable job?</p>

<p>A man who gets 13 weeks' resettlement payment is 13 weeks better off than a man in private industry who changes his job frequently during the course of a year. If the man was a


permanent employee of a firm which subsequently became absorbed in the Road Haulage Executive, he has permanent compensation under the new Regulation, but if he has been only a short time in the employment of the Road Haulage Executive it is probable that he is a man who is changing his job from time to time and he has temporary compensation for 13 weeks, or it may be up to 26 weeks, which will cover the interim period.<br/>
The argument that this is unfair has been put forward with a great deal of force except when it comes to the alternative. Having explained at great length the hardships which would arise under Regulation 3, the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Lewisham, South went on to say that he wanted 52 weeks instead of 26. If it is going to be such a great hardship and these men are going to be "thrown on the scrapheap"&#x2014;that was the right hon. Gentleman's expression&#x2014;surely the argument is not between 26 and 52 weeks. Either the men are being given a temporary payment while changing jobs or else hon. Members opposite are asking for some better form of compensation. Hon. Members opposite cannot have it both ways.<br/>
These Regulations are an improvement upon the previous ones in many respects, and my right hon. Friend and his advisers are to be congratulated upon bringing them forward.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Truro (Mr. G. Wilson) agrees that the Regulations are very useful, but he does not know why. He is not seized of the point that when the 1947 Act brought the Road Haulage Executive into existence it made a vast difference to the security attached to employment. That is the whole point of the argument against the present Regulations. There is a real need for the Minister to recognise that when the men went into the service of the British Transport Commission, it offered them security and better conditions and in most cases infinitely better salaries and wages. I was wondering whether there was going to be any objection to that statement from the other side of the House.</p>

<p>It is not untrue; it is exactly what happened. In the case of Pickfords, for instance, when the men were brought into the service of the British Transport Commission it represented an increase in wages of 35s. a week. That applied to members of the union to which I belong.</p>

<p>Again the hon. Gentleman does not realise that we could not function fully until the men came under the Road Haulage Executive. The hon. Gentleman does not begin to understand the position about these Regulations.<br/>
The Minister has a direct and personal responsibility to these people. I know he recognises that, but will he recognise that he has to do his very utmost to see that these Regulations take into account the fact that these men, having been employed by the British Transport Commission&#x2014;I know that he has argued against this in the past&#x2014;feel that, when they go into a smaller undertaking and to an unknown employer, they are to some degree embarking on a sea of insecurity? Therefore, we are entitled to ask for these Regulations to be an improvement on previous compensation Regulations.<br/>
The 1921 Act attempted to give the employees a bigger organisation which could offer them better superannuation and better salaries. The 1947 Act offered to them the same kind of principles, and they were much more ready then to accept the Regulations governing compensation than to accept the present Regulations, which appear to be a reversion to conditions of employment in the past which they did not like, with smaller salaries and security almost non-existent.<br/>
I should like to make it clear that these people are not asking to be made secure against every ill wind that blows. They are not asking to be "feather-bedded" in regard to their conditions, but they are entitled to ask the Government, which


are responsible for these schemes, to see that their terms and conditions are not worsened. In the past the House has always recognised that, and it is the central and essential principle which the House and the Minister must recognise.<br/>
Now may I invite the right hon. Gentleman's attention to a point of detail about which I am not satisfied&#x2014;the question of the emoluments upon which compensation is to be based? Since the announcement of the Government's policy many thousands of positions which had been graded for salary, pension, and so on, have been varied in that regard because vacancies have been filled on a temporary basis. I do not know whether in his negotiations the Minister has heard of the mystic letters D.O.P., which represent difference of pay as between the pay attaching to an appointment and the lesser grade which undertakes appointment on a temporary basis? Obviously, that difference will affect the emolument of the person concerned and his entitlement to pension. I am certain that the Minister seizes the point, and while I do not necessarily want him to deal with it this evening, I ask him to go into it and say that he will have some regard to it.<br/>
Another question to which the Minister's attention was drawn earlier was that of reasonable employment or comparable employment. The phrase which we would like him to use is referred to in Regulation 2 on two occasions. In Regulation 2 (<i>a</i>) the last phrase is "a reasonably comparable office" and in the last paragraph it is "be deemed to be not reasonably comparable." If the Minister would use that term within the Regulations as applicable to the kind of work which people displaced under the operation of the Act do undertake, rather than the phrase "suitable employment," it would be preferable. "Suitable employment" might not apply to transport at all, whereas "reasonably comparable" work is work associated with transport. Suitable work for the individual might not be associated with transport and might take no account of the skill, technical or otherwise, and long experience within the transport industry. I hope the Minister will take that into account in considering this matter.<br/>
My main point is that in road and rail transport a serious atmosphere of

insecurity has been aroused. The Minister ought to take more account of this and so ensure that these Regulations are an improvement upon those which followed the 1921 and 1947 Acts.</p>

<p>It is the burden of our case on this side of the House&#x2014;this is the answer to the hon. Member for Truro (Mr. G. Wilson)&#x2014;that these Regulations are being introduced into an entirely different atmosphere in the transport industry. The hon. Member must believe that we are sincere in that. When the 1947 Act came into operation in 1948, I was closely associated with many trade union officials who were engaged in the change-over from private enterprise to public ownership. In my area some 60 firms were taken over. One would have imagined that there would have been a great deal of friction and difficulty. Speaking for myself, however, I had not a single complaint, and I am assured by the unions that when the employees were taken over they were in the main taken over entirely.<br/>
But that will not apply today; it just is not possible. It is almost certain that the vast number of those who buy the lorries will not, in the first instance, at any rate, take on the drivers automatically with the vehicles. The buyers will take only the better quality vehicles and obviously they will not want those drivers who are redundant because of the fewer vehicles that will be bought.<br/>
There is one respect in which the Regulations do not satisfy us and which so far has not been mentioned, not even by my right hon. Friend the Member for Lewisham, South (Mr. H. Morrison). I understand from the trade unions that up to the time of the proposals of the Conservative Party, they were in process of negotiation with the Road Haulage Executive for a pension scheme for lorry drivers. They had, in fact, got to an advanced stage of negotiation. One of my colleagues in the trade union movement assures me that another year would have seen the fruition of such a pension scheme.<br/>
Does the Minister not realise how galling will be the Regulations to lorry drivers who were within a year of being within a pension scheme for the


first time in their lives but who again are to be denied any possible hope of ever being in a pension scheme of any kind, because private enterprise cannot give it to them?<br/>
I ask for this concession, and the Minister will know that what I say is true. After long negotiations, that pension scheme almost came to fruition. Cannot the Minister now accept for these drivers that had there been a pension scheme he would give it to them under the Regulations? Can he not accept some form of compromise which would concede something to these men? Under the nationalised undertaking, they would have had their pension scheme within a year, but the Minister has now denied them its fruition.<br/>
There can be no comparison whatever between conditions in transport today and in 1948. I hope, therefore, that the points that were raised by my right hon. Friend the Member for Lewisham, South will be considered. Much has been said of the older men in the industry but one thing of which we can be certain is that in comparison with 1948 their prospects are now much worse. The Minister recognises this and is to give them compensation for 26 weeks. There is no reason why he should not make it 52 weeks. These men, who have been in transport for a long time, some of them most of their lives, will have great trouble now in finding alternative employment. That is the view of most of us in the industry, and I hope that the Minister will look with favour at the suggestion to increase the length of the resettlement period.</p>

<p>It is important that stress should be laid on the point about the date of operation. I do not propose to argue it in detail, because it has already been mentioned by one or two of my hon. Friends from this side of the House. It seems to me and to the trade unions that a date in May, 1952, would be a much more reasonable date to put into the Regulations than the date put in by the Minister. I think it also important that the words "reasonably comparable" should be in Regulations dealing with employment given in exchange for another job rather than the words "suitable employment." A man

might get some alternative suitable employment, but it would not be reasonably comparable with the kind of job he had under the Transport Commission. That point ought to be covered. There should be no doubt about the justice of the way in which the Regulations are drafted.<br/>
I want to stress, most particularly from the point of view of the road haulage men, the necessity for reducing the qualifying period of eight years of employment. The effect of this provision will be that most of the road transport men&#x2014;lorry drivers and so on&#x2014;will be cut out of compensation. I do not know whether that is the intention, but that is what will happen. I would press the Minister very strongly to accept the suggestion put to him by the trade unions concerned that the period should be about three years rather than eight. In so doing he would give the road haulage men, who I anticipate will be much more affected by this than most of the railwaymen, a much fairer chance of getting compensation if&#x2014;as some of us fear will happen&#x2014;they are thrown out of employment or suffer serious loss or diminution of earnings.<br/>
I want also to refer to the Second Schedule, over which the Minister took some trouble. Paragraph 5 deals with the loss or diminution of pension rights. I defy anyone who is not a lawyer to understand it and I doubt whether many lawyers could understand this paragraph. I have read paragraph 16 and find a full stop at the end of the fifth line and then 10 lines without a full stop. It is extremely difficult to understand, except the old phrase which some of us are so used to in negotiations with Government Departments, "whichever shall be the less." Whatever happens, at the end of the sentence&#x2014;if we understand it&#x2014;it is that the lesser of the two payments will be made, if any.<br/>
Paragraph 17 is even worse. I have tried to understand it, because the Minister referred to it. It is a paragraph which, apparently, gives some compensation in cases where men lose pension rights because of a change of employment arising out of the de-nationalisation of road transport. It consists of 15 lines before one comes to a full stop and it is quite impossible for most people to understand. In the course of a long trade union experience, on many occasions I have, as a lay lawyer, tried to interpret the meaning


of such paragraphs as this, but this one has beaten me. If a road transport worker or a railway worker has this presented to him and is told, "This is what you are entitled to if your pension rights are interfered with," I cannot see how on earth he will understand it.<br/>
I should like the Minister to deal with this matter. It seems that even the parts which, on the explanation of the Minister, appear to give compensation are limited by an earlier provision which limits the amount of compensation persons may get to one-sixtieth of current annual emoluments. If a man who has long service gets reasonably large compensation on the one-sixtieth basis, is he to get compensation for loss of pension rights in addition, or is it limited by the amount covered by that paragraph? As I understood what the Minister said, he is subject to the maximum. It seems to me, therefore, that this paragraph really does very little for the man concerned. If these Regulations are to be issued, I plead that they should in some way be rewritten in plain simple English which the average man in the transport industry can properly understand, and that there shall be a careful and simple explanation of them.<br/>
My only other point is that if these Regulations go through tonight, as I fear they will, it is absolutely essential that there should be a spirit of willingness to give the men the benefit of the doubt, where there is any doubt, when these Regulations are applied. I have considerable experience of the compensation Regulations under the Electricity Act. I know that under these, where there is some doubt, unless the benefit of it is given to the workman, the workman suffers nine times out of ten and has a grievance, and there is trouble as a result. I suggest that if the Minister gets these Regulations approved and wants to make them work, he must give instructions that they must be worked reasonably and with sympathy, and that where there is any doubt, the workman should be given the benefit of the doubt.</p>

<p>The Minister recognises that the denationalisation of road transport must create disturbance and loss of employment. That is the reason for the introduction of these Regulations. Some of us have a vivid memory of what

happened when there was a big merger of 120 different railway companies into the four main-line companies. The compensation provisions were quite ineffective, and I could not find anyone who got compensation under those previous Regulations. I knew many thousands of railway men who were displaced or who lost their grade position and lost a great deal of money over many years. We are afraid that we shall have a repetition of that position when these Regulations are brought into force.<br/>
Once the Act is put into operation, the Minister cannot say how many railway-men will be displaced consequent upon the competition which the railways will receive from road competition on certain stretches. He cannot tell us how many railwaymen will lose their grade position or their wages. I am sure that the denationalisation of road transport will cause great upheaval among railway and road transport workers. After the sale of the road haulage units, are workers expected to move about the country to keep their employment? I wish the Minister to deal with that point&#x2014;are they expected willy-nilly to move about the country in order to keep their jobs?<br/>
Road haulage depots have been built up; they have been strategically sited to meet the needs of road traffic movements about the country. These vehicles are now to be brought up and operated, not to meet the geographical needs of the country. Hosts of other reasons will be brought into the reckoning&#x2014;where the private operator lives and where he has been accustomed to having his business; and&#x2014;of a certainty&#x2014;these units which will operate will be much smaller than those built up by the Road Haulage Executive. The smaller owner will have his own employees; possibly he will be buying the vehicles because he needs new ones, and possibly he will prefer to recruit his workers from his own area.<br/>
That is the position as I see it. If transport workers are asked to move their homes for hundreds of miles in order to keep their jobs, and do not do so, will they come under the compensation Regulations? They may not be able to do so because the move would result in worse conditions of employment, possibly less wages; or it may be because there would be difficulty in securing a home in the new area. It may be that an operator


would be asked to remove to Scotland, and I imagine that that would be a blow to some Englishmen. It might possibly be an even greater blow to a Scotsman to be asked to come, say, from Glasgow to the outskirts of London in order to retain his job.<br/>
I cannot imagine local authorities putting a clause in their housing allocation schemes to provide accommodation for transport workers in order to help this Government who have displaced those workers. I asked about this matter on Committee stage and the Minister promised a reply, but he forgot to make it on that occasion. I appreciate of course that he had then many other matters to deal with, but I would ask him to deal with this question tonight. The people we are discussing have given their lives to the industry. They have built it up and are the very timber of it. We want something much better than these Regulations as a protective measure for them, and if the Minister cannot provide it I for one will have much pleasure in voting against them.</p>

<p>In pressing the Minister to withdraw these Regulations for further amendment I am not unmindful nor unappreciative of the agreements he has already reached in conversations with the trade unions and other interested parties. I have no doubt the Minister fully understands the position, although he is not prepared to concede all our points of view.<br/>
British transport has a long and chequered history. Three major Acts of Parliament have had a great influence upon the well-being of employees and the transport services of this country; the Railways Act of 1921, and the Transport Acts of 1947 and 1953. It is perfectly true that those three Acts have several analogies. They have features in common, which my right hon. Friend the Member for Lewisham, South (Mr. H. Morrison) and the Minister were perfectly right to quote in support of their arguments. But I would remind hon. Gentlemen opposite that there is a fundamental difference between the Act of 1953 and the other two Acts to which I have referred. The 1921 Act and the 1947 Act aimed at integrating not only the

transport services but the staff organisation. It was an attempt to set up a cohesive body administering the transport affairs of Great Britain, and I fear that the people who were responsible for that re-organisation have not been given the credit that was due to them.<br/>
The first thing that the Minister said today was that he took pride in the fact that he had been able to introduce the Regulations within three months of the passing of the Act and that the Labour Government took 11 months to introduce Regulations for the railways and three years to introduce Regulations for the Road Haulage Executive. He compels me to remind him of the chaos out of which we had to evolve order. Does he not realise that when we took over there were nearly 3,700 different transport concerns in the country and that the overwhelming majority of them had no trade union conditions?<br/>
Does he not realise that the first thing we had to do was to clear the Augean stables and set the house in order to encourage men and women to remain in the industry under decent and proper conditions? It was a great administrative achievement on the part of the Road Haulage Executive to get that house in order in such a short time, and to be able to introduce Regulations governing such things as compensation really adds to their credit.<br/>
On the question of compensation there are two or three broad principles of which I should like to remind the House. The first is that when we acquired these private concerns to merge them into a public service the public had to pay compensation. Now that the right hon. Gentleman is handing over to private concerns this great public asset, the public have to pay compensation. The public have to pay on every occasion. I invite the right hon. Gentleman to reply to the direct question put by my right hon. Friend the Member for Lewisham, South: if he is going to let the Road Haulage Association take over these public assets, is it not fair to ask them to accept the liabilities as well? It is because the right hon. Gentleman has not done that that we have so much cause for complaint.<br/>
I am astonished that the right hon. Gentleman should quote the company which he mentioned on the question of


hardship of compensation. I should not like to try to adjudicate between him and my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, South-East (Mr. Callaghan). I will not do so now but will content myself with quoting the actual facts from HANSARD. My hon. Friend asked the Minister of Transport what was the total amount of compensation paid by the British Transport Commission for the acquisition of Hurst and Payne Limited and its allied company. The answer on 1st August, 1952, was &#x00A3;200,840. But what are the facts governing that situation? Mr. Hurst
<q>&#x2026; was employed as managing director at a salary of &#x00A3;3,000 a year with an annual commission of &#x00A3;1,000; making &#x00A3;4,000 altogether. He had other advantages such as an entertainment allowance and the use of a car."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 25th July, 1952; Vol. 504, c. 1052.]</q>
On nationalisation, when the Road Haulage Executive examined the position they said to Mr. Hurst, "Why, you can have a job as group manager"&#x2014;and to his credit he accepted it&#x2014;" but that job is not worth more than &#x00A3;1,200 per annum."<br/>
It surprises me that people have not noticed that while as a rule the Government are accused of paying extravagant salaries and paying very much more than the business world, here we have a competent Government Department like the Road Haulage Executive telling a man frankly that the job is not worth more than &#x00A3;1,200, although previously he was getting &#x00A3;3,000 a year, &#x00A3;1,000 commission, and an entertainment allowance and the use of a car. He must have thought that the Road Haulage Executive was speaking the truth and he was glad to accept the position. The extravagance is not on the part of the Labour Government but on the part of the Government represented by the Minister in this debate tonight. To quote that as a case of hardship is to introduce a tone of irony into the matter which surprises me very much indeed.<br/>
The hon. and gallant Member for Buckingham (Sir F. Markham), who has retired from the scene for a few minutes, welcomed these Regulations because he said it was the first time the House had been given an opportunity of approving such regulations. Of course, it is the first time. It could not have happened unless the Government decided to denationalise the Post Office or the Civil

Service. It is the first time that such a situation has arisen, and it is because the matter has not been dealt with adequately that we are asking the Minister tonight to withdraw these Regulations and amend them still further.<br/>
May I emphasise the first point made by the Deputy-Leader of the Opposition tonight when he asked for an interpretation of a point in a letter sent by the Road Haulage Executive to the General Secretary of the trade union. It was the point where they say:
<q>.. in view of the current uncertainties and in order to avoid increasing the problem of grade redundancy that might well become serious in the event of a rapid run-down of the organisation &#x2026; we are arranging that any promotions or upgradings should be made on an acting higher grade duty basis.</q>
We want the right hon. Gentleman to tell us frankly, if and when some of these men who are serving on an acting higher grade basis are entitled to compensation, the amount will be arrived at by taking the whole of the figure into consideration.<br/>
Some people say that the point is quite clear, but I am disturbed by a phrase which says that other payments which do not reflect a permanent state of affairs will not be calculated. It is obvious that a man acting on a temporary basis is not engaged in a permanent state of affairs. But it would be manifestly unfair to give him lower compensation because he had had to accept the post on an acting basis in view of the state of flux through which the industry is passing just now. I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will give us his personal view on this matter.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman seemed to be proud of the fact that he was making the qualifying date for compensation 31st December, 1951. I repeat the request that it should be 1st May, 1952. The argument of the right hon. Gentleman is that in the debate on the Loyal Address the policy of the Government was made known. Our reply to that statement is that the White Paper was not issued until 1st May, 1952. I would add that anybody reading that White Paper is unable to find a single reference to the conditions of the staff.<br/>
It was only as a result of a debate in this House, when we exposed the perils to which the operational and administrative staff were being exposed, that the right hon. Gentleman said that he would put that right in the second Bill that


would be brought forward. It is manifestly unfair to take 31st December, 1951, as the qualifying date. Why does the right hon. Gentleman worry about it? Surely the difference between 31st December, 1951, and 1st May, 1952, cannot mean very much to him. If his confidence in the Levy is fully justified, the money will be available and the men to whom we are doing an injustice unless we accept the second date will have their injustice set right.<br/>
No reference has been made tonight to the question of the appeals procedure. I know the right hon. Gentleman will say that that is not a matter for him but for the Ministry of Labour. That is true, but we want to hear something from him in the matter. This is his Act, and these compensation Clauses are his responsibility. We want to know in what strain he has been talking to the Minister of Labour about this Question. Does he agree that we have a case in the matter?<br/>
The House should be informed of the difficulties. In the case of appeals, the only possibility is to apply to the High Court for a writ of <i>certiorari</i>. That cumbrous and expensive machinery is the only way of appealing. No appeal is possible when a tribunal decide on a point of fact, or even on a point of law, unless the tribunal state their reasons, and no obligation rests upon them to state any reason for their decision. We have had a very unhappy experience in many cases because of the present unsatisfactory appeals machinery.<br/>
It has been suggested that this machinery requires revising, not only in respect of the transport industry but of every other industry, but our problem tonight concerns the men and women who are engaged in the transport industry. We want the Minister to commit himself definitely and tell us precisely what are his views about this matter, and what representations he has made to the Minister of Labour, who was here a moment or two ago and whom I was hoping would hear our views on this matter.<br/>
There is some query as to the period with regard to resettlement payment. We say that it should be a minimum of 52 weeks, unless the person concerned finds suitable employment. The Regulations we are discussing are quite inevitably

expressed in cold, formal and legal terms, but, as some of my hon. Friends have reminded us tonight, they are of vital concern to the men and women who have spent their lifetime in this industry. I suggest that even the men and women who were engaged in the private sector before nationalisation, have devoted nearly the whole of their time and talent to transport, and are now being compelled to seek other employment, should be given a longer period than the Minister suggests, to try to adjust themselves to their new circumstances.<br/>
This is a deliberate act on the part of the Tory Party, and they ought to put up with the consequences and provide for the displaced men and women. I have asked on previous occasions for evidence that the compensation proposals in respect of the various features which I have mentioned are satisfactory to the people concerned. If we can find &#x00A3;2,080 for a small firm of approximately two directors, there should be no quibbling about giving the men and women 52 weeks in which to resettle. There ought not to be any ambiguity as between 31st December, 1951, and 1st May, 1952. There must be no ambiguity, either, in respect of the men who are qualifying for compensation and the conditions under which they qualify.<br/>
If I were to reflect upon the experience of the last 32 years, I would say that even the Railways Act of 1921 and the Transport Act of 1947 made better provision for these people than does the Act of 1953. In the 1947 Act a dual task was performed. Order was evolved out of chaos, and a transport service was established which met the needs of the public far and wide. Men and women who had been employed under the most shocking conditions were given proper salaries, proper sick pay, entrance into a superannuation scheme, and holidays each year.<br/>
All this has been done since 1945, and now these public assets are being handed over to the private investors. The Tory Party gave a pledge to the Road Haulage Association, at every level early in the October before the General Election. Nobody has denied that. The Chairman of that Association said that the Opposition&#x2014;referring to the Tory Pary of the time&#x2014;had promised them, at every level, that if they got into power they would


denationalise transport. We are asking for a <i>quid pro quo</i>. If they were ever promised that, the Minister is entitled to say to them, "Now that these men are leaving the security of employment, where their conditions were infinitely better than they ever had before, and now that they are going into your service, what are you prepared to do to lend a helping hand?"<br/>
Is it beneath the dignity of the right hon. Gentleman to ask members of the Road Haulage Association to give these men a trade union salary and to give them proper provisions for superannuation? Could he not say that they should maintain arrangements in respect of sick pay and annual holidays? Could he not say, "Do what you can to give them a ladder of promotion. They had this under public employment. You must see that these men are given good conditions which are worth having and which will encourage them to remain in your employ"?<br/>
The Road Haulage Association have been very successful in lobbying Her Majesty's Government in their actions. We want the Minister to be equally successful and, if I may say so, equally persistent in his efforts to lobby them to give those employees, north, south, east and west, the conditions which are their due. I do not want to introduce anything of an intimidating nature into the debate. The country has decided that for the time being the Tory Party should rule. I warn the Tory Party that these acts of sabotage in respect of industrial conditions will have their repercussions. If we were more concerned with political prestige than with the rights due to men and women we would not oppose these Regulations but would let the Government carry on and give them enough rope to hang themselves. But we are not sacrificing principle to expediency. We are really worried and concerned about the well-being of these men in the industry.<br/>
We therefore ask the Minister to take these Regulations back and amend them in the way we have suggested. It will cost him nothing at all because he can get the money out of the Levy. The Road Haulage Association should be grateful to him and should pay up cheerfully. For those reasons, I support my

right hon. Friend the Member for Lewisham, South and ask the House, if the Minister does not meet us reasonably tonight, to reject these Regulations so that he can start all over again.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Carlisle (Mr. Hargreaves) said that he hoped I was conscious of the uncertainties in which many people find themselves as a result of Government legislation. This is almost inherent in Government legislation and we all regret it, whatever the cause may be. Most changes are unwelcome to all of us, and I have noticed that frequently to be the case in practice with the Socialist Party, certainly much more frequently than many of their spokesmen would suggest. Most people dislike changes even if, in their heart of hearts, they know that the result of the change in the long run may be for the better.<br/>
It is, as I have said, our hope that there will be a very smooth transition in that part of the road haulage business which is to pass from the public into the private sector. I very much hope, and I take it that hon. Members on both sides of the House equally hope, that the number of people who will be obliged to take advantage of these Regulations will be very small indeed. We all hope that.<br/>
The concluding speech of the hon. Member for Swansea, West (Mr. P. Morris) was couched in vigorous language and inspired by the knowledge, of which he is undoubtedly an expert, of the background of these Regulations. It is quite true that I did not consider&#x2014;and I repeat that I was right not to consider&#x2014;that it was part of my proper province to consult the Road Haulage Association on the precise terms of the compensation to be paid by the British Transport Commission to those who lost their employment, but I lose no opportunity of urging on all those engaged in the road haulage business, and particularly those who will have renewed and greater opportunities in the future as a result of the Government's Act, their obligation to keep the standards and conditions of employment as high as possible and to make the indifferent employer look to the good employer so as to raise his standards to those of the good employer. I have no doubt whatever that in this


business there will be improvements all along the line, although I would repudiate completely the oft-repeated assertion&#x2014;repeated without any justification&#x2014;that there were scarcely any good employers in the road haulage business.<br/>
The hon. Member for Swansea, West made a number of points, most of which, I think, had been made by previous speakers, and I shall take them up as I go along and deal with the various observations that have been made, but there are two points on which I should put the hon. Gentleman right. He said it was the case that the public always paid. In the sense that the users of transport in the long run have got to pay for the cost of transport, of course that is true, whatever the policy may be; but he said that the public paid compensation when the private industry was taken over and now the public are going to pay again.<br/>
Of course, the truth of the matter is that, though the British Transport Commission are the compensating authority under these Regulations, the cost of compensation of the road haulage employees will be borne out of the levy, and so it will in fact be borne by the very people who, the hon. Gentleman said, ought to bear it, the new owners and the owners of the road haulage industry, and by those other operators of transport, the C licensees, who are going to find as a result of the better service to be available that their opportunities of service will be better looked after than before.<br/>
There is one other point the hon. Gentleman made which, I think, ought to be picked up. He dealt with the question of appeals, and no one else, I think, referred to that. I did myself in my opening speech refer to appeals but not to this particular aspect. When the trade unions spoke to me about their dissatisfaction with certain aspects of the appeals procedure, I pointed out to them that under Section 28 (3) of the Transport Act, just like Section 101 (3) of the Socialist Government's Act, the appeals under these Regulations are to go to the appeals tribunal set up by the Minister of Labour and if they did not think that the appeals machinery was working smoothly they should realise, as indeed they freely did, that the procedure of this tribunal covered many subjects quite

apart from transport, and only the Minister of Labour could properly deal with this issue.<br/>
Then they said to me, "Will you represent to the Minister that we are disturbed about it in this and other fields?" I said that I would certainly point out to the Minister of Labour that the trade unions had doubts on this matter, and we did so inform him, and that is now, I understand, the subject of direct communication between the Trades Union Congress and the Ministry of Labour.</p>

<p>The right hon. Gentleman has missed the point I was making. He has just recited that he has conveyed to the Minister of Labour what the trade unions thought about the matter. I am asking the right hon. Gentleman what he thinks about the matter. Does he agree, and is he prepared to support us in our representations? I am not imputing to him any failure to report what he said he would to the Minister of Labour, but will he support us in our representations? The new procedure is unsatisfactory. Does he agree?</p>

<p>As I say, it is now under direct discussion between the Minister of Labour and the trade unions, and I think we had better see what emerges from those discussions. It is the appeals machinery in the Socialist Act of 1947 that is causing the trade unions a certain amount of anxiety.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman the Member for Clapham (Mr. Gibson) asked whether these Regulations could be rewritten in simpler English. The right hon. Gentleman the Member for Lewisham, South (Mr. H. Morrison) quoted one passage of the Regulations which, I recognise, is in rather elaborate prose. It would be possible, if I had time, to take Statutory Instrument 1083 of 1950 for which his Government were responsible, which dealt with the same subject, and find a great many phrases in it that one would require to sit quietly by oneself wholly to elucidate on first reading. But let me point out to him that if his Government's Regulations were couched in simpler English, in the upshot they did not give anybody long-term compensation, and surely it is better that the Regulations should be complicated and do justice than be simple and prevent justice from being done?</p>

<p>All that happened under the 1947 Act was that a few employers lost their businesses without in fact losing their livelihood, but these people are losing their livelihood, and there is a difference between the two.</p>

<p>I cannot accept that explanation of the difference, but I hope to deal with one or two points to show that we are really looking after people who may lose certain rights.<br/>
The hon. Member for Clapham referred also to paragraph 16 in the Second Schedule, and he said he could not make out what it meant. It is perfectly plain. It deals with the point which I made earlier about the continuation of pension rights under the separate Regulations which I am going to introduce, I hope, during the Recess.<br/>
Under Section 27 of the Act we shall preserve the pension rights by service up to the date of loss. One hon. Member, in an interruption, quoted the case of a man aged 50 years who had 30 years' service. We would preserve his pension rights to that extent now under the Regulations to be issued under Section 27, but by the compensation to which I drew attention today we would increase his pension rights by the pension that he would have earned if he had done 40 years' service, that is, by one added year for each year of service after 40, so that he would not be at a disadvantage even if he was in no position to continue to make his payments as a contributor under the British Transport Commission.<br/>
I think that a trade unionist would prefer to have a complicated Clause and be all right than to have a simple Clause that gave him nothing at all. The right hon. Member for Lewisham, South, in his wide-ranging speech, raised almost every other issue which has been raised tonight. May I say that perhaps his juggling with figures this afternoon would manifestly qualify him to any treasurership which might ever be available, even if some of the wild language which he used about the matter was not designed to facilitate that very end.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman asked about the people who are employed now on a temporary basis. He asked whether they are going to get compensation on their temporary pay or only on their substantive pay. The answer is that compensation is based on the annual rate of

earnings at the time of the loss, and whether these are acting earnings or permanent earnings does not affect the issue. I draw attention to page 1 of this Statutory Instrument which sets out the definition of "current net emoluments." The next point which the right hon. Gentleman raised was the question of the qualifying period.</p>

<p>I have only six minutes and there are other questions I should like to answer.<br/>
The hon. Members for Swansea, West, Clapham and The Hartlepools (Mr. D. Jones) all dealt with this point. The hon. Member for The Hartlepools got very impassioned about my failure to date from the White Paper and my insistence that we ought to date from December, 1951. Then he proceeded to quote from a letter which, if I understood him correctly, came from somebody who would appear to have 30 years' service and therefore would qualify three times over; but I am not claiming that that gentleman is so qualified, because I do not want to take up the functions of the compensation authority. The quotation he gave of the actual instance&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>

<p>The right hon. Gentleman's charge was that the Home Secretary on 12th November did in fact set out the Government's policy. I proved by quoting the Home Secretary's speech that he did nothing of the kind. In fact the right hon.

<p>I cannot give way to the hon. Gentleman. I felt it right to give way to the hon. Member for The Hartlepools because I referred to a letter which he quoted. In my last five minutes I must deal with other points which have been raised.<br/>
I shall not again go over the qualifying period, the long-term compensation and the other issues with which I dealt fully in my opening speech, but as a number of hon. Members have spoken about "suitable employment" and


showed that they have confused it with "comparable employment," I wish to make a few observations about it.<br/>
If hon. Gentlemen opposite will look at page 7 of their own Regulations of 1950 they will find "suitable employment" used on the two relevant occasions. There has been some confusion about this. A man can be refused compensation because he does not take up "suitable employment." I defend the use of those words because they occur in the 1950 Regulations and in the 1946 National Insurance Act of the Socialist Government, and the phrase is common form. But if the man accepts "suitable employment" which is not "comparable employment," he gets compensation for the difference between the new job which is not comparable and his previous job.<br/>
I think hon. Members slightly confused the phrases "suitable employment" and "comparable employment." In Section 5 of the National Insurance Act, 1946, it is expressly provided that the phrase "suitable employment" and the whole section should not be rigorously interpreted in the period immediately after the loss of employment. If there are any further worries about that matter, I will gladly discuss them with hon. Gentlemen on any suitable occasion, publicly or privately, but I do not believe that their fears are justifiable.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham (Sir F. Mark-ham) asked me a very important question about National Service. He wanted to know if it is clear that, when a man's appointment with the Road Haulage Executive is interrupted by military service, the military service ranks as continuing service with the Road Haulage Executive. I can give an absolutely definite "yes" to that. Service with the Road Haulage Executive and service with the State as a National Service man constitute continuous employment.<br/>
The hon. Member for Bermondsey (Mr. Mellish) raised a very important point. He said it would be very galling for road haulage drivers now leaving the

employment of the Road Haulage Executive to find that there will shortly be a pension scheme for the Executive's employees. I ask him to ponder upon the consequence of that observation if there is soon to be&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>

<p>That is not what I said. I said that a pension scheme for Road Haulage Executive employees was being negotiated and if it had not been deferred because of the introduction of the Bill, drivers now leaving would be in a pension scheme.

<p>That is exactly what I was saying. The hon.

But has the hon. Gentleman not realised that there would not have been a pension scheme at all but for the efforts not only of the British Transport Commission and the trade unions but of Her Majesty's Government? After the short period that this Government has been in office, we are entitled to claim very considerable credit by reason of the fact that a problem which baffled our predecessors looks as if it is in process of being solved. After this full discussion, I hope the House will approve the Regulations by the large majority which they deserve.</p>

<p>I do not think there is any quarrel with the purpose of the Order, but we should have some explanation from the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in view of the circumstances out of which it arises. The purpose is to give the employees of the International Wheat Council exemption from Income Tax, but what puzzles some of us is why this step should be taken now.<br/>
Although it is said in the Order that the United Kingdom is a member of the International Wheat Council, we cease to be a member at the end of this week. The future of the Council is in some doubt, because Australia and France have not ratified and, apparently, it is not known what their action will be until the meeting in Madrid. I much regret the sorry pass into which the International Wheat Council has fallen, but this is not the appropriate occasion to debate that. It is, however, an occasion when we should have an explanation from the Government of why the Order has been laid, in view of the uncertainty as to the future of the International Wheat Council.</p>

<p>I want to ask a similar point as to why the Order should apply if after the end of this week the United Kingdom is withdrawing from the International Wheat Council. The Explanatory Note says that the Council has its headquarters in London. Is it to continue to keep its headquarters in London? Can my hon. Friend the Joint Under-Secretary give some information on that point?</p>

<p>I am always critical of diplomatic exemptions. Paragraph 2, on the back of the Order, says:

<q>All employees of the Council, except citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies, shall enjoy exemption from income tax in respect of emoluments received by them as officers or servants of the Council as from the twelfth day of July, 1950.</q>
The Council, apparently, sits in London. Therefore, presumably, the people are paid in sterling. They are not, as I understand it, servants of their own Governments; they are not ordinary diplomatic persons. If they are foreigners, they pay no taxation. If they are British, they will pay taxation.<br/>
Imagine the case of two people of the same status, in receipt of the same gross salary, one an American or Frenchman or Australian or anything else, and sitting in adjoining rooms. One may have two or three times as much spending power as the other. Are these people who are not
<q>citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies</q>
liable to pay taxation in their own countries in respect of an income paid to them in this country by an international organisation which has its headquarters here?<br/>
It seems to me a very strange state of affairs. They are not in the position of Ambassadors. An Ambassador, even though he is accredited to the Court of St. James, is theoretically living in his own country. But these people to whom the Order relates are not of the status of Ambassadors and are, apparently, to be free of all taxation here. Will they be free of taxation in their own country?</p>

<p>I will certainly do my best to enlighten the House on the points which have been raised and to give a general explanation of this Order. I was asked by the hon. Member for Sunderland, North (Mr. F. Willey) why we had introduced the Order now. Of course, neither Her Majesty's present Government nor the late Government have an entirely clear conscience on this subject. Both had considerable periods of time in which the Order could have been produced.<br/>
As far as Her Majesty's Government and my responsibility are concerned in the matter the answer is that we hoped to be able to bring forward a number of Orders relating to international organisations. As the hon. Member knows there


is one relating to the Universal Postal Union, another relating to the World Health Organisation, another to the International Telecommunications Union, another to N.A.T.O. and other organisations. We had hoped to bring them all together in order to save Parliamentary time and to have a discussion on the whole subject. That has not been possible because those Orders are not ready and, as I shall explain, we are obliged to introduce this Order whilst we are still a member of the International Wheat Council, therefore, before 31st July when our membership ceases.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, North (Mr. F. Harris) asked whether the headquarters of this organisation are likely to remain in London. I cannot give him a definite answer on that. We shall not be members of the International Wheat Council as from 31st July, when our membership lapses, and it will be for the International Wheat Council to decide where its headquarters shall be. No question of diplomatic immunities privileges can arise as far as this country is concerned. We shall not be obliged to grant any immunities or privileges after we cease to be a member whether or not the headquarters of the Council remain in London.<br/>
The general explanation of the Order is briefly this. On 27th June, 1949, the late Government ratified the International Wheat Agreement, which had been signed in Washington in March of that year, and under Article XVII (7) of the Agreement the Government accepted an obligation to grant exemption from tax on salaries paid to the staff of the Council if the seat of the Council should be established in this country. This exemption was not mandatory in the case of nationals of the country where the Council was set up, that is, in the case of nationals of this country. Since it came into being in 1949 the seat has been in London and, therefore, the obligation to grant exemption has fallen on Her Majesty's Government. The purpose of this Order is to carry out that obligation.<br/>
The draft Order is to be made under the International Organisations (Immunities and Privileges) Act, 1950. This Act provides, as the House is aware, in Section 1, subsection (1) that it may only be applied in the case of organisations of which this country is actually a member.

Since we cease to be a member of the International Wheat Council on 31st July, when the present Agreement expires, this Order must be made before that date. If it were not there would be no power to make it thereafter.<br/>
I am well aware that no diplomatic immunities Orders are ever popular on either side of the House, or for that matter, in another place, but I hasten to reassure my hon. Friends and hon. Members opposite that the practical implication of this Order is in fact very modest. The International Wheat Council employ what I think can be described as a very small staff. There are at present 17 members in this country, of whom 14 are citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies and, therefore, untouched by this Order. Since the Wheat Agreement places no obligation on Her Majesty's Government to exempt their own citizens from tax and since the Act of 1950 specifically debars United Kingdom citizens from being given exemption, unless the agreement requires it, the Order only applies to Commonwealth and foreign members of the Council's staff. But there are only three such people at present employed on the staff. One is an American national paid by the United States Government, and not by the Wheat Council. He is exempt from paying United Kingdom Income Tax by Section 462 of the Income Tax Act, 1952.<br/>
Thus in effect the Order applies only to two present employees of the Council. Of the former Commonwealth and foreign employees only one is still resident in the United Kingdom. Therefore, in practice, this Order will benefit only three persons, two present employees and one past employee of the Council. I was asked by my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, East (Sir H. Williams) about the position of foreigners and Commonwealth citizens who enjoy exemption under this Order, and whether they pay Income Tax on salaries in their own countries. I cannot answer for the Income Tax law of other countries. That is a matter for those other countries. Be they Commonwealth or foreign, this Order in no way exempts any Commonwealth or foreign citizen who is or was a member of the International Wheat Council staff from paying Income Tax in his own country. It applies only so far as United Kingdom Income Tax is concerned.<br/>
I cannot say exactly what the concession will cost the Exchequer&#x2014;only a few hundred pounds, certainly less than &#x00A3;1,000. The important point, however, is that by not making the Order Her Majesty's Government would be in breach of an international obligation under the International Wheat Agreement. This is a matter of principle, and whatever the size of the sum involved, this Order is necessary to discharge our international obligations. I hope that, with this explanation, the House will approve the Order.</p>

<p>I beg to move,
<q>That an humble Address be presented to Her Majesty, praying that the Training of Teachers (Scotland) (Amendment No. 7) Regulations, 1953 (S.I., 1953, No. 1121), dated 21st July, 1953, a copy of which was laid before this House on 22nd July, be annulled.</q>
In the debate on the Estimates in the Scottish Grand Committee I and some of my hon. Friends asked the Secretary of State to withdraw the draft Regulations on the training of teachers. Since that time opposition has poured into his Department from many educational bodies in Scotland. But in spite of the representations that were strongly made in the Scottish Grand Committee, and in spite of these very strong representations that have since come to the Secretary of State, he has decided to present these Regulations to the House, Regulations which lower the standards and qualifications of persons who desire to enter the training colleges. It is true that the representations have had little effect. The Secretary of State has now decided that one of the subjects to be passed on the higher standard must be English. That is an improvement.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman has also decided that these Regulations should apply only to women entrants. Originally they applied to some categories of men entrants. This again shows very clearly that the representations have had some effect. But the Regulations and what they contain are still a great danger to our country. The present position is that anyone wishing to enter a training college must have passed in two subjects on the higher standard and three subjects on the lower standard. These Regulations make it possible for a young woman to enter the training college with one pass on the higher grade, which must be English, and three on the lower, or two on the higher and two on the lower.<br/>
For a very long time in Scotland it has been the considered opinion of those interested in education that the present qualifications for non-graduate women are too low. The policy, particularly of the Educational Institute of Scotland has been graduation for every woman in the profession. These low qualifications the


Secretary of State is now making even lower. The Joint Under-Secretary of State who is responsible for the Department of Education has had a Press conference in the last few days. I am not sure whether he has had two Press conferences&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>

<p>On Friday there was in the "Glasgow Herald" a statement he made about these Regulations, and in the "Glasgow Herald" of Saturday the statement he made about the new bursary Regulations. In the case of each of these it seems that some members of the Press asked him how those things included in the Regulations compared with the position in England. On Friday we find that he says:
<q>I admit that our standards"&#x2014;</q>
that is the standards asked of Scottish students&#x2014;
<q>have hitherto been higher. The English will now be able to claim that in this narrow respect they are no worse than we are.</q>
On Saturday, when he was dealing with the bursary Regulations he said,
<q>Why should we have to drag ourselves at England's coat tails? We have our own traditions and surroundings and we think that within the Scottish conditions these are pretty adequate bursaries.</q>
There are two very different statements&#x2014;one saying that these Regulations for entrants to training colleges bring us side by side with England and the other saying "Why should we drag behind England?" I would say that in the Regulations we are discussing tonight we are following England in a way that Scotsmen would not wish to do.</p>

<p>May I correct the hon. Member? Actually the position in England is that their Regulations provide that the earlier training organisations, which correspond to our training authority, may at their discretion accept a person whose passes do not strictly fulfil the requirements of the Regulations, provided he or she is deemed likely to become a good teacher. That is all we are suggesting should be done here.</p>

<p>I am making no complaint that that is the position in England. I have known that for a long time. I am complaining of the fact that the Joint

Under-Secretary wishes to hide behind England when it suits him and does not want to follow England when it does not suit him. That is the whole gravamen of my complaint. I would say indeed that these two statements of the Joint Under-Secretary show great vacillation on his part and are an excellent example of opportunism. I would say how typical this is of those who at present are responsible in this House for the well-being of Scotland.<br/>
What do hon. Members opposite know about the Scottish educational system? From my inquiries, I would say precious little. The hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Sir W. Darling), who I see about to interrupt, is among the nine Scottish Members on the Government side who were educated wholly in Scotland. Out of the 35 Scottish Members on the Government side, 21 were educated wholly in England. I find that four of them began their education in Scotland, but their parents did not seem to think it was good enough and they finished it across the border. Only nine of them had the whole of their education in Scotland.<br/>
Where are the children of hon. Members opposite being educated at present? Are their children being educated in our primary schools in Scotland? I should be surprised indeed if that applied to many, if any, children of hon. Members opposite. What moral right have they to try to foist on our children in the primary schools teachers with qualifications lower than those for which they would ask in teachers for their own children?</p>

<p>I am sorry; I cannot give way. There are many who wish to speak and I must finish soon. I have been very good at giving way, and perhaps if the hon. Gentleman catches Mr. Deputy-Speaker's eye he will be able to make his point later.<br/>
When we were responsible for education in Scotland we were faced with exactly the same problem, but we tackled it in a very different way from the way in which the present Government are tackling it. We introduced a special recruitment scheme for teachers which required the normal qualifications from those wishing to enter the profession. In


a little over two years that special recruitment scheme has brought in 1,069 recruits, of whom only 50 per cent. will be graduate teachers when their training is finished. Would it not have been much better for the Secretary of State and his Department to have tried to improve on that scheme, to have made that scheme more attractive and by so doing bring in more teachers while in no way lowering the qualifications asked for? If that is what they are doing, why this unseemly rush to lower the qualifications?<br/>
Perhaps in reply the Joint Under-Secretary will be able to tell me whether these figures are correct. He was reported as saying that in five years' time this lowering of the qualifications will produce 400 extra teachers for Scotland. I would say that was perhaps the maximum. It may even be fewer than 400 with the lower qualifications. Is he quite certain that as against that, at the most, 400, he will not lose many honours graduate teachers from the profession?<br/>
At present we are having the greatest difficulty in attracting teachers for mathematics and science. I pointed out in a previous debate that in almost every other profession in the country the qualifications are being raised. Qualifications required of doctors, dentists and other professional men and women are being raised and by so doing the status of those professions is being raised. By lowering the qualifications for teachers we shall obtain 400 non-graduate teachers in a little less than five years' time, possibly at the expense of honours graduates of whom we are very short indeed in the teaching of certain subjects<br/>
We on this side of the House are not the only people who oppose these Regulations. As the Joint Under-Secretary of State knows full well, many local authorities oppose them. The biggest two in Scotland, Glasgow and Lanarkshire, have protested to the Secretary of State.</p>

<p>I am coming to those reactionary local authorities who are ready to accept anything at all.<br/>
Glasgow and Lanarkshire are joined by Aberdeen, which has always been famous for its interest in education, and

by Dumfries, Kincardine and Renfrewshire. They are all completely opposed to these new Regulations. As the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Sir W. Darling) has said, we find that Edinburgh is supporting the Regulations. One should not be surprised at anything reactionary that might come from Edinburgh City Council. Moray, Nairn and Sutherland education authorities completely oppose the Government's proposals.<br/>
It is evident that the education authorities in Scotland who are responsible for the education of the overwhelming number of Scottish children are opposed to the lowering of these entrance qualifications. The Joint Under-Secretary appears to be indicating dissent, but on examination I think it will be found that the overwhelming number of the children are under the care of local education authorities who are opposed to this scheme. The members of the local education authorities are the men and women who are on the spot and who face this problem of shortage of teachers every day. They are the men and women upon whom the Government have imposed the duty of providing facilities for education. Yet these same men and women are those who, in their wisdom, oppose the lowering of the entrance qualifications.<br/>
It is true that the National Committee support this proposal, but let us consider the views of those who are nearer the problem and those who know what qualifications should be required. There are four provincial committees on the training of teachers in Scotland. Three out of the four&#x2014;the Edinburgh, Glasgow and Aberdeen committees&#x2014;are opposed to this lowering of the entrance qualifications. I do not know whether the fourth&#x2014;Dundee&#x2014;have made any representations at all, whether they have told the Secretary of State that they support these proposals or whether they have kept silent. These men and women who are responsible for the training of teachers in Scotland realise what a retrograde step the Government are proposing. The Educational Institute of Scotland oppose this scheme completely.<br/>
Even at this late date the Joint Under-Secretary should reconsider the decision that he and his right hon. Friend have made. I should very much like to know


from where this suggestion has come. I have my own suspicions, but I should very much like to know, because it means that if these Regulations become law tonight Scotland, who was always so proud of the fact that she demanded certain qualifications, is now going to be in a position of knowing that this Government&#x2014;these Tories who are in control of us&#x2014;have as little hope of dealing with educational problems as they had when I left training college, when it was not a question of a shortage but a surplus of teachers.<br/>
At that time teachers in Glasgow were teaching anything up to 50 children in one class, and I and hundreds of other graduate and fully trained teachers were going about the streets of Scotland, idle. The Tories of that day could not or would not deal with that problem, and they are saying today that they cannot deal with the present one.<br/>
I have never made an attack without proposing some other means of meeting the shortage. I ask the Joint Under-Secretary to read&#x2014;if he has not already done so&#x2014;what I said in the Scottish Grand Committee. The problem today is a shortage of educated men and women in all professions, and we are not going to cure that shortage if we do nothing to ensure that more of our children stay at school after they are 15 years of age. I beg him to bend all his energies to getting these children to stay at school after they are 15. Then, in five years' time, he would have many more students for the teaching and other professions than he has now, and without lowering standards in any way.</p>

<p>I beg to second the Motion. In view of the fact that my hon. Friend the Member for Lanarkshire, North (Miss Herbison) has covered a great deal of the ground in her able speech, I do not propose to follow her by repeating many of the points she made. I should like, however, to put one or two points, to which the Joint Under-Secretary referred in our debate on the Scottish Estimates.<br/>
When he was speaking then he said:
<q>Supposing there is a girl who, instead of getting 51 per cent. in French, gets only 49 per cent. but, on personal examination"&#x2014;</q>

a peculiar sort of phrase&#x2014;
<q>is found to be well-qualified so far as all the attributes of teaching are concerned, the proposal is that the training authorities shall have the right to say, 'Yes, we will accept that exceptional case.'"&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, <i>Scottish Standing Committee</i>, 30th June, 1953; c. 89&#x2013;90.]</q>
There are some unusual phrases in that statement by the hon. Gentleman, but I leave them to him. I should have thought that one of the attributes of education was a cultural background.<br/>
I simply cannot imagine a teacher in the proper sense of the word who was deficient in that respect. I should apply that yardstick not merely to one particular stage of education, but to all its stages. I think that cultural background is just as necessary at the infant stage of teaching as at the secondary stage, and, furthermore, to teach the pupil at the secondary stage is no more difficult than teaching at the primary stage or the infant stage. Teaching at the secondary stage is no more difficult than it is when dealing with the younger children; and time and time again we have heard complaints from secondary schoolteachers of the weakness of the material that comes to them from the primary schools. The various stages are interdependent.<br/>
If we are, by these Regulations, to lower the cultural background of those engaged in the early stages of education, then we shall weaken performances throughout the whole school. We shall hinder the pupil at every stage, and that is one reason why it is so important that we should maintain the standard of qualification of the teachers at all stages if we wish to maintain the standard of the output which comes from our schools today.<br/>
That is one of the chief criticisms that can be laid against this proposal by the Government. The Government are admitting to teacher training those who just fail in the leaving certificate examination. Is there any logical reason why they should not, at some future date, admit to teaching those who just fail at the training college? The second step could quite easily be a logical consequence of the step proposed tonight and that, to me, is one reason, and a very important reason, why we should oppose these Regulations in the Division Lobby tonight.<br/>
During the course of the debate on the Estimates stage when mention was made


of this subject, I pointed out that we were dealing with an old type of solution which had been tried before in the teaching profession; that is, the lowering of the standard of entry; lowering the attainments necessary and, thereby, providing more necessary personnel for the schools. That method has failed in the past. It has been tried before without success. I have pointed out on a previous occasion that these Regulations were to apply principally to women. That is because it has unfortunately always been found easy in this matter to divide the teaching profession.<br/>
So long as we have these two different types of qualification, so long as the Government can say to the men, "This is something which does not affect you," so long will they find it easy to put the Regulations through, because they will have divided the teaching community. The Joint Under-Secretary of State met the objection about lower qualification by saying that the Regulations would not apply to men and that the qualifications necessary for entry to the training colleges would be preserved for them although it would be lowered for women. We welcome that little concession, but it is a qualified concession because it means that the Government have made the separation complete, which is a dangerous thing.<br/>
They are separating the women engaged in certain phases of teaching from the remainder of the teaching profession. They are applying more clearly than ever the old policy of dividing the profession in order to try to get part of it to carry out Government policy. That is a dangerous thing to do, for we cannot degrade one part of the profession, we cannot attack the foundations, without finding by and by a creeping paralysis affecting the entire profession. Gresham's law will operate here just as surely as it operates in other parts of our economy.<br/>
There is another reason why I oppose the Regulations. The attempt to lower the status of women, which is inherent in the Regulations, is in direct conflict with every trend in life today. The claim which women are making today is for a status and salary equivalent to that of men. We recognise that here; there is no discrimination within Parliament such as we are seeking to impose on the teaching profession. There is no discrimination in other professions&#x2014;the medical

profession. The claim for equality is being recognised more and more widely throughout every profession and business in the country, yet in these Regulations the Government are taking the retrograde step of moving in the opposite direction. That is wrong for the profession, for the children of the nation and for the nation itself, and because of that I hope the House, even at this late hour, will reject the Regulations.</p>

<p>I am pleased to enter this debate because the hon. Lady the Member for Lanarkshire, North (Miss Herbison) was good enough to say that I was one of those qualified to take part in it. I understand that she went on to say that she thought I had a broad outlook. She went on in the language of exaggeration when she said that these Regulations were a great danger to our country. I must say that when I hear my country is in danger it is a call I am unable to resist. When I heard those words I had to look at these Regulations and the kind of problem we are discussing. It is to get more teachers. That is what we want.<br/>
That is the position, and the desire of the Secretary of State is to get more teachers. Is that not a laudable object which we may well commend to the House, although it may be that the method by which he proposes to do it may not commend itself to the hon. Lady and her hon. Friends; but the hon. Lady is prejudiced because she speaks from a very narrow point of view&#x2014;the class of persons she represents.</p>

<p>The hon. Lady is by profession a teacher, and she is proud to be a teacher. She was a teacher of the very highest quality, and she speaks for a limited class quite effectively. I am not a teacher, I have never been one, I am


not qualified, I am not one of those, but I am one of those of whom the teachers ought to be ashamed. They failed to make anything of me. They could do nothing for me, but the common people of South Edinburgh have shown on many occasions a high appreciation of my talents.<br/>
The object is to get more teachers ultimately in schools in Scotland, but immediately we have to do something about the present situation. We find we are not getting sufficient applicants to enter this extremely important calling. and if I understand the proposals, my right hon. Friend proposes to take special steps to get more teachers, more persons to enter the training colleges. In order to do that he has looked at the number of people coming forward and has found that a large number of persons, particularly girls, want to be teachers but have not the full qualifications to enter the training colleges.</p>

<p>The number is unimportant. I do not think we want to deny to any clever young girl, who feels teaching to be her calling, the right to become a teacher. If she wants to do this I do not want to be the one to keep her out of it. I am not like the trade unionists who want to keep everything for people of their own class. If there is a girl in Edinburgh who wants to become a teacher, I do not want to discourage her. I am going to give her a job, particularly when I learn what the Regulation is.<br/>
This is what is happening. Here is a clever girl who has qualified in four subjects out of five, English, geography, history and mathematics, but who is not very good at Latin. She gets 100 per cent. in the first four subjects, but is not good enough at Latin. She is mad keen to be a teacher. On a Saturday she sets ups her little dolls and teaches them, she goes to Sunday school, but she has only four qualifications out of the necessary five subjects. But she has a feeling about teaching, she wants to impart knowledge, she has ideals and is anxious to be a teacher. This girl does not want to be a shop assistant, a nurse, or even an M.P., but under the present arrangement she is not allowed to enter the training college.<br/>
A girl who qualifies in four subjects but fails in another may show personality and keenness at the interview. My right hon. Friend's proposal is that such a person should be allowed to enter a training college with a view to becoming a teacher. That is all the proposal is. There is to be no lowering of the standard upon leaving the training college. If the girl does not reach the required standard as a result of the course, she does not become a qualified teacher. We are pleading not for the qualifications to be lowered but for the right to enter the college. Should a keen girl with four qualifications, although not four and a half or five, be denied the opportunity of entering? My right hon. Friend says that she could get a chance.<br/>
I speak for a constituency which is in no way inferior to others in education. It is in no way behind Glasgow, nor does it humble itself before Dundee. The City of Edinburgh takes the view that it has a lot of bright girls to whom it would like to give the opportunity of becoming teachers. The hon. Lady and the hon. Member for Tradeston (Mr. Rankin) say that they are not to have it. The two hon. Members represent a trade union whose desire has been to keep a narrow class limitation in the interests of the profession. All trade unions act in that way. The hon. Members are acting true to form. They are narrowing down the area of choice of free citizens, and I object to it.</p>

<p>It is not a very good tribute to the clarity of mind which the profession confers upon those who follow it that the hon. Member does not know what a point of order is. I believe I am right in saying that both he and the hon. Lady represent the teaching profession in the sense that they were at one time teachers and have not lost the taste for the profession. I suggest that they are trying to make their profession more exclusive, maybe for good reasons, like the engineers and other trades seek to do. They want to make it more difficult for people to join the profession. It may be


a reasonable point of view, but I do not agree with it. I speak for Edinburgh, whose girls who want to become teachers are at present denied the opportunity.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Kilmarnock (Mr. Ross) was as much out of order in that intervention as was the hon. Member for Tradeston just now.<br/>
Those who oppose the Motion are, intentionally or otherwise, restrictionists. They are hindering the opportunity of people to follow a certain calling. I should be in agreement with hon. Members opposite if the standards on leaving the training colleges were being lowered, but that is not so. People who are anxious to follow the profession are to be allowed to enter; if they qualify they will be allowed to become teachers, but if they do not qualify they will be forbidden to become teachers.<br/>
A young girl who is anxious to become a teacher takes her courage in her hands and enters a training college. She knows that if she fails to pass the required standard she will be discarded and will not become a teacher. She knows that her life will be broken. Yet, because she is to be given this opportunity, hon. Gentlemen opposite are against it. I do not think that by hindering and limiting the choice for the citizen to make a mess of his or her life it will improve education.<br/>
I would go further and say to the teachers and those who represent the teaching profession that this quandary in which we find ourselves is not a reflection on the Government, or its predecessor, but on the teachers themselves. We are not getting boys and girls coming forward with the necessary qualifications because the primary and secondary school teachers have failed in their duty and, having failed, now turn round and say, "Because you are not fit we are excluding you by law." That is most unfair and unjust. Here is a profession which has failed entirely to do its duty and, having failed to do its duty, attaches a penalty on

children who are victims of its incompetence and ineptitude.<br/>
I hope these Regulations, put forward in such grandiose terms, it is "a calamity" said one member, "a disaster" said another, will be approved. Let it be quite clear that it is no calamity or disaster, but a worth while decision and a serious plan to increase the number of students into the teaching profession.</p>

<p>According to hon. Members opposite, by introducing these revised Regulations we are taking what they call a retrograde step, a degrading step, which is a danger to our country. I must say that these phrases do not strike me as an expression of mature thought or sober judgment. Their language is rather biased and prejudiced; it is the


language of political controversy rather than of impartial consideration. It really does not serve any good purpose for hon. Members to get so worked up about this matter. We have here certain plain, indisputable facts confronting us, facts which demand not only lip service&#x2014;the hon. Lady gave them lip service&#x2014;but action, if we are to safeguard the education of our children next year, the year after and for the next few years.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman has referred to me and says I have given lip service to the facts. I think that my time in his office showed clearly that my right hon. Friend the Member for Greenock (Mr. McNeil) and myself gave a great deal more than lip service to it. I would also draw to the attention of the hon. Gentleman that it is not only my hon. Friend the Member for Tradeston and myself who are opposing these Regulations, but provincial committees for training teachers and the education committees&#x2014;ordinary men and women who are responsible for education in Scotland.</p>

<p>I am sorry if I have upset the hon. Lady; I did not mean in the slightest that she did not do a good job when occupying my position. But I say that it is no good in the face of the existing facts to pay lip service to them; we have to take action on them. That is what I am concerned with now and I want to recite those facts for the benefit of the House. When the present Government took office this is what we found, and it is because of the situation in which we found ourselves that we are obliged to take the action we propose tonight, and for no other reason.<br/>
The year before we took office the hon. Lady and her hon. Friends had become very much concerned about the shortage of teachers and set up a Departmental Committee to ascertain the existing and prospective vacancies in the schools. The Committee reported early in 1951. It said that the staffing outlook was far from satisfactory; in October, 1949, the number of teachers required to replace uncertificated teachers, retired teachers and married women wishing to be replaced, and to fill vacancies was 2,300; and added:
<q>According to our estimates the figures will fall to about 1,250 by the end of 1952 but

thereafter the occupation of new buildings, the rise in the school population and the virtual cessation of output from the Emergency Scheme will together bring about a deteriorating position, and, if the present trends continue, the total assessed as above will be at least 3,000"&#x2014;</q>
that is to say, deficiencies&#x2014;
<q>by 1956. The above figures minimise the gravity of the situation as several important factors such as the reduction in the size of classes have so far been excluded from the statistics.</q>
By any test, those were serious figures, and it was to the credit of the hon. Lady and her colleagues that they introduced the Special Recruitment Scheme, designed to attract to the teaching profession men and women who had gone into other walks of life. Successful candidates, as she quite properly said, had to pass the usual tests and have the usual training before being awarded a certificate as a teacher. On more than one occasion I have complimented the hon. Lady on that scheme and I do so again now. It brought in 1,069 effective students to the training colleges, of whom already 292 have completed their courses.<br/>
It may interest the House to know that of the total just over half have been accepted for graduate courses, just under a quarter for non-graduate courses and under one-tenth for technical courses. This is the point on which I want the House to concentrate. Good though that scheme was in theory, valuable though it has turned out as an instrument for additional recruitment, it was and still is attacked and denounced by many of the same people who are attacking this Measure we are considering tonight.<br/>
The hon. Lady was the object of criticism, even abuse, for her scheme, just as we are for the step we are taking. Let me recall to the hon. Lady some of the things that were said about her attitude and her scheme. The Educational Institute, in their journal of 19th October, 1951, just before the General Election, said,
<q>The present proposals &#x2026; merely touch the fringe of the problem and are unworthy of a great profession.</q>
Later on, when the Secretary of State published draft Regulations to continue the scheme, the E.I.S. wrote to us on 29th February, 1952, to say,
<q>The Executive &#x2026; have instructed me to intimate to you their opposition to the Secretary


of State's proposal to continue the special scheme of recruitment.</q>
And one other example. In their journal, that is to say, the Scottish Schoolmaster's journal&#x2014;</p>

<p>The "Scottish Schoolmaster," the journal of the Schoolmasters' Association, in October, 1951, said this of the recruiting scheme,
<q>The constant dilution of the teaching profession by the entrance of individuals through emergency channels "&#x2014;</q>

<p>The hon. Lady is quite right, and if she will be patient I will come to all these matters. The same sort of criticisms from the same people have been levelled against the scheme we are discussing tonight. I want the House to know that. We now know there was no justification for the fears expressed to the hon. Lady in 1951. She was right about it from the start. She said there was no justification for any qualms about dilution. I am just as confident tonight that similar fears arising from the present proposals will equally prove to be groundless.<br/>
Let me continue with the little bit of history I must offer to the House. Despite the success of the Special Recruitment Scheme&#x2014;and it was a marked success, for

the hon. Lady secured a large number of applicants&#x2014;the problem of teacher-shortage remained and the hon. Lady realised that something additional had to be done. She spoke on the wireless and elsewhere most eloquently, making earnest appeals for more teachers. But there was a continued shortage which I think increased in her time.<br/>
When the second report of the Departmental Committee was presented to my right hon. Friend some months after we took office, the position was demonstrated to be more disturbing than ever. After making full allowance for the potential increase of entrants to the Training Colleges from the Special Recruitment Scheme and for other factors such as the new Code, this revised report found this:<br/>
First of all they found that the deficiency of teachers in October, 1951, was no fewer than 2,300. That is when we took office. Secondly, they found that, while normal recruitment, plus the output of the new scheme of the hon. Lady and of its predecessor, the Emergency Training Scheme, would safely cover wastage up to 1957, after that date, when the flow from these exceptional measures was likely&#x2014;and I think the hon. Lady will agree may very well be likely&#x2014;to diminish, the output from normal training courses would be insufficient unless more students entered the Training Colleges in the next few years. The conclusion of that second report, which was given to us a few months after taking office, was that unless something substantial was done, and done quickly, to stimulate recruitment, by 1957 the deficiency would rise to 3,300. That was the grim situation which the hon. Lady's Government left us to face and, somehow, to deal with.<br/>
When we examined the details and analysed the total figures we discovered three particularly dangerous features in that situation. First of all, the shortage of mathematics and science teachers was acute when we took office and had been worsening every year since the end of the war, and this Departmental Committee forecast that by 1957 the shortage of these highly specialised trained men and women would be as much as 26 per cent. of the total strength required.<br/>
I should perhaps tell the House that there are at present 1,550 teachers of


mathematics and science in Scotland, that we are short of 280, and that the deficiencies are increasing at the rate of 50 per annum. The potential effect of that situation upon industry and upon the production of future scholars of these two supremely important subjects gave my right hon. Friend the gravest concern.<br/>
Next we discovered that in October. 1951, the shortage of women domestic teachers was 220 and by 1957 would rise to something over 300. Lastly we discovered that by far the largest deficiency of all was among teachers in primary schools, which accounted for almost half the total. In 1951 it amounted to 1,000. and we were advised by the Committee that by 1957 the figure would rise to at least 1,500.<br/>
The House is, I think, aware of the particularly difficult phase into which Scottish&#x2014;and English&#x2014;education has moved, and is moving in the course of the next few years. Partly because of the peak birth-rate in the years 1947&#x2013;50, partly because of the continued drive for smaller classes, but not least as a result of the growing number of new schools in new housing areas, we shall in the course of the next few years be faced with a substantially larger school population. In primary schools it will mean an increase of 25,000 over this year's figure, and in secondary schools an increase of 52,000 on this year's figure. In consequence, we shall find an acute, an increasingly acute, demand for teachers.<br/>
Now, it is the combination of those conditions, concentrated as they are into a relatively limited period, and coming upon us almost at once&#x2014;indeed, it has started already&#x2014;that makes this problem so anxious and so urgent. That was the inheritance which we took over, and it was a pretty bleak inheritance. We had to do something swiftly and effectively, and since the problem is so many sided we had to consider not one remedy but many. I will tell the House what we propose to do. On the shortage of teachers of mathematics and science, my right hon. Friend has already indicated that he proposes to set up a committee to advise him. Tomorrow he will have&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>

<p>I will content myself with saying that we are taking those measures, for which the hon. Lady the Member for Lanarkshire, North asks, to encourage more people to become teachers and to encourage particularly gifted children to stay on at school. We are doing exactly as she asked. We have increased bursaries by as much as 60 per cent. with that end in view, and soon we shall be undertaking an inquiry to find out whether there is anything that prevents people who otherwise would do so from becoming teachers. Teachers' organisations, and the hon. Lady, have said, "That is not enough. What you want to do is to give us bigger salaries." It would be out of order, however, to deal with that.</p>

<p>Well, the teachers are saying that, and it would be out of order for me to deal with it.<br/>
I think that the plans which I have outlined will commend themselves to the House. Many of them arise from suggestions made, among others, by the hon. Lady. We shall carry on with those plans with all the strength we have. But that demands good will from everybody concerned and, as every experienced person will know, these plans will take time to develop and fructify. Meanwhile&#x2014;and that is the reason for this measure&#x2014;the "bulge," that perplexing, educational monster advances upon us inexorably, and may overcome us unless we take special steps&#x2014;immediately&#x2014;to increase the flow of recruits into the Training Colleges.<br/>
The Regulations with which we are concerned, in the opinion of the Government, are an essential step towards increasing the flow of recruits. We have not taken this step of issuing these Regulations lightly, nor without seeking the best advice available to us in Scotland. I am satisfied, despite what the hon. Lady has said, that the bulk of responsible educational opinion supports us. It is true that a number of bodies and organisations have declared against these Regulations; but if the House would care to add up all the bodies who have pronounced they would find that just as many have come down in their favour as against them.<br/>
I could give the hon. Lady details of them if she asked me. For example, six education authorities have criticised them, but six are for them, in view of the changes we have made in the draft Regulations. The Association of Headmasters are against them, but the Association of Headmistresses are for them. One university senatus is against them, but the directors of education are for them. Three Provincial Committees are against them, but the National Training Committee&#x2014;the central authority for training teachers in Scotland&#x2014;pronounce in favour of them. Teachers' organisations are against them, but they were also against the hon. Lady's recommendations. When we recollect that the great majority of Scottish education authorities have not commented at all, it is safe to assume that the majority of them take our view, and that is certainly the impression I formed when I met the local authority associations some weeks ago.<br/>
What does this scheme amount to? If the Regulations are carried into effect, what changes will take place? The answer is quite simple. Eighty or so additional girls each year will be given the chance to enter the Training Colleges and become certificated teachers of young children, but apart from that virtually no change will occur. It has been suggested that this is dilution. I ask, dilution of what? It is not dilution, in any sense, of the demands of the training colleges. Indeed, the tendency may be quite the reverse. The girl who enters the college with 48 per cent. instead of 51 per cent. in, say, Higher History will have no easy passage. She will be required to go through exactly the same training as others, to meet the same exacting tests, and pass the same examinations.<br/>
The very fact that she goes in with a mark or two less than her class-mates will make it incumbent upon her&#x2014;and her instructors&#x2014;to pick up the difference before the end of the course. If she fails to satisfy her instructors within the first few months of her course&#x2014;within what is called the probationary period&#x2014;out she will go. If, at the end, she falls short of the standards demanded by the College, again she will be failed, and will not become a teacher. Only those students who meet the normal, full requirements of the Training Colleges will be awarded certificates as qualified teachers.<br/>
That being so, I cannot understand how this can be described as dilution. It is a complete myth. There is no dilution. That is the situation, and I feel that the House should not be unduly moved by the spate of specious propaganda which has descended upon us. The situation with which my right hon. Friend is now confronted, is that at this moment we have a crisis on our hands. It is nothing less than a crisis. Present methods are insufficient to meet the country's educational needs. Others have to be found&#x2014;and found at once.<br/>
I have searched earnestly for alternatives to those proposals which the House has discussed tonight. I have waited anxiously for constructive suggestions from the Opposition, but I have heard none. In fact there are no practical alternatives. None have been offered by anybody in the discussion tonight, nor have any been offered by anybody outside; and, since there are no practical


alternatives, my right hon. Friend has had to take a decision. But, he is conscious of the many fine traditions of Scottish teaching, and he desires that we shall maintain our high standards. He is resolved that the children of this generation shall by adequate education, with classes of proper size, and with adequate teachers; and, in the interests of the children&#x2014;which must be our overwhelming order that they may have</p>

<p>The question I want to raise tonight concerns a Mr. Stothart and a Mr. Richmond and the circumstances in which they parted company with their employers, the Ministry of Works. They were employed at the Ministry of Supply establishment at Eastriggs, a village in my constituency built up entirely during the first World War in order to meet the needs of the war at that time. During the Hitler war the Ministry of Supply, I am told, employed at that place five joiners, two bricklayers, two painters and a plumber. I am informed the actual accommodation to be maintained is much the same at the present time, except that three farm buildings were taken into use for storage of empty cases during the war.<br/>
In 1942&#x2013;43 the Ministry of Supply took on the two employees in question. Mr. Stothart was taken on as a joiner. He is a man who was wounded in the leg at Gallipoli. He is very lame still, and the wound still gives him trouble. At the moment he is awaiting admission to hospital for the removal of a dead bit of his limb. He belongs to the district, he has a house there, and he is aged 58. Mr. Richmond is a plumber. He is a man who was badly shell-shocked at Tobruk in 1941. He was invalided out in 1942, and taken on in 1943 at Eastriggs. He belongs to Glasgow. He was advised when he was invalided out of the Army to go and work in the country because of the state of his health.<br/>
The Ministry of Works took over the maintenance of this establishment in 1946, and the establishment was then cut down to a joiner and a plumber, Mr. Stothart and Mr. Richmond, and ultimately two labourers. I understand at the beginning of 1953 the Ministry of Works gave notice that they were going to hand


over the maintenance of the establishment to outside contractors, and they gave six months' notice at that time of their intention to Mr. Stothart and Mr. Richmond and the two labourers. Three, at any rate, of them were established, and being established civil servants, of course, they were offered alternative employment elsewhere. They were to be sent to Glasgow. Mr. Richmond was to be sent back to the place which he was told to leave for his health. The odd thing is that the labourer asked to be sent to Edinburgh, his home, but he has been transferred to the Ministry of Supply at Eastriggs. The others could have been taken on by the Ministry of Supply at Eastriggs, but as labourers and not as tradesmen. The position is, of course, that both have lost their jobs because they declined to go to Glasgow. They lost also their pensions with their jobs, and they do not get compensation because they were offered these jobs in Glasgow.<br/>
I appreciate that the decision of the Ministry of Works to hand over the maintenance of the building at Eastriggs to private contractors may have been the result of a general decision, but the general decision ought not to have been applied without consideration of the special circumstances of the employees on the spot. I am informed that a man is working there whole-time doing the very job that Mr. Stothart was doing.<br/>
I seriously suggest to my hon. Friend&#x2014;I have had discussions with him about the matter&#x2014;that men like these two who have lost the zest of life through the service which they have given to the country, deserve special consideration. When considering future policy for Eastriggs, it would have been reasonable for the Ministry to take their special circumstances into consideration. Yet Mr. Richmond was virtually told "We recognise that you had to leave Glasgow for the good of your health, but you must go back there or leave your job without compensation." To Mr. Stothart. the Ministry said "We know that you are in no condition of health and not of an age to change your home, job and way of life, but the regulations say that you have either to take the job which is offered to you or lose the pension rights which you would have had in two or three years' time in your present job and also

your rights to compensation." It is extremely hard.<br/>
I recognise that, rightly or wrongly, the Ministry have taken the step at Eastriggs and have already handed the maintenance work over to a private contractor. But the work is still there to be done by somebody. I urge my hon. Friend not to let his Ministry gain a name as a bad employer. The Ministry should set an example as a good employer. In this case, the compensation at least ought to be paid, but if the regulations preclude the payment of compensation, the right and proper course is to make an <i>ex gratia</i> payment. The cost to the Ministry for both men would perhaps be &#x00A3;500, but the Ministry would gain the advantage of a feeling among the employees that the regulations will be used not against them but in their favour and that the Ministry will do&#x2014;as I am sure my hon. Friend will say&#x2014;everything in its power to stretch points in such hard cases as this, giving the men who have served it well the greatest possible consideration when a difficult decision has to be made.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Dumfries (Mr. N. Macpherson), discharging the duty of representative of his constituents, has raised tonight the case of these two men who were employed by the Ministry of Works at Eastriggs. I hope to be able to satisfy him that, having due regard to the amount of work to be done and the need for economy in public administration, every reasonable step was taken by my Department to give these men an opportunity of alternative employment.<br/>
My Department is responsible for the maintenance of the establishment belonging to the Ministry of Supply at Eastriggs. The amount of work to be done has been declining and for some time before the beginning of this year it was found that Mr. Stothart, the joiner, and Mr. Richmond, the plumber, and the two labourers, were not fully employed upon maintenance. In fact they were not employed more than two-thirds of the time. In the circumstances it was natural that we should look to a local contractor to undertake the responsibility for the maintenance of this establishment.<br/>
The hon. Member will realise that we have principles which have to be applied


throughout the many establishments and buildings for which the Ministry of Works is responsible. Because these men were established we were under an obligation to try to give them continuous employment. If they had been unestablished industrial employees it would have been possible and natural for us merely to discharge them when, owing to the decreased amount of work, it was decided to employ a local contractor instead of direct labour. Because these two men were established industrial employees we offered them alternative employment.<br/>
The hon. Member has referred to the fact that Glasgow is a long way from Eastriggs, but that was the only place where we could offer them alternative employment. We have approached the Minister of Supply who had found employment for the two labourers, but they had no job to offer to a joiner or a plumber. They were willing to take either or both as labourers. We were able to offer them alternative employment in Glasgow, and one of the obligations which an established industrial employee undertakes in return for his increased security and right to a pension is that he will move to where the Department can give him employment.<br/>
In the case of Mr. Richmond, I understand he has now elected to go to a local authority which has employed him in the place where he lived.</p>

<p>That is not actually correct. He is employed by a private engineering firm as a machinist.</p>

<p>Yes. The reason I was not entirely informed about that is because we have not dismissed either of these two men. In fact, as the hon. Member has said in carefully chosen words, these men and the Ministry of Works have parted company and we have never dismissed them. They were told to report for work at Glasgow and they did not do so. As a result of representations made by my hon. Friend Mr. Stothart was granted an extension first of one week and then of a second, but he has not elected to report for work in Glasgow. I am without information as to whether he has obtained alternative employment or not.<br/>
My hon. Friend has referred to Mr. Stothart's service in the Army and to the wound he sustained at Gallipoli. I am

quite sure that that information is reliable but we had heard nothing about his going into hospital until I received my hon. Friend's letter, dated 8th June, and we still are without information about it from Mr. Stothart. If it had been the case that he was just on the point of going into hospital he could have obtained sick leave for that purpose, but in fact he never made complaint to us upon the subject at all.<br/>
My hon. Friend has suggested that the Department should consider the particular cases of all their employees if ever they decide to close down an establishment. I do feel that if my hon. Friend considered what that would involve he would realise that it would make the ordinary administration of a rather large Government Department almost impossible. We are bound by the Superannuation Acts which have been passed by this House and which lay down the general principles upon which pensions are to be awarded and gratuities are payable. Gratuities are payable on three grounds; first, ill-health; secondly, abolition of office; and, thirdly, age limit. In fact these men do not come under any one of those three categories. I followed my hon. Friend's speech carefully and I think he was careful not to attempt to base his case upon any one of those three contingencies which are provided for in the Superannuation Acts.<br/>
What in effect he asked us to do was to depart from the general principles which are applied by the Superannuation Acts and which have, therefore, the authority of this House, in order to treat these particular individuals in an entirely exceptional way. When my hon. Friend referred to what the cost of paying a pension or gratuity to Mr. Stothart would be and represented it as a very small amount, I think he omitted to notice that it is really impossible for us to treat a single individual in an exceptional way without creating a precedent which must apply throughout the country. It is for that reason that the Ministry of Works is obliged to apply in the case of its own employees those general principles which are applied by all Government Departments under the direction of the Treasury in accordance with legislation passed by this House.<br/>
I can assure my hon. Friend that we made every effort to find alternative em-


ployment for these two men at Eastriggs. We made representations to the Ministry of Supply and were successful in the case of the two labourers and we could have obtained employment for these two craftsmen as labourers. We could not undertake to pay a gratuity to a craftsman if he is unwilling to remove to where another job is offered. The effect of that would be to bring completely to an end mobility of labour among those employed by the State. We should find that wherever Government establishments were closed down all the employees would ask to receive a gratuity and would not move to other parts of the country where the Department was able to give them employment.<br/>
I feel that in the way we have treated these craftsmen who have worked for a number of years for the Ministry of Works, but not long enough to qualify for a pension, we have shown great consideration and done the best we can to find them alternative employment. We have no information about Mr. Stothart's illness, other than that given by my hon. Friend&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>

<p>Which indeed I accept, but we still have no confirmation from the man himself. He has made no claim for a gratuity on that basis. It is impossible for us, simply out of sympathy for these two craftsmen, to depart from the established principles.</p>

<p>May I ask if it is open to Mr. Stothart to make such an application for a gratuity on the grounds of ill-health?</p>

<p>I think it is extremely unlikely that he would be able to obtain it. His record shows very little absence due to sickness. What is open to him is to report to Glasgow and the extensions of one and two weeks which we have already considered as a result of the representations of my hon. Friend will be extended to re-employ him in Glasgow if he likes to re-consider his decision to remain in our employ.</p>
