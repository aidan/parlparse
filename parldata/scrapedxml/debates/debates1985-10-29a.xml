<p>Does the Minister accept that long-term unemployment is now the greatest problem facing our society&#x2014;a problem that was scarcely noticeable under the Labour Government, but is major under the Tory Government?

<p>The House will agree with the hon. Gentleman's assessment of long-term unemployment, which carries with it a sense of rejection and degradation and is a source of great concern to us all. It is for this

reason that my right hon. and noble Friend the Secretary of State has set in train a number of initiatives devised specifically to bring the long-term unemployment back into the purlieu of the employment service, to make known to them all the facilities that are available and to make fresh contact with them, whether by post or by inviting them into jobcentres. I hope that the increasing economic activity will help bring this intractable problem towards a solution.</p>

<p>Does my hon.

<p>My hon. Friend is right. It is true that the number of jobs continues to go up and that we have increased it by 350,000. If the population of working age had stayed at the same levels, unemployment would now be in the 2 million range.</p>

<p>The House knows that we are already spending &#x00A3;2 billion of taxpayers' money on special employment and training measures, but it is hard to believe that permanent and lasting jobs could be created from this source after the tap of taxpayers' money had been cut off, or after, as would be the case if there were a Labour Government, the Chancellor of the Exchequer came scuttling back from the International Monetary Fund with his marching orders. Real jobs can be created only by increasing business and enterprise activity.</p>

<p>Has my hon. Friend seen the recent article by the hon. Member for Dunfermline, East (Mr. Brown)?

<p>I think that "scurrilous" is the word. The survey to which my hon. Friend refers is the labour force survey, which was carried out in no fewer than 57,000 homes. It is regarded both in and out of Whitehall as a nonpolitical, independent and widely-accepted source of statistical information. I find it interesting that the hon. Member for Dunfermline, East (Mr. Brown) has used that survey to his advantage when referring to second jobs. The Labour party does not like good news. Last year Britain created more new jobs than the whole of Europe put together. The hon. Member for Dunfermline, East is particularly scornful of the estimated growth in the number of self-employed. The official estimate of an increase of 393,000 is based upon the same statistical inquiry, the labour force survey.</p>

<p>Is the Minister aware that in any "snapshot" of the unemployed we see that people do not look for work in a particular week because they are realistic and know that work is not available? Does he realise that the annual survey found that 870,000 workers were seeking work but that they were not included in the figures because they were not entitled to benefits? I hope that he will not mock the unemployed by emulating Jeffrey Archer and suggesting that they are workshy and malingerers. That is not true. Does the Minister not realise that in six years of Conservative government unemployment has risen consistently every year? Is he not ashamed of that fact?</p>

<p>It is not my intention, nor that of my colleagues, to mock the unemployed. However, we are sick to the back teeth of the Labour party's claim that it has a monopoly of compassion. If the hon. Gentleman thinks that he has the answer and that there is an easy solution to this problem, will he explain to the House in some detail why unemployment rose so dramatically when the Labour Government were in office?</p>

<p>Is my hon. Friend aware that in my constituency 4,600 people are registered as unemployed and that 82 per cent. of companies report difficulty over recruiting skilled labour, including companies in the engineering industry? At the skillcentre, 24 places are available on engineering courses, but the average occupancy rate is only eight, and the course is therefore to be curtailed. Is my hon. Friend satisfied that sufficient is being done to draw to the attention of the registered unemployed the fact that there are great opportunities to retrain for jobs, which are available in large numbers?</p>

<p>My hon. Friend is correct. Vacancies notified to MSC jobcentres are only about one third of the true level. Employers are best placed to tackle the many possible causes of shortages by training and retraining. That is why we have adopted the adult training strategy which allows for national Government and local grants to

help industry meet its skill requirements. We hope that employers in my hon. Friend's constituency and throughout the country will take advantage of that assistance.</p>

<p>I add my congratulations to the Minister of State and the Paymaster General on their appointments, although I deplore the fact that the Secretary of State for Employment is in a non-elected place, from where he throws insults at the labour force by calling them work shy.<br/>
May I encourage the Paymaster General and the Secretary of State to set a precedent in their Department by giving us the real unemployment facts? Do they recognise that their labour force survey reveals that 870,000 people are available for work but not registered? That means that the official unemployment level is well over 4 million and between three and four times greater than that which the Conservative Government inherited in 1979.</p>

<p>On behalf of myself and my right hon. and learned Friend the Paymaster General, I thank the hon. Gentleman for his kind words. He was kinder than he thinks because he promoted me to Minister of State. The hon. Gentleman is perhaps a little late in referring to the fact that my right hon. and noble Friend the Secretary of State is a non-elected Member, because Mr. Bickerstaff mentioned that at the Labour party conference. That was surprising, since he was elected for life by that famous British institution known as the block vote. The truth is that the statistical survey is accurate. The hon. Gentleman is wrong in that he referred only to the 870,000 people who are not claiming benefit but who are looking for and taking jobs. That point was made in the article that my right hon. and noble Friend wrote on 5 October. The hon. Gentleman must take into account the fact that 940,000 people are claiming benefit but not looking for work.</p>

<p>Does my hon. Friend agree that one must look behind the statistics? Does he accept that the largest number of long-term unemployed are in the south-east, the area with the largest number of job vacancies? In the south-east, about 9,000 job vacancies have remained unfilled for two months or more, when 12 per cent. of CBI firms report that labour shortages are the reason for restricted output in the future. The MSC has identified 173 occupational areas with labour shortages. Is not one of the problems that unemployment benefit officers know who is unemployed but do not know where the jobs are, while the jobcentres know where the jobs are but do not know who is unemployed?</p>

<p>We are well aware of the difficulties caused by the fewer job opportunities in the north compared with the south. That is one of the principal reasons for a regional policy. As a northern Member, I am well aware of the difficulties. It is important to stress the adult training strategy and the many pluses and achievements which have resulted from the youth training scheme. That scheme is without doubt a success and is recognised as such by those who take advantage of it.</p>

I know that there is bad news in the inner cities, which is why the city action teams are concentrating on coordinating the vast amount of Government money being put into those areas.

<p>I notice that the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hillsborough (Mr. Flannery) has just taken his place. If he had been here sooner, instead of engaging in some part-time occupation, his earlier question could have been answered.<br/>
A substantial proportion of the new jobs being created are part time and self employed. That reflects the social change that has been taking place for many years, and which will continue to be reflected as we create employment in a modern economy.<br/>
The hon. Member for Bolsover (Mr. Skinner) is not committed to social change. He prefers traditional industry with traditional organisation inside that industry. We are creating an economy in which more people will he employed in service industries, which is the pattern of other developed economies. I am sorry that that does not fit the hon.

<p>Does the right hon. and learned Gentleman agree that mainly women are being forced into part-time jobs which are badly paid and have bad conditions? for example, many of them lack holidays and other entitlements.

<p>One reason why the increased rate of employment is not reducing the total of unemployed is that many more women are entering the labour market. It is a perfectly desirable consequence of social changes that they should be doing that, but it follows that many of them are actively looking for part-time work. They are jobs that people require and that are of value to the economy, so there is no point in dismissing part-time employment.<br/>
The answer to the hon. Lady's question about the community programme is that, in my view, it is right that the programme should concentrate on the needs of the long-term unemployed. The first aim of the community programme must be to make it easier for those people to get themselves back into the world of employment. Other aims must be subordinate to that.</p>

<p>About one tenth of the work force is self employed, the highest figure for 60 years. From an examination of international examples and the experience of good advanced economies elsewhere, one can expect that proportion to increase. At the same time, we must not have abuse of the status of self employment for tax and

insurance purposes. Having said that, it is good news that we have just reduced the national insurance contribution for the self employed, thus reducing a burden on them when they create their own businesses and provide employment for others.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman is one of those who have tried to explain during the passage of various pieces of legislation how difficult it would be for unions to have ballots. The ballot held by the Transport and General Workers Union has shown that instead of having about 30,000 members contracted out. 120.000 voted against the political levy. I suspect that the hon.

<p>My hon. Friend is right. It is clear that if the ballots had taken place a year ago, the results may have been very different. It is clear also that if ballots are held again in nine or 10 years' time, the results may be different. If that were not so, there would be no reason for the Opposition to say that they will take away the right of union members to review every 10 years whether to have a political levy. If the Opposition were not frightened of trade union members, they would not want to alter the provisions that are set out in the Act.</p>

The moment the Government move to remove unnecessary regulations in the wages market and an outmoded method of fixing young workers' pay and to set out the details of all terms and conditions for workers in certain industries, the Opposition object and defend past practices. We are convinced that the changes we are making will increase job opportunities for many people in the industries affected.</p>

<p>Does my right hon. and learned Friend agree that the reason why 50 per cent. of young people in Germany go into apprenticeships and only 5 per cent. of young people in Britain do so is that in this country young people have been effectively priced out of jobs by trade unions, supported by wages councils wage rates?</p>

<p>I agree that the incidence of unemployment varies between travel-to-work areas. They are defined as travel-to-work areas because it is usually possible to move about in a city to find work.

<p>Is my right hon. Friend aware that she has overwhelming support among thousands of workers whose jobs depend upon trade with South Africa for her stand against sanctions? Did the Commonwealth conference consider taking action against Zimbabwe, Sri Lanka and Uganda, whose security forces are responsible for far more deaths resulting from police action against rioters than are those in South Africa?</p>

<p>My hon. Friends know that, among other matters, I can see little point in sanctions which will create more unemployment in this country, only to create more unemployment in South Africa. That seems to me to be a ridiculous policy and one that would not work.<br/>
With regard to the other matter, violence is never acceptable as an instrument of political change. The


sooner we get that message home, the better. The Opposition will not agree with that, but the Government say that violence is never acceptable as an instrument of political change.</p>

<p>I will, with permission, Mr. Speaker, make a brief statement on my visits to Nassau for the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting from 16&#x2013;22 October, and to New York on 23&#x2013;24 October for the 40th anniversary of the United Nations. My right hon. and learned Friend the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary accompanied me to Nassau.<br/>
I have arranged for copies of the communiqu&#x00E9; from the Commonwealth meeting to be placed in the Library of the House.<br/>
Much of our time at that meeting was devoted to the problems of South Africa. We were unanimous in our abhorrence of apartheid, in our wish to see fundamental peaceful change in South Africa as soon as possible, and in our desire to find practical ways in which the Commonwealth could help secure that objective.<br/>
As my right hon. and learned Friend the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary has already told the House. we reached an agreement which was endorsed by all 46 Governments attending the meeting. That agreement is set out in the Commonwealth accord on South Africa. I wish to emphasise four points from the accord.<br/>
First, we called on the South African Government to establish a dialogue with representatives of the black community with a view to establishing a non-racial and representative government. Secondly, the dialogue should be initiated in the context of a suspension of violence on all sides. Thirdly, we agreed to set up a group of eminent Commonwealth persons to encourage and facilitate dialogue. Fourthly, we agreed on a programme of common action which incorporated a number of measures which we were already taking, together with two new measures of which my right hon. and learned Friend has already informed the House.<br/>
The Commonwealth accord is a clear political signal from the united members of the Commonwealth of the need for rapid change within South Africa as well as of the need for the South African Government to end their illegal occupation of Namibia. We shall review the situation in six months' time.<br/>
The Commonwealth Heads of Government agreed on a number of other matters, including a declaration on world order reaffirming the support of the Commonwealth for the United Nations, a welcome for the report of the Commonwealth Consultative Group on the vulnerability of small states; the need for greater co-operation both to counter the international traffic in illicity drugs and to deny to those convicted of drug trafficking the proceeds of their crime, and the need for greater co-operation to prevent and combat terrorism.<br/>
I believe that the outcome of the meeting demonstrated the capacity of the Commonwealth, despite widely varying initial views, to reach a sensible and realistic agreement acceptable to all Governments. Its rejection of violence as a way to solve the problems of South Africa is of particular importance. I believe that the outcome of the meeting is one which fully meets the interests and concerns of the United Kingdom.<br/>
I subsequently visited New York from 23 to 24 October to address the 40th anniversary session of the General Assembly of the United Nations and for meetings with

other Heads of Government. I held bilateral discussions with President Reagan, Prime Minister Craxi, Prime Minister Peres, Premier Zhao Ziyang and the Secretary-General of the United Nations. I also attended a meeting with President Reagan and the Heads of Government of Canada, the Federal Republic of Germany, Italy and Japan to discuss the forthcoming meeting of the President and Mr. Gorbachev. We expressed our support for, and confidence in, President Reagan's approach to this important meeting and we wish him well.</p>
</speech>
<speech hansard_id="358589" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1985-10-29a.816.0" hansard_membership_id="6891" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/11457" speakername="Mr. Neil Kinnock" colnum="816" time="15:31:00">
<p>We welcome the Prime Minister's further condemnation of apartheid in her statement but regret that she undermines the force of her words against apartheid by saying that she is willing to take only a "tiny little bit" of action against apartheid.<br/>
The Prime Minister has spoken on previous occasions of "signals" to South Africa. Does she not realise that the inconsistency between her words and her actions signals only comfort to President Botha and those of his regime? Is she further aware that leaders of opinion in South Africa, including Desmond Tutu, reject her excuses for not imposing tougher sanctions as sophistries, and that many inside and outside South Africa agree with that estimate of her attitude?<br/>
On 25 July the right hon. Lady told the House that sanctions would be "counter-productive". Is she aware that we welcome the change in that view, which she has signified by her agreement to the Nassau accord and the way in which she belatedly recognises the failure of so-called constructive engagement strategies, and that we also welcome the usefulness of economic pressures in pursuit of peaceful change in South Africa, which she now apparently endorses?<br/>
We wish every success to the Commonwealth mission, provided, of course, that its activities are not used as a means of delaying or diminishing pressures on apartheid from outside. In order to clarify her position on the initiative, will the Prime Minister confirm that when she reviews the situation in six months' time she will be prepared to join in further action if the Commonwealth leaders on that mission judge that further pressure is required?<br/>
I gather that there is some difficulty in choosing a British representative for the Commonwealth mission. I put it to the Prime Minister that we have a number of very suitable candidates in the House and that she could usefully consider distinguished and well qualified Members, including, perhaps, those from Cardiff and Bexley. <i>[Interruption.]</i> We will settle for "useful". "Superb" would involve my right hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, East (Mr. Healey).<br/>
We hear what the Prime Minister says about the need to stop violence in South Africa, and of course we earnestly hope that that will occur, but will she tell us what she is doing to ensure that the inherent violent system of apartheid is ended, for that, in itself, is the root of all political violence in South Africa?<br/>
As for the Prime Minister's discussions with President Reagan, her statement was, to say the least, very uncommunicative. May I ask her the following questions, so that she can enlarge on what she has told us?<br/>
First, are the Americans still willing to negotiate about the arms race in space, which was agreed between Mr. Gromyko and Mr. Shultz at their February meeting in


order to set the agenda for the forthcoming summit, and does that agreement include discussion of the strategic defence initiative?<br/>
Secondly, does the Prime Minister stand by her statement in New York on 24 October:
<q>as I understand it there will be a further initiative before the meeting</q>
between President Reagan and Mr. Gorbachev on 19 November? Is that still the right hon. Lady's feeling, or was that wishful thinking, resulting from the reasonable desire which she and others have that President Reagan will announce counter-proposals before going to Geneva? Can she, in any event, confirm that President Reagan will report back to NATO after the Geneva summit?<br/>
Thirdly, is the Prime Minister aware &#x2014; [HON. MEMBERS: "Come on."] The Prime Minister could have said all this in her statement if she had not made it so abrupt. Is the Prime Minister aware that while a plan to curb regional conflicts between the super-powers would be welcome, especially in respect of the middle east, that process should not distract attention, diminish effort or in any way inhibit work to secure an early agreement to stop the nuclear arms race?<br/>
Fourthly, and finally, can the Prime Minister confirm that she interprets the 1972 anti-ballistic missile treaty in the same way as Mr. Shultz and Mr. Paul Nitze, and that so-called new principles could not justify the testing of components or of sub-components of an anti-ballistic missile system?</p>

<p>I note that when I make a long statement the right hon. Gentleman wants it short, and that when I make it short he wants it long. I tried to be brief in this statement. It suits me very well when the statement is briefer than the questions.<br/>
As regards sanctions, as the right hon. Gentleman knows, the Labour Government were absolutely against far-reaching economic sanctions. Indeed, they said in 1978&#x2014;[AN HON. MEMBER: "That was the right hon. Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Dr. Owen)."] No, it was not. The hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands) said:
<q>We voted against"&#x2014;</q>
the sanctions
<q>together with France, West Germany, the USA and some other Western countries because we do not agree that the far-reaching economic measures which the resolution calls for would produce the changes in South Africa which we would all like to see." &#x2014;[<i>Official Report</i>, 16 January 1978; Vol. 942, c. 9.]</q>
We wholly agree. That is why we are fully against&#x2014;</p>

<p>That was stated from this Box &#x2014; not by the right hon. Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Dr. Owen)&#x2014;on 16 January 1978 as official
Labour party policy, even if the hon. Gentleman does not like it.<br/>
The only strict sanction that we are operating at the moment is the one against armaments, in accordance with the mandatory resolution of the Security Council, which we have been operating for some time. The others are not strictly sanctions. They are a number of unilateral measures, that we have been taking for some time, concerning such things as add-on computers, new nuclear contracts, and so on. The only two small ones are on krugerrands, where we have agreed to do all that we can,

because there are legal limitations, to stop their importation&#x2014;the import is very small indeed&#x2014;and to stop new grants from taxpayers' money for trade missions to South Africa.<br/>
Several eminent persons are under consideration for the mission to which I referred. I am sure that the right hon. Gentleman will be able to add to the list which he has already provided.<br/>
I was pleased to hear what the right hon. Gentleman said about stopping violence and that all his hon. Friends want the violence to stop. That is not what I thought he was saying, as he appears to support Mr. Tambo, and what Mr. Tambo has said:
<q>The ANC will go to every conceivable length to destroy the apartheid system in South Africa. The escalated armed struggle cannot avoid the use of guns.</q>
I understand that the right hon. Gentleman totally and utterly rejects that statement, and I am delighted to hear it.<br/>
As regards the talks in New York, the SDI research, as the right hon. Gentleman knows, is outside the antiballistic missile treaty. I do not believe that the Americans will negotiate on research. There is no way, as the right hon. Gentleman should know, in which one can verify what research is going on. I think, therefore, that research on both sides of the strategic defence initiative &#x2014;because a good deal is being carried out on the Soviet side &#x2014; will continue and will not be bargainable in these talks.<br/>
As regards the new possible initiative, the United States put forward proposals at Geneva in the talks on strategic arms reduction for radical reductions in ballistic missile warheads&#x2014;a cut of nearly 50 per cent. in the current Soviet level. That was put down in the spring. Those proposals, together with a look at the new Gorbachev proposals, will, I believe, give rise to new initiatives before the talks are actually started.<br/>
President Reagan has said that he will come to NATO to tell us the results of the talks after they have taken place, so that he will have consulted both before and after them. Regional conflicts will, I believe, be on the agenda, but, as the right hon. Gentleman knows, it is not easy to find solutions to the middle east conflict.</p>

<p>Will my right hon. Friend rub in still further to the Leader of the Opposition the message that, whatever the shortcomings of the South African Government, President Botha has done more to reform and to roll back or contain the Soviet interference on the northern borders than the Governments of South Africa with whom the Labour party was happy to work? Will she confirm that while arms control is essential, the regional problems of Angola, Afghanistan. Cambodia and Nicaragua have been the main cause of the arms race over the past few years, and that it is essential that the Soviet Union should realise this?</p>

<p>I agree with my right hon. Friend that the South African Government have taken more steps than were taken by any of their predecessors to start the process of dismantling apartheid. A considerable number of measures have been taken&#x2014;the Mixed Marriages Act and section 16 of the Immorality Act have been repealed, almost all job reservations have been removed and forced removals have been suspended, the abolition of influx control and pass laws has been recommended to the President by his advisory council, and a common


citizenship for all South Africans has been restored. These are considerable steps towards the process of removing apartheid&#x2014;a process which will need to continue, and to which the dialogue is directed.<br/>
I agree that, as well as arms control, it is vital that some trouble spots in the world, including Afghanistan &#x2014;which is illegally occupied&#x2014;central America and other parts of the world, and the presence of Cuban troops in Africa must be discussed at the summit because that are manifestations of the difference of approach between the Soviet Union and the United States.</p>

<p>In the light of the talks with President Reagan, will the Prime Minister give a sign of the British attitude on two specific aspects of the anti-ballistic missile treaty? First, do we believe that the nine technology demonstrations planned as part of the strategic defence initiative programme in the United States are outlined by the treaty? Secondly, do we believe that the Soviet Union is in breach of the ABM treaty because of its radar installations?</p>

<p>We believe in what is known as the more conventional interpretation of the treaty, which includes most, although not all, of the testing. There have been suggestions that certain actions are not in compliance with the treaty. These actions probably fall into two kinds &#x2014; those which may be genuine non-compliance, and those which result from an ambiguity of the wording of the treaty. The treaty provides a way to sort out those problems, because machinery exists, in the standing consultative commission on the treaty, for the United States and the Soviet Union to discuss implementation of the ABM treaty. That appears to be the right place to discuss compliance if there are suggestions that the treaty is not being complied with.</p>

<p>As my hon.

<p>If the hon. Gentleman would like more aid to be provided, and I am the first to understand the reasons why, we have to look at our other expenditure.

<p>I do not think that the case for a Palestinian voice is in dispute. It is who should represent that voice that is in dispute. As my hon. Friend knows, we tried to take an initiative and there was a carefully measured statement. We do not accept violence as a means of pursuing a political end. Unfortunately, the Jordanian-Palestinian delegation was not seen by my right hon. and learned Friend the Foreign Secretary, for very good reasons. The understanding on which the meeting was set up was not a statement that they were prepared to make. Nevertheless, we must persist in trying to get a settlement of the middle east problem. The United States, Jordan and Prime Minister Peres understand that before negotiations can start there must be a framework of international support.

<p>The Prime Minister is surely aware that to include private flow figures is a smokescreen in relation to the overall aid programme; that the average figures for the OECD disguise the fact that Britain, in terms of aid per head, is 12th among the OECD countries and is giving half that which is given by most Scandinavian countries, and only a quarter of that which is given by Norway. Does the Prime Minister realise that if she, with other Heads of Government, were to achieve the 0&#x00B7;7 per cent. target it could create 2 million jobs in the OECD countries, many of which would come to the United Kingdom? When will she set at least a teeny-weeny target, such as increasing aid from 0&#x00B7;33 to 0&#x00B7;35 per cent. of GNP, so that we can have some indication that aid will go up rather than down?</p>

<p>I do not accept the hon. Gentleman's premise that we should not also look at private flows. Many Heads of Government are prepared and anxious to get more private capital into those countries because they wish to develop their resources. If the Opposition would like more money to be spent on aid, as many people would, they must not spend money at the same time on other things. If expenditure at home on social security goes up and up, what can be spent on giving help


abroad will not be sufficient. Therefore, the Opposition should look at expenditure at home if they wish to change the balance.</p>

<p>I think that many people there realised not only that sanctions would cause great damage to industries in South Africa but that they could be counterproductive, in that they would induce exactly the attitude that we do not wish to have. They would also have very damaging effects on the African countries which have tried to increase trade with South Africa a great deal in the last year. As some countries pointed out, they, too, have preferential trading arrangements with South Africa which

they do not wish to stop. There was a good deal more reality than would appear from some of the rhetoric. The hon. Gentleman should not lose sight of that.</p>

Is her opposition not precisely to do with the fact that British companies own 40 per cent. of foreign investment in South Africa?

<speech hansard_id="358639" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1985-10-29a.825.1" hansard_membership_id="5998" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/16448" speakername="The Secretary of State for the Home Department (Mr. Douglas Hurd)" colnum="825" time="16:04:00">
<p>Following the recent exchanges in the House, I will, with your permission, Mr. Speaker, make a statement about representations made by right hon. and hon. Members in immigration cases.<br/>
Ministers receive large numbers of representations from Members of this House on a wide variety of individual cases. What distinguishes those made on behalf of passengers refused entry at the ports is that they have the effect of securing an immediate change in the action that would otherwise be taken by the immigration service under the relevant statutory provisions. The service is by convention, though not by law, precluded from arranging the passenger's removal until the hon. Member's representations have been received and considered. In the vast majority of cases, the passenger is granted temporary admission. In a small minority of cases, he may be held in detention at the port.<br/>
Home Office Ministers received representations on immigration cases about 20 times a week in 1980. Last year, the average was some 70 a week. During the past few weeks there have been 200 representations a week. The increase since 1980 is not the result of some dramatic change in the criteria being employed by immigration officers at the ports in operating the immigration rules. Nor can it be explained by an increase in passenger traffic, which has increased by 25 per cent. while hon. Members representations have increased fivefold taking the year as a whole. What is happening is that hon. Members are being approached and asked to put stops on cases more often than in the past, and hon. Members are agreeing to ask for stops on cases more often than in the past.<br/>
That increase has created real administrative problems for the staff at the ports. People are being temporarily admitted who do not qualify as visitors under the rules, and who often spend a considerable time here. The diversion of staff to deal with increasing representations and the case work involved has meant that visitors who are fully qualified find themselves held up and inconvenienced at Heathrow.<br/>
Against that background, I believe that it was entirely right for my hon. and learned Friend the Minister of State to bring the position to the notice of the House. I wish to make it clear that my hon. and learned Friend was not at any time sugesting that the law had been broken. In his letter yesterday to the right hon. Member for Manchester, Gorton (Mr. Kaufman), he described the ways in which the present arrangements are being misused.<br/>
It was argued yesterday that my hon. and learned Friend should have given specific examples to the House of the action taken by particular hon. Members. As he explained, he could not have done that without revealing the terms of the letters that they had written to or about individual immigrants and, in two cases, letters written by them to third parties. He is writing today to 23 hon. Members, whose cases are examples of the various problems that we are facing, seeking their permission to make such correspondence public.<br/>
There are obvious difficulties, for example when hon. Members make representations on behalf of sponsors of whom they have made no inquiries, and when they arrange for a stop to be placed on a passenger's removal but fail

to follow up the initial telephone call with a confirmatory letter. There is also concern that some hon. Members are willing to take up cases from outside their constituencies, which the constituency Member has chosen not to pursue. Here again, some restatement of the agreed conventions of the House is needed.<br/>
Finally, there are one or two cases in which it seems to us that an hon. Member is deliberately facilitating the attempt to secure the temporary admission of a passenger whom he has every reason to believe would not qualify for entry under the rules approved by this House. I am not suggesting that, even where that happens, hon. Members have acted unlawfully; they have not. But if their actions were to be more widely copied, the result could only be the weakening of our system of immigration control, based at the ports of entry. I believe that our present system suits both our geography and our constitution and that we need collectively to consider how it can best continue to operate.<br/>
I ask the House to accept that we wish to make a genuine attempt to strike the right balance between the representations of hon. Members and the need for an effective and efficient control without the strains at present imposed on it. We are anxious to discuss these difficulties urgently with those in this House who are mainly concerned, in the hope of working out a sensible answer. In any case, there will not be any changes in our procedures before I have reported to the House.</p>

<p>I apologise for not being in my place when the Home Secretary rose to make his statement.<br/>
The House will wish to thank in equal measure both yourself, Mr. Speaker, and my right hon. Friend the Member for Blaenau Gwent (Mr. Foot), without whom the statement would not have been obtained. Even after the right hon. Gentleman's statement, and the strange letter sent to me yesterday by the Minister of State, the reckless allegations made by the Minister of State remain unsubstantiated.<br/>
The Home Secretary appears to be totally confused about the rules relating to visitors. He said that the Minister of State had talked about the right to enter. The Home Secretary talked about the qualification of visitors &#x2014;he used the phrase "qualify as visitors"&#x2014;when most would-be visitors have the automatic right to enter unless deprived of it by the Home Secretary. The huge increase in representations from hon. Members to which Ministers have drawn attention proves that the Minister of State is increasingly withdrawing the right of entry from certain categories of visitor.<br/>
We totally reject the claim that there has been no change in the way in which the rules are being administered, and we are worried by the Home Secretary referring in his statement to changes in procedure. Will he categorically assure the House that he has no intention of imposing a visa requirement for visitors or limiting the existing rights of hon. Members?<br/>
As for alleged "abuses," they are not abuses at all. If an hon. Member was confined to taking up cases the full particulars of which he knew, as mentioned by the Minister of State in his letter, we should none of us be able to take up social security or income tax cases, because we take up those cases to get the facts. That is so in these cases as well. If an hon. Member&#x2014;again, as requested and apparently required by the Minister of State &#x2014; were


confined to taking up only the cases of constituents he knew personally, thousands of people in every constituency would never have any cases taken up.<br/>
Other allegations made by the Minister relate to relationships between hon. Members. They are matters, if at all, not for the Government, not for the Home Secretary, not for the Minister of State but for you, Mr. Speaker, and the House.<br/>
In essence, the allegations that the Government are making add up to a whine about the actions of hon. Members being an inconvenience to the Executive. But one of the most essential functions of an hon. Member is to be an inconvenience to the Executive. If the volume of representations is a burden to the Home Office and its Ministers, let me make it absolutely clear that the administration of the rules of entry is a burden to thousands of our constituents looking forward to visits from relatives. The Home Secretary looks upon those people as inconvenient statistics, but they are human beings with warm family feelings, and they have the same right to have visits as any other of our constituents. Our efforts to help them may be a great deal of trouble to Ministers, but we are determined to go on helping them, and that is a lesson that the Home Secretary had better learn.<br/>
On Thursday, the Minister of State twice asserted that some hon. Members were "abusing their right." Yesterday in the exchanges in the House he used the word "abuse" three times. In his letter to me he used the word "abuse" nine times. Today in his statement the Home Secretary did not once use the word "abuse." Instead, he mentioned 23 hon. Members whose cases, he said, were examples of
<q>the problems that we are facing.</q>
We want to know clearly and without equivocation from the Home Secretary whether he alleges that hon. Members have been abusing their position. If he says that there has been abuse, we want the names. We demand the names, because hon. Members have the right to defend themselves against charges made by Ministers in this House.

<p>The right hon. Gentleman must have worked that response out before he heard my statement. He is perfectly correct to say that I did not use the word "abuse". I used the word "misuse". If, with his knowledge of the English language, he wants to make something of that, he is welcome to do so.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman will get the names. My hon. and learned Friend is setting about the task in the right way. He is writing today to 23 hon. Members asking for their consent that the correspondence in question illustrating those problems should be published. That is straightforward and that is what is happening.<br/>
On the substance of the matter, I reiterate that the policy has not changed since my hon. and learned Friend has been responsible for it. I will read to the House, because it is the heart of the matter, rule 17 of the immigration rules. It is what immigration officers have administered under the supervision of my hon. and learned Friend and under the supervision of Ministers of State of Labour Governments. It is, in essence, the same rule:
<q>A passenger seeking entry as a visitor, including one coming to stay with relatives or friends, is to be admitted if he satisfies the immigration officer that he is genuinely seeking entry for the

period of the visit as stated by him and that for that period he will maintain and accommodate himself and any dependants, or will, with any dependants, be maintained and accommodated adequately by relatives or friends, without working or recourse to public funds, and can meet the cost of the return or onward journey.</q>
That simple requirement has existed for many years. That is what immigration officers must administer, and there has been no change in it.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman referred to visas. As he knows &#x2014;and again, as has been the practice&#x2014;the position is kept under continuous review. The comparison that the right hon. Gentleman made with social security benefits was illuminating. We are all the time asking as constituency Members, for example, that benefit for one or other of our constituents should be reconsidered or increased. But we do not expect the benefit automatically to be increased while our representations are being considered.<br/>
What, so far as I know, makes this facility unique is that there is a covention&#x2014; which the right hon. Gentleman supports and wishes to maintain, as I do &#x2014; that automatically a stop is placed and the action that would otherwise be taken is suspended. The problem is now caused partly by the increasing number of arrivals and partly by the increase in the number of representations.<br/>
It is not a matter of inconvenience to the Home Office or of administrative inconvenience. <i>[Interruption.]</i> The principal consequence is that under the rule to which I referred people who should not be allowed entry are allowed in. That is not what Parliament intended, and we should consider carefully among ourselves how this facility, which we wish to preserve, is to be preserved.</p>

Secondly, does the right hon. Gentleman accept that it is inevitable that an hon. Member may have to act urgently to prevent a visitor being sent back without knowing the full facts of the case at that point? Does he agree that one


can ascertain the details and make proper representations only after a stop has been put on a constituent's relative, and he has, perhaps, been sent back to his home country?<br/>
Does the right hon. Gentleman recognise that there is often a great deal of bewilderment on the part of both the visitor and the family? In many instances the visitor may not be able to understand why he has been prevented from making an ordinary visit to his family, and many families offer the very bond that his hon. Friend the Member for Hornsey and Wood Green (Sir H. Rossi) suggested. Does the right hon.

That is one of the larger examples of what is going wrong. It is because we want to preserve the facility that right hon. and hon.

<p>Is the Home Secretary aware that the matter is far more complicated than he seems to understand? He is a new Home Secretary and I for one would be prepared to talk to him seriously on the issue and even to lighten the burden of the Minister of State. The right hon. Gentleman must understand that those of us who represent large immigrant communities, or erstwhile immigrant communities, are bound to find that certain of the families receive visitors. One example is the Sikhs in my constituency. Through the problems in

India, for example, a number of young people have come in to Britain from India. That will have given rise inevitably to greater surveillance at the port of entry and will have placed a greater strain on the immigration officers, who are complaining bitterly of a shortage of staff and the way in which they have to treat passengers at the port of entry. All that has to be considered.<br/>
I should like to involve you to some extent, Mr. Speaker, and put it in the mind of the Home Secretary that it has always been traditional in the House of Commons that, if a constituent claims that his Member has failed or refused to act for him, it is an elementary fact that any hon. Member is qualified to act for him. There are only a few occasions when I have had so to act but occasionally I do, and I find mostly that Tory Members are pleased that I do so when they are absent on holiday or for other reasons. I shall continue so to act according to the tradition of the House.</p>

I emphasise that there has not been any change of policy or of the rules. However, a problem is being created and I agree with the hon. Gentleman that there is a need to discuss the issue carefully, in whatever way is most orderly, to find a way of easing the strain.

<p>I have already answered a question about visas. I agree with my hon. Friend that one of the problems and one of the symptoms of strain in the machine is that visitors who are wholly entitled under the rule that I have read to come into Britain on a visit are held up and inconvenienced, especially at terminal 3 at Heathrow, because of the increasing number of people who are not so entitled but who present themselves.</p>

This creates enormous problems in places such as Birmingham and elsewhere, which adds to the festering situation.<br/>
What does the right hon. Gentleman expect Members to do when they are knocked up in the middle of the night to find that someone, perhaps soaked to the skin, has come from Heathrow upon being told by an immigration officer, "Unless we hear from your MP by early in the morning, your elderly father will be sent back home"? Is that not an outrage to the integrity of our affairs? Does the right hon.


Gentleman expect hon. Members to be sitting at home every day and every week, including weekends and holidays, to placate the demands of the immigration service as required by Home Office Ministers?</p>

<p>It is quite clear from what the Home Secretary has said that he is straining at a gnat. Is he aware that last Thursday in the House, the Minister of State said that 1 million Commonwealth and Pakistani people had been allowed into the country last year and that he had representations during 1980 in only 1,000 cases and was expecting representations from Members in 4,500 cases this year? In other words, 1,000 was less than 0&#x00B7;01 per cent. If it is 4,500 this year, it will be less than 0&#x00B7;05 per cent. The Minister has referred to the rule. I have been in discussion with the Minister of State since last Friday&#x2014;five days&#x2014;about a black man whose brother is a British citizen. That British citizen has signed a statement, which I have here, with the Bangladesh High Commissioner saying he will keep, look after and be responsible for him and will see that he returns. That man has been refused entry into the country, kept on remand at public expense, and questioned during those five days. Can the Home Secretary look into that case? It constitutes a disgusting state of affairs, and I am very angry about it. It is one of the worst cases I have had for some years and it arises only because the man is black.</p>

<p>I cannot comment on the hon. Member's individual case, but he is perfectly entitled to put it. There is no dispute about that. I will give again the figures which


relate to his first point. Representations by Members in port refusal cases have grown from about 1,000 a year in 1980, 1981 and 1982 to 3,532 last year. Up to 22 October this year the total was about 5,000. That is the fivefold increase I was talking about, and that is what is creating the strains. In view of the general conclusion made by the hon. Member, I should add that the proportion of refusals to entry has remained basically static during this time. It is not true that immigration officers are turning away or refusing entry to a larger proportion of people.</p>

Secondly, I have no doubt that the whole House accepts that the system is under tremendous strain. In this get together of hon.

<p>Will the Home Secretary admit that the Minister of State lost his temper and made false allegations and that that is the cause of the whole problem? The Minister of State should apologise to the House.<br/>
It is understandable that the Home Secretary does not understand the operation of immigration control. He told my hon. Friend the Member for East Kilbride (Dr. Miller) that his story about what happened in Scotland was not typical, but he was wrong. These problems for our constituents occur every week. Genuine family members come here to visit their relations but they are turned away. Their only way in is by ringing their Member of Parliament. This causes an enormous amount&#x2014; [HON. MEMBERS: "Their Member of Parliament&#x2014; not you."] Let me say to those Conservative Members who shout that one of the reasons why Opposition Members are troubled by people who do not live in their constituencies is that they are telephoned by people who say, "My MP is racist and will not represent me."</p>

<p>I believe that Labour Members should compile a list of the people who frequently approach them. The origin of this problem is the fact that too many genuine visitors are refused entry.

<p>The hon. Lady is ignoring the fact that the proportion of refusals is no higher than it used to be. These facts are clearly established, but they do not suit the hon. Lady's doctrine.

On the hon. Lady's first point, I think that it would be a poor day if a Minister could not come to the House at Question Time to explain something and volunteer views on a matter that was causing all of us genuine concern. That is what my hon. and learned Friend the Minister of State did, and I think that he would have been wrong not to do so.</p>

<p>Does the Home Secretary agree that, so long as visitors who are refused entry to Britain are denied any right of appeal, the rights of Members of Parliament to stop removal and have a review of the immigration officer's decision are of great importance? Does he also agree that the serious allegations by the Minister of State are clearly a smokescreen behind which the Government are preparing to introduce a visa requirement for citizens of the new Commonwealth and Pakistan who wish to visit Britain in the future? Will the right hon. Gentleman give an undertaking, therefore, that no such visa requirement will be introduced without the clear approval of the House, in order to avoid the embarrassment that the Government might incur by introducing visa requirements while the House is not sitting next week? Will the right hon.

<p>The hon.

<p>The Home Secretary has demonstrated a misunderstanding of what concerns Opposition Members. In dealing with the analogy of a person whose Member of Parliament seeks to obtain for him or her an increase in social security benefit, he says that the social security benefit is not increased while the application by the Member of Parliament is being considered. When the Member of Parliament's application is being considered, the social security benefit is not removed. The person whould be removed from the country unless the hon. Member made the application. That is the whole basis of the stop procedure.<br/>
The Home Secretary said that he wishes to discuss these matters with the hon. Members concerned. If he is willing to have discussions now, why did the Minister of State not ask for discussions before making his reckless allegations to the House last Thursday? Throughout the exchanges today the Home Secretary has consistently used the word "misuse" and consistently withdrawn from the word "abuse" which was used by his hon. and learned Friend.

It has been revealed that the Minister of State, Home Office, has written to 23 right hon. and hon. Members on both sides of the House asking for their permission to make public the correspondence that has passed between them and him. I assume that the correspondence will be made public by publication in <i>Hansard</i> or by copies being placed in the Library. However, the correspondence between an hon. Member and a Minister must be on the basis of confidentiality between the hon. Member and his constituent. No hon. Member has a right to reveal correspondence unless he has the explicit permission of the constituent to whom the correspondence refers.<br/>
Could I put it to you, Mr. Speaker, that it is a very dangerous practice for Ministers of the Crown of arty Government to come to the House and make an accusation about Members abusing their position and then defend that accusation by challenging them, on the following day, to allow him to publish the correspondence? I am glad that the Leader of the House has remained in his place, because this is a very serious intrusion into the way in which Members of Parliament carry out their work on behalf of their constituents.</p>

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. The Minister, in the exchange over the immigration rules, repeated once more the insinuation and the allegation that a number of Members of Parliament have been acting improperly, and he now confirms that he has written to 23 of them. Presumably he will ensure that the names of those 23 will appear in <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> tomorrow.

<p>With permission, Mr. Speaker, I should like to make a statement about the outcome of the trial concluded yesterday of eight service men under the Official Secrets Acts.<br/>
On 3 February 1984 a senior aircraftsman of 9 Signal Regiment based in Cyprus failed to complete unit clearance procedures prior to being posted back to the United Kingdom. On 6 February he was interviewed by the deputy unit security officer of the regiment. From this interview it appeared that a breach of security had occurred and the senior aircraftsman was arrested. His case was referred to the RAF provost and security service in Cyprus. Subsequently, the Army special investigations branch was also brought in since it appeared that soldiers as well as RAF personnel were involved. As is the standard procedure where a breach of the Offical Secrets Acts may have occurred, the Ministry of Defence security authorities brought the matter to the attention of the Director of Public Prosecutions during the course of their investigation.<br/>
On 15 March 1984, in view of the seriousness of the alleged breaches of security, the Director asked the Metropolitan police special branch to assume responsibility for the conduct of the investigation and in the light of its investigation he considered that the evidence justified prosecutions under the Official Secrets Acts. On 11 April the Attorney General consented to the prosecution of seven service men, who were charged on 13 April. The Attorney General subsequently consented to the prosecution of an eighth service man, who was charged on 8 June 1984.<br/>
As the House is aware, the service men charged have all been acquitted. Their future in the services will be determined in accordance with normal service regulations. These afford a right of appeal to the service boards, which include Ministers, before any final decision on their future is taken.<br/>
As the House is aware, the Security Commission reports to my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister. As my right hon. Friend stated to the House earlier today, she decided in June 1984 that, given the gravity of the apparent breaches of security and the length of time the trial proceedings would be likely to take, it would be right to make an immediate reference to the Security Commission. The reference was not announced at the time, so as not in any way to prejudice the course of justice. In the light of the acquittals, my right hon. Friend will consult the chairman of the Security Commission and report to the House in due course.<br/>
The House will wish to know of the steps that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence has taken in the light of what has occurred. First, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State was first informed of the possibility of a breach of security on 10 February 1984. In the light of further information he decided that there should be an investigation of the security arrangements and procedures in 9 Signal Regiment which was to be led by the security service. In parallel with this investigation my right hon. Friend instructed that further investigations should be carried out into security procedures in all other static communications units of all three services which handle sensitive traffic. These security investigations produced a large number of detailed recommendations for


enhancing security at the units concerned. Most of them have been accepted, and either have been or are being implemented.<br/>
Secondly, my right hon. Friend has decided that there should be an independent inquiry into the way in which the service police carried out their investigations of the eight men originally accused. Mr. David Calcutt, QC, has agreed to conduct this inquiry and to complete it as quickly as is practical. He will start work next week. His terms of reference will be as follows:
<q>To inquire into the question of whether the investigations carried out by the Royal Air Force's provost marshal branch and the Army's special investigation branch into matters which formed the substance of charges subsequently laid under the Official Secrets Acts against SAC Geoffrey Jones, SAC Adam Lightowler, SAC Wayne Kriehn, SAC Christopher Payne, SAC Gwynn Owen, Lance Corporal Anthony Glass, Signalman Martin Tuffy, and Signalman David Hardman were carried out in accordance with lawful and proper procedures; to report with all practicable speed; and to make recommendations as to any relevant procedure.</q>
Subject to the usual security considerations, it is my right hon. Friend's intention that Mr. Calcutt's report will be published.</p>

<p>The Opposition are relieved that, on this occasion at least, the Ministry of Defence has reacted to the anger and outrage expressed on both sides of the House and outside at the revelations during the spy trial at the Old Bailey and in particular at the way in which confessions were extracted from defendants who were subsequently acquitted by a jury.<br/>
The Minister has announced the setting up of an inquiry and we welcome that. We shall scrutinise its powers and await its conclusions with interest. I remind the Minister and the House that this is the third occasion in little more than a year when prosecutions have been brought under the Official Secrets Acts emanating from activities within the Ministry of Defence and that on each occasion an Old Bailey jury has acquitted the defendants, and I remind the Minister that in this case the jury also rejected confessions extracted from the accused by investigators and interrogators at the Ministry of Defence.<br/>
Some fundamental questions remain which cannot be dealt with by the inquiry. In effect, they relate to ministerial responsibility within the Department for the prosecutions and also responsibility to the House. Who on earth at the Ministry of Defence was responsible for putting together a case which turned out to be so full of holes and based to a considerable extent on confessions extracted by means at best dubious and at worst barbaric?<br/>
Secondly, were the Minister and the Secretary of State at any time informed in their capacity as Ministers of the course of the investigations? Were they told about the interrogations? Did they know what was going on? Were they told the length of time for which the accused were interrogated and how long many of them were incarcerated? What were Ministers told about the inquiries while those inquiries were going on? Are we to believe that the Minister of State for the Armed Forces, beavering away at his desk churning out all the answers for which he is famous, and the Secretary of State knew nothing whatever about the conduct of those investigations and interrogations? The House deserves to know exactly how much they knew about what was going on. Did no alarm bells ring when in a previous case another Cyprus service man was acquitted at the Old Bailey?<br/>
Thirdly, will the Minister explain the third paragraph of his statement, relating to the future of the service men involved? Will they have to go through another harrowing experience in terms of military discipline and procedures or are the Government prepared to accept the jury's verdict and to allow those service men to continue with their careers as they were doing before they were interrupted?<br/>
What thought has been given to compensation for the service men and for their families, who have also suffered, as those men's careers have clearly been blighted?<br/>
Finally, the Minister referred to the Security Commission. Has the Security Commission now cleared the security arrangements at that establishment in Cyprus?</p>

<p>I am glad that the right hon. Gentleman has welcomed the setting up of the inquiry to be carried out by Mr. Calcutt. With regard to the conduct of the service police investigators, I suggest it would be much more proper to await the outcome of Mr. Calcutt's investigations and detailed inquiry before leaping to any conclusions on that. As for the responsibility for putting the case together, the decision to prosecute lies entirely with the Director of Public Prosecutions and the handling of the case is his responsibility.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman asked whether Ministers were informed in detail about the questioning of those facing the accusations. The answer is that they were not. The established procedure in the Department is that judges' rules apply, and the central issue that Mr. Calcutt will be examining is whether those conducting the questioning did so in conformity with judges' rules.<br/>
As for the future of the service men involved, I made it clear in my statement that they will have every opportunity to be considered within the service regulations. It goes without saying that the Department fully accepts the verdict on the allegations which were subject to the judicial proceedings in relation to the Official Secrets Acts. It also made it clear that the service men have a right of appeal to service boards on which Ministers sit. Compensation is not and never has been available in such cases.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman's question about the Security Commission is a matter for my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister and I must ask the right hon. Gentleman to address it to her.</p>

<p>Does my right hon. Friend accept that in the case of my constituent, Senior Aircraftsman Wayne Kriehn, the anger and bitterness of the young man's parents is deep and it is shared by many who know the boy in question? Does my right hon. Friend accept that in May 1984 I wrote to him passing on information given to me by the boy's parents that the confession had been extorted by interrogation in solitary confinement? Does he further accept that my hon. Friend the Member for Clwyd, North-West (Sir A. Meyer) and I wrote to the Secretary of State in August 1984 detailing our wider concern in the light of further talks with two of the prisoners? Given that background, does my right hon. Friend feel that there is a lesson to be learnt with regard to the continuing role of the services and the Ministry of Defence in looking after the welfare of service men awaiting trial in civil proceedings?<br/>
Looking to the future, will my right hon. Friend be a little more forthcoming about the opportunities now open to a man such as my constituent Wayne Kriehn, whom the


defending solicitor described as a high flier? Having put the matter to a civil court in preference to a court martial, it seems reasonable not to seek to reverse the process and attempt to try the people involved again.</p>

<p>I assure my hon. Friend that there is no question of trying the individuals concerned in any other way in relation to the Official Secrets Acts. As for any other matters, I assure my hon. Friend that there is no contemplation of any further proceedings on the evidence available to us at the moment.<br/>
We are, of course, aware of the earlier correspondence and my hon. Friend rightly acknowledged that he was expressing the particular concerns that he described, but I am sure that he too will wish to await the conclusions of Mr. Calcutt's inquiry before reaching any final conclusion as to the validity of the complaints that were put to him.<br/>
On the wider policy issue of the continuing role of the services in being responsible for service men facing procedures in civilian courts, as the service men remain members of the services during that period I suggest that it is right that they should remain within a service environment and that the services should remain responsible for them. The crucial requirement is that they be afforded the same rights and protection as civilians in the same situation, and that is the object of the policy.</p>

<p>There was no reference in the Minister's statement to any assistance having been sought from the Cypriot police authorities. Will the Minister explain why that was so? Is it true that the prosecution went ahead without any effort being made to ascertain whether any independent corroboration of the confessions was available in Cyprus? Secondly, is the Minister satisfied that no secrets have been lost in relation to the base in Cyprus, and does he accept that, even if he is satisfied, the House cannot be satisfied until there is parliamentary scrutiny of the security services?</p>

<p>On the last point&#x2014;this is as far as I can go&#x2014;at the time of the original investigations it was the clear view of the Ministry of Defence security authorities that there was a real likelihood of a serious breach of security having occurred. That was the basis of the relevant papers being passed to the Director of Public Prosecutions. The decision to prosecute is, of course, entirely a matter for the Director of Public Prosecutions in consultation with the Attorney-General and they were afforded full access to all the relevant information.<br/>
I cannot elaborate on the involvement of other agencies, but the hon. Member can be certain that all reasonable steps were taken to see whether there was any additional evidence in relation to the confessions made by the men.</p>

<p>Does my right hon. Friend agree that the main point is whether the alleged statements made by the defendants were voluntary?

Does my right hon.

<p>The independent prosecution service will not impinge on proceedings relating to the armed services. I can assure the right hon.

<p>I understand that that is the case as far as my Department is concerned. I should like to make it clear that in matters such as this, where there is an alleged serious breach of the Official Secrets Acts, there is an obligation on my Department to submit the relevant papers to the Director of Public Prosecutions. This is not a matter where we have discretion, and the papers automatically go to the Director of Public Prosecutions in such cases in accordance with the rules which have been laid down.</p>

It then went to the Army investigation branch which sent it to the Director of Public Prosecutions, who sent it to the special branch, who returned it to the Director of Public Prosecutions, who finally sent it to the Attorney General, whose guidelines then became involved. Is there not a defect in a decision-making process which allows eight service men to be charged and brought to the Old Bailey on the flimsiest and most insubstantial evidence, which the jury must then consider? Is that not an appropriate subject for inquiry?</p>

<p>I do not think that the hon. Member for Middlesbrough (Mr. Bell) can fairly come to the conclusion that there is a defect in the procedures &#x2014; [HON. MEMBERS: "Why not?"] Because, until Mr. Calcutt has reached his conclusions, there is no possible justification for saying that. The House must appreciate that it is a fundamental responsibility of all three services and of defence Ministers to take the necessary procedural and administrative steps to ensure that the classified and highly sensitive material with which many service men are involved is properly protected. Where breaches of security may have occurred, it is important that there is a procedure clearly laid down for bringing the appropriate cases rapidly to the attention of the Director of Public Prosecutions. There is nothing in this case which makes us feel anxious that the procedure was not followed.<br/>
It is essential that where the armed services' security authorities decide that a serious breach of security may have taken place and that there is a potentially serious breach of the Official Secrets Acts, the relevant papers are drawn to the attention of the Director of Public Prosecutions.</p>

Are those powers to include the power to summon witnesses to take evidence on oath or to grant immunity? Surely, failure to give Mr. Calcutt such powers would render his investigation abortive.

<p>My right hon. Friend will no doubt agree that in most Communist countries people who confess are never acquitted, and this case is a triumph of our system. Will not my right hon.

<p>I agree entirely with my hon. Friend's first point, that the mere fact of an acquittal is not a matter of criticism under British justice. That matter seems to have been forgotten by some. There are specific provisions


in the Police and Criminal Evidence Act that make it necessary for my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State to publish codes to ensure that service men facing criminal charges will have the same protection as civilians in questioning and related areas.</p>

<p>Will the Minister deal with a specific point? Were the confessions of the service men ruled inadmissible by the trial judge? Upon being acquitted, did the defendants make an application for costs? Does the Minister appreciate that Mr. David Calcutt's inquiry is welcome, but it must take a certain amount of time, and in the intervening period, the acquitted defendants' service careers and reputation are in jeopardy? The Minister seems to imply by innuendo that being acquitted is not the same as innocence; therefore there is a continual slur upon the reputations of those defendants.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman's last comment is wholly wrong. I believe I made it clear that those men have have been found innocent, and that verdict is totally accepted by Ministers and by the armed services. I give the clearest possible assurance on that point. In answer to the hon.

The confessions of the remaining seven service men were not ruled inadmissible by the judge.</p>

<p>Does my right hon. Friend agree that the jury system, as the only shield against injustice, was never better vindicated than in this case; and that in serious matters like this, military tribunals are not effective? The service men would almost certainly have been found guilty under that system. Will my right hon. Friend reconsider compensation? I believe that most of us think that to be charged with treason is possibly worse than being charged with murder, particularly in the armed forces. Bearing in mind that those men and their families have suffered for 22 months, does he not agree that it is ludicrous to think that those men may want to stay in the forces which, bluntly, have treated them so badly, as my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel (Mr. Marshall) pointed out? My right hon.

<p>I certainly agree with my hon. Friend's opening remarks, and all of us in the House endorse the jury system. I am grateful for my hon.

<p>As a former military policeman, I think that the important question is whether lawful procedures were followed. Section 75(1) of the Air Force Act 1955 gives protection to airmen against unnecessary delays in the criminal investigation of offences.

<p>I am sure that the House is grateful to the hon. Gentleman for the benefit of his relevant experience. The question whether correct procedures were followed is central to Mr. Calcutt's inquiry. There can be no final answer on that matter until he produces his report. However, I can assure the hon.

<p>Can the Minister make a couple of factual observations which do not affect the inquiry? Were the original investigating officers in the case of the Cyprus seven the same officers who investigated the case of Paul Davies?<br/>
Secondly, will the Minister confirm that Mr. Costas Elenas, who was referred to throughout the trial, undertook to act as a witness, but that the Attorney-General was not prepared to give him immunity against prosecution in Britain? The Minister has not been forthcoming on the powers of the tribunal. Will witnesses get immunity from prosecution when they appear before judges? Will the evidence be taken on oath? Will witnesses be compelled to come forward and give evidence on oath? Will protection be given to members of the services who give evidence, so that their careers will not be prejudiced in any way?<br/>
Regarding ministerial responsibility, the Opposition find it hard to accept that Ministers who have prosecuted Pontin, Paul Davies and now the Cyprus seven did not know what was going on. They should have seen the warning lights about discrepancies that were likely to appear and that there would be a powerful case for the defence in confessions taken under duress.<br/>

<p>As I said in my statement, as soon as this case came to light, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State rightly initiated an exhaustive study of the security procedures in Cyprus and related establishments worldwide. Recommendations arising from detailed investigations have been accepted and have been or are being implemented. No one can express absolute confidence in security, because any security is vulnerable. That is self-evident. I believe that my right hon. Friend has taken the correct steps. A number of changes in security have been made. We have done our utmost to prevent a repetition of this case.<br/>
I do not know whether the investigators involved in the earlier proceedings were also involved in this case. I will be happy to look into the matter and give the hon. Gentleman that information. Immunity for witnesses must be a matter for the Attorney General. I have already dealt with taking evidence on oath and with immunity. I made it clear that the question of immunity will be discussed between Mr. Calcutt and the Attorney General.</p>

<p>I beg to move,
<q>That leave be given to bring in a Bill to provide access for private individuals to information relating to themselves maintained by certain authorities, institutions and persons; to allow individuals to obtain copies of, and require corrections to be made to, such information; and to provide for the enforcement of these provisions.</q>
The House will be aware that a similar Bill was before us as recently as last Session. In July 1984 the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith) introduced a measure in very similar terms. This Bill, as did that, has all-party support. This Bill, as did that, will no doubt fall when the House is prorogued tomorrow afternoon.<br/>
The sponsors of the Bill have deliberately sought to draw the attention of the House to this measure on the last day of the parliamentary Session. This is done on the basis that it has merits which are unique and on which I hope to address the House briefly in a moment. We also seek to highlight opportunities in the forthcoming ballots for private Members' Bills, bringing with them, as they do automatically, the parliamentary time required to translate any such Bill to the statute book. Statutory provision for putting this Bill on the statute book is the goal of the sponsors, and nothing less will do.<br/>
If I did not run the risk of straying out of order, Mr. Speaker, I would spend the rest of my 10 minutes engaging in a commercial or a trailer for the private Members' ballot, because this Bill is unique in as much as it is achievable, it is non-controversial and a lot of time has been spent in making it such. It would have a profound impact in changing attitudes to secrecy in this country, and it would have widespread support. If it found favour this afternoon, the Bill would be in a printed form.<br/>
The timing of the measure is particularly appropriate. It is the next most obvious step in the whole campaign for freedom of information, which it would be in the interests of the country to achieve.<br/>
The need for the Bill is urgent and self-evident. Two major problems currently arise. Factual errors can be made, sometimes caused by carelessness, and at other times made in good faith. However the errors are generated, they can result in Executive action and administrative decisions leading to quite inappropriate treatment, in a health context, or other equally serious personal injustices.<br/>
The most recent example that has come to my notice was the tragic death of four-year-old Jasmine Beckford, where it became clear in the subsequent inquiry that the report on the foster parents, when Jasmine Beckford was taken from them, was quite inaccurate and may have contributed to the decision by the social work department to return her to her stepfather and natural mother. Alternatively, situations can arise where information of a highly subjective or speculative nature or pure opinion can be included in a file which, if promulgated unchallenged, can cause distress and damage which can be prejudicial to individuals. As an example, health records may contain comments such as "Doesn't like doctors." This health record pursues the person throughout his medical history and can have unfortunate and unjustified results.<br/>
There have been some encouraging signs. Some of these problems are being recognised in some quarters. Some authorities and professional bodies already actively encourage a policy of free access, and the results of this experience, such as have been reported, are wholly beneficial. The experience reported from other countries which operate a policy of free access is also wholly encouraging. The House should study with care the results of the introduction of free access in America, where a staggeringly high number of reported errors and inaccuracies was found when the policy was introduced.<br/>
Our Government have, in a limited way, introduced systems which allow some access in certain situations. For example, the Housing Act 1980 means that housing applications are now covered to some extent. There is also the Education Act 1981 and the DHSS circular of 1983 on guidance to social work authorities. These are all encouraging and very welcome signs.<br/>
The Bill will also redress the anomaly that will exist in November 1987 after the full implementation of the Data Protection Act, which creates a statutory right of access to electronically but not manually stored information. We shall then be in the ridiculous position that if a person lives in a part of the country where records are stored electronically he can have access, but if they are not so stored he is denied access.<br/>
The powers of the Bill allow an individual to discover whether certain records are held, allow for the supply of copies of any records, allow inaccuracies to be corrected, allow individuals to seek compensation where damage or distress can be proved to have flowed from errors, and allow recourse to the courts if the authority holding the information fails to comply with the law.<br/>
The Bill embraces the principal public authorities providing services to the public. This includes health authorities, individual doctors, education authorities, social work departments, any credit agencies that keep records of the ratings of an individual and certain administration of justice records, and authorities whose duties include the administration of benefits, grants and other types of assistance to the public.<br/>
The restriction to these public authorities is a deliberate compromise. Some sponsors would like the Bill to be much more widely drawn, but it is deliberately limited to enhance the prospects of wider acceptance, and therefore increase the chances of its getting on to the statute book.<br/>
The important part of that compromise, and the important exceptions built into the Bill, can be briefly stated. They are that information will not be released when it involves the privacy of any other person, when it reveals the identity of someone who gave information on a confidential basis, when someone other than the applicant might be subjected to physical harm as a result of the release of the information, or when, in a few cases, it is the opinion of a doctor that it could cause mental distress to a patient. Finally, information will not be released when it would breach established legal, professional privileges.<br/>
The Bill is well thought out and properly drafted. I pay tribute to the work being done by the Campaign for Freedom of Information, which is widely respected and straddles all strands of opinion in the country, political and otherwise, and which has done a great deal of work. The past 18 months have been spent in extremely thorough consultation with the interested parties and in winning over some of the professional bodies which originally had


doubts about the Bill. It is a highly popular issue with the public, and therefore it is extremely unlikely that it would be actively opposed by the Government.<br/>
We need access as of right to information recorded about ourselves, and we need the right to ensure that such information is both fair and correct. The legislation to create those rights will do more to enhance the quality of our democracy and redress the balance between the administrative arm of government and the individual than almost any other Bill that could be introduced by a Back-Bench Member. I hope that hon. Members on both sides of the House will give the Bill careful consideration when the private Members' ballot is held. I hope that the Bill will find favour with the House.</p>

<p>The vast majority of the amendments are purely drafting and technical, but a significant number make important and constructive changes, notably the additional provisions to ensure that the interests of elderly and disabled passengers receive due attention. These amendments, and more of the other substantive amendments, were initiated by the Opposition or by Back-Bench Members of the other place. We tried wherever possible to respond positively where we felt that amendments were genuinely seeking to improve the Bill rather than to undermine its fundamental principles. I said before the Second Reading that we wanted to fashion a better Bill, and these amendments go towards achieving that.</p>

<p>Last night, the hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich (Mrs. Dunwoody) did not know whether to attack the amendments or to welcome them. I can understand her dilemma, because the amendments reinforce the Bill, whereas she simply wishes to wreck it. True to form, the Opposition have tabled a number of amendments, some of which raise again the fundamental issues of policy underlying the Bill. I shall be disappointed if the Opposition choose to waste time today on the motion, rather than getting on with considering the issues.</p>

<p>This is a long and complex Bill, but, despite the guillotine, it has received very thorough consideration by Parliament. In this House alone, the time spent so far amounts to some 174 hours. In the other place, the Bill received some 70 hours of debate, and there were some 20 Divisions. The supplement to the order will ensure that we have a further 4 hours of debate this evening. I know that a large number of amendments have been accepted for debate. It is a bit hard to respond to the Opposition by being flexible and accepting amendments and then to be accused, as I was last night, of not having prepared the Bill properly.</p>

<p>It is time that the Bill was on the statute book. It puts the customer first, by removing unnecessary restrictions over competition between operators. It applies to the bus industry the market approach that is regarded as perfectly normal, and indeed vital, in most other sectors of the

economy. Urgent action is needed to stem the sorry pattern of declining patronage, rising costs and escalating subsidy. No Government could sit on their hands and allow the decline to continue. That would not be in the interests of passengers and it would certainly not be in the interests of the industry and those who work in it.</p>

<p>It was in July last year that we set out in the White Paper our reasons for believing that customers on local bus services now deserve the same benefits as passengers on express services have enjoyed since 1980. We consulted widely on the White Paper and we brought forward a Bill, dealing not just with deregulation, but providing for a comprehensive package of measures to enable competition to operate fairly, within a stable framework of safety controls and financial support for socially desirable services. The Bill has now received the fullest possible examination by Parliament over a period of nine months.</p>

<p>Operators and local authorities have much to do between now and deregulation day on 26 October next year to prepare for the new system. The order will ensure that the House has the opportunity to decide at a reasonable hour this evening the last few remaining issues to be resolved. The Bill can then complete its final stages and the industry, and those who work with it, can get on with the task of making the transition to deregulation. The time for arguing is coming to an end, and the time for action is about to begin.</p>

<p>It is instructive to look carefully at the Bill that we are now hurrying on to the statute book with the aid of a timetable motion. It will initiate a revolution not just in local public transport but in parliamentary procedure, and the results of the experiments prove that there should be no repetition of the methods used by the Secretary of State.<br/>
The Government have a manifesto commitment to more competition in the bus industry, and that was taken as justification for ignoring the whole of the normal consultation procedures. The White Paper on buses, published in July 1984, was written without any of the normal discussions and in a form that made it difficult for people to respond easily to it. There were 7,000 respondents. They were required to let the Department have their views during the two summer months. That shows the depth of anger that this extraordinary legislation has aroused.<br/>
It is interesting to note that only a handful of the 7,000 who responded supported the Government's plans. One of their supporters, from the Adam Smith Institute, was a bankrupt bus operator. That there were 7,000 replies shows the depth of anger aroused by the Bill. When it was published in February 1985 it was found that bus substitution had been added to the original legislation, yet this had been discussed only in a Green Paper that applied to Wales. This was to become law on the basis of no real examination of its implications for the whole of the United Kingdom.<br/>
The Government showed how much interest they have in informed discussion through their choice of Committee members. Many Tory Members of Parliament who are known to have an interest in transport were deliberately excluded. Committee membership was top heavy with Parliamentary Private Secretaries and the most junior Members of the House. The Government's fear of open debate went even further. They refused to wait until the


Select Committee report on buses was published, although they were aware that it was a detailed and useful examination of an enormous lacuna in this legislation. The Government went further still by making personal attacks on the Chairman of the Select Committee, a most valued and highly independent Member of Parliament whom we shall miss very much indeed.<br/>
The Committee stage began on 21 February. By April fool's day&#x2014;94 debating hours and one non-Government amendment later&#x2014;the Government asked, for the first time, for the imposition of the guillotine. Only 11 clauses had been debated. The only non-Government amendment made at that stage was the reduction in the retirement age for traffic commissioners from 70 to 65. By 7 May the Committee stage was completed, after another 55 hours of debate&#x2014;a total of 150 hours of discussion. During that time the Government allowed two non-Conservative amendments&#x2014;</p>

<p>They allowed rail and ferry travel to remain within the concessionary fares rules, including the change to which I have already referred.<br/>
Then the Government allowed Tory Back Benchers to stage probably the most phoney rebellion that one has ever seen in a Committee. To say that it was ill rehearsed is to put it mildly. Suddenly we were told that no longer would the public be allowed to object to the issue of public service vehicle licences when operators were thought to be unsuitable by the customer. Later the Government repented and introduced a very much amended and weaker version which still excludes the general public and includes only local authorities and the police. The Government were clearly terrified of allowing the general public to have a say. Therefore, they decided to remove that aspect from the legislation. By that stage the Government had amended their Bill no fewer than 122 times.</p>

<p>The Report stage on 22 May made the new parliamentary procedure much clearer. During the two days of debate the Government blocked all 17 amendments from Opposition Members, but 138 Government amendments and 13 new clauses were passed. The Government used the House as a departmental drafting body. Although hon. Members were allowed to vent their anger, they were outvoted. The tidying up of the Government's unformed schemes went ahead unaffected. The result was that 13 hours of debate produced more change than the 150 hours of detailed discussion. The Government could not have shown more clearly their deep contempt for the House of Commons as a place of debate and enlightenment.</p>

<p>In July the Government proved that they could go one better. The other place debated the Bill in Committee for six days. Well over 300 amendments were discussed&#x2014;mainly Government amendments. The same drafting method was applied in another place. On Report in another place between 14 and 17 October the drafting system was used to deal with over 400 amendments&#x2014;again, tabled mainly by the Government. Finally, on 24 October, on Third Reading in another place,

there were still 86 amendments to be dealt with. The Government made 420 amendments to their Bill during its passage in another place, but only one non-Government amendment was accepted. It watered down the effect of the Tory rebellion in Committee in this place.</p>

During the nine months in which the Bill has been debated in Parliament, the Government have amended it 680 times and added over 30 new clauses.

<p>I do not. If one looks at the number of amendments that the Government are still trying to write into the Bill, one finds that many of them arise not from changes of principle &#x2014; certainly not from consultations, which this Secretary of State does not understand in any practical way&#x2014;but from the fact that the Bill was badly drafted and ill conceived. It should not have been introduced in this Session of Parliament. There should have been consultation on a Green Paper.<br/>
We are dealing with one of the greatest changes in public transport in 50 years, yet the Secretary of State has followed no real consultation procedure. He has rejected the normal parliamentary procedures. Instead of legislation being introduced with a view to considering the reaction of hon. Members, the legislative procedure has been turned into a sham in a ruthless attempt to save time. The only real discussion that was allowed took place in the Department. The House has been regarded as a very minor step in the presentation of the Secretary of State's views &#x2014;or perhaps I should say his prejudices. He knows that he has been found wanting by the courts of this land. I shall not refer to his theft of &#x00A3;50 million from the Greater London council for London Regional Transport. Consultation is an important aspect when framing legislation. I remind the Secretary of State&#x2014;</p>

I remind the Secretary of State of a point made by the judge when one case was brought before the courts. It was pointed out to the Secretary of State that consultation means more than simply telling people what will be done. When he consults the House, he must be willing to listen to the arguments. The fact that 680 amendments were made, only two of which were Opposition amendments, shows how little the Secretary of State has learnt. About: 1,700 amendments were tabled. The Secretary of State can congratulate himself upon the fact that no real account has been taken of the views of the general public or of anybody who recognises how vital public transport is to the people of this country. I congratulate him upon having acted in an unacceptable way. He has behaved in an even more arrogant fashion than is his wont.</p>

<p>This is a group of consequential and drafting amendments. Their most important purpose is to bring the terminology of the Transport Act 1968. the Energy Act 1976 the Public Passenger Vehicles Act 1981 and the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984 into line with that of the Bill, and to provide that phrases such as "stage carriage" in previous legislation, including local and subordinate legislation, have a continuing meaning.<br/>
The amendment to clause 2 ensures that separate "fares" in that clause has the same meaning as in section 2 of the 1981 Act, thus preventing the evasion of registration by bogus free services.</p>

<p>These amendments put the traffic commissioners' publication "Notice and Proceedings" on a statutory footing, and remove the separate and then redundant requirement for the Traffic Commissioners to send details of registrations to local authorities and the police. The amendment provides for the content of notices and proceedings to be specified in regulations. It will cover registrations, traffic regulation conditions and applications for operators' licences, among other things. It will be provided free to local authorities and the police, and will be a general sale. The group also includes amendments simplifying and codifying the requirement on the traffic commissioners to keep records of licences, traffic regulations and so on, and make them available to members of the public.</p>

<p>I beg to move, That this House doth agree with the Lords in the said amendment.<br/>
This amendment gives the traffic commissioner a power to award costs, which will be used to deter delaying tactics and similar abuses, for instance by people called before him for possible disciplinary action.<br/>
The amendment gives power to the commissioner to recover only his costs, and those of the Department in providing accommodation and clerical assistance for an inquiry. It does not enable the commissioner to order one party to pay the costs of another. We understand from the commissioners that they would not welcome the responsibility of adjudicating in such a way, and, of course, in many public service vehicle operator licensing

cases, particularly the disciplinary ones of which we are primarily thinking, there is only one party&#x2014;the person whom the commissioner has called to the inquiry.<br/>
The regulations we shall make under subsection (4A) will limit the. recovery of costs to cases where the person against whom the award is made has acted vexatiously, frivolously or the like. The vast majority of people appearing at commissioners' inquiries, for whatever reason, need not fear an increased expense. Indeed, they and all licence holders will benefit if the commissioners' costs are kept down because all costs are met from fees. We see that power as a deterrent and, we hope, an effective one&#x2014;and not a way of raising money.<br/>
The regulations will lay down the way in which costs are calculated, and a maximum. That will prevent the commissioners' task from being invidious.</p>

<p>This group of amendments closes some possible loopholes in the registration system, by precluding registration by operators with conditions on their operators' licences, preventing them from running local services, or by education authorities which are using contract services rather than their own vehicles to provide school transport. That makes it more flexible by allowing for the exemption of certain excursions or tours from registration. We propose to require only these excursions that are hard to distinguish from ordinary local services to register. The other amendments in the group are drafting improvements.</p>

<p>This group of amendments changes substantially clause 16 from the form in which it left the House. The main change is to the criteria according to which a district council may refuse to grant a taxi licence to limit the number of taxis, a rather convoluted provision that we had taken from the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982, which had attracted some adverse comment in this House and was the subject of litigation in the Scottish courts. It has been replaced by a much clearer set of words.<br/>
As well as that change to the criteria, the form in which they are expressed has been changed in response to constructive criticism in another place. The amendment to the Town Police Clauses Act 1847 is now made by reference rather than textually. Such a method of amendment is, generally, the inferior one, but in a case such as this&#x2014;for which the antiquity of the statute is to blame&#x2014; it produces a clearer result, and there is no need to refer to the interpretation Act or to the "prescribed distance", a concept which is a throwback to the last century.<br/>
I should perhaps emphasise that there is no fundamental change in policy. It is the Government's clear view that the restriction of numbers in any industry is justifiable only in the most exceptional circumstances and that the strict limits which many district councils have imposed have been bad for the trade and for its customers. The Bill opens the way for the taxi trade to expand into new markets, in particular those at shared fares. It would be a tragedy if it failed to take advantage of these opportunities, kept out new blood and remained wedded to the past. It would be

a tragedy if the only way someone could start a new small taxi business was to spend many thousands of pounds on buying someone else's plate.<br/>
The Bill does not, however, and never did, simply abolish quantity control. It allows a district council to refuse a licence application so as to limit numbers&#x2014;as well, of course, as on grounds of unsuitability&#x2014;but it puts the onus on the council of satisfying itself that there is no significant unmet demand. Any applicant who is refused a licence will be able to appeal to the Crown court, and I am sure that the court will test whether the council had good grounds for its refusal.<br/>
It will not be sufficient that the existing taxi trade says that it can cope or that it has always been the council's policy to have no more than, say, 87 taxis. If a new applicant intends to tap new markets&#x2014;for instance, by running registered local services&#x2014;I do not believe that any council could refuse the licence. But if there is demonstrably an over-supply of taxis in a district, as there may be in some cities, a licence could be refused.</p>

<p>The amendment changes the wording of the Scottish measure so that the arrangements are the same as for England. Therefore, what I have been saying applies equally to Scotland.<br/>
I hope, therefore, that all district councils will review their policies and act liberally, as the law will require, and that we shall no longer see the sort of under-supply that has led to taxi plates changing hands at ridiculous prices. We shall, of course, monitor carefully what happens, and take everything into account in the review of taxi and hire car legislation that we shall undertake once the Bill has been implemented.</p>

<p>I welcome the amendment. Its presence may have something to do with the fact that the noble and learned Lord Denning, as well as my noble Friend Lord Winchilsea, spoke on this issue in the other place. Common sense has at last prevailed in the description of the situation. For example, from the point of view of Liverpool, when all controls were removed, there were too many taxis on the streets with too few customers in them, and that led to much unrest and bickering between taxi operators.<br/>
Had the amendment not been proposed, I should have feared the worst in my constituency, certainly out of season. However, even in season, in Ryde esplanade and elsewhere, there would have been many arguments, because we already have too many taxis in competition. The amendment will introduce some balance into the situation, and for that it is to be welcomed.</p>

As I said, we shall keep a close eye on it to make sure that all is well.<br/>
The answer to the question asked by the hon. Member for Rhondda (Mr. Rogers) is that we, not the local authorities, will be doing the monitoring, so no question of extra expense for local authorities arises.</p>

<p>I am grateful that at last we shall have got right a clause which we have long needed. The House will be aware that the system under which licences were revoked or suspended disappeared into a silent mist originally in the office of the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis. One could never get at the facts. The system is to be moved to the Department of Transport, and with this amendment we shall get it into the court structure so that somebody who has his livelihood taken away will be able to challenge the decision in an open place, know the evidence against him and be able to argue against that evidence.<br/>
The Under-Secretary of State has cleared up the problems which rendered it inappropriate for a person's case to be determined where he resided. It is to be welcomed that it will be possible to argue a case, if someone is to be deprived of his livelihood, in the place where he earns his livelihood. I hope this part of the statute will be implemented soon. I do not agree with every part of the Bill, but I think that this part of it is good. I hope that its implementation will not be delayed after the Bill becomes law, so that taxi and cab drivers may have justice.</p>

<p>Amendment No. 46 tends to put together some of the ingredients which were found in the Bill as it first came before the House. It highlights the absurdity and, indeed, farcical quality of much of the debate that has taken place.<br/>
Clause 22 of the original Bill included the perfectly sensible undertaking that those who wished to make representations to the traffic commissioners could do so

where they had reason to believe that those who were being considered for licences were not suitable. We then had an extraordinary element of humour in the Committee because, half way through Committee, Conservative Back Benchers discovered that the clause was dangerous and had to be taken out of the Bill. Ministers agreed with astonishing alacrity. It is obvious that they reconsidered the position and appreciated that there would be those who wished to give evidence to the traffic commissioners. After much humming and hawing, we have a milder, much weaker undertaking that provides that those who are involved with local authorities and the police can object. We think that is excellent.<br/>
Where there are environmental matters, it is important that local authorities should have a say. It is quite possible that the police will know something about prospective operators and their past records. However, those who may still be in the best position to weigh up the real impact of an application are other operators, members of the public or business men and professionals with local knowledge. They will be unable to object.<br/>
The Government repeatedly said that the Bill is about protecting the interests of the public. We know that that claim is totally hollow and that their aim is to break up efficient public enterprises so that their friends can take the profits on the good routes while casting the remainder to the winds and the few crumbs of subsidy that will be left.<br/>
If the Government really are a caring Administration who mean what they say, let them accept the amendment.</p>

<p>If the hon. Lady will allow me, I shall explain. The amendment is undesirable because we must keep to the minimum the number of people able, by appealing against the grant of a licence, to prolong the time during which a new operator is uncertain whether he has a stable business or not. It is unnecessary, because if anyone&#x2014;operators, suppliers or private individuals&#x2014;has reason to know that an applicant for a licence does not satisfy the requirements as to good repute, financial standing and professional competence, and tells the traffic commissoner, the commissioner is bound to consider what he is being told. He cannot ignore the facts, if they are relevant, merely because the person has no formal status as an objector.<br/>
We considered this matter fully in Committee and there is nothing further which can be said. I have explained that the amendment is not desirable because it will cause delay and uncertainty. We want to encourage new operators. We do not wish to erect barriers to bar them, as the hon. Lady would. The hon. Lady would regulate everything out of existence if she had the opportunity to do so.</p>

<p>Under the clause as drafted the traffic commissioner may attach conditions preventing an operator from running local services in future if he has broken the registration rules, but he may do so only if the operator's conduct was intentional, reckless, dangerous or frequent. The amendment substitutes the words "without reasonable excuse" for "intentional or reckless". "Intentional or reckless" was taken from the 1981 Act, where it qualifies the circumstances in which a road service licence may be revoked because of breaches of conditions by operators. "Without reasonable excuse" is used in the clause which deals with loss of fuel duty rebate for contravention of registration rules, and is more modern and appropriate.</p>

<p>This is a group of amendments to the clause which deals with appeals. The main change that the clause makes to the present law is to transfer appeals relating to PSV operators' licences from the Secretary of State to the transport tribunal. The amendments remove a right of appeal because a traffic commissioner has not reached a decision in a reasonable time. That was ill-defined and could have caused a tribunal much trouble.<br/>
The amendments also disapply anything relating to traffic regulation conditions, appeals on which go to the Secretary of State under clause 9. They also give the traffic commissioner the right to withdraw any stay of execution that he has granted pending an appeal, so that if one is withdrawn the operator affected can apply to the tribunal to have it granted.<br/>
Finally, the amendments tidy up the relationship between this clause and section 9 of the 1981 Act as to appeals against refusals to remove prohibitions on vehicles.<br/>
These are tidying-up amendments and do not represent any major change in policy.</p>

<p>These are technical amendments. Amendment No. 70 corrects a drafting imperfection and exempts from London local service licensing not only permanent bus substitution services provided by BR, which under the clause as drafted are already exempted, but also any temporary BR bus services provided in London. This brings them into line with temporary replacement services outside London.<br/>
Amendments Nos. 105 and 258 are minor drafting improvements. Amendments Nos. 266 and 396 correct a technical imperfection to retain for the Secretary of State the power that he has under existing legislation to give directions to BR, LRT or LRT subsidiaries in connection with a closure consent. Amendment No. 372 simply corrects the description of the transport tribunal.<br/>
Amendments Nos. 259 to 265 ensure that the PTEs have the power to support bus substitution services, as they have under existing legislation to support rail services, and that where PTEs do support bus substitution services, their role in the case of a proposal by the board to withdraw the service is exactly parallel to that which they now have in relation to proposals to withdraw PTE-supported rail services.</p>

<p>The Government have introduced a number of amendments and have accepted others designed to ensure that proper attention is paid to the needs of disabled people as users of public transport.

Member for Crewe and Nantwich (Mrs. Dunwoody) an opportunity to do so.<br/>
As a whole, the amendments clarify the responsibilities of local authorities to provide new powers for the support of minibus services meeting the needs of elderly and disabled people, and for the provision of grants for vehicles, or modifications to vehicles, and give LRT a new power to support dial-a-ride services in London, establish a new disabled persons' advisory committee and place an obligation on me to issue guidance on the measures that can be taken to make vehicles more accessible to disabled people. Taken together, the amendments will lead to a real improvement in the way in which public transport meets the needs of disabled people.</p>

<p>It is understandable that we have become a little confused, because of the rapid rate at which we are moving through the amendment paper. It might be as well if we slowed that pace and examined precisely what the other place has been doing in other major areas of concern.<br/>
Mr. Speaker's selection list has caused us some difficulty with respect to amendment No. 83, which is in this group of amendments. The Opposition are attempting to disagree with the Lords in the said amendment, but, because of the time factor, and because of the ludicrously tight guillotine, I do not intend to pursue our arguments on amendment No. 83, but will deal more specifically with our arguments on amendments (a) and (b) to proposed Lords amendment No. 91.<br/>
Our intentions are obvious. The pension provision for people in the National Bus Company is causing concern. There have been broadly two approaches to pension funds in privatisation plans&#x2014;both maintaining some version of "no worsening" plans. In my industry, in British Telecom, privatisation meant that the entire pension fund was paid over en bloc. When the predecessor of the present Secretary of State decided to sell off Sealink, the staff remained in the British Rail pension scheme.<br/>
In the case of the NBC there will be no company left, because it is to be broken into smaller units, in line with the Government's competition theories. This means that there will be no large company with the resources to underwrite the current pension funds.<br/>
So long as the Government's predictions on inflation and investment returns are exactly correct, for the next 40 or more years, there will be no problem. The Government appear to want NBC staff to believe that this is possible. However, if in any one year there is a shortfall, pensions will have to be topped up from some other source. There

are two possible sources. The new staff of NBC paying into the fund is one source. That will end w hen NBC closes, thus turning the National Bus pension fund and BEST into "closed" funds.<br/>
The other guarantee was a straight payment from NBC. That will also go. We heard recently that the Government intend using some insurance companies to assist them in this dilemma. At present, 15,000 former employees and 10,000 staff dependants receive funds from the NBC pension fund. In addition, NBC had 51,000 staff at the end of April 1983. All those people who have been paying into the pension funds believe that their pensions will be cut and that the provisions will no longer be forthcoming.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman might say that that is nonsense, but he will have the opportunity later, if he catches your eye, Mr. Deputy Speaker, to assuage some of the fears of people in the industry. In spite of what he may say, he has not yet done that. If he had done so, perhaps we would not have had the strike by bus men, which is the only way in which they could demonstrate their rejection of his pension proposals.<br/>
The amendments which were tabled in the other place provide for a guarantee by the Secretary of State that at normal retirement date, employees of the NBC or its subsidiaries will receive pensions no less than those which they were entitled to receive on the day the NBC was privatised. Lord Belstead said that this was calling for a guarantee which the Government could not give. He said:
<q>It would be an open-ended commitment of taxpayers' money and in that respect it would go further than NBC does already." &#x2014;<i>[Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 14 October 1985; Vol. 467, c. 347.]</q>
I remind the Secretary of State of the two examples that I quoted, I remind him of the employees in British Telecom who were former civil servants, then former public servants, and who now work for a private company. Their pension provision, from Civil Service status to public service status to private status, has been maintained and guaranteed, so the principle has been established. The people who were employed by Sealink are still members of British Rail's pension fund, so there has been no worsening of their position.<br/>
What does the Secretary of State propose to do with the employees' pension provisions in British Airways when it is sold to private enterprise? I understand that the Secretary of State has given a nod and a wink to the idea that their pension provisions will be secured and they will be looked after. If so, why will only people in the transport industry &#x2014; the bus men and bus women who have worked in the industry all their lives&#x2014;see their pensions at risk? That is why we have tabled these amendments.<br/>
I understand that in the case of NBC the Government propose to hand over the entire assets of the BEST pension fund to the Standard Life Assurance Company, which proposes to reduce the benefits already earned.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman may say that that is nonsense. We shall have to see on closer examination whether he can persuade us that that is the case. I remind him that sitting next to him is the Minister of State&#x2014;the hon. Member for Wallasey (Mrs. Chalker)&#x2014;who has been quoted on a number of occasions on this matter. She claimed that staff pensions would not be worsened by the


provisions of the Transport Bill 1982 and that it would be "wrong if it did". In 1985 that pledge has been broken. I do not know whether the hon. Lady can justify those claims, which were made when the position was put to her by not only the Labour Front Bench but by members of the transport industry.<br/>
These amendments on the pension fund issue are our last chance to put this matter right. Throughout the whole year of discussions on this wretched Bill there has been an acceptance of certain technical and drafting amendments. These amendments were "technical" and "drafting" to facilitate the lunacy of the Secretary of State. They were not in any sense a response to the sensible and orchestrated opposition to the Bill from almost every section of society. If the Secretary of State has any doubts about that, I can supply him with a Marplan poll concerning his proposals. He would get a big shock on seeing what people think about the ruination of co-ordination of transportation.<br/>
We are at the eleventh hour&#x2014;it is almost midnight for the Bill. If we do not get any movement on the question of pension schemes for NBC staff, this will be to the immense electoral disadvantage of the Secretary of State and his party at the general election. I spent the summer travelling around the country talking to people employed in the transport industry. I talked to bus men and bus women in their garages and on their buses. I had big meetings in Dover and in Chippenham. I had meetings in the south of England, in the good underbelly of Tory Britain. The bus men were worried.</p>

<p>The Secretary of State says that they do not know what they are talking about. The right hon. Gentleman has the habit of leading with his chin. I hope that <i>Hansard</i> has got that intervention for posterity and that it is there for all to see. Sometimes I despair when I am trying to plead with the Secretary of State for common sense to prevail. We are asking for acceptance of amendments (a) and (b) to Lords amendment No. 91 which we believe are in the spirit of what the hon. Member for Wallasey meant when she said that it would be wrong if there was a worsening of the position.<br/>
In Committee I said that people employed by the NBC had arrived at a point where their pensions were secure. Their pension entitlements have been negotiated by the trade union with their employer. It is not the employer or the trade union, but the Government who are moving the goal posts. The Government are changing the scene. It is not the fault of the NBC or the TGWU, but the fault of the Secretary of State. He has moved the goal posts and muddied the waters. If he has changed the ball game, he should accept responsibility to ensure that the pension rights are maintained.</p>

<p>I wish to support amendments (a) and (b) to Lords amendment No. 91. Even at this late hour, I hope that we will have an explanation from the Government of whether the points just made from the Opposition Front Bench are right. I have read the debates

in the other place. Unfortunately, by four votes the final effort to pass something similar to the amendments was lost.<br/>
Lord Shepherd is a former chairman of the NBC and was no doubt briefed by the company. In the other place he said:
<q>at the present moment the advisers to the trustees take the view that what the Government are proposing does not rank in any way equivalent to what the members themselves have subscribed for and would have expected to receive on the dissolution of the National Bus Company."&#x2014;<i>[Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 14 October 1985; Vol. 467, c. 350.]</q>
Is that right?<br/>
I am briefed by the manager of Southern Vectis, who, incidently, is a supporter of privatisation and is not completely opposed to the Bill. In a letter to me he said:
<q>In the case of NBPF,"&#x2014;</q>
that is, the National Bus pension fund
<q>ten major insurance companies have been approached by the Department of Transport but none would agree to carry on the existing basis of linking pensions to individual salary increases, and we in the Group feel that this is essential if existing pension rights are to be preserved.</q>
<q>In all other cases where nationalised companies have been privatised guarantees have been given by the Government to secure the pensions of current employees and existing pensioners.</q>
I believe that we received that assurance in the other place, but I hope that it will be confirmed.<br/>
The letter from the manager of Southern Vectis continues:
<q>I note from Lord Shepherd's speech on 14 October that Mrs. Lynda Chalker has said that it would be quite immoral for the government in any way to take such action as would reduce the benefits of a scheme.
The present proposals of the Government simply do not go far enough as they do not rank in. any way equivalent to what we ourselves have subscribed for and would have expected to receive on the dissolution of National Bus Company. What we are asking is that the government gives guarantees that are equivalent to guarantees at present given by the Trustees of the pension funds of the National Bus Company.</q>
As I understand it, that is what the amendments seek.<br/>
I have had experience of what happens when companies are privatised. I am still suffering from the privatisation of Sealink. The latest problem is that pensioners' travel cards issued by British Rail are not being honoured by Sealink, although its competitors are allowing pensioners to travel free. Pensioners from the Isle of Wight have to pay to travel on Sealink although they can travel free on trains at either end of the boat journey. The manager of Sealink has taken a retrograde step about which I have complained bitterly.<br/>
That is the sort of thing that has happened, and that will no doubt happen again when the National Bus Company is broken up into smaller companies. The employees of the smaller companies should have priority to enable them to buy shares and take over the companies themselves. That was done with the National Freight Corporation. If it is not done with the National Bus Company, it will be disastrous. Some people want to get their hands on bus companies, not to provide a service to the public, but merely to make a profit. The managers and employees of the bus companies are entitled to a guarantee from the Government that their pensions are safe. We have not yet had that guarantee.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, NBC employees will receive a fair deal, but the Government seem to have


tied themselves into a Jesuitical knot so that they may give them that deal. As I understand it, for ideological reasons, the Government are unwilling themselves to offer an open-ended, "no worsening", guarantee to a private company. The Government are convinced that there will be no worsening. They want to arrange for the trustees of the pension fund to insure against there being any worsening. The premium for that insurance will have to be paid by the Government.<br/>
If insurance proves necessary, apparently it is to come out of the employers' contribution. If so, to the extent that that costs the employers money and commits them to future costs, it will reduce the price for which the National Bus Company can be sold, because it must be sold with the commitment to pay out of the employers' contribution a premium for an insurance scheme against any worsening of the pension scheme. In the end, through its reduced receipts on the sale of NBC, the Government will pay for an insurance policy to provide a guarantee which they themselves are unwilling, partly for ideological reasons, to provide.<br/>
If the Government are convinced that there will be no worsening and that the pension scheme is not threatened in any way, it would be cheaper for them to provide the guarantee themselves than to pay a private insurance company to provide it. They will be paying not only for the guarantee but for the BMWs owned by the directors of the insurance companies. All insurance is irrational, except insurance based on the belief that the insurers have incorrectly assessed the risks that are being insured against. If they succeed in persuading the NBC trustees to seek a guarantee privately, the Government will have tied themselves, as I said, into a Jesuitical knot.<br/>
Nor am I sure that the trustees will be right in purchasing the premium. Better use of the trustees' funds might be to put them straight into the pension scheme. If the trustees are convinced that the funds are not under threat, it is not right to use them to insure against a threat. It would be better for them to put the money towards the payment of pensions. At the end of it all I do not think that NBC employees have anything to worry about, so I shall support the Government.</p>

<p>On most of the Bill, especially on the whole idea of privatisation, the Government have thrust upon us ideological views which we do not like, but we must accept that they have a majority.<br/>
The amendments suggested by my hon. Friend the Member for Wigan (Mr. Stott) seek to prevent the Government using bus men and bus women and their pension funds as pawns of the Government's political will. There is great anger among bus men and bus women about this. The Government will correct me if I am wrong, but I have never known a national strike, as today's action has been, about pensions.<br/>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Wigan has said, what can bus men and bus women do when no one will listen to them, their unions or their employers? The Government will not even listen to the employers, who have valiantly put the case for the preservation of existing pension rights. My hon. Friend the Member for Wigan has pointed out that it is not the bus men and bus women, the NBC or even the trustees of the pension funds, but the

advisers to the trustees &#x2014; actuaries and accountants versed for a lifetime in pension matters &#x2014; who have stated categorically that the Government's proposals are worse than the existing scheme.<br/>
It is no answer for the Secretary of State to say, as he did, that those advisers do not know what they are talking about. I see the Under-Secretary of State nodding, but I am sure that all Members in the parliamentary pension fund would listen if I, as a trustee, told them what our advisers were saying, as opposed to what the Government's advisers were saying. The NBC and its employees feel exactly the same about what their advisers say.<br/>
The amendment merely seeks to ensure that bus men and bus women&#x2014;drivers, conductors, inspectors, garage staff, the tens of thousands of people in the industry&#x2014;should receive no worse treatment than the Government have provided when other industries have been privatised. There is no political polemic in this. We are simply fighting for present pension funds and levels of benefit to be preserved.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Wigan referred only to the NBC, perhaps due to lack of time. I wish to refer briefly to the PTEs and municipal companies. Their worry is expressed as follows:
<q>The current Transport Bill makes provisions for PTEs and municipal transport undertakings to be set up as PLCS which will be deemed to be admissible bodies for inclusion in the Local Government Superannuation Fund. However, as the deeming option is not mandatory and is merely permissive there can be no guarantees that employees being transferred into their new companies will maintain future pension rights.</q>
As a Member sponsored by the Transport and General Workers Union, I realise that that case bears no comparison with that of the NBC employees, who are really done down by this option. I do not suppose that the Secretary of State will take any notice of the words of Lord Shepherd, a former chairman of the National Bus Company, who has stated without any hesitation that the attempted Standard Life scheme based on a guarantee of RPI plus 1&#x00B7;5 per cent. bears no comparison with the skilful management of the existing scheme, which is based on current wage levels.<br/>
If the Government cannot accept our amendments on this last day of term&#x2014;I appreciate the difficulty in that respect&#x2014;I plead with them to bring in legislation in the next Session to achieve justice and equity for people who have paid into pension schemes, many of them in private companies even before the NBC was set up, but whose pensions are now in jeopardy because the Government will give no guarantee that their position will not worsen as a result of the Bill.<br/>
The Conservatives know that they deal with pensions at their peril. When the Chancellor made noises and flew kites last year about attacks on pension schemes, all of us, and especially Conservative Members, were inundated with letters from people who feared that their pensions might be affected. When the present Secretary of State for Social Services says that he intends to review the state earnings-related pension scheme, the reaction from the country is enormous. The bus men and bus women of this country know that the Government may be tampering with their pension scheme. I must tell the Government that they do that at their peril.</p>

<p>I support the amendments because they seek to do what we have sought to do throughout the proceedings on the Bill&#x2014;to secure a fair deal for people working in the bus industry.<br/>
The action taken by people in this industry today shows their clear belief that even at this late stage the Government have not provided the guarantee of fairness to which those employees are entitled. Last night's <i>Lancashire Evening Telegraph</i> quotes Mr. Marshall, general manager of the Burnley and Pendle area, on the subject of the strike. Like most of the employees, whether in management or on the buses, he is cynical about the Government's actions. He is reported as saying:
<q>I believe the whole protest is futile</q>
and
<q>The Government will simply not commit the new bus companies to expensive pension schemes.</q>
The article continues:
<q>Mr. Marshall added that all pension payments made to the date of the introduction of the new bus companies next year would be fully safeguarded.</q>
We are concerned not just about existing pensions, but about the future pension rights of people in the industry. The hon. Member for Derbyshire, West (Mr. Parris) said that the provision that we seek would reduce the selling price of the industry, but why should people working in the industry suffer so that the Government can obtain the maximum price? That is wrong and entirely unacceptable to Labour Members. Those employees should have the guarantees that we have sought for so long.<br/>
When the Bill is passed, the bus companies will have to go out to tender and they will face competition from people who do not have to comply with any conditions of employment or service. They will have to face competitors who do not provide adequate pensions, sick pay and all the other benefits to which workers are entitled. It stands to reason, therefore, that the NCB, the PTEs and the municipal undertakings will not be able to win tenders and to remain in business if they do not compete on equal terms. Indeed, the NBC has already withdrawn from the National Joint Council for the Omnibus Industry because it knows that it will have to worsen the conditions of its employees.<br/>
7.30 pm<br/>
Pensions are important, and more and more people are taking this issue extremely seriously. We know that if the state earnings-related pension scheme is abolished or phased out, the two categories hardest hit will be women and manual workers. People in the bus industry will lose in two ways. They will not have the benefit of a backup from SERFS and a guaranteed minimum pension, and they will also lose their existing scheme. We must take notice of what the trustees and advisers have said, and we must recognise that the trustees have a statutory duty to ensure that the maximum benefit is preserved for the people whom they represent&#x2014;the employees, those who are already on pension and those who will be on pension in the future.<br/>
The amendment is reasonable and fair. Even at this late stage the Government should wake up and accept it. In Committee, a number of hon. Members expressed sympathy, and made all the right sounds, but when it came to the vote they supported the Government. I fear that they will do the same today. I shall be surprised if the Secretary of State for Transport says that he is prepared to accept the

amendment, however fair and justified it may be. He is not a reasonable man, and I cannot believe that he will accept the amendment.</p>

<p>I echo the remarks of my hon. Friends when I say that these are unique circumstances. The House, as I understand it, will for the first time be effectively passing legislation which will worsen people's pension prospects. However objectionable previous privatisations may have been, at least pension rights were secured.<br/>
My hon. Friends are correct to say that today's industrial action reflects the anger and incredulity which has built up over the last few months among many people in the bus industry. They were opposed to many aspects of the Bill and were staggered by the inanity of much of it. They were opposed to privatisation, but they nevertheless believed that it would be inconceivable for the Government not to leave their pensions "no worse off". Even in the past few days, while the Bill was in another place, it dawned on people that the Government are seriously and cynically not prepared to protect those pensions.<br/>
People in the bus industry have expressed anger and incredulity; they do not know what has hit them. They feel outraged that they have been robbed. They are being robbed of all they have contributed over many years&#x2014;over a whole lifetime in the industry in many cases&#x2014;by the Government's refusal to creat a "no worse off' position.<br/>
Those circumstances are not unique to pensions. I am not sure whether the Secretary of State and his colleagues sincerely believe the nonsense that they have talked about the protection of pensions, and other matters, throughout the Bill's long and sordid history. When the Secretary of State replies I shall ask myself whether he believes the nonsense&#x2014;the Jesuitical nonsense as the hon. Member for Derbyshire, West (Mr. Parris) described it in a Jesuitical speech&#x2014;that in some obscure way there is protection.<br/>
It is extraordinary, as my hon. Friends have said, that the trustees can say that there is no protection, and that the National Bus Company management, from the most senior to the most junior level up and down the country, and everyone involved can say that the assurances given are meaningless and do not create a "no worse off' position.<br/>
The Secretary of State has the arrogance to say that the experts do not know what they are talking about and that the whole world does not know what it is talking about. That statement is made by a man who has been in and out of the courts in the past few months and who has been found to have acted illegally on one occasion after another in his job as Secretary of State for Transport It is extraordinary that someone who has had such a career in the courts with so many judgments against him has the audacity to come here tonight and say that the pension fund trustees do not know what they are talking about when they advise National Bus Company employees.<br/>
As my right hon. Friend the Member for Halton (Mr. Oakes) said, this matter involves not just the NBC. I have an interest in the matter. I am glad that when I came here, I opted to transfer my service as a previous PTE employee in the local government superannuation scheme into the House pension fund. If I had not done that and had retained my service, I should be worried about what would happen.


A clause which states merely that something "may be" held in a local government superannuation fund is nothing like the same as a clause which says that it "must be" held.<br/>
The Secretary of State must be aware that local managers in various parts of the country, not just in the NBC but in PTEs and municipalities, are already saying informally and, in some cases, formally, to their trade unions, "You know that we shall be unable to maintain the value of pensions. We are not certain that the future company will stay in the local government superannuation scheme. It will depend upon the competition. If we are competing with people who do not provide that kind of pension, how do you expect us to provide it?" That gives the lie to the assurances that are being given by the Government. They must be aware of that, and of the fact that those things are being said.<br/>
The Government must also be aware that all the nonsense that was talked about the Bill creating employment has already been given the lie because Northern General Transport, even before the Act has received the Royal Assent, has formally told its trade unions that it will dismiss 25 per cent. of its staff. That is a most extraordinary example of how all the nonsense that was discussed in Committee and on Report is contradicted by what is already taking place.<br/>
I recall the hon. Member for Wellingborough (Mr. Fry) making a long and detailed speech on Report in which he took apart every detail of the misleading impressions being given by the Under-Secretary and others. He quoted chapter and verse. He said that many of the things that the Minister claimed that he had said or written were untrue. The hon. Member said that the only way he could conclude that what was happening was not fraud was to assume that it was gross incompetence. That came from a Conservative Member. He was listened to by two or three other Conservative Members, two of whom voted with the Opposition, as did the hon. Member for Wellingborough. However, when the Bell rang, the Lobby fodder came flooding through to defeat the Opposition amendments. No doubt the same will happen tonight.<br/>
Bus men, bus women and many other workers will notice the House's final disgusting hypocrisy. It has its own pension scheme, which must be one of the best available to anyone anywhere. In July 1983, the House improved that pension scheme but it is apparently not going to find itself able tonight to prevent the Government from robbing NBC, PTE and municipal employees of their pension rights.</p>

<p>We do not need a nasty turn of mind to consider what the Secretary of State has in store for the transport workers. Wherever he goes there is despondency, unhappiness and misery. The workers tremble whenever the Prime Minister suggests a new office for him. There is heartache in the country because the people know his state of mind. We do not need a nasty approach because there is the record.<br/>
It is the Secretary of State's Bill. He listens to no one. All the advice that has been made available to him has been swept aside. He has arbitrarily deprived transport industry workers of their pension expectations and rights. He has a responsibility to tell the House what is inhibiting him from acting reasonably. What is stopping him from applying a provision for the maintenance of pension rights

for transport workers in the same way as it has been accorded to other people who have gone into the private sector? What actuarial basis is there for his resistace to what is reasonable?<br/>
How many Conservative Members will go to their constituencies this weekend&#x2014;there is plenty of time, as we prorogue tomorrow &#x2014; and address the transport undertakings that will be privatised? Will they say to them, "We fought for your pension rights," or "We spoke in Standing Committee," or "We spoke in the House of Commons"? Will they say that they put the case sympathetically on their behalf? But they will omit to say that they went into the wrong Lobby.<br/>
What is the position of the Conservative party&#x2014;the caring party, as they like to tell the nation, but the uncaring party, as the nation has learned? Having taken that arbitrary action, is not the Secretary of State conscience striken that he has not taken the opportunity that was there for other people transferred from the public sector to private enterprise? The opportunity to do what is right for transport workers is there, but for some reason he is not taking it.<br/>
The House is entitled to know the position. Either there are some strong arguments that we have not yet heard that support his view or there is a doctrinal, rigid or dogmatic approach, in which the Secretary of State has shown no sensitivity. We have reasonable men and women working in the transport industry and some of the highest standards of transportation in the public sector. I remind the right hon. Gentleman of the havoc that will come from privatisation.<br/>
There is an employment problem for the workers in the transport industry, apart from their pension problem. All at once the Conservative Government have decided that there must be a state of unsettlement in the transport industry and a state of denial for the workers. Is some spite or prejudice being exercised here? Although I do not agree with the principle of privatisation, why is the favourable, sustainable, and reasonable treatment for one section of the public service that has been transferred to the private sector not applied to another? Why are the Government behaving differently towards so many thousands of people who provide an excellent public service for their community?<br/>
Let me put in a caveat. Privatisation has caused problems on our roads. There is an inquiry going on, so I cannot comment on it, but we must bear in mind the consequences of the transport measures we have had in the past two or three years. We not only have congestion on the roads but the Government's expression of concern is constipated. The Government will not respond to reasonable submissions in Standing Committee and elsewhere, to get the best out of the Government's overall principle, that come hell or high water they will privatise. The Minister could get his own way on privatisation, but he must respond to the consequences, and if he believes that some people will suffer when he does not intend them to suffer, let him say so.<br/>
Will the Secretary of State tell the House those things now, because Conservative Members have to go to their constituencies? I hope that all the transport workers will nobble them. Two years after the vote, they might have got over it. Conservative Members are entitled to learn from the Secretary of State what is the case for not giving the transport workers their pension rights, no more or less than before. We are not asking for any hand-outs. We are


asking for nothing other than what has been actuarially decided upon &#x2014; a valuable pension scheme, to be sustained when the Secretary of State hit transport workers out of the public sector into the private sector.<br/>
Will the Secretary of State spell out the reasons why he cannot allow us to have this reasonable amendment? Are there any practical difficulties, or has he decided, meaning that that is the end of the matter?</p>

<p>I shall be extremely brief, because the arguments on both sides have been more than adequately rehearsed and because I am sure many hon. Members will be keen to get off to their supper.<br/>
I appreciate the points made by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State in his correspondence to me on this subject. Despite that, rightly or wrongly, much concern has been expressed in my constituency over the pensions issue. Bus men from depots in Langley Mill and Alfreton have taken a great deal of trouble courteously to explain and put their fears to him. I accept, although there are strong arguments on both sides, that their concern is genuine and not politically motivated. I feel that my right hon.

<p>It is absolutely astounding that some hon. Members should give their supper a higher priority than workers' pension rights. However, I am grateful for the fact that the hon. Member for Amber Valley (Mr. Oppenheim) has decided that he cannot support the Government on this issue.<br/>
The points against the Government have all been made by my hon. Friends. It is scandalous for any Secretary of State to treat any group of workers in this fashion, particularly considering that many thousands of transport workers have given a lifetime of loyal service to the public transport industry. It is scandalous that they will not even be allowed to retire with the guarantee of a decent pension. In some areas, with certain provisions, they might have the pension rights that we are seeking to guarantee, but that will be left to local variants, and in many cases they might not have proper pension rights.<br/>
I should like to re-emphasise the points made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Halton (Mr. Oakes) and my hon. Friend the Member for Sunderland, North (Mr. Clay) in respect of PTE employees. I welcome the fact that the PLCs that will be set up will be deemed to be admissible for inclusion into the local government superannuation scheme. However, the failure to make that mandatory is unjust and heartless to the extreme. If it is worth while to include the provision in the Bill, why not make it mandatory? I appeal to the Secretary of State, even at this late hour, to make it mandatory. If he cannot do it tonight, will he take steps to do it as soon as possible? If not, why not? How can he justify such a cruel decision? Can he not change his mind at the last minute and make the provision mandatory?</p>

<p>I want to make it clear that I thoroughly share the views of all hon. Members that this is a very

important matter, which has been rightly discussed at every stage during the Bill's progress both in the House and in another place. I want to try once more to persuade Opposition Members that they have not entirely grasped what is going on and that they are wrong in many of their allegations.<br/>
The right hon. Member for Halton (Mr. Oakes) and the hon. Members for Burnley (Mr. Pike) and for Glasgow, Shettleston (Mr. Marshall) referred to local government pensions. It is clear that they do not understand that any accrued rights of bus men employed in local government are safeguarded. Accrued rights for past service will remain in the local government scheme up to the time of seperation.<br/>
The hon. Member for Sunderland, North (Mr. Clay) was wrong when he said that he had been wise to move his pension into the House of Commons scheme. It. would have been equally safe in the local government scheme. We are discussing future arrangements for local government pensions, not accrued rights. That is an illustration of how some hon. Members have not grasped the point.<br/>
Future benefits in the National Bus Company are a different issue. The debate has been about accrued rights in the NBC scheme.
<q>It is not our policy to affect any existing pension rights&#x2014;that is, pension entitlements that employees have already earned and paid for through their contributions. The Bill contains nothing that would have that effect, and it would be wrong if it did." &#x2014; <i>[Official Report, Standing Committee F,</i> 18 March 1982; c. 345.]</q>
Since many hon. Members have quoted my hon. Friend the Minister of State, I should tell the House that that is a quotation from her speech on the 1982 Bill. I feel that I am justified in repeating it in this debate.<br/>
I shall take a little time to go through what has happened, because I am sure that hon. Members mean it when they say that they want to be reassured. Throughout I have stressed the importance of ensuring that the assets of the funds are adequate to meet their liabilities. It is the Government's clear undertaking to ensure that any deficiencies in the funds are eliminated at the time of privatisation following a fresh actuarial valuation on a prudent and reasonable basis. In Committee, many hon. Members and trustees did not think that that was sufficient assurance. They argued that something further should be done so that trustees would have more security to offer their members. Always helpful, I proposed that private sector insurance of the fund should be examined. I did that on Report, and not recently, as the hon. Member for Wigan (Mr. Stott) alleged.<br/>
That insurance is not in some way purchased by the Government, as the hon. Member seemed to suggest. It is a way by which the trustees could seek to ensure that their funds are adequate for their responsibilities for many years to come. Throughout the summer recess my Department and the trustees of the NBC and their advisers pursued these matters with insurance companies. The result has been that private sector insurance is available to assure present funds at a price within their reach. In other words, it should be possible for the trustees to provide for members one or more of the household names in the insurance industry as security for the benefit that members have built up. That option is now available.<br/>
Nevertheless, the trustees faced further difficulties. They might want to purchase the insurance now, which would have the effect that the House wants, but how could


they be sure that they could also cover by insurance the extra benefits that would accrue in the scheme over the next few years until privatisation is completed? Indeed, it might also be difficult to buy insurance straight away because some of the pension funds' assets, particularly property, might be difficult to realise and to turn quickly into cash to pay to the insurance company. Those difficulties were encountered during the summer.<br/>
However, the Government met the problem by making an offer to the trustees through the NBC and proposed that the company should make cash available to the trustees, in the form of a bridging loan, so that they could purchase insurance now if they wished, although they may not have sufficient liquid assets to do so.<br/>
We further proposed that the NBC should make available, through the employer's pension contributions, such further finance as may be necessary to ensure insurance cover over the next few years up to the end of the disposal programme. In this way, the trustees can now offer their members the certainty that has been asked for by hon. Members throughout our proceedings on the Bill. It is now available to the trustees to offer as they wish.<br/>
I take exception to the hon. Members who have alleged that accrued rights will be cut down, eroded or threatened. Worse still, Mr. Bill Morris of the Transport and General Workers Union was asked on Radio Four last week:
<q>But they won't lose the benefits that they've already accrued?</q>
He replied:
<q>Yes, in some instances there will be massive reductions of the pension benefits already earned by people employed in the National Bus Company.</q>
That is not so, as I have demonstrated. It cannot be so. When the leader of the union says that there will be massive reductions in benefits, I do not find it surprising that great alarm, fear and despondency have been stirred up among bus men about their pensions.</p>

<p>I am listening closely to the Secretary of State. The kernel of the issue is whether the trustees, who are charged with the responsibility of ensuring that the NBC pension fund is adequate for the purposes for which it was set up, accept what the right hon. Gentleman says about the new plan that he has devised.</p>
</speech>
<speech hansard_id="359153" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1985-10-29a.899.1" hansard_membership_id="11415" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/30570" speakername="Mr. Ridley" colnum="899" time="19:45:00">
<p>I will answer that question, but I wish first to refer to the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Derbyshire, West (Mr. Parris). In a sense, he is right, in that the commitment to buy insurance will cost something, which will increase the financial exposure of the NBC and thus of the Government. However, I have always made it clear that the Government were prepared to ensure that sufficient money was made available to ensure the adequacy of the pension fund. This is the form in which such a pledge will be implemented if that is what the trustees decide to do.<br/>
My hon. Friend's argument is faulty, because if the Government gave a guarantee at the taxpayers' expense, that would save the insurance premium, but the saving would go not to the Government, but to the fund and, therefore, it would be an unequal transaction.<br/>
We think it right to propose that the benefits in one of the schemes, which are currently linked to average national earnings, should instead be linked to the rise in

retail prices plus 1&#x00B7;5 per cent. and not just to the rise in the retail price index, as Mr. Morris and some Opposition Members seem to think.<br/>
I have had an analysis done of which has been better over the past 10 years&#x2014;the earnings index or retail prices plus 1&#x00B7;5 per cent. In five of the years, one was better and in the other five years, the other was better. I believe that the difference is equivalent. It would make the insurance more cost effective and it would give the fund member the certainty of a fixed percentage over and above prices. The benefits to be obtained from the insurance option are at least equivalent, therefore, and in many circumstances could be said to be better. One of those circumstances would be if we ever had the disaster of an Alliance or a Labour Government. I am certain that we would all rather have 1&#x00B7;5 per cent. more than RPI, than earnings under them. There could be many times when it would be wiser to go for RPI plus 1&#x00B7;5 per cent.<br/>
8 pm<br/>
The right hon. Member for Halton (Mr. Oakes) referred to the advisers to the pension fund trustees. I think that he was trying to make the point that the Department's suggestion on how to secure insurance might lay them open to legal challenge. I can only tell him that my legal advice is that that is not so. I do not know of advice other than that which they have received, but I can say that this basic choice exists for the trustees, because it is they who are responsible for these funds and for paying the pensions, the accrued rights. They can take some form of insurance option to give that extra security which many hon. Members have sought, my hon. Friend the Member for Amber Valley (Mr. Oppenheim) prominent among them.<br/>
Or the trustees will be able to say, "We are better fund managers and we can be sure that the funds that we have set up will be adequate to provide that security because we believe that we are cleverer than an insurance company." Then they will have taken the responsibility to themselves. The responsibility in this matter lies not with the Government but with the trustees of the pension funds.<br/>
This brings me to all the examples quoted by the hon. Gentleman on the Opposition Benches &#x2014; British Telecom, British Airways, Sealink and many other firms that have been or will be privatised. In not one single case has a Government guarantee been given to the pension fund. It has always been recognised that the trustees are the people who are responsible. In no case has a Government guarantee be given nor will it be given in the future. The hon. Member for Hartlepool (Mr. Leadbitter) is therefore quite wrong. These employees are receiving treatment which is identical to that given to the pension assets of every other group of privatised workers.<br/>
I could say that we have gone far further in relation to the bus men's pensions than with any other group of privatised workers because we have taken immense trouble to facilitate the provision of insurance, if they wish it, and to make sure that the funds will be adequate to buy that insurance, if that is what the trustees prefer.<br/>
An occupational pension is not a pension produced or guaranteed by Government, not even in the nationalised industries. Even if the National Bus Company were to remain in the public sector, the Government would not guarantee its pension funds. There is, therefore, a complete difference between what the Opposition are


seeking, which is a Government guarantee of a private pension fund, and the reality of security, which is what the bus men actually want.<br/>
The measures that I have outlined give the option of that very full security. I should have thought it more likely that some of the great insurance companies of this country would still be solvent long after the country had gone bankrupt under a Labour Government. I would rather have a guarantee from the Standard Life company than from any conceivable Labour Government. If we are talking about security, that is where security comes. I will therefore ask Opposition Members to stop trying to frighten the bus men, to make them fear for their own pensions, in order to make these cheap political points against the Bill. I ask the House to reject their amendments.</p>

<p>Although this has been a very interesting debate, sadly we have made little progress in persuading the Secretary of State of the very genuine fears in the industry regarding pension provisions. The hon. Member for Derbyshire, West (Mr. Parris), to use his own phraseology&#x2014;turned round on him by my hon. Friend the Member for Sunderland, North (Mr. Clay)&#x2014;made a very Jesuitical speech. Those of us who have served on Standing Committees with him over the past few years are used to his making that kind of speech. He is a past master at walking on barbed wire. According to my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Maryhill, (Mr. Craigen), he is the only person who could talk himself out of his own arguments. There was more than a grain of truth in what the hon. Gentleman said, and in his approach to this serious matter he demonstrated the way in which, in conscience, he ought to vote on this issue.<br/>
Not so his hon. Friend the Member for Amber Valley (Mr. Oppenheim) who is taking the middle road out of all this. He believes neither the Secretary of State nor me, so he will not support either of us. He will sit on his hands. If he thinks that that is going to save him from ignominious defeat at the next election, I must tell him that it will not because there is a great deal of resentment among people in the transport industry.</p>

<p>We will see about that. I assure the hon. Gentleman that I have as much concern, or more concern, with this matter and the other matters that we will debate before 10 o'clock, when I have to go to my supper.<br/>
The Secretary of State has outlined the way in which he has moved. I concede that he has moved on this matter. He has moved because he has been forced to do so, because we have highlighted the difficulties and the seething resentment about this matter in the transport industry. Yet the Secretary of State has still not got the message. I will put a forthright question: do the trustees of the National Bus Company's pension fund accept what he says and agree with him? They do not. They do not believe that what he proposes will be beneficial to the members of the pension fund.<br/>
The Secretary of State had the audacity to say that he had taken legal advice. This is the man who has been before the courts of this country, not once, not twice, but three times, on the legal advice of his officials, and been found guilty on every count of being irrational and irresponsible and of acting illegally. Even today, the High

Court has overturned his own legal advice on an appeal against the GLC lorry ban. We cannot take seriously the Secretary of State's legal advice or the way in which he interprets these matters.<br/>
We have tried persuasion. We have tried argument. We have tried to put forward the views expressed to us by the thousands of people who will be affected by this legislation. The Secretary of State has taken no notice of the most important issue concerning them. I am left with no option but to invite my hon. Friends to come into the Lobby with me and vote in favour of the amendment.</p>

<p>The amendment deals with some remnants of history. It provides the Secretary of State with an order-making power to disolve subsidiaries of the NCB that are statutory companies constituted under local Acts of Parliament or an order under the Light Railways Act 1896. There are three such NCB subsidiaries. All are dormant companies, and it is highly unlikely that any private purchaser would want to acquire them, particularly as at least one of them would have a duty to provide certain services. The preferred solution is therefore to dissolve them by order.</p>

<p>These amendments reinstate section 9(5) of the Transport Act 1968. That provision, which allows district councils to assist a PTE, and vice versa, was proposed to be repealed as it applies to Scotland because Scottish district councils no longer have transport functions. However, as a result of representations from the Strathclyde PTE, that under this power they enter into agreements with district councils for such matters as the cleaning and maintenance of bus shelters, it was decided to reinstate section 9(5) for Scotland, with a minor drafting change to alter the description of the area from "designated" to "passenger transport".</p>

<p>I believe that these changes will be welcomed in all parts of the House. They place new duties on authorities to consult about their transport policies, to publish a statement of those policies and to liaise with one another to secure better co-ordination between social services, education and transport authorities on how best to meet all their transport requirements. When it left the House, the Bill contained certain consultation duties on county, regional and island councils, but not on PTAs, and co-operation duties on education and transport but not on social services authorities.<br/>
These amendments fill those gaps. They also ensure that county, regional and island councils which exercise all three functions must equally have regard to all their responsibilities when drawing up their transport policies. It was impressed upon my right hon. Friend in Standing Committee that a requirement on authorities to publish a statement of policies would usefully improve accountability to the electorate. These amendments do that while avoiding unnecessary burdens on authorities. The amendments also require PTAs, county, regional and island councils to consult each other where their policies may affect each other's areas. I am sure that this will be welcomed by authorities and passengers alike.</p>

<p>These amendments have an important purpose. On Report in another place the Government were asked to remove any possible scope for misunderstanding

about the roles of the PTA and the PTE which could conceivably arise from the drafting of the Bill The amendments seek to state the roles of the authority and its executive more clearly. I hope that the House will welcome it if I describe briefly what those roles are.<br/>
The PTA will be responsible for assessing the transport requirements which exist within its area. It will also be responsible for formulating general policies about the descriptions of services which should be secured to meet those requirements. It will then be the responsibility of the executive, the PTE, to secure the services which, in its professional judgment, it believes to be appropriate to implement the policies of the authority. It will have the power to do so by entering into agreements for service subsidies, subject to the tendering provisions of the Bill, but this power is to be exercised in accordance with the authority's general policies. The amendments also make clear the responsibilities of non-metropolitan authorities. If any hon. Member would like me to do so, I can go into those at length.</p>

<p>These amendments are carefully designed to meet points which were made not only by hon. Members but in another place. Some concern was


expressed about the Bill's requirement for PTEs to form a company for the purpose of carrying passengers by road within, to and from, but not completely outside, their areas. The Government initially had doubts about whether this phrase would prevent the initial company from maintaining services outside its area, which, for historical reasons, the PTE had assumed responsibility for and had confirmed that it would provide. We carefully considered the arguments that were put to us, particularly in relation to the services run by the Greater Manchester PTE in Glossop and agreed that there might be some doubt about the position.<br/>
These amendments were tabled to put an end to that doubt. They make it clear that the initial company should be formed to provide any of the services now carried out by the PTE, including any outside its area. They also make quite sure that the new company will have adequate scope to make alterations to the services which it provides, including the provision of related new services, by classifying a later clause to make it clear that the company may engage in any activities, including new ones, which can conveniently be carried on in association with the executive's existing activities. I am sure that hon. Members will be glad to have a constructive response from the Government to a genuine doubt which arose during the passage of the Bill.</p>

<p>It is important to examine exactly what their Lordships have done in amendment No. 121. The


Government's response by the noble Lord Trefgarne to the amendments moved by Lord Banks appear to be reasonable, but on close examination a number of inadequacies are revealed. We can narrow them down to four. Let us first examine the financial liability. Any service by an employee within a superannuation scheme up to the date of transfer to the company is protected. It leaves aside the question of how the pension increases are to be funded in the absence of any central Government funding. There are two options. The first is for the company. If an employee is transferred to a company, the cost of funding pension increases from previous service could be borne by the company as a transferred liability from the executive. That would affect the company's ability to compete because the cost would be substantial.<br/>
The cost could be retained by the executive, but it would then become the first charge on the revenue grant from the authority as that would be the only source of income. That would adversely affect the ability to subsidise services and grant concessionary fares unless the Secretary of State allowed an additional amount above the EFL for that purpose.<br/>
Even though the gratuity schemes are covered by the amendments, no reference is made to former employees who retired before their employing authority brought transferred employees within the scope of superannuation. In some instances, these schemes have been unfunded and payments have been made by the executive out of general income. There is protection for any such scheme under local powers, but some have their origins in acquired undertakings.<br/>
It is expected that this liability will continue to be borne by the executive, but in some cases there might be no legal obligations to do so. With the pressure on the precept which will be the only source of funding for the executive, there can be no guarantee. The suggestion is that there should be some protection for retired employees in receipt of gratuities.<br/>
Earlier, the Secretary of State referred to the employees' option. The Government intend to alter the local government superannuation regulations to allow company employees to be admitted to the scheme. That is the deemed option. The option is given to the company or local authority, not to the employee. If that option is not exercised by the employer, the employee's position could be adversely affected since the new scheme might not be as good as the local government superannuation scheme. Alternatively, the employers might not be prepared to admit the employees to the scheme on grounds of ill health or old age. In such circumstances, it could be impossible for the employee to protect himself by private arrangements. It is therefore important that the employee should have the right to opt.<br/>
God forbid that bankruptcy should occur, but one never knows. Bankruptcy is not covered. That might be acceptable in respect of new employees, but it could be grossly unfair to existing employees since it could affect previous service as well as service with a particular company. Employees with local authority sectors in transport undertakings work for organisations which cannot go bankrupt. Thus, they enjoy complete security. They organise their personal affairs accordingly. Their position is altered by the Bill and employees might now

be unable to protect themselves adequately in the absence of a Government guarantee in respect of their superannuation rights.<br/>
A serious problem is revealed by our discussions on pensions and superannuation, not just for the National Bus Company and its employees but for the thousands of employees of the PTEs and municipal undertakings throughout the country.<br/>
I do not wish to press our amendments to a Division, but I hope that the Secretary of State will examine what I have said and perhaps devise a way of incorporating in legislation the spirit of what I have said.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman has made a constructive, detailed and complicated speech which I shall try to answer as fully as I can. I shall be happy to supplement my reply with a letter, because some of his remarks were highly technical.<br/>
Before replying I shall say something about the Lords amendment which the Government recommend the House to accept. It was introduced by the Government to give power to PTEs and PTAs to provide for the continuance of staff benefits for employees of their bus companies who, as the result of deregulation or restructuring, might otherwise lose staff benefits&#x2014;principally free or reduced price travel or, as the hon. Member for Wigan (Mr. Stott) said, gratuities.<br/>
Alternatively, it provides for compensation to be paid if the benefits are not to be continued. The intention is simple and limited. This proposed power will be complementary to the scheme-making process, allowing the arrangements for fringe benefits to continue so far as is practicable and for the negotiation of adequate replacements in cash or in kind when they are not.<br/>
PTE employees are currently all members of the local government superannuation scheme. They will have a benefit accrued in that scheme representing their service up to the time of transfer to the public transport company. I stress, as I said when we debated the last amendment dealing with pensions, that whatever arrangements are made for the future, transferred staff will be entitled to keep their accrued benefit preserved in the local government superannuation scheme, where it is now.<br/>
The hon. Member for Wigan asked what would happen if a company went bust. If the employees had accrued benefits with the local government superannuation scheme, they would be preserved in the event of the company going bust, up to the time of transfer. It is impossible to imagine that a local government scheme would go bust. That is a remote possibility only. No statutory provision is needed for that; it already exists in the rules of the scheme. That preserved benefit will be increased in line with prices until the person concerned retires and receives it as a pension. Thereafter, the pension, too, will be increased in line with prices.<br/>
It is important that I should make it clear that staff can keep their accrued benefit in their existing pension schemes and that it is covered, in relation to increases in the cost of living, in the way that I described. I again take issue with Bill Morris, who seemed to imply that that was not so. Talking about the strike, he said:
<q>The strike is not a strike against the Government. It is an argument with the employers. The employers have it in their authority to guarantee our members continued membership of the local government superannuation scheme. We want to make that absolutely clear.</q>


I do not want him to mislead bus men into thinking that in some way they are being taken out of the scheme for accrued rights. That is not the case, as I have said.<br/>
The hon. Member for Wigan asked about the cost of this to the local authority. The employees of PTEs and bus undertakings stay the same. Costs can be allocated by local decision to a PTE or a company. We have said that we will look at the GRE if costs shift between different types of authority. In any event, the pensioners are secure. Thus, thought is being given to that as part of ensuring that the local authority financial regime will accommodate what is being done.<br/>
As for the future, we shall not impose any pension arrangements on the public transport company. It would be strange if we did, because the whole point of setting up these companies is to ensure that they can be run as independent, free-standing concerns able to respond to local travellers' needs and local commercial circumstances. It is exactly on that sort of local managerial flexibility that the prosperity of the bus industry and its employees must depend.<br/>
Thus, we must leave the company free to negotiate pension arrangements with staff, just as it would negotiate any other term or condition of service &#x2014; just as any other company is free to negotiate with its employees. We must not give the new companies an unfair disadvantage compared with their competitors. That point was made in the earlier pensions debate.<br/>
8.45 pm<br/>
I am in no doubt that the companies will be thoroughly responsible employers and do their best for their staff. The hon. Gentleman referred to ill health and old age. It is unlikely that any employer would set up a scheme which excluded his own staff. Most modern pension schemes have no health test, so it is good management practice which these companies should, as many companies do, seek to follow.<br/>
They will have the option to continue to participate in the local government superannuation scheme as far as transferred employees are concerned. We recognise that, and we shall make it possible by making the necessary changes to the relevant regulations. Thus, the PTE, with the agreement of the company, can arrange for continued membership of the LGSS for transferred employees. In other words, the Government are willing to make options available for local decision by the company and its parent.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman then asked why we could not allow individuals the choice of deciding whether or not to stay in the local government superannuation scheme. Individual choice would be inconsistent with the principles of the LGSS, and with most other occupational pension schemes, too. Apart from anything else, the decision has cost implications for the employer, and therefore for the financial success of the company as a whole.<br/>
The decision must ultimately be for management, but, as responsible employers, they would want to consult carefully the staff representatives. The hon. Gentleman will realise that in no occupational scheme is it an individual decision; it is a decision taken by the employer after discussions with his staff and maybe the trade unions.<br/>
I hope that those remarks are of help to the hon. Member for Wigan. I believe that he will agree that his amendment would not be appropriate. Accordingly, I hope that he will not press it.</p>

<p>I may have the position wrong because I am not an expert on pensions. If, under the local authority, the municipal bus services as they now exist are privatised and the new owner of the privatised bus company wishes to avail himself of the opportunity of remaining within the local government pension scheme, I gather that he can do so. In other words, it is entirely a matter for the proprietor.<br/>
However, if it is part of the National Bus Company, that situation will not apply because that company's pension scheme is to be would up and the accrued benefit will go to those employees who at the time of the winding up, are still in the employment of the National Bus Company or one of its subsidiaries. From then on they will be at risk if their new employer does not run a suitable pension scheme. Is that right or wrong?</p>

<speech hansard_id="359266" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1985-10-29a.918.1" hansard_membership_id="11415" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/30570" speakername="Mr. Ridley" colnum="918" time="20:30:00">
<p>The hon. Gentleman was not right in his second point. If a local government bus operation became a company, whether or not it had private capital in it, the company could opt to stay in the LGSS. The accrued: rights up to the time of the transfer must stay in the local government scheme and be available.<br/>
With the National Bus Company there is no continuing pension fund, unless the trustees decide that they would like to do that. If the trustees were to decide not to take insurance but to continue to run the fund, they would be able to do that and to safeguard the assets which had accrued at the time of transfer. They would have to run it for perhaps another 50 years because people with service would still be drawing pensions from the fund in 50 Years' time. That is from where the desire for greater security came.<br/>
The privatised subsidiaries or companies from the National Bus Company could decide either to stay with such an arrangement, if it were to come into existence, and leave their pension business with that fund, or to set up their own funds for future service.<br/>
Obviously, they cannot decide to set up their own funds for accrued rights, but they can for the future. There is an analogy between both instances: for future service the choice is with the future company; for past service the choice is with the LGSS for local government bus operations and with the National Bus Company pension funds for past service with the NBC. The earlier arguments concerned how best to guarantee and give security to the accrued rights of the National Bus Company fund.</p>

<q>(2) Subject to the following provisions of this section, the authority or authorities responsible for administration of any such scheme may at any time by notice in writing served on any operator or prospective operator of an eligible service (including an operator already participating in the scheme) impose on him an obligation to provide travel concessions in accordance with the scheme on journeys on any such service operated by that operator to which the notice applies.
A notice under this subsection is referred to below in this Part of this Act as a participation notice.</q>
<q>(3) The power under subsection (2) above to serve a participation notice shall not be exercisable in relation to any such scheme until after the date (or whichever last occurs of the respective dates) of first publication under section <i>(Publicity requirements for schemes and reimbursement arrangements)</i> of this Act of particulars of the scheme and of the current reimbursement arrangements for eligible service operators participating in the scheme as they are to apply on initial establishment of the scheme.</q>

the authority or authorities responsible for administration of the scheme may, not less than such period before the variation is to take effect as may be prescribed, by notice served on any operator of any such service who is under an obligation under this section to provide travel concessions in accordance with the scheme, require him to indicate, within such period and in such manner as may be prescribed, whether or not he is willing to continue to participate in the scheme after the variation takes effect.</q>
<q>(7) Any notice under subsection (6) above shall give particulars of the proposed variation.</q>
<q>(8) Where in pursuance of subsection (6) above an operator indicates that he is not willing to continue to participate in the scheme after the variation takes effect, any obligation of that operator under this section to provide travel concessions in accordance with the scheme which was current at the date of the notice under that subsection and would still apart from this subsection be in force on the date when the variation takes effect shall cease on the latter date (without prejudice, however, to the service of a new participation notice).</q>
<q>(9) Where a notice is served on an operator under subsection (6) above the preceding provisions of this section shall apply, on and after the date when the variation in question takes effect, in relation to any obligation of that operator under subsection (2) above to provide travel concessions in accordance with the scheme in question which&#x2014;

<p>When the Bill left the House, it contained eight clauses concerned with travel concessions. It now returns to us with 13 clauses, all of which contain amendments and all but three of which were only tabled in their present form in another place. I would like to explain to the House why the Government felt such radical action was necessary.<br/>
During the Bill's passage through the House the Government gave a commitment to introduce provisions for operators of local services to be required to enter a concessionary fare scheme if they were unwilling to do so on a voluntary basis. This power complements the right that operators have to enter any concessionary fare scheme established on a voluntary basis and enjoy its benefits. At short notice, on the Report, the Government tabled new clauses to make the necessary provision for compulsory participation. The principles behind these clauses remain in the amendments that we are now considering, although it has been necessary to refine much of the detail.<br/>
I hope that the House will forgive me if I do not go into all the technical changes that have been made. These have been fully examined in another place. The advent of the compulsory participation provision, which was requested by this House, has required us to recast the form of many of the clauses as they originally appeared in the Bill.<br/>
However, more substantively, we recognise that in giving this power to local authorities we have to ensure that it is not used to the detriment of the operator. Following representations from my hon. Friend the Member for Wellingborough (Mr. Fry), an amendment was introduced to allow compensation to be awarded to an operator who can show that the terms under which he is reimbursed for his compulsory participation are inadequate, either when the initial compulsory participation is imposed or at any time during its course. There is also provision for the Secretary of State to release operators from compulsory participation at any time if the reimbursement is inadequate. There is provision for a time limit to be set on the duration of a single period of compulsory participation so that an authority has to take stock of its arrangements from time to time.<br/>
None of these amendments diminish the power of an authority to use its power to invoke compulsory participation&#x2014;they merely ensure that it is done fairly. Before the amendments on compulsory participation were

introduced, it was felt in some quarters that too much of an advantage rested with the operators. With these amendments, I feel that we have now reached an equilibrium between the interests of the operators and authorities.<br/>
A number of other amendments have been tabled to clarify the powers of local authorities and to ensure the effective provision of concessions. A concessionary fares scheme may now be limited to only part of an area so that an authority can use its powers to establish schemes for children, for example, selectively to top up whatever is commercially available. The definition of "children" has been more precisely formulated so that authorities have the power to provide concessions for school children at any time up to their 19th birthday.<br/>
The amendments meet the concern expressed by some authorities that they may find difficulty in running an effective scheme by providing that within limits they may control the times of entry to and exit from their scheme by operators. Steps have also been taken to meet the concern expressed by operators that the administration of a scheme might be left to one dominant operator in an area to the disadvantage of his competitors. The Secretary of State now has the power to make regulations to cover that.<br/>
Provision has been made also for concessions to be provided on the limited number of services that will continue to be operated directly by the PTE or local authorities following the formation of the new public transport companies.<br/>
Finally, I draw the attention of the House to two sets of amendments that are now incorporated within clause 87 that should allay fears that were expressed in another place about the adequacy of local authorities' powers to provide concessions. As it left the House, the Bill was designed to reproduce the powers which authorities already had under the Transport Act 1968 in relation to the services to be covered and the provision of concessions for pensioners, the blind, and those suffering from handicaps which severely impair their ability to walk. It also gave authorities the power to provide concessions for children. However, it became clear during debate and in the light of consultation with the authorities that there was a problem over rail services in the non-metropolitan counties.<br/>
The powers in the Bill as drafted reflected the situation in which the metropolitan counties had powers to provide concessions on rail services in their areas as a result of their general responsibilities for the support of those services under section 26 of the 1968 Act. However, there were no corresponding powers for authorities in the shire areas. It appears that a number of non-metropolitan authorities and their equivalent in Scotland are already providing support for rail services. Indeed, in some instances local rail services are at least as important to local transport facilities as the bus services that were covered by the powers under the 1968 Act.<br/>
It was therefore decided to remove the distinctions between metropolitan and other areas so that all authorities will have the power to provide concessions on all forms of public passenger transport services.</p>

<p>Perhaps the Minister will be rather more explicit. In Coventry there are at least half a dozen routes which do not make a profit although they are well used by holders of concessionary tickets. What will happen, when the Bill is enacted, to ensure the continuance of service on these routes? The Minister has mentioned that operators who might be interested in tendering for such routes are already expressing doubts about their ability to handle the necessary administration of such schemes.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman is bringing together two slightly different aspects of the legislation. In the areas where services currently require subsidy, the Bill provides that those routes should be put out to tender, if the local authority so wishes, to ensure that they are run in the most cost-effective way to the level required by the local authority.<br/>
On concessionary fares, authorities will be allowed to draw up their schemes, and it is for them to decide in what areas and to what extent such schemes should apply. That matter is now being regulated, especially by the restructuring part of the Bill that has come to us from another place.<br/>
I accept that there are some complexities in what I am setting out, but it is important to appreciate that, if we are to have a scheme that works fairly and properly&#x2014;many of the ideas for the scheme have come from hon. Members on both sides of the House &#x2014; we cannot produce something as simple as was originally envisaged.<br/>
I come now to another group of amendments from another place, which were tabled by Lord Carmichael of Kelvingrove, Lord Stallard and Baroness Stedman. I hope that the House will give the Government credit for accepting these amendments. Although they give my right hon. Friend a wide general power to add additional groups to those eligible to receive concessions under clause 87 by order, they reflect the debate in another place about specific problems that have arisen in relation to groups of people who are eligible to receive assistance with travelling expenses under the terms of the National Assistance Act 1948.<br/>
Those groups, including people such as the mentally handicapped and the deaf and dumb, are eligible to receive support from social services authorities. However, it has become clear that in some cases&#x2014;Greater Manchester springs to mind&#x2014;concessions are being provided not by the social services authority that has the statutory powers, but by the transport authority.<br/>
We have reached the conclusion that it would be appropriate to provide a machinery for removing the financial and administrative problems that would result if transport authorities did not have the power to provide concessions for people in those groups. It is in the light of those problems that we accepted the amendments, which I hope will be welcomed by the House.<br/>
My right hon. Friend, in consultation with my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Social Services, will consider how best the order-making power can be used to extend the coverage of schemes to those in groups covered by the 1948 Act. It is obviously only right that any decision should be taken jointly by both my right hon. Friends, bearing in mind their common responsibilities and the continuing interest that social services authorities inevitably must have in that area. I must, however, emphasise to the House that, in accepting the amendments, the Government have in mind the problems in relation to the 1948 Act.<br/>
Although the amendments on concessionary fares are substantial in number, they continue, in a more refined form, the central policy to which this House has already agreed, and extend the coverage of concessionary fares in a manner which I hope the House will support.<br/>
I am sorry to have dealt with this matter at some length, but the provisions are new to the House. I hope that I have, at least in outline, explained the way in which the Government see them working.</p>

<p>I wish to speak to the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Crewe and Nantwich (Mrs. Dunwoody) to Lords amendment No. 223.<br/>
The Minister did not have the benefit of a Scottish education &#x2014; <i>[Interruption.]</i> Well, he did not have a Scottish primary or secondary education. At one stage I thought that he was in danger of getting his three Rs wrong because he spoke of radical action, refining much of the Bill and recasting many of its clauses. Frankly, we take the view that the Government, rather than extending the area of concessionary fares and the principles that underlie the system, have actually narrowed the application.<br/>
The Minister referred to Lord Carmichael of Kelvingrove. I have just seen a long letter that my hon. Friend wrote to Lord Belstead after the long passage of the Bill in the other place, expressing some misgivings about the way in which the Government sought to restrict some of the concessions which will operate in practice.<br/>
I noted what the Minister said about the National Assistance Act of 1948 to which Lord Carmichael also referred in his letter. I am not unmindful of the way in which the legislation applicable to Scotland operated in recent years under the Concessionary Travel for Handicapped Persons (Scotland) Act 1980. When discussing concessionary fares we must bear in mind that one of the largest restraints on the operation of concessionary fare schemes is the way in which the Government continue to cut the amount of aid to local authorities. That will be the biggest constraint on the ability of local authorities to provide and finance adequate concessionary schemes. No matter what is said, and no matter what legislation the Government say is there in a discretionary form, if the resources are not available to local authorities the schemes will become inoperable.</p>

<p>Is my hon. Friend aware that in recent months when I have gone to


see elderly people, on every occasion the inevitable question is, "What is going to be done about concessionary fares?" That is the fear uppermost in people's minds. It is a justifiable fear because, as my hon. Friend said, at the end of the day it depends on the amount of money available from the Government. It is remarkable that a Government who pay lip service to the elderly and the care of the elderly should, in effect, be putting the concessionary fares scheme in danger.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend did not have the advantage that we had of serving hour after hour on the Transport Bill Standing Committee. Even if he had, he would still be unable to assuage the fears of his elderly constituents, because the Minister did not give the guarantees necessary to eliminate those genuine fears. We had a lot of soft soap from Ministers and, as the hours wore on, even some of the most dim-witted Government Backbenchers&#x2014;there were one or two&#x2014;began to realise that the concessionary scheme was not going to do all that the Minister claimed it would do.<br/>
The second main area in which we have to be wary about the Government's pronouncements is about the extent to which local authorities will be able to exercise discretion. Even where there is a will, we now have ratecapping, and the Government, by reducing the amount of transport subsidy, will have a second bite at local authorities, because, effectively, the Government can reduce what local authorities are able to do to sustain concessionary schemes.<br/>
In Scotland the average fare in the regions and islands works out at half fare and, in some instances, at a third fare. I am afraid that that will he squeezed even more because of the reduction in the transport subsidy forthcoming from central Government and because of the way in which the Department of the Environment, the Scottish Office and the Welsh Office will work the principles of rate capping.<br/>
The Minister referred to the arrangements for the blind, and I shall put on my spectacles for a minute. Bodies such as the Royal National Institute for the Blind and the National League of the Blind and Disabled are worried about the position of the partially sighted passengers as a group. Their numbers are not inconsiderable. In March 1982 there were about 58,000 registered partially sighted people in England. In March 1984 the figure was 3,271 in Scotland and 4,876 in Wales. In December 1983 there were 1,230 registered partially sighted people in Northern Ireland.<br/>
Will the Minister make it clear that these people will not be disadvantaged by the radical changes, recastings and refinements in the other place? Lord Carmichael of Kelvingrove went into the matter in some detail in his letter to Lord Belstead, but I shall not weary the House with the details. It is understandable that a person who spent a bit of time looking at the Bill during its passage through the other place took pen to paper and wrote three pages to the Minister. I hope that the Minister can assuage some of our genuine fears.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend is right to voice concerns about the future of concessionary fares. Does he agree that it is a matter of not only the lack of resources but the possible lack of services? Does he agree that many areas which have services used by people who benefit from

concessionary fares are likely, because of the Bill's long-term effects, to have drastically reduced services or even no services? What use is a concessionary fare if there are no services to use it on?</p>

<p>I can tell that my hon. Friend was not hauled up the Clyde in a barrel. Obviously, services need to be running before we can benefit from concessionary fares. Our colleagues and I have taken issue with the Government over the rest of their obnoxious legislation. We are well aware that the other clauses will seriously cripple the ability of operators in many parts of the country to run adequate services.<br/>
I have been trying to keep within the confines of order, so I have concentrated merely on dealing with concessionary fares. I hope that the House will in due course agree the amendments standing in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Crewe and Nantwich (Mrs. Dunwoody) because they seek not only to broaden the range of groups who should be eligible for concessionary fares but to avoid any confusion from a Government team that was clearly mystified by the whole process during the Bill's passage.</p>

<p>I shall speak in a positive tone, unlike the hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mr. Craigen) who showed a negative view. I should like my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State to comment further on the partially sighted to whom the hon. Member for Maryhill rightly alluded. In another place on 24 October the Government accepted an amendment intended to help disabled passengers. I welcome that.<br/>
9.15 pm<br/>
I want to make a point which may be in danger of being overlooked. Surely our aim is to ensure that the partially sighted are not excluded from the categories for whom concessionary fares may be provided, if local authorities wish. The Government have agreed to include a power for the Secretary of State to specify "other classes of persons" as eligible for concessions in addition to those already listed in the Bill. In other words, we are going further than pensioners, children, full-time students under the age of 18, blind people and those with a seriously impaired ability to walk.<br/>
I understand that it is the Government's intention to make an order specifying the other categories who are to be eligible. Lord Belstead, the Minister in another place, referred to the mentally handicapped, the deaf, the dumb and other passengers. He said that the Government would consider how far it would be appropriate for transport authorities to provide concessions for disabled people other than those named in the Bill.<br/>
The point should be registered that partially sighted passengers often have the same mobility needs as blind people and should be among those for whom transport authorities may make provision. Partially sighted people may use buses to avoid a hazardous journey by foot involving busy road crossings. A partially sighted person's level of sight may be affected greatly by changing light conditions, such as darkness on a winter morning or shadowy light and dark. Partially sighted people are often found in low income groups and may have difficulty in finding work. Public transport is vital for them.<br/>
I am glad that the Government intend to improve the provisions for eligibility for concessionary fares and I am concerned to make sure that the partially sighted are


included, numbering as they do a small category compared with the 130,000 registered blind in the United Kingdom. The Government have argued previously that groups outside those listed in the Bill can be covered if social services departments decide to use their powers under the National Assistance Act 1948. Reference has already been made to that. The Government's acceptance of the amendment in the other place is a welcome recognition that problems arise and that the powers of transport authorities should be widened.<br/>
Some authorities include wider categories. The Concessionary Travel for Handicapped Persons (Scotland) Act 1980 extends eligibility in Scotland without the legal complications that arise in the rest of Britain. For example, Tayside and Fife regional councils are among those who give concessionary fares to partially sighted passengers. Thus there is a strong case for that group to be included in categories that are specified as eligible under this legislation. If they are not included, they may be left worse off than they are now.</p>

<p>Opposition Members are disturbed because the Bill places more emphasis on giving fair treatment to operators than to those who are willing to use the transport services. That is demonstrated dramatically in the provisions for concessionary fares. Unfortunately, because of the time restriction, we have to rely on the arguments that were put forward previously.<br/>
This is a key issue that will affect many people. In Committee the Government refused to accept amendments which would have ensured a future for concessionary travel instead of the patchwork system which may result. The word "may" in the clause does not give sufficient security for the general provision of concessionary travel throughout the country.<br/>
It is hypocritical for any Member to suggest that the Conservatives are concerned about elderly or disabled people not being socially mobile unless there is a concessionary fares system, when the whole public transport system will be severely truncated as a result of the Bill. Conservative members have said in Committee and again today that they want to look after these groups of people but they know that the Secretary of State for the Environment will immediately start cutting the money available and that there is no provision in this or any other legislation to ensure that within the general targets laid down for local authorities or in the rate support grant settlements money can be made available specifically to support concessionary fares schemes.<br/>
This is a missed opportunity. The Bill should have provided an opportunity for the Government to go forwards rather than backwards and to show that they are caring and compassionate and want to provide a decent concessionary travel scheme throughout the country. The opportunity has been missed because they do not care. They probably never use public transport and do not appreciate the enormous difficulties that old people, disabled people and young people face, especially in rural areas. The Government have been found lacking in this respect and I hope that some Conservative Members will support the amendment.</p>

<p>In Committee, Conservative Members were anxious to protect and, indeed, to improve the provisions

for concessionary fares. I believe that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State delivered our hopes in full on Report and he seems, indeed, to have improved on that today.<br/>
I seek my right hon. Friend's clarification on one aspect &#x2014; the protection of the legitimate budgeting of local authorities. Members will recall that in Committee I outlined a mechanism whereby a local authority could establish a fair and reasonable valuation of the concessionary pass and thus know at the beginning of the financial year its total commitment for that year. The administrative mechanism whereby that budget was shared among the operators was not in my view, or in that of local authority treasurers, an insurmountable problem.<br/>
I seek an assurance from the Government today that under the new provisions local authorities will still be able to establish a finite budget. If they cannot do so, the fear of an open-ended commitment may force some authorities to move reluctantly from a pass scheme to a token scheme when they do not wish to do so. If my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State can give an assurance that finite budgets and therefore passes will still be possible, I believe that the last remaining fears of local authorities can be set aside<br/>
We have heard the customary noises from the Opposition and the main thrust of the argument made by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mr. Craigen) has been that even if the Bill achieves all these things, any failure to deliver a concessionary fares scheme will be the fault of wicked central Government failing to provide the resources. In fact, as anyone who has been involved in local government knows, it is not central Government who will determine whether the provision will be made. The rather perverse priorities of some authorities will be the key to whether old age pensioners are threatened. Local authorities which have their priorities right will always find the money for a scheme of the kind that has been set out today.</p>

<p>It is rich of Opposition Members to spend their weekends storming up and down the country telling elderly people that their concessionary fares scheme will be taken away, and then spend the weekdays reporting to the House that they have encountered much alarm among elderly people about the future of their pension schemes.<br/>
The Government have been able to allay two anxieties which existed in Derbyshire. We were worried about our ability to support concessionary fares schemes on the railways as well as the buses and my hon. Friend has confirmed that that will now be possible. Secondly, we were worried about provision for the mentally handicapped. We knew that we could make such provision through the social services but it would be more sensible to make it through the county council's transport department. My hon. Friend the Minister said that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Transport will be able to arrange for that by order. Those are two small but helpful alterations to the Bill and I welcome them.</p>

<p>I am grateful to my hon. Friends for the appreciation that they have shown for the amendments which have been made. As I said earlier, I believe that the scheme we are putting forward now is an improvement. It is largely based on the suggestions made by hon. Members during the progress of the Bill. It is significant that in Committee and on Report Opposition Members argued about the details of the concessionary fares


provisions within this legislation. Tonight they cannot do that. Only one Opposition Member spoke to the details of Opposition amendments. They could merely revert to singing the same old tune&#x2014;that deregulation was not going to work, that there were going to be fewer buses and that local authorities would not be provided with enough money.</p>

<p>We have heard all these words and songs over and over again during the passage of the Bill. I am reassured tonight that the provisions we are putting forward on concessionary fares are right, because Opposition Members were cautious not to criticise the hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mr. Craigen) who moved an amendment which contained four extra categories of fares but did not mention any of them. That shows the level of confidence the hon. Member has in his amendment, so we need not spend much time dealing with it.<br/>
A number of important points have been raised during what has been a useful debate. The first relates to the partially sighted. It was raised by my hon. Friend the Member for York (Mr. Gregory) and by the hon. Member for Maryhill. The partially sighted are included among the group for whom assistance may be provided under the National Assistance Act 1948 and they are affected by the provisions I referred to earlier.<br/>
My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Transport now has powers under the amendments which have come from another place. Subsection (8)<i>(f)</i> of the new clause which is Lords amendment No. 223 allows him by order to specify other classes of person. I should like to tell my hon. Friend the Member for York that my right hon. Friend will wish to consider whether the partially sighted should be covered under a new order made by the order-making power.<br/>
It is important to state that in terms of a number of the categories mentioned tonight, that new order-making power is available, and serious consideration would have to be given to individual cases.</p>

<p>The purpose of having that power available is so that when categories are brought to my right hon. Friend's attention, he can consider them. The hon. Member for Maryhill referred to a letter from his noble Friend Lord Carmichael. Lord Carmichael asked us to accept his amendment and we did so. I believe that the points made by Lord Carmichael in that letter have been met by these provisions.<br/>
The hon. Member for Rhondda (Mr. Rogers) suggested that the purpose of these amendments was to be fair to operators. I must say openly that we wish to ensure that we are fair to operators and also to authorities. During the debate there has been a tendency to swing from one to the other, but I believe that we now have the equilibrium right; it is for that reason that the provisions are welcomed by my hon. Friends.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, South (Mr. Brandon-Bravo) mentioned the ability of authorities to operate concessionary fare schemes without having to move to tokens. Depending upon the method of reimbursement that they adopt, authorities can be

reasonably clear at the start of the financial year about the cash that they will have to pay over that year. To ensure that operators are properly reimbursed for journeys that they carry out, authorities may need to make adjustments after the end of the financial year. There cannot be precise, finite budgeting on such a matter, but I believe that within these provisions there is sufficient flexibility to allow past schemes to continue.<br/>
9.30 pm<br/>
Throughout the course of the legislation there has been debate about whether concessionary fare schemes would continue. Hon. Members such as the hon. Member for Walsall, North (Mr. Winnick) have talked tonight of people's fears as to whether concessionary fares would continue. I do not suggest that it was necessarily him, but Opposition Members started to put about the scare story that the Bill meant the end of concessionary fares long before the provisions were discussed in Committee. That has caused a great deal of unnecessary distress and fear. We are debating a concessionary fare scheme which, I believe, will provide for the type of concessionary fares that we wish to see across the country. I hope that my hon. Friends will reject the amendments moved by the Opposition and will approve the amendments from another place.</p>

<p>An important objective of the Bill is to ensure that local authorities co-operate with one another to achieve the most effective use of public funds. That cooperation will be especially important in the case of cross-boundary services, because travel patterns do not always respect adminstrative boundaries. Without these amendments, the Bill would not provide for such an arrangement between London Regional Transport, which is of course not a local authority, and adjoining county and district councils in subsidising services in which they both have an interest. The amendments put that right. They enable LRT to take the lead with a contribution from the council or vice versa. When LRT takes the lead in securing services under such an arrangement, it will be bound by the Bill's tendering provisions for local bus services in the same way as local authorities.</p>

<p>The purpose of this group of amendments, voluminous though it is, is to clarify the meaning of "joint undertaking". Some bus undertakings exist under agreements giving rights over assets to more than one council, and would have fallen outside the definition of "joint undertaking" as originally drafted. Transfers by order under clause 65 would not have applied. It would, however, be inappropriate for the property rights and liabilities of those undertakings to be transferred under the scheme which makes provisions that apply to other district councils, since the parties might not be able to reach agreement about the allocation of property and other assets and the order - making procedure would be needed to settle matters. The amendments make it clear that in cases of that sort the undertakings fall within the definition of "joint undertaking", and are therefore subject to the order making process. We have also clarified that public transport companies can be formed as joint companies under the provisions only by two or more councils.</p>

<p>This is an important amendment. I am glad to see my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, South (Mr. Brandon-Bravo) in his place, because he pressed very hard for such a scheme.<br/>
During earlier debates in the House and in another place there was criticism of our proposal that all the capital expenditure incurred by the new public transport companies should count for capital control purposes as though it were incurred by their controlling authorities. The amendments respond to that concern. They remove the companies' own expenditure from the capital control system. There will still be control over the extent of their external finance. The Local Government, Planning and Land Act 1980 ensures that capital spending financed by the controlling authority remains subject to control, and clause 72 still provides that companies can borrow only from the controlling authority except for temporary loans and overdrafts. We are therefore placing control over the amount that the companies can raise by external grants or borrowing while allowing them full freedom to deploy their own resources. That is fully in line with the arguments put forward by Lord Shepherd in the debate in the other place, when he emphasised that capital expenditure should come from internal resources when possible, and that the companies should aim to replace their assets by the amounts that they can generate.<br/>
We believe that that is the best way to encourage the new companies to make business-like pricing and investment decisions. I hope that the House will welcome the change. We shall consult the local authority associations and the PTEs on the working of the new system as soon as possible.</p>

Clause 95, as it stands, apparently gives the Secretary of State very wide powers to make grants, so wide that I am advised that its interpretation could have given rise to serious difficulties in its practical application.

<p>I beg to move amendment No. 1, in page 2, leave out lines 27 to 30 and insert&#x2014;
<q>'(e)"local authority" means a county, district or London borough council, the Common Council of the City of London or the Council of the Isles of Scilly, and in sections 45(2)(b), 50(2), 51(6), 80(1), 157(1), 171(2), 438, 441, 442, 443, 444(4), 452(2), 453(2), 573(1), paragraph 2(1) of Schedule 2, grounds 7 and 12 in Schedule 3, ground 5 in Schedule 4, paragraph 7(1) of Schedule 5, paragraph 5(1)<i>(b)</i> of Schedule 6 and Schedule 17 includes the Inner London Education Authority and a joint authority established by Part IV of the Local Government Act 1985.'.</q>
I hope that it will be for the convenience of the Committee if I speak generally on the amendments not only to the Housing Bill but to the Housing Associations Bill, the Housing (Consequential Provisions) Bill and the Landlord and Tenant Bill. The amendments are essentially of two kinds-first to take account of the provisions of the Local Government Act 1985 and, secondly, minor drafting corrections and improvemennts.<br/>
The Local Governmet Act has altered the law concerning certain local authorities and, if these Bills are to represent the law as it now is, it is necessary for certain amendments to be made. They can be divided into three groups. First are the amendments to remove references to the Greater London council &#x2014; references to county councils remain to cover shire counties&#x2014; and to add references to the new bodies established by the Local Government Act &#x2014; the new Inner London Education Authority, the joint bodies established by part IV and the residuary bodies.<br/>
The same drafting scheme is followed as in the Local Government Act. References to ILEA and to the joint bodies are inserted in the housing provisions, but the position of residuary bodies, whose duration is limited, is dealt with in schedule 13 to the Local Government Act, referring to the relevant housing functions. In consequence of the abolition of the strategic functions of the GLC, a certain amount of re-arrangement of the Housing Bill is required, principally the removal of schedule 1 and the incorporation of the surviving provisions elsewhere.<br/>
The number of amendments to the Housing (Consequential Provisions) Bill is accounted for by the fact that the abolition of the GLC makes it possible greatly to simplify the definition of "local housing authority" in outlying enactments.<br/>
The second group of amendments arising as a result of the Local Government Act are those that put back the commencement of the consolidation to 1 April 1986, when the Local Government Act comes into force. A paragraph is also to be inserted into schedule 3 to the Housing (Consequential Provisions) Bill to make it clear that what is consolidated is the law as it stands after the Local Government Act has come into force, although the Acts


all come into force on the same day. It also makes it clear that references in the consolidation to things done by or in relation to the local authorities before 1 April 1986 continue to include things done by, or in relation to, councils abolished on that date.<br/>
The third group is of consequential amendments of housing provisions in various GLC Acts, which also apply to London borough councils. These amendments were not included earlier because of the pending Local Government Bill, but in the event they are purely consequential on the consolidation and are not affected by the Local Government Act.<br/>
The minor drafting corrections and improvements are largely to secure consistency of style and expression, to correct minor mistakes which have come to light and to deal with other small points, such as removing references to the Development Land Tax Act 1976 which has been repealed by the Finance Act.<br/>
On Second Reading on 21 October 1985 the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East (Mr. Brown) drew attention to the work of the Joint Committee on Consolidation Bills, the value of which is recognised by the House. This Committee considers consolidation Bills after they have received their Second Reading in the other place. It then reports to both Houses. Any amendments suggested by the joint Committee are incorporated into the Bill in the other place before it comes to this House.<br/>
However, sometimes it is the case that while a Bill is in progress, other Acts change the law, or small drafting or technical matters come to light. In these cases the usual procedure is for the draftsman to submit amendments to the chairman of the Joint Committee as a matter of courtesy and to enable him to comment, should he wish to do so. While there may be no formal requirement, the practice is well established and enables both Houses to deal with such amendments with greater confidence.<br/>
In this case the draftsman followed the established practice and submitted all, bar one, of the amendments made to take account of the provisions of the Local Government Act and some of the drafting corrections and improvements. The chairman raised some small points, which the draftsman incorporated. However, due to the absence of the chairman, Lord Brightman, following illness, it was not possible to submit to him before the Committee stage, originally fixed for 24 October 1985, the rest of the amendments, nor those already submitted and commented upon.<br/>
The concern expressed about the House considering the amendments in these circumstances led to the agreement through the usual channels for the Committee stage to be put off until today. I entirely understand and accept the grounds for the concern of the hon. Member for Newcastle on Tyne, East. At a late hour I inadvertently expressed myself in a slightly unfortunate way about the problem of getting information to him about amendments. I entirely understand the view that he took about that, and I regret what I said on that occasion.<br/>
This has enabled the amendments, as tabled, to be submitted to the chairman over the weekend. I understand that he has seen them and that he is content. In those circumstances and, since they do not change the existing law and represent pure consolidation, I hope that the Committee can move on to consider them in the spirit of co-operation usual for consolidation measures. Before doing so, once again may I pay tribute to the work of the joint committee and to its chairman. It is apparent from

what I have said that the committee plays a crucial part in these matters. I am sure that the House of Commons will wish to join me in expressing our gratitude. I commend the amendments to this Committee.</p>

<p>I fully accept the Solicitor-General's apology for the misunderstanding which occurred last week over the timing of the Opposition's receipt of the amendments. The House has rights. It is only proper that the Opposition and the Committee as a whole should be assured that we are agreeing to consolidation. I am now satisfied that we are agreeing to consolidation&#x2014;indeed, very good consolidation. I endorse the thanks of the Solicitor-General to the Committee and its staff.</p>

<p>On a point of order. Before we conclude what may seem to some a bizarre ritual, I wish, as a lawyer and housing

spokesman, to say that what we have just done will make life much easier for many people. As the Law Commission said in its report, we have effectively consolidated the whole of housing law, the whole of landlord and tenant law and the whole of housing associations law into one measure. Only two other bits&#x2014;the rent and leasehold legislation&#x2014;remain elsewhere on the statute book.<br/>
In view of the difficulties faced by anybody who slogs from one piece of legislation to another trying to match them together&#x2014;remembering that, in housing matters, non-lawyers as well as people trained to give legal advice must perform that task&#x2014;the Solicitor-General was right to pay tribute to the Law Commission for endeavouring to ensure that we not only bring our law up to date and dispose of what should not be on the statute book, but make the law intelligible for those who must apply it.<br/>
If ever a subject was part of the day-to-day application of legislation, it is housing. Thanks to the work of the Law Commission, and with little thanks to ourselves, we have done a good deed in a bizarre and ritualistic way.

<p>I am glad to give the Minister this opportunity to answer some of the questions that my hon. Friends and I have been raising about the resources allocation in the south-west Thames region to one of its districts.<br/>
In the west Surrey and north-east Hampshire district health area there have been proposals to close and reduce three facilities, action which would have a major impact on the lives of people living there. I refer to the closure of the Fleet hospital, the cessation of surgery at Farnham hospital and the closure of a ward at Frimley Park general hospital.<br/>
Had such a proposal been tough but fair and in line with Government policy, I should have been inclined to accept it and explain to my constituents the rationale behind it, because in general terms I believe that the Government's policy is right. However, the effects of the proposal, if it were implemented, would be neither fair nor reasonable, a fact that has been accepted by the regional health authority and the Department of Health.<br/>
Historically, the district has been under-funded and this lack of resources has been exacerbated by the fact that we live in an area where growth in house building, and therefore new population, has been particularly rapid. The cumulative effect of this is that those within the area, my constituents among them, are being unfairly and ever increasingly discriminated against in the amount of health resources they receive.<br/>
Under the RAWP formula, which is the main plank of the Government's policy, the district is receiving about &#x00A3;78 per patient against a national average of &#x00A3;100 and a regional average of &#x00A3;109&#x2014;in other words, considerably less than the resources to which it should be entitled. In our region, this imbalance is as great as in any region in the country. For example, the Wandsworth district receives &#x00A3;156, per patient, more than double the amount that is received by west Surrey or north-east Hampshire.<br/>
In addition, the district's performance indicators, which are the Government's measures of efficiency and productivity, are the best in the region. The cumulative effect of this is that the district with the least resources but the best record of efficiency is continually under-funded while others which operate less efficiently continue to be over-funded.</p>

<p>I thank my hon. Friend for raising this subject. I am also involved, as my constituency contains Farnham hospital. I ask my hon. Friend to reaffirm that in our district the efficiency of patient turnover and cost effectiveness are amongst the best in the country. Nobody is seeking an unfair allocation of resources. We all want a fair allocation of resources and the avoidance of waste in the interests of patient care. However, am I not right in thinking that our figures are among the best in the country?</p>

<p>My hon. Friend is quite right and no doubt the Minister will agree. These facts are not in dispute. am sure that the Minister will agree that the sum total of these facts is an intolerable situation. However, despite the representations made to the Ministry, it is not prepared to


intervene in the region's management decisions. Despite representations to the region, it is not prepared to intervene in the district's management. The current jargon which has been used by the Minister himself is that management must not be second-guessed. I applaud the Government's efforts to sharpen up management, but they cannot simply back away from highly political decisions by saying that they are not prepared to intervene.<br/>
The Minister's job is to see that his policy is having the effect he intends. If not, he has the right and the duty, to give directions that the Government policy is carried out.<br/>
I recognise that the region has a difficult task in allocating its shrinking resources. I fully support the Government's decision to reallocate the resources from where they have been historically spent to areas where a new need has arisen. My point is that this admirable policy is being implemented only in a few health districts and that the Minister should ensure that his policy reaches down to the sharp end of the Health Service. We boast, and rightly so, that our record in health service provision in the past six years is second to none. The present policy should result in that excellent record being enhanced. If the Government are unable or unwilling to carry out fine tuning, when for a number of understandable reasons the policy is not working, we shall lose the argument.<br/>
My constituents are in an area where an unwanted growth in housing has been foisted upon them and it is no use telling them that the Government's policy is fair and sensible if the reality they see is the closure of and reduction in health services which are already under strain. Nor would I wish to try to do so.<br/>
Many Members try to plead special reasons why their constituents should be more favourably treated than others. This is not one of those occasions and forms no part of my argument. I am asking the Government for nothing to which our people are not entitled, nor am I asking the Government to change their policy. I ask only that, having frankly admitted that my constituents are being disadvantaged because of Government policies, the Minister should take steps to correct the situation. Thus I will be able to report that the Government's programme for distribution of health resources is sound and sensible, which I believe it to be, and it is seen to be fairly operated.</p>

<p>I am grateful for the opportunity which my hon. Friend the Member for Hampshire, East (Mr. Mates) has given me and the House to discuss the important problems to which he has drawn our attention. I congratulate him on the way in which he has demonstrated his concern. I know that that concern is shared by my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey, South-West (Mrs. Bottomley) and others of my hon. Friends whose constituents serve within the relevant district health authority area.<br/>
Before turning to the details of the district and the problems to which my hon. Friend has referred, I hope that he will allow me to make one or two general points to set the issue in context. The title of the debate, which my hon. Friend requested, was "The Allocation of Resources within Regional Health Authorities". It is important to recognise that the resources that we are allocating nationally are increasing and have increased during the

period of this Government at a significant rate. I know that my hon. Friend recognises that, but it is important that the message is communicated again and again to all our constituents. We have doubled spending in cash terms, and in real terms the increase has been over 20 per cent.<br/>
The issue is not limited to the transfer of resources because services have improved for patients. That is a measure by which we can stand to be judged, and we are happy to do so. There is often talk about waiting lists, but I regard that as a poor proxy measure. Our achievements in terms of the number of patients treated are much more significant. Only last year, the number of day cases treated nationally rose by 11 per cent. to 903,000 and the number of in-patient cases rose by 2&#x00B7;6 per cent. to 6&#x00B7;18 million. At the same time, we have seen capital expenditure increase significantly. In the five years between 1980 and 1984, there were 36 major new hospital schemes. Progress continues with over 75 major schemes to a total value in excess of &#x00A3;850 million.<br/>
My hon. Friend would rightly ask, "What about distribution?" I am sure that my right hon. and hon. Friends recognise that the significant transfer of resources to health care is commendable, especially at a time when public spending is rightly under pressure. But is distribution unfair, not least in the district health authority in my hon. Friend's constituency? <br/>
Reference has been made to the formidable animal called the Resource Allocation Working Party. The policy of RAWP has been in operation since 1976 and its objective has been accepted by virtually all those concerned, at least in outline. When it pinches on their own interests, however, different views often obtain. There is a broad acceptance of the ideas of RAWP, which are based on the principle of providing equal opportunity of access for health care needs for people at equal risk. The fundamental emphasis is on equality of access. Successive Governments have accepted and implemented the RAWP approach.<br/>
As my hon. Friend knows, the RAWP approach involves a complex calculation both of the revenue and capital implications of the target and the fair share of resources. Revenue targets are based fundamentally on relative populations. Population figures are weighted, first, to reflect the make-up of the population by age and sex and to reflect the use that the population makes of health services as analysed over six main blocks of services. Secondly, standardised mortality ratios are used, which the RAWP recommended could be used as a proxy for relative need for health care. This is a complex matter, but it has been accepted that it produces answers which will help to achieve equality of access to health care.<br/>
Other factors in the RAWP calculations reflect cross-boundary flows of patients, the existence of teaching facilities, the funding of a small number of supra-regional services and, in the case of the Thames regions, for London weighting. The capital formula is similiar to the complex revenue formula, but is based on population figures projected for the five years ahead of the year of allocation and they deliberately ignore cross-boundary flows.<br/>
The application of the RAWP formula to the south-west Thames regional health authority undoubtedly poses a difficult task for that authority over the next 10 years. As a Thames region, it will be expected to release an element of its historically high level of funding for redeployment elsewhere. At the same time, within the region, it has to


plan for revenue to be redistributed from some of its districts, including some in London, to others which its own internal RAWP formula shows are in need of extra money. My hon. Friend has referred to the needs of his district.<br/>
Without going further into the minutiae of these calculations, I should like to stress that it is for the regional health authority to determine in the first instance the basis of the principles that we have set nationally. I recognise my hon. Friend's point about the final responsibility of central Government. The district and regional levels are crucial factors in the balance of the operations of the Health Service. The DHSS has received and is examining regional strategic plans which set out the regions' intentions over the next decade. Those plans require ministerial approval. Obviously, my ministerial colleagues and I will be reviewing them carefully.<br/>
The south-west Thames regional health authority plan is being considered by the Department. It is expected that it will be with Ministers at the end of the year. Ministers will also have the opportunity to discuss the services and resources with the regional chairman and officers at the annual ministerial review meetings. There is a balance between the responsibilities and duties at the district and regional level and the DHSS.</p>

<p>I take that point. However, my hon. Friend is talking in terms of the strategic plan&#x2014;we are talking about the immediate threat of closure. That is why there is a time element which is not on our side. Ministers should look at this aspect where policies are not working.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend talks about the "immediate threat of closure". The proposal&#x2014;it was no more than that &#x2014; with respect to the three hospital facilities to which he referred has now been withdrawn. As I understand it, there is no immediate threat of closure. There is a need to ensure that within the RAWP formulae &#x2014;nationally clown to district health authority level&#x2014;the proposals are implemented at a measured and sensible pace. There is a strict limit to the pace at which they can be pursued. I hope that my hon. Friend will accept that the proposals which were floated and which caused such concern have been withdrawn.</p>

<p>Unilaterally, but we have not solved the problem. The problem will not go away&#x2014;it might get worse. That is the real reason why I raised this matter. My hon. Friend should not wait and make the decision next April, because, by that time, the problem will be twice as bad.</p>

<p>If my hon. Friend will allow me, because we are running fast out of time, I wish to draw his attention to two resources that are being moved into the district and must be taken into account in all the calculations. The west Surrey and north east Hampshire district will be receiving more than &#x00A3;5 million extra a year in revenue over the next 10 years. It is important to recognise that already this year that district has had significant financial help from the region. It has received an additional &#x00A3;400,000 a year in recurrent revenue; it has had non-recurrent bridging finance to help the mental illness sector to the tune of &#x00A3;644,000. The region has agreed to underwrite overspending in the mental illness sector this year of &#x00A3;200,000. That adds up to &#x00A3;1 million.<br/>
Planning has also started on an extension to the main district general hospital at Frimley Park to provide 110

extra beds. This will cost in excess of &#x00A3;7 million, and the region hopes to start work on it in 1987. Recognising that the district has a low base of capital stock, it bought the Brompton hospital site in the district last year at a cost of about &#x00A3;3.5 million. We should compare that with the position of a district in the same region which has to find ways of coping with a reduction of &#x00A3;1 million this year and nearly &#x00A3;14 million a year by 1994.<br/>
The regional chairman wrote to all district chainnen within his region, asking them to examine their spending patterns for the year and, if an overspend was projected, to put forward a package of measures to bring them back to target. The west Surrey and north east Hampshire distrct made public possible ward arid hospital closures to curtail spending before having discussions with the authority and before going through the normal consultation process. As I have said, those plans are not going ahead.<br/>
The regional health authority has had to work out a policy for moving resources which it believes to be fair to every district&#x2014;those that are under-provided as well as the better off ones. When decisions are made, much importance is attached to timing and to the minimum disruption both to the gainers and to the losers. It will be a matter of judgment how fast a pace can be sensibly maintained. In the timing we have to take account of the redistribution of resources to gainers and of the anticipated opening of major capital projects.<br/>
In the case of the west Surrey and north east Hampshire district, the bulk of its additional revenue will become available in 1990 and 1991 when the new extension to Frimley Park hospital should be ready to open. By then the district will be getting an extra &#x00A3;4&#x00B7;5 million a year out of a total of 5&#x00B7;1 million planned for 1994.<br/>
It has long been our view that every health authority in the country should make every penny that it receives count in the service to patients. It is important that those districts which can show they are not so well off as they might be do not just sit back and wait for more money. They must review every aspect of their services to make sure that they are fully effective and efficient. We have asked authorities to provide cost improvement programmes which show a saving of at least 1 per cent. of their revenue base. Districts can then retain these savings to be used for service development as they think necessary. We have also encouraged authorities to put some of their housekeeping services &#x2014; cleaning, laundry and catering &#x2014; out to competitive tender as a means of making savings. The House should know that the south west Thames region has already made enormous progress in this area and is to be congratulated on the excellent results achieved.<br/>
I am aware that this district, as well as the Basingstoke and north Hampshire health authority will be affected by plans to build more dwellings in the area up to 1991. Naturally that causes concern to the health authorities which have to provide extra services for the additional population. I know that both districts have made representations to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for the Environment about alterations to the structure plan which will propose that the number of new dwellings should be increased to 20,000. I assure my hon. Friend that I will write to the chairman of the two regional health authorities concerned and ask them whether these developments were taken into account when their 10-year resource plans were drawn up. If not, I hope they will


consider looking again at the level of provision set aside for these districts in the context of their resource distribution policy.<br/>
I hope that what I have said will go at least some way &#x2014;I must not be too optimistic&#x2014;to reassure my hon. Friends that we recognise the pressures. I hope that they understand that the movement towards meeting their RAWP targets is happening, although it will not be at the pace that we should all like for reasons which I hope that we all understand. Nevertheless, the movement is in the right direction. The problems of the area are understood at district and regional levels and also in the Department, but we must continue to look for the good housekeeping which experience has shown can be achieved throughout the country.<br/>
I now appreciate that the alarm and dismay that was caused when the proposals were floated had a singularly unfortunate impact in the constituencies of my hon. Friends. I hope that they now recognise that the very significant transfer of resources that we are making to our health effort is producing results throughout the country and that their district is not being neglected but will be able to look forward to an increasing share of the resources available in years to come. We must, however, be governed by the realities of the problem and the need to balance, in this case, the demands of inner London against the growing demands creating by the rising population of my hon. Friend's district.</p>

<p>All that my hon. Friend the Minister has said reinforces the points that I have made. We are indeed short of resources, and resources are being reallocated slowly&#x2014;I understand all the arguments about that&#x2014;but proposals, for example, to close a ward at Frimley Park hospital when we are getting ready to build a whole new

extension make the whole problem, which is really just an accounting problem, even more ludicrous in the eyes of the people in the district.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Minister talks of the proposals having being been withdrawn as though that meant that the problem had gone away. In fact, by refusing to carry out the region's instructions the district health authority has now put itself in the red, so the problem has not gone away. Indeed, there is a risk that it will get worse in the next six months and that even more severe cuts will be required next April when the overspend will have grown because the savings will not have been made because the proposals have been withdrawn. The Department's complacent view that it will all come out in the wash may be true in four or five years' time, but it is not true for those actually being deprived of patient care at this moment.</p>

<p>I hope that my hon. Friend will accept that people are not being deprived of patient care at this moment. The proposals have been withdrawn, but the Department is certainly not complacent. There is an overall framework&#x2014;we seem to agree on that&#x2014;and the movement towards it is steady. Indeed, on the figures that I have given, I would say that the movement is impressive. Nevertheless, we must look to the district to play its part in meeting the imperatives which none of us can escape. Much has been achieved in many other districts by way of cost improvements and, indeed, rationalisation. From time to time that must include hospital closures because there are many small, inefficient and inaccessible hospitals. I make no comment on these particular instances, but in some circumstances that may well make sense because it is a major part of our policy&#x2014;and one which I certainly stand by &#x2014;that having appointed regional and district health authorities we must, within very broad parameters, allow them to make their management judgments within the resource implications that we impose. I was about to say "resource constraints", but it is important to recognise that the district health authority will have an expanding budget at its disposal. We look to the authority to use that expanding budget sensibly.</p>
