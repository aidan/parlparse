The partnership is transforming 100 acres of brownfield site donated by Yorkshire Water into a hazel coppice and a fish farm which, in three years' time, will produce Wakefield's first caviar.

	<p pid="a.1504.3/1">It is important that young people are involved in the commemoration. Indeed, we are organising a debate that could probably take place in the House&mdash;if the authorities agree&mdash;involving young people from various parts of the Commonwealth, who will discuss not only the commemoration of the abolition of slavery, butthe whole issue of the human trafficking that is going on today. The activities of Hull in twinning with Freetown, and the schools that are involved&mdash;that is called class-to-class connection&mdash;form an important part of that. When I visited Sierra Leone only a few weeks ago, I saw the important role played by the British Council in encouraging schools and local authorities to come together. That would be a worthwhile legacy to come out of the commemorations this year.</p>

	<p pid="a.1505.0/1">I could not agree more with what the right hon. Gentleman has said. On my recent visits to Ghana and Sierra Leone, I foundit interesting to see those two independent Commonwealth countries commemorating, not only in Ghana the 50th anniversary of independence, but a piece of what could be said to be colonial legislation passed by this Parliament 200 years ago to abolish the slave trade. I very much agree with what he says and we shall do all that we can to see that the commemorations extend further than this country. I am glad that he also said that it was a wider level of support in the community that brought the abolition about, but Mr. Wilberforce was the man who was effective in bringing the legislation to the House.</p>

	<p pid="a.1508.1/1">I most certainly will meet my hon. Friend to discuss the matters. Indeed, the House will have a chance on <phrase class="date" code="">20 March</phrase> to debate the issue of slavery. The importance of bringing young people together was impressed on me during our visit to the classrooms and schools in Sierra Leone and Ghana. In a powerful commemoration of the bicentenary, a slave scene was enacted, in which people dressed in chains, like the slaves of that time, and were chained to a person with a whip. One of the lines that was said, to which everybody should give thought, was that not every white man was guilty and not every black man was innocent. In those circumstances, if we saw the broader picture of the problem of slavery, we could start a proper debate about the issues, instead of about the total shame that we feel about the actions that took place more than 200 years ago.</p>

I welcome ITV's temporary suspension of all premium rate interactive services on allITV channels. My hon. Friend will wish to knowthat the regulatory body for the premium rate telecommunications industry is currently investigating complaints about several television shows, and I understand that the broadcasters are meeting later this week. It is obviously important that they come together with the relevant telecommunications companies and make sure that the service is provided in a reliable and trustworthy way.

	<p pid="a.1516.5/1">I assure my hon. Friend that our strong and co-ordinated set of polices on domestic violence will continue. According to the most recent British crime survey, domestic violence has fallen by about 60 per cent. in the past 10 years. Although more domestic violence offences are being recorded, their prevalence has fallen significantly, partly as a result of our additional investment, and partly, as she says, because we are treating the issue more seriously and offering more protection to people within the courts system. We should maintain our focus on the issue, which continues to be a serious one, as we approach international women's day.</p>

	<p pid="a.1518.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend on her work on this issue. We have increased our investment in the DRC from, I think, just under&pound;6 million to almost &pound;70 million. We are doing that precisely to support the democratic process there and to give humanitarian assistance. I hope that people in the country understand that when I refer to that extra investment in Africa, I deliberately use the word &quot;investment&quot;. If those countries are riven by civil war and large numbers of people are displaced and become refugees, all the evidence of the modern world is that, sooner or later, that becomes a problem for countries such as ours in Europe. Therefore, when we bring peace and stability to parts of Africa, as with the DRC, that is an investment not only in those countries but in our own future.</p>

	<p pid="a.1524.5/1">The title given on the monitors will explain exactly what each motion is on. I hope that the situation will be sufficiently clear, but I am sure that there will be plenty of Members in the Chamber and elsewhere guiding their friends and colleagues into the Lobby.</p>
	<p pid="a.1524.5/2">A considerable amount of work has already been done on this issue. There is the excellent report of the Joint Committee on Conventions, chaired by my right hon. and noble Friend Lord Cunningham of Felling, and, of course, the substantial work done by the cross-party working group, chaired by my right hon. Friend the Leader of the House. I hope that today's debate will be another major step in a century's-worth of steps on the road to reform. Members will be relieved to know that I will not be giving them a year-by-year account of the history of reform&mdash;[Hon. Members: &quot;Go on!&quot;] Well, otherwise, there will be no time for any of this evening's votes, and as I have said, I must get away in time to see Celtic defeat the mighty AC Milan. However, there are some points along the timeline that I would like to highlight.</p>
	<p pid="a.1524.5/3">The first such point was the Parliament Act 1911, which was a response to the crisis arising from the Lords' rejection of the 1909 Budget. That Act ensured that money Bills could receive Royal Assent without the approval of the other place, and it shortened the maximum length of a Parliament from seven to five years. Public Bills, with some exceptions, were to receive Royal Assent without the consent of the Lords if they had been passed by this House in three successive Sessions. The Parliament Act 1949 reduced that period to two Sessions, and reduced the period between the first Second Reading and the final passage of a Bill to one year. Those Acts are key pillars of the primacy of this House and they are fundamental to its relationship with the Lords.</p>
	<p pid="a.1524.5/4">Then there was the development of the Salisbury-Addison convention. The 1945 general election produced a Labour Government with a massive majority of 156, but of course, at that time there was only a small number of peers&mdash;16 out of 831&mdash;who took the Labour Whip. That imbalance had to be addressed. The then Viscount Cranbourne, Leader of the Opposition in the Lords and fifth Marquis of Salisbury, and Viscount Addison, the Labour leader in the Lords, came to an agreement that we now refer to as the Salisbury-Addison convention. They agreed that, because major Government legislation had been put before the country at the general election, and the people, with knowledge of those proposals, had returned a Labour Government, the Government had a mandate to introduce their key proposals, and the Lords should not oppose them.</p>
	<p pid="a.1524.5/5">The Joint Committee on Conventions has given an excellent description of the convention as it stands today and I commend its report to the House. That Salisbury-Addison convention gives effect to the primacy of this House, and it is vital to how the other place responds to manifesto legislation. Parliament would be very different without it.</p>

It should be remembered that there is a perception in the country that gradually over the years&mdash;especially in the last10 years but also before then&mdash;the Executive have been seen to grab more powers to the Executive and become less accountable to Parliament as a whole, and that the reform of the House of Lords is part of the process of giving more accountability again to the Executive, which in the long run will benefit the Executive as well by keeping them more in touch.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-03-07a.1526.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1682" speakername="Bridget Prentice" colnum="1526"  time="012:44:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070307/debtext/70307-0004.htm#07030793003825">
	<p pid="a.1526.4/1">I can agree with the hon. Gentleman in one sense: I agree that making these reforms will make the Executive, and Parliament as a whole, more accountable. I would say to him too, however, that over the past 10 years the Executive have probably been more accountable in many ways than any previous one, so I would not accept his point on that.</p>
	<p pid="a.1526.4/2">I want to move on to the third key point along the time line&mdash;the Life Peerages Act 1958 and the Peerages Act 1963. They allowed life peers to sit in the other place; the Lords would no longer be limited to those with a hereditary title; and they even allowed women to sit there too. The 1963 Act also famously allowed hereditary peerages to be disclaimed for life or relinquished for a period of time.</p>
	<p pid="a.1526.4/3">Fundamental and far-reaching reform did not come, however, until this Labour Government came to power in 1997. The House of Lords Act 1999 removed the majority of peers who sat in the other place as a right of heredity. It was an absurdity in a modern democracy and it had to go. I see from yesterday's debate that both sides of the House agree that this should be so, although I do recall the campaign literature for the Conservative party in 1997, drawing attention to the advantages of the hereditary peers.</p>
	<p pid="a.1526.4/4">Our job was incomplete, however. Running through these parliamentary reforms demonstrates that which is obvious but which may also be so close to us that we miss it. Those reforms are now embedded in our culture and conventions. The Salisbury-Addison convention, the introduction of life peers and women peers and the removal of the majority of hereditary peers have all strengthened the other place, and in so doing have strengthened Parliament as a whole. It is quite clear that where reform is necessary, the Houses do not crumble but are reinforced.</p>
	<p pid="a.1526.4/5">This history demonstrates something else, loud and clear. Reform of the second Chamber has been on the agenda for too long. We must now today have the courage of our convictions, as our predecessors did. We must today complete that to which our manifestos commit us. It is time to complete the job that the Government started in 1999. I therefore urge Members today to remember that, and not to allow the fine detail of reform, which there will be ample time to debate later&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="a.1528.1/1">Yes and yes is my answer to that. I shall address that point in a moment, as my hon. Friend will hear. In his own eloquent performance yesterday, in which he successively advanced an argument and then advanced a series of sub-arguments in case that he lost the first and then the second and the third, he brought out well a point with which I agree: we will have to take steps to try to make the Members of the upper House as independent as possible. I agree with my hon. Friend that one of those steps could be to prevent them from serving as Ministers.</p>
	<p pid="a.1528.1/2">Let me return to the question whether a largely elected House of Lords could work. There were two sides to that argument yesterday. One side argued that if the upper Chamber were largely or wholly elected there would be a productive tension between it and our House, or between it and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1700" name="Theresa May">the Government. My right hon. Friend the Member for Maidenhead (Mrs. May)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1794" name="Kenneth Clarke">my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke)</phrase> both made speeches to that effect. On the other side of the argument were those who argued that a largely or wholly elected House of Lords would create deadlock. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1864" name="Alan Williams">The right hon. Member for Swansea, West (Mr. Williams)</phrase>, who is not in his place today, made a powerful and eloquent case for the proposition that it would engender deadlock<i> &mdash;[</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> I am aware that some of my hon. Friends agree with that proposition. Those two positions are at the centre of the debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.1528.1/3">On the question whether an elected House would create a productive tension, some of my hon. Friends and some Labour Members suggested that there was no problem to be solved in the first place. They argued that we did not need to worry about whether the tension would be creative or lead to deadlock because we did not have a problem at the moment. Therefore, they argued, there was no need for change. I do not believe that that argument has much weight. One of the few issues in this whole vexed area on which we can almost all agree is that the Executive have too much power. That is not a reflection on the present Government, or on previous or future Governments, because the simple fact is that we live under a Government who are dominated by the Prime Minister of the day because of his powers of patronage. By definition&mdash;or by hypothesis in our system, because of our fused arrangements&mdash;the Government have a majority in the House of Commons and are, broadly speaking, able to do what they like with insufficient check between elections. That is a problem not only for the people of this country but for the Government of the day who would benefit from being more effectively checked. That is common ground between the occupants of the Front Benches, but it is also a widely shared view in the country and in the House.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-03-07a.1530.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1549" speakername="Oliver Letwin" colnum="1530"  time="012:55:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070307/debtext/70307-0005.htm#07030793003838">
	<p pid="a.1530.1/1">As a matter of the logic of the argument, it is important that my hon. Friend should recognise that we are dealing now with composition and will deal later with the rules governing election. However, as a matter of fact, I share <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1591" name="Edward Leigh">the view of my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh)</phrase> that one has to take steps to make the elected or largely elected members of the upper House independent. One step might be not to allow them to be Ministers. Another might be for them to serve long terms and a third should be for them not to be elected on a closed list system of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1816" name="Philip Davies">the type that my hon. Friend the Member for Shipley (Philip Davies)</phrase> mentions. There are other possible steps, but it must be possible to devise rules that will make it more rather than less likely that those Members will be independent minded. It must also be the case that if they have a mandate, they will feel more empowered to challenge the Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.1530.1/2">I come now to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1914" name="Mike Hall">the salient point made by the hon. Member for Weaver Vale (Mr. Hall)</phrase>. The answer of most of those who spoke in yesterday's debate, who rejected the proposition despite everything that I have just said, was that the problem did not reside in the House of Lords not having a function, or in it not attaining more oomph and vigour in pursuing the function of challenging the Government as a result of election, but in the fact that the system would work too well. The House of Lords would somehow&mdash;in the phrase used yesterday, which the hon. Gentleman repeated&mdash;challenge the primacy of this House.</p>
	<p pid="a.1530.1/3">I invite right hon. and hon. Members to reflect on how we look to the outside world. That is a difficult thing to do, because it is difficult to look at oneself. Who on earth in the United Kingdom cares about the primacy of the House of Commons? If I went out in the streets with a big banner that said &quot;I'm in favour of the primacy of the House of Commons&quot;, I would not attract large groups of people to follow behind me&mdash;[<i> Interruption.</i>] Yes, there are some hon. Members who are concerned about that, but my point is that the 60 million people out there could not care less about the primacy of anything, especially the House of Commons. Indeed, if one asked them about the primacy of the House of Commons, they would probably think that one meant whether it should be filled with primates&mdash;a very different subject.</p>
	<p pid="a.1530.1/4">The primacy of the House of Commons is, in constitutional terms, neither here nor there. What matters is whether the Government can govern, and that is what hon. Members were trying to get at yesterday. That does matter to hon. Members, but more importantly it matters to 60 million people in this country. It matters that when the Government of the day have been elected in a general election they are able to govern and do their business. Forget the primacy of this House and concentrate on the ability of the Government to govern.</p>
	<p pid="a.1530.1/5">The Leader of the House was persuasive and eloquent on this point. The question is whether the Government, if they are in possession of a majority in this House&mdash;which they must have in order to form the Government in the first place&mdash;and if this House has control of Supply, which it undoubtedly does by convention and deep constitutional theory, and if the House and Government are possessed of the Parliament Acts, as they will be, face any realistic prospect of not being able to get their business through, spend their money and follow their policies? Manifestly, the answer would be no. There is no such prospect and, interestingly, those who opposed large degrees of election did not argue that there was. It is significant that, as part of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1579" name="Bernard Jenkin">his conversion, my hon. Friend the Member for North Essex (Mr. Jenkin)</phrase> withdrew from that position. He considered that things would change in 10, 20, 50 or 100 years, and that somehow the Government of the day would be deprived of the vital powers conferred by the Parliament Acts, the right of Supply and so on.</p>
	<p pid="a.1530.1/6">I do not know what will happen in 100 years. None of us can. However, I do know that, when a new system with a largely elected House of Lords is introduced, the House of Commons will retain the powers needed to ensure that the Government of the day can govern.</p>

	<p pid="a.1533.1/1">No, as I want to advance my argument a little.</p>
	<p pid="a.1533.1/2">What is special about 50 per cent., 60 per cent., or80 per cent.? What is the logic? The Government are trying to involve us in a kind of constitutional sudoku, in which we fill in the blank spaces. Other metaphors for what they are getting us into might be spread betting, or the premium phone-ins on ITV that my good friend Michael Grade is bringing to an end.</p>
	<p pid="a.1533.1/3">This is an utterly irresponsible way to create a new House of Parliament from scratch. After 800 years of the other Chamber's evolution, the Government basically want to abolish it and to start anew. However, if that is what they intend, they must proceed only on the basis of total logic.</p>
	<p pid="a.1533.1/4">The Leader of the House is my friend as well as my right hon. Friend, but I have to tell him that what he is proposing to vote for this evening is constitutionally disreputable. What is more, the dark warnings that he has given the House of Lords of the terrible fate that awaits it if it obstructs what the House of Commons votes for this evening&mdash;assuming that we vote as he wants us to&mdash;are useless if there is an elected element there.</p>
	<p pid="a.1533.1/5">The House of Lords has obstructed the House of Commons even when nobody there has been elected. Under the proposals, Members of the other place may secure an elected mandate on the 20 per cent. of the electorate likely to turn out if their polls are held at the same time as European elections. Even so, they will say, &quot;We've been voted for. You, friends, get lost!&quot;</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-03-07a.1536.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1824" speakername="David Heath" colnum="1536"  time="013:26:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070307/debtext/70307-0006.htm#07030793003866">
	<p pid="a.1536.1/1">The hon. Gentleman is quite wrong to say that we have nothing to say about democratic renewal in the European Union, but that is not the matter before us today.</p>
	<p pid="a.1536.1/2">May I deal with the various points raised in the debate yesterday and today? First, there is the perfectly respectable argument that is put forward by those who favour a unicameral system. Those who believe that we should not have a second Chamber have a degree of logic on their side. It is not a position that I particularly agree with, but at least I can see that there is an internal logic to their argument. Their difficulty lies in establishing how the House of Commons would properly function as a Chamber instigating legislation and revising it in one move. That is done in some legislatures, but the majority of larger countries&mdash;countries with more complex legislation and economies&mdash;find that there is the need for a revising Chamber that can take some of the work load, although I agree with one of my colleagues, who said yesterday that the work load argument cannot be carried to a conclusion, because we can organise our work more effectively than we do at the moment. At least those who believe in abolition have a clear view&mdash;a view that I respect, but do not support.</p>
	<p pid="a.1536.1/3">I have a great deal more difficulty with some of the other arguments that have been adduced. First, it is argued, on the grounds of utility, that the House of Lords does an excellent job and, that being so, that it is unnecessary to make any reform. I am certainly one of the first to say that there should be respect between the two Chambers. I respect enormously the work done by many Members of the House of Lords, as presently constituted in its capacity as a revising Chamber. They do us many favours in looking at legislation that we inadequately scrutinise and often asking this House to think again.</p>
	<p pid="a.1536.1/4">I am not sure, however, that that respect necessarily extends to every current Member of the House of Lords. Many of them appear rarely, if at all. Some are suspected of owing their place more to their cheque book than to their intrinsic merits. Some, frankly, are the dead wood of this House who have been moved to the other place to make way for perhaps more enterprising replacements. Some have been convicted of criminal offences, but retain their seats in our legislature. There is a limit to the arguments about respect.</p>
	<p pid="a.1536.1/5">Secondly, there is the argument about the effectiveness of the other Chamber. Again, having dealt over recent years with difficult Home Office and Department for Constitutional Affairs legislation, I have reason to be grateful for the good sense of those in the Lords who have been prepared to defy the Government and say, &quot;Think again.&quot; But I am also conscious of the fact that, at the end of the day, they have always had to give in to this House, without this House properly considering the arguments that have been put. That is a key issue. We have an extraordinary system at the moment&mdash;at the end of the Session, when we have the ping-pong&mdash;whereby we have a so-called message from the Lords, which we dispose of in an hour's debate, with most Back Benchers not beingable to contribute, scant real debate on the issuesand no opportunity for conciliation. That does not demonstrate respect between the two Houses and it does not allow for this House and the other place to do their work effectively.</p>

	<p pid="a.1540.10/1">The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. I only hope that he can carry a majority of his hon. Friends with him. I have the quaint idea that manifestos should mean something to Back Benchers, even they feel a sense of shame when they do not support the view expressed in them.</p>
	<p pid="a.1540.10/2">Three parties are committed to the democratic reform of the House of Lords. We will find out later whether that translates into a majority in the House. I worry about the siren voices who say that they want democratic reform of the House of Lords, yet want the new Members of the House of Lords to look as much as possible like Members of the House of Commons, with constituencies near to the size of those of hon. Members, and want those Members to be elected by the same system used for elections to the House of Commons. We should resist those siren voices because we know that that would be unacceptable to the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.1540.10/3">The House should take a clear view. It would be a great shame if we were unable to do so. If we are unable to reach a clear conclusion, it will be because of the voting system that will be used. It is instructive that the people who were vociferously against the preferential voting system proposed by the Leader of the House are exactly the same people who are expressing the view that they want no change&mdash;over their dead bodies will they see change in the House of Lords. I regret that. They took a potentially dishonest view. However, even within the constraints of a very poor voting system, the House can take a view, and that view should be for reform.</p>

	<p pid="a.1550.5/1">I thank my hon. Friend. I hope that the House can exercise some collective ingenuity this evening and avoid the errors of four years ago.</p>
	<p pid="a.1550.5/2">When the Prime Minister contemplates his legacy, the chapter on constitutional reform will be incomplete. When he set out on this journey 10 years ago, he was warned not to do stage 1 without stage 2&mdash;in other words, that before he removed the hereditary peers, he should have a clear vision of what was to be put in their place. He was told that if he did not do that, the process would stall, as indeed it has. In their response to the Wakeham report, the Government said that they would</p>
	<p pid="a.1550.5/3" class="indent">&quot;make every effort to ensure that the second stage has been approved by Parliament before the next general election&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.1550.5/4">that is, the 2001 general election. Subsequently the Prime Minister made a further inexcusable mistake. He was elected in 2001 on a manifesto that he wrote, in which he committed himself to a &quot;more representative and democratic&quot; House of Lords. A week before the vote on that commitment, he announced that he had changed his mind and wanted a wholly appointed House. Whatever diminishing influence he may now have within his party, had he voted in line with his manifesto four years ago, I am sure that 80 per cent. vote would have been carried. Now he has changed his mind.</p>
	<p pid="a.1550.5/5">I want to make three brief points. In this debate, some people have taken a two-dimensional view of the relationship between the two Houses, whereby if one Chamber gains in authority, the other must lose it. However, as the hon. Member for Cannock Chase said, the dynamics are far more complex. For 90 per cent. of the time, we are not rivals to the upper House, but partners in holding the Government to account. The House of Lords adds weight and value to arguments that we have adduced in this House or arguments that we have not had time to deploy. I would argue that over the past 10 years, the House of Lords has gained in authority, and that it has done so not at the expense of this House, but at the expense of the Executive. I would further argue that, if its legitimacy were enhanced by the injection of some democracy, its authority would be further enhanced&mdash;again, not at our expense, but at the expense of the Executive. A stronger House of Lords is a threat not to the Commons but to the Executive. For that reason, we should welcome, not obstruct, a more effective second Chamber.</p>
	<p pid="a.1550.5/6">On composition, my view is that there is a role in the upper House for an appointed element&mdash;those who served in the armed forces, the generals, the surgeons, the lawyers, the mandarins, and the professors. I agree with everything that has been said about their contribution to the proceedings, and I would want them to remain&mdash;at a level of about 20 or 30 per cent. However, the party political peers, whatever the percentage, should be elected. Unlike the Cross Benchers, they are political animals; they are not political virgins. If we look at those who have been appointed since 2001, we find that 69 per cent. previously fought an election&mdash;either general or local, devolved or European. If we look at some of the party peers who have not fought an election&mdash;the Lord Chancellor, for example&mdash;we find that they would have liked to do so, but could not find a constituency to select them!</p>
	<p pid="a.1550.5/7">If we look at what happens in general elections, the fact is that large numbers of Conservative peers are out banging on doors on our behalf. I find nothing wrong at all in saying to those who are members of a political party and who want to sit in a second Chamber that is going to pass laws that they should have one final gentle brush with the electorate along the lines proposed in the White Paper. That confers a legitimacy that no other process can.</p>
	<p pid="a.1550.5/8">Finally, I want to deal with the other side of the legitimacy coin&mdash;namely, the rival mandate argument. I thought that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1463" name="John Bercow">my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham (John Bercow)</phrase> demolished the argument yesterday, so I add but a footnote to what he said. Let us consider the proposition in the White Paper, with50 per cent. appointed and 50 per cent. elected, and the 50 per cent. elected being replaced a third at a time at European election time. At any one point in time, at most 17 per cent. of the upper House could claim a more recent mandate than that of this House; and of that 17 per cent., some would remain loyal to the Administration. That is hardly a strong platform on which to base a claim for a rival mandate and extra legitimacy over and above this Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="a.1550.5/9">Yet it goes further than that. Members of this House are all elected on the same day on the basis of the same party manifesto; we are elected to the pre-eminent House in Parliament, which sustains the Executive and produces the Prime Minister. We submit ourselves for re-election, which is the country's verdict on our performance. None of those conditions would apply to the second Chamber as proposed in the White Paper. Elected Members would not be elected all at the same time, but over a longer period. They would have no mandate to rival the mandate of those in this House: indeed, some would be not elected, but appointed. The notion that they could somehow convert themselves into an equally legitimate Chamber that could challenge the authority of this House is strictly for the birds.</p>
	<p pid="a.1550.5/10">In all the proposals for the second Chamber, it is clearly defined as complementary and subordinate to this House. Its only powers are those given to it by this House, which remains pre-eminent. The second Chamber would simply not be able&mdash;even if it wanted to&mdash;unilaterally to change its powers after reform, any more than it can now.</p>
	<p pid="a.1550.5/11">In common with the hon. Member for Cannock Chase, I find echoes in today's debate of earlier debates in which we heard that the accumulated wisdom of those who govern the country would be lost if the franchise were extended. The good folk of other countries that used to be behind the iron curtain but are now democracies&mdash;or, indeed, the good folk of Iraq and Afghanistan&mdash;might be surprised to learn that we regard it as a matter of controversy that people should elect those who govern them. This reform is long overdue and, when it has happened, people will wonder what all the fuss was about. We should get on with it tonight.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-03-07a.1553.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1886" speakername="David Clelland" colnum="1553"  time="014:33:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070307/debtext/70307-0009.htm#07030793003927">
	<p pid="a.1553.1/1">I am not giving way, because other Members are anxious to contribute and there is not much time left.</p>
	<p pid="a.1553.1/2">The system of proportional representation has also been mentioned. It would undoubtedly be used for the election of Members to the upper House, but it is, in fact, just another system of appointment&mdash;any list system is a system of appointment by elected party leaders&mdash;and would lead to a conflict in constituencies between Members of that House and of this Chamber. Some have argued that, apparently, there are no such problems with the election of Members of the European Parliament, but I suspect that that is not true in all cases. Members of the European Parliament are, of course, in a different parliament and we are talking about Members in this Parliament. The proper comparison to be made is that with the Welsh Assembly and the Scottish Parliament, particularly in terms of the problems caused by list Members in the constituencies of elected Members. We would encounter the same problem here.</p>
	<p pid="a.1553.1/3">The Leader of the House has prayed in aid public opinion, claiming that it favours elections. As we all know, public opinion depends on <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1478" name="Tony Wright">the question asked. My hon. Friend the Member for Cannock Chase(Dr. Wright)</phrase> referred earlier to one question that was asked and the curious results that emerged. The public will realise that what is being proposed is the electionof at least another 270, perhaps another 500-plus, elected politicians&mdash;at an estimated cost, according to this morning's report from Lord Lipsey, of more than &pound;1 billion.</p>

	<p pid="a.1555.0/1">I am pleased to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1886" name="David Clelland">the hon. Member for Tyne Bridge (Mr. Clelland)</phrase>. He represents the north-east, I come from the north-west and our views on the subject are identical.</p>
	<p pid="a.1555.0/2">The speeches in the debate so far have been outstanding. They have shown commitment to democracy and to this House and displayed a sense of history. That is right in any such debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.1555.0/3">I hope that I am not out of order to say to you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, that perhaps in future, such debates, which last for two days, should not necessarily include speeches from two Front-Bench Members. That applies to speeches by Opposition Front Benchers as well as Government Front Benchers, and, for that matter&mdash;perhaps I say this with more venom&mdash;Liberal Democrat Front Benchers. The Liberal Democrat spokesman in today's debate spoke for longer than either the Government or the official Opposition spokesmen. <i> [Interruption.] </i><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1824" name="David Heath">The hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath)</phrase> does not have to give way to Members if he is claiming that interventions are the reason for the length of his speech.</p>
	<p pid="a.1555.0/4">The hon. Gentleman did not do his case any good by referring to the appointment of former Members of this place to the House of Lords. The Liberal Democrats could be accused of all sorts of things in respect of the people whom they have appointed from this place, including failed politicians or politicians who changed sides, to safe seats in the upper House.</p>
	<p pid="a.1555.0/5">The hon. Gentleman should also examine one or two of the reports of the Modernisation Committee, which the Leader of the House chairs, about Lords messages and the Reasons Committee. Those matters are being discussed by the Modernisation Committee and it does not need an elected element in the House of Lords to put them right.</p>
	<p pid="a.1555.0/6"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1478" name="Tony Wright">The hon. Member for Cannock Chase (Dr. Wright)</phrase> always makes thoughtful speeches. However, I want to pick him up on one point. He referred to a poll that gave the House of Lords great credit. Let me cite another. The ICM poll in 2005 found that 72 per cent. of those questioned thought that the Lords did a good job, meaning &quot;very good&quot; to &quot;fairly good&quot;, as opposed to only 23 per cent. who thought that it did a bad job, meaning &quot;fairly bad&quot; to &quot;very bad&quot;. The hon. Gentleman chairs an important Committee and I stress to him and other hon. Members that many other Chambers and legislatures would die for such figures. How would election of another set of politicians increase confidence in a second Chamber?</p>
	<p pid="a.1555.0/7">The Father of the House went to the heart of the matter yesterday when he said:</p>
	<p pid="a.1555.0/8" class="indent">&quot;The primacy derives absolutely&mdash;not just in part&mdash;from the fact that we are the elected Chamber, and because of that the other House observes conventions.&quot;&mdash;[Official Report, <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-06">6 March 2007</phrase>; Vol. 457, c. 1427.]</p>
	<p pid="a.1555.0/9">I had the honour to serve on the Joint Committee that dealt with Lords conventions. As I said in an intervention on the Leader of the House yesterday, that Committee stated clearly that if the composition of the House of Lords was changed, another Committee comprising different Members would have to review the position on conventions.</p>
	<p pid="a.1555.0/10">The Father of the House tabled a written question to the Leader of the House asking whether Members of the House of Lords would have the same freedom as Members of the House of Commons to make representations on behalf of their constituents. I shall not go through the majority of the reply, but the last sentence states:</p>
	<p pid="a.1555.0/11" class="indent">&quot;The House of Lords should not duplicate the functions of the House of Commons.&quot;&mdash;[<i> Official Report, </i><phrase class="date" code="2007-03-01">1 March 2007</phrase>; Vol. 457, c. 1469W.]</p>
	<p pid="a.1555.0/12">The hon. Member for Tyne Bridge referred to that in a way when he mentioned the complications, problems and conflicts that arise between Members of this House, Members of the European Parliament and especially Members of the Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly Members. I have spoken especially to Labour Members&mdash;we have so few Members in Scotland&mdash;and they are deeply concerned and often placed in difficult positions by the interference of Members of the Scottish Parliament in matters that relate to the House of Commons.</p>
	<p pid="a.1555.0/13">It is extraordinary to discuss the composition of the House of Lords before we have decided what we want it to do. Surely that is putting the cart before the horse. I believe that we should examine the role of this House first and consider how the House of Commons can hold the Government of the day to account and properly scrutinise legislation. We need to make the role of the Back Bencher more positive and meaningful. It has not been mentioned&mdash;surprisingly, not even by the Leader of the House&mdash;that the Modernisation Committee is currently dealing with that matter and also examining how the House might use non-legislative time. That is important. Surely we should put our House in order before we start messing about with the House of Lords.</p>
	<p pid="a.1555.0/14">As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1847" name="John Maples">my hon. Friend the Member for Stratford-on-Avon (Mr. Maples)</phrase> said yesterday:</p>
	<p pid="a.1555.0/15" class="indent">&quot;The House of Lords is exactly what we say we want. It is independent; some of its Members have significant expertise; it has limited power; it does not challenge the House of Commons; and all parties are represented, although none of them has a majority. It does almost everything that we want it to do, but it does not satisfy the test... of whether or not it is democratic.&quot;&mdash;[<i> Official Report, </i><phrase class="date" code="2007-03-06">6 March 2007</phrase>; Vol. 457, c. 1434.]</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-03-07a.1568.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1497" speakername="Paul Holmes" colnum="1568"  time="015:25:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070307/debtext/70307-0011.htm#07030793003972">
	<p pid="a.1568.1/1">No, I will not. There is not time, because a lot of people wish to speak.<i> [Interruption.]</i> I could give way only at the expense of other people.</p>
	<p pid="a.1568.1/2">This Parliament should not be a feudal hangover from 400, 600 or 800 years ago. As one or two hon. Members have said, all the arguments that we hear as to why the second Chamber should not be elected are the exact mirror image of everything that was said back in the 19th century, when at various stages reform of this place proceeded very slowly, like extracting teeth very painfully from unwilling people. In 1832, when a radical proposal to extend the franchise from 2 per cent. of rich landowning men to 5 per cent. of rich landowning men was put forward, people in this House fought it tooth and nail. It was first proposed in the 18th century, but it was some 40 years before the House even got to consider that proposal. The same arguments were advanced in 1867, when the franchise was extended further, although still not to all men, let alone to women, which did not come until the20th century.</p>
	<p pid="a.1568.1/3">In 1874 we heard all these arguments when it was suggested that we should have a secret ballot. How outrageous that voters should be able to vote in secret! Much better that they could vote in public, so that their employer could exercise due influence by sacking them if they voted the wrong way; so that their landlord could exercise due influence by evicting them if they voted the wrong way; so that the mob in the street could exercise due influence by beating them up if they voted the wrong way when they stood on that public platform. Those were things that happened all the time in the 18th and 19th century. It is appalling that, in the 21st century, in 2007, people come up with all these arguments as to why we should not have democracy.</p>
	<p pid="a.1568.1/4">Then we heard the argument that we should not democratise the second Chamber because it is full of experts. A number of hon. Members have referred to this, and pointed out that if, for example, someone is appointed to the second Chamber because they are an expert on in vitro fertilisation and health issues in general, that does not make them an expert on the other 95 per cent. of discussion, debate and legislation that is considered in the House of Lords. If someone is there because they are an ex-vice-admiral, ex-air vice-marshal or defence expert, does that mean that they are qualified to talk on the health service and so on?</p>
	<p pid="a.1568.1/5">If we want expert advice, we employ expert advice. We bring expert witnesses before Select Committees. Both Government and Opposition use experts to draft legislation. We do not appoint experts to govern our lives. I know that that is something that is creeping into the democracy of this country. A lot of local government has had its power stripped away; it is being given now to the quangocracy. There is the Learning and Skills Council, which spends &pound;9 billion of public money and is accountable to no one. If I ask a Minister about the Learning and Skills Council I am told, &quot;Oh, you have to ask them; that is not our business any more,&quot; but it is spending &pound;9 billion of taxpayers' money. There are the primary care trusts, and the regional development agencies. There are the Government regional officers who march with their jackboots into the housing department of Chesterfield borough council, wanting to know why we have not privatised the council housing, although the council tenants have voted overwhelmingly not to do so. If it was down to me and to my party, all that power would be devolved back to accountable, democratic bodies. And there is the idea that experts should run the whole of local government, and run the second Chamber&mdash;why not this Chamber?</p>
	<p pid="a.1568.1/6">One hon. Member even made a very eloquent case this afternoon, virtually saying that this Chamber was ineffective, and that the only effect he had ever managed to achieve was to get some appointed Members in the second Chamber to change legislation. It sounds to me like a superb case for abolishing elections to the House of Commons and appointing everyone who is here as well, which is simply ridiculous and outrageous.</p>
	<p pid="a.1568.1/7">I realise that reversing all this to reintroduce democracy into local government, let alone into the second Chamber, seems very radical, but in the rest of Europe and across the United States they seem to manage it somehow. The idea that in the UK we cannot cope with democracy and self-government and devolution of power is incomprehensible.</p>
	<p pid="a.1568.1/8">My preference tonight is clear. I would prefer to see a 100 per cent. elected second Chamber, in keeping with the manifesto that I, among others, was elected on in 2001, which said clearly that we wanted a directly elected second Chamber&mdash;not partly, but directly elected, 100 per cent. Equally, our manifestos of 1997 and 2005 said that we wanted a predominantly elected second Chamber. So as a second-best option, I will go for the 80:20 split, but I would much prefer to see a fully elected second Chamber.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-03-07a.1575.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1841" speakername="Mark Fisher" colnum="1575"  time="015:53:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070307/debtext/70307-0012.htm#07030793003985">
	<p pid="a.1575.2/1">If we vote tonight for a second Chamber that is either 80 or 100 per cent. elected, we will be taking a long stride towards completing our democracy&mdash;a process that we have stuttered towards for hundreds of years. Heretofore, the people of this country have been denied any say in who sits and governs in half of our Parliament. That is completely against the spirit of what we have been trying to achieve democratically. We have had half a democracy and half a democratically elected Parliament. We have the chance tonight to end that and I hope that we do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.1575.2/2">As other hon. Members, especially <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1639" name="Frank Dobson">my right hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Frank Dobson)</phrase>, have said, this is only part of a much wider democratic debate that we should be having. It is thus a great pleasure to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1498" name="Andrew Tyrie">the hon. Member for Chichester (Mr. Tyrie)</phrase>, with whom I find myself in permanent agreement on constitutional and political matters, on which he has always written and spoken good sense. The changes that we are considering do not represent all the political and democratic reform that this country needs, but they will form a significant part of it.</p>
	<p pid="a.1575.2/3">Yesterday's debate focused on the composition of the second Chamber. Can we start calling it a second Chamber, by the way, and not the House of Lords? The White Paper says that we must get rid of the peerages, and we are considering the second Chamber of our Parliament. Given that the debate focused on composition, it inevitably gave rise to a consideration of primacy, or, more properly, the crucial question of whether reform would inhibit the power of the Government to govern. I make it clear that I will be voting for a composition of 100 per cent. or 80 per cent. elected Members. I am always amazed when people who have been elected as Members of the House through the democratic process have scruples or doubts about the usefulness of that process. I hope and expect that, unlike in 2003, the House will decide on80 per cent., at least.</p>
	<p pid="a.1575.2/4">When the time comes, I hope that we will be decisive on other aspects of the White Paper. It is regrettable that we are talking about only composition today because there are other important matters in the thoughtful and wide-ranging White Paper. Given that the White Paper is so thoughtful, however, I am amazed&mdash;and rather depressed&mdash;by the timidity of proposing a transitional period for the new democracy of about half a century. The very youngest Member of the House, and even the child of the youngest Member, will be long since gone by the time that we reach the democratic position that I hope that we all want. I hope that we will be more decisive on the transitional period.</p>
	<p pid="a.1575.2/5">I also hope that we will not go for a closed-list system because that would undermine everything. That system would be a complete disaster, as has been proved by our experience of the European elections. As other hon. Members have said, such a system gives power to the political parties, but not to the people of this country.</p>
	<p pid="a.1575.2/6">I hope&mdash;this is crucial to any consideration of remit and powers&mdash;that we will be considering a much smaller second Chamber. It is nonsense that the House of Lords has 740 Members, most of whom do not take part in debates. It does not need that many Members. I suspect that most of the work up there is doneby between 200 and 250 people. A House of200 people&mdash;a senate, as it were&mdash;could do its job very well. Although this might be uncomfortable for hon. Members, this Chamber is too big as well. We could well do our work with 400 people.</p>
	<p pid="a.1575.2/7">The remit of the second Chamber is crucial. If we can get it right, it will resolve all the questions of primacy and competitiveness between the Houses. That is the wrong way in which to look at the two Houses. We are one Parliament. The job of Parliament, irrespective of the House, is to hold the Executive to account, to monitor what they do and to try to pass good legislation. The Houses are working together, but it has long been an appalling characteristic of both Houses that we do not talk to each other&mdash;politically, if not socially&mdash;and see ourselves as being in competition. We must rid ourselves of that stupid and limited attitude. We are both aiming for the same thing: to improve the quality of government and to hold the Government to account.</p>
	<p pid="a.1575.2/8">This House has achieved primacy over the past250 or 300 years by controlling Supply. Indeed, that has been the case for much longer than that. King John chose to go to Runnymede to sign up to a Magna Carta that he absolutely did not agree with a word of because he needed Supply. Of course, he reneged on everything that he had agreed within weeks, but Magna Carta is seen, historically, although totally erroneously, as the fundamental source of all our liberties.</p>
	<p pid="a.1575.2/9">Although the control of Supply is one element of what gives this House its great power, the other element is the fact that, for the past 200 or 250 years&mdash;since Mr. Walpole&mdash;we have been the location of the Executive, rather than the monarch. That, in a way, determines the remit of both Houses. The Commons is the House of the Executive&mdash;of the Prime Minister, the Ministers and the Cabinet&mdash;and the other Chamber has a natural remit, not as the House of the Executive, but as the House of scrutiny.</p>
	<p pid="a.1575.2/10">As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1478" name="Tony Wright">my hon. Friend the Member for Cannock Chase (Dr. Wright)</phrase> said in a typically excellent contribution, and as other Members have said, there are many types of scrutiny that we do not do well, and there are many areas where we could do more. They include post-legislative and pre-legislative scrutiny, and scrutiny of the arm's length agencies and quangos that increasingly work on behalf of the Government, but that are not held accountable. Ministers duck questions and pass them on to those bodies. Much scrutiny that will, I suspect, never be carried out in this Chamber could be done in the second Chamber.</p>
	<p pid="a.1575.2/11">Things would work much better, and it would clarify the distinction between the two Houses, if the other House had no members of the Executive&mdash;no Ministers&mdash;at all. We do not need Ministers in the other House; this is the House of the Executive and Ministers. If the second Chamber were free from Government patronage and careerism, and its Members were really free, within the bounds of parliamentary and political philosophy, to be independent, rigorous scrutineers, it would hugely improve the clarity of the distinction between the two Houses, and it would allow us to work much more complementarily. I notice that the White Paper mentions that point in passing, in almost just a line, but surely we must come back to the issue. Let us get the Executive out of the second Chamber and free that Chamber to be a rigorous House of scrutiny.</p>
	<p pid="a.1575.2/12">I agree with my right hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras that today's debate ought to be part of a much wider political debate on reform. Hon. Members on both sides of the House are, at the moment, in a critically weak parliamentary position. The imbalance between the Executive and the legislature has become critical, and any decision made today could play a small but significant part in improving that.</p>
	<p pid="a.1575.2/13"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1706" name="Gerald Kaufman">My right hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Gorton (Sir Gerald Kaufman)</phrase> said that the debate is otiose because nothing will happen, and asked what new incoming Prime Minister would want to get bogged down in the issue. I hope that he is wrong. It is incumbent on Members on both sides of the House to ensure that, either before or after the next election, any new Prime Minister is encouraged to see, indeed is shown, how important reform is, and how popular it could be. The Prime Minister who changes the balance between the Executive and the legislature and creates a fully democratic Parliament could go down as a great reforming Prime Minister. There is an opportunity to be taken.</p>
	<p pid="a.1575.2/14">We need a new settlement, a new covenant, a new Magna Carta that would clarify the democratic role of both Houses and the relationship between the Executive and the legislature. We will not have this opportunity very often; we are lucky. We may be unfortunate enough to be in a House that is decrepit, in terms of the provision of parliamentary scrutiny and the balance between the Executive and the legislature, but we are lucky to be here at a moment when we can influence it, perhaps in a way in which it has not been influenced since Wilkes. This evening will, perhaps, be a great moment. I hope that the House will have the courage to take that step, to rebalance our democracy, and to ensure that the voice of the people is heard in both Houses.</p>

	<p pid="a.1578.1/1">This has been a fascinating debate. It is now generally agreed by Members on both sides of the House that Parliament as a whole, and not just the House of Lords, must be reformed. I add that there should be a reduction of the overweening power of the Executive and the Whip system. That must be done on the great principles of democracy; independence of judgment; public interest; the self-government of the United Kingdom; the supremacy of our Westminster Parliament, based on the primacy of the House of Commons as the Chamber of government; legislation derived from opinions, judgment and democratic principles within the framework of the rule of law; and, above all else, the will of the electorate through general elections.</p>
	<p pid="a.1578.1/2">The arguments presented by those who are against a democratically elected House of Lords have, I fear, a resonance in the reactionary arguments that were heard in the run-up to the Reform Act 1832, the reform of the House of Commons, against the repeal of our corn laws, and again in 1867, 1874, the late 19th century, 1911 and 1926, when it was thought by some inconceivable that women should have the vote.</p>
	<p pid="a.1578.1/3">We must complete the democratic process after100 years of debate. Even in the 18th century, the economic reform movement paved the way to removing the rotten boroughs, which were based on purchase by patronage and appointment by the Crown. I recall Dunning's famous motion of 1780 that the power of the Crown has increased, is increasing and ought to be diminished.</p>
	<p pid="a.1578.1/4">What is wrong, some ask, with an appointed House of Lords? After all, it is true that many of them have performed and continue to perform an assiduous and distinguished role in the political life of the nation. But surely, it is argued, it is in the public interest to have experts appointed to legislate in their specialised field. Unfortunately, the appointments system does not stand scrutiny. It is based on patronage and, at its worst, is corrupted by the whiff of scandal.</p>
	<p pid="a.1578.1/5">As to expertise, I read, for example, that one noble Lord tells us that he would not tend to vote in areas where he knew nothing about the issue in question. This is one of the so-called people's peers. I think he knows little about parliamentary ways. Legislators have an obligation to learn to participate in the process as a whole. This particular peer regards himself as an expert in matters of the European Union, but is significantly out of kilter with public opinion on the subject.</p>
	<p pid="a.1578.1/6">On the more general question of appointment, as I said yesterday in an intervention, in 2005-06&mdash;this is telling&mdash;170 life peers who are not Law Lords voted in less than 10 per cent. of the Divisions, and 76 of them did not take part in any Division whatsoever. That is a disgrace. They are part of the legislative process. Why are they there at all? Furthermore, from figures that I have from the Library in relation to claims for the daily allowance, the median rate of attendance based on allowance claims was 67 per cent., whereas the median participation in Divisions was half of that&mdash;a mere36 per cent. That cannot be right.</p>
	<p pid="a.1578.1/7">The House of Lords is often described as a revising Chamber. That generalisation deserves proper study. In the past few years, few Bills have been rejected by the House of Lords and subjected to the Parliament Act. In respect of amendments to Bills, most amendments are made by the Government. The problem comes from the disgraceful number of Bills guillotined in this House, which must be stopped. This is not a reason in itself to glorify the House of Lords as a revising Chamber. Indeed, many amendments that are returned to the House of Commons are a product of the votes of Cross-Benchers with Liberal Democrats, with their zeal for certain types of legislation, including human rights legislation and some of the most permissive legislation that has gone through recently.</p>
	<p pid="a.1578.1/8">Direct elections would make the House of Lords more responsive to public opinion in respect of matters relating to both the European Union and human rights. It is noticeable that the Committees in the House of Lords are dominated by acknowledged Euro-enthusiasts. I have no objection to their views. I would defend their right to express them, but I would ask that they take a rational view of the basis on which the arguments are presented. Most are contrary to public opinion.</p>
	<p pid="a.1578.1/9">There is an even deeper question here. Through the European Communities Act 1972 the House of Lords and even the Law Lords are overarched in the legislative process and as a supreme court by the European treaties. The Leader of the House knows that I am right. Therefore, the House of Lords is, like the House of Commons, very much within the influence of the European Union, which is itself undemocratic and unaccountable.</p>
	<p pid="a.1578.1/10">I object to the proposed open-list system&mdash;we will have to sort that out when the Bill comes before the House of Commons at a later stage&mdash;and I am extremely concerned that we are not being presented with a first-past-the-post system. I am profoundly against the patronage of the party list system, which, even if independents were allowed to stand, would in practice result in excessive control by the party leadership over the judgment of those who are elected. There is a strong case for a democratically elected House to be required to prohibit whipping in the upper Chamber in respect of legislative matters after Second Reading. If that were done by Standing Orders, it would buttress people's ability to make decisions based on their own judgment, not driven by the party Whips system.</p>
	<p pid="a.1578.1/11">As for 15 years' tenure, I cannot understand why it should not be a mere five years. That would enable a more natural transition from the existing House and allow those of good standing to remain for the time being.</p>
	<p pid="a.1578.1/12">On possible conflicts between the Houses, I have argued for more than a decade that it is easy to avoid that by having different electoral cycles and different constituencies, and a hybrid House of 80:20 or 60:40. However, if Lords elections and boundaries were coterminous with European elections and boundaries, I fear that that would lead to the former being dominated by European issues, which would be absurd. As my amendment shows, I would have preferred that the Chamber's functions be determined before its composition, but we are where we are. There must be drawn up in the Bill a schedule of important but restricted functions for a democratically elected House of Lords, with primacy clearly founded in statute to ensure that the House of Commons is the democratically elected Chamber of Government, with financial matters clearly reserved to it. I am afraid that I do not agree with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1549" name="Oliver Letwin">my right hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin)</phrase> that people are not concerned about primacy; I believe that they are. Because primacy and functions are inseparable, we must not merely rely on the conventions, but insist on statute to bring into effect a directly elected Chamber, in order to ensure that this House remains the Chamber of Government and determines questions of taxation and public expenditure.</p>
	<p pid="a.1578.1/13">I have argued for more than a decade for a directly elected House of Lords, and it is time for us to make certain that that takes place.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-03-07a.1580.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1709" speakername="Robert Marshall-Andrews" colnum="1580"  time="016:13:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070307/debtext/70307-0013.htm#07030793003988">
	<p pid="a.1580.0/1">I start in a spirit of repentance, as foreshadowed by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1463" name="John Bercow">the hon. Member for Buckingham (John Bercow)</phrase>. In the 1999 debate on this subject, I strongly supported and spoke in favour of the unicameral option. In the 2003 debate, I strongly supported and spoke in favour of a substantially elected second Chamber&mdash;&quot;substantially&quot; then being the mot juste. Tonight, I will support the status quo. It will be immediately obvious that I have had a double apostasy, which has been a remarkably painless process. All those who undergo life-changing operations want to speak about it, so that is what I want to do.</p>
	<p pid="a.1580.0/2">Let me offer a mea culpa and explain why I have arrived at this position having traversed the whole breadth of the options that are available to us. When I strongly supported a unicameral Chamber, it was for the simple reason that I believed that the House of Commons should take responsibility for its own actions and its own votes. I was reinforced in that by the fact that immediately beforehand I had been trying to persuade some of my hon. Friends to vote against the Government. Unlike <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1706" name="Gerald Kaufman">my right hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Gorton (Sir Gerald Kaufman)</phrase>, I cannot boast of 37 years of never voting against the party Whip&mdash;nor 10 years, for that matter, nor even six months. On that occasion, I was hoping to persuade many of my colleagues to vote against the first Criminal Justice (Mode of Trial) Bill, which my right hon. Friend the Leader of the House may remember very well. A surprisingly large number of them told me that they were entirely in agreement with my view and were entirely against the Government's attack on this aspect of civil liberty, but that they would none the less vote with the Government because they knew full well that in due course the House of Lords would do its duty, which it did.</p>
	<p pid="a.1580.0/3">It seemed to me that that in itself was an abnegation of the responsibilities of this House. It also seemed to me at the time that a unicameralist position would do much to reverse that. I have observed what subsequently happened and what has happened to other Bills that have passed into the House of Lords. I am grateful to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1369" name="Gerald Howarth">the hon. Member for Aldershot (Mr. Howarth)</phrase> for pointing out that on 400 occasions the House of Lords has reversed serious parts of Government legislation, the majority of which have affected civil liberties in one way or another. On most occasions, the other place sought to affect the civil liberties aspects of Bills that the Government had passed. It is worth reflecting that this Government have passed more Bills affecting civil liberties than were passed in the whole of the 19th and the first part of the 20th century. Such Bills can be passed in this House by a majority of one vote. Bills on constitutional matters can be passed without a two-thirds majority.</p>
	<p pid="a.1580.0/4">As I grew up, I suppose, it seemed to me that the essence of the House of Lords was indeed to object to that type of attack on constitutional issues, so I changed my mind and voted for a largely or substantially elected upper House. The reason I did so was on account of the belief that I have always had that the true curse of the British political system is patronage&mdash;patronage in whatever aegis or whatever system it comes. I am talking about patronage in appointments to ministerial office and patronage in appointments to the House of Lords. Because I believed that so strongly, I voted for a wholly or substantially elected second Chamber.</p>
	<p pid="a.1580.0/5">That patronage, however, has been immeasurably increased in the short time that I have been here by the growth of the professional politician. There is nothing wrong with the professional politician. It is an honourable vocation: despite the predations of the fourth estate, we have an honourable vocation. However, it is unanswerable that those who come into politics as their only profession&mdash;wishing, of course, to succeed in their only profession&mdash;are vulnerable to the powers of patronage to a far greater extent than others. As a result of the catalyst of those two things, patronage has increased immeasurably.</p>
	<p pid="a.1580.0/6">For that reason, I find myself&mdash;paradoxically and perversely, in many ways&mdash;changing again. I am always encouraged by the expression on the face of the hon. Member for Buckingham when I get into this kind of strife. I changed again for a reason that can be seen in the White Paper, particularly in relation to the formof election in the second Chamber. The postulation of that election is that it should be by closed or semi-closed or open list&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="a.1582.5/1">It is always a pleasure to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1709" name="Robert Marshall-Andrews">the hon. and learned Member for Medway (Mr. Marshall-Andrews)</phrase>. He is good value. I do not agree with him on this occasion but it is interesting that he has been to Damascus. However, I have not.</p>
	<p pid="a.1582.5/2">We are tackling the problem backwards. We have heard much in the past few days about the primacy of this House, but the problem is the overweening power of the Executive. Fifty Home Office Bills have been introduced since 1997 and we have experienced the nonsense of clauses in some measures being overtaken by succeeding Bills. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1478" name="Tony Wright">the hon. Member for Cannock Chase (Dr. Wright)</phrase> said, we have quangos. We also have European legislation. I served on the European Scrutiny Committee and, one day, we met at 4 o'clock and adjourned two minutes later, having passed 78 documents. This House is not restraining the Executive or scrutinising legislation effectively and my constituents continually complain about over-regulation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1582.5/3">We should establish the function of the House of Lords first, but that is not the point of the debate. I would welcome a stronger House of Lords that made life more difficult for the Executive and galvanised the House of Commons into doing its job better.</p>
	<p pid="a.1582.5/4">The experience of the United States Senate does not bear out the alarm of those who fear an elected House of Lords. It was originally appointed by various mechanisms. An age threshold of 30 was set and the Senate was excluded from issues of Supply&mdash;raising and spending money. It was intended to be the junior House, with the House of Representatives being the proportionate House. Now that the Senate is elected, it has inevitably increased its power. It is inevitable that any elected element will give a new House authority. However, mechanisms have been devised, such as the Conference Committee, to resolve deadlock. I do not fear deadlock. We have too much law and some parliamentary setbacks might have a beneficial effect on an overbearing Executive. I would welcome some tension.</p>
	<p pid="a.1582.5/5">The US Senate's most brilliant innovation was to allocate two Senators per state, regardless of population. That was originally intended to ensure that the thinly populated rural states were not overwhelmed in the legislature by the populous states that were dominated by the commercial interest. That was a clever rationalisation of the geographical distribution that the hereditary peerage provided in Great Britain.</p>
	<p pid="a.1582.5/6">I have asked the Prime Minister a series of parliamentary questions, the answer to which shows a spectacular disfranchisement of the United Kingdom outside London and the south-east. I asked the Prime Minister on <phrase class="date" code="2004-09-14">14 September 2004</phrase>, <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-24">24 March 2005</phrase> and<phrase class="date" code="2007-03-06">6 March 2007</phrase>&mdash;I thank his office for replying this morning&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.1582.5/7" class="indent">&quot;what the place of residence, at the time of their elevation, was of each peer created since <phrase class="date" code="1997-05-01">1 May 1997</phrase>&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1582.5/8">Four hundred and one peers have been created. In percentage terms, the north-west got 5 per cent.; the north-east got 2 per cent.; Yorkshire and Humberside got 5 per cent.; the east midlands got less than 1 per cent.; the east of England got 7 per cent.; the west midlands got 4 per cent.; the south-east got 11 per cent.; the south-west got 5 per cent.; London got an incredible 44 per cent.; Scotland got 7 per cent.; Wales got 3 per cent.; Northern Ireland got 3 per cent., and &quot;judicial&quot;, which means no home address, accounts for 3 per cent., too. Fifty-five per cent. of the new peers in our second Chamber therefore come from London and the south-east. That is unacceptable and it is essential for the new Lords to reflect more fairly the regions outside London and the south-east.</p>
	<p pid="a.1582.5/9">I regard the Government's hybrid as deplorable: it will entrench the power of London and the south-east. The proposed list system is repellent: it will give power to those who place candidates on the party list and exclude the voters from making real decisions. The regions are also far too large. I would advocate a smaller number of peers being elected in fixed numbers&mdash;say, two or three per county or city, regardless of population. I would support a second Chamber elected with maximum terms and rolling election every five years. I would also exclude Ministers from the second Chamber.</p>
	<p pid="a.1582.5/10">We have an over-mighty Executive; I shall vote for80 per cent. and 100 per cent. as a small step to start reining it in.</p>

	<p pid="a.1584.0/1">May I say through you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, that I am grateful to Mr. Speaker for allowing me to be absent for the earlier part of the debate. I shall be accordingly brief.</p>
	<p pid="a.1584.0/2">I have looked carefully at the voting options tonight. As I did so, the spirit of Khrushchev entered me, as I resolved to vote &quot;Nyet&quot; to them, one by one, until we come to the welcome last option, which allows me to vote yes to the removal of the hereditary principle, which is long overdue.</p>
	<p pid="a.1584.0/3">I have no objection in principle to a second Chamber. I do have an objection in principle to a second Chamber that is not wholly elected. It seems to me inexcusable that part of the legislature in the21st century could be appointed by whomsoever. The idea that those appointments could include representatives of one or a pot-pourri of religions seems positively mediaeval.</p>
	<p pid="a.1584.0/4">I have no objection to an advisory body on legislation, which might be more persuasive if stocked with people of experience and ability&mdash;without the baggage of challenging the primacy of the Commons&mdash;relying solely on the power of argument. I cannot vote for a 100 per cent. elected Chamber because of the issue of primacy, notwithstanding all that has been said in the debate hitherto.</p>
	<p pid="a.1584.0/5">Successful second chambers, such as the United States Senate, are elected on a wholly different basis from that of the first chamber. That option, often a federal option, has been specifically rejected in this country, most recently in the north-east referendum.</p>

	<p pid="a.1585.1/1">Perhaps my right hon. Friend did not hear what I said. I said that the Commons Chamber was a force that attempted, unsuccessfully in some cases, to stand up for itself. I spoke with my tongue a little in my cheek, but I nevertheless believe thatwe should have the courage of our predecessors of350 years ago in supporting that good old cause,the true democracy of a single-Chamber Parliament elected by the Commons of the United Kingdom.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-03-07a.1585.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1588" speakername="Mark Harper" colnum="1585"  time="016:31:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070307/debtext/70307-0014.htm#07030793004000">
	<p pid="a.1585.2/1">My starting point is my belief that what is most important is the relationship between the Executive and Parliament, rather than the relationship between this House and the other place. I believe that the Executive is too powerful, not just in terms of the Government's ability to pass legislation but in terms of the accountability of Ministers, and the extent to which we are being supplanted by the 24-hour news media when this House is the place where announcements should be made first. As I have explored some of the options at length during Westminster Hall debates I shall not do so again now, but that is my central point.</p>
	<p pid="a.1585.2/2">What we should be discussing is not merely the reform of the upper House, but the reform of Parliament. Our experience over the past 10 years of other constitutional reforms&mdash;Welsh and Scottish devolution, the botched abolition of the Lord Chancellor, and the way in which the Human Rights Act 1998 was introduced&mdash;suggests that it behoves us to think the issue through carefully, rather than rushing in and then being confronted by a raft of unforeseen consequences.</p>
	<p pid="a.1585.2/3">Our key task is to consider the role that we want Parliament to have against the Executive, and how much power we want the Executive to have. We should also think carefully about the relative roles of the two Houses. As other Members have said, the House of Commons has a key supply role in providing Ministers, while the upper House's role will involve scrutiny, revising, and advising this House. Once we have established the respective roles of the Executive and Parliament and the roles of the two Chambers, decisions about composition will become more straightforward.</p>
	<p pid="a.1585.2/4">That is the first debate that we should have, and the arguments in which we have engaged about the different types of election that we favour should flow from it. As was pointed out by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1818" name="Owen Paterson">my hon. Friendthe Member for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson)</phrase>, the United States Senate considered a system involving the representation of geographical regions. Depending on the function that we want the upper House to have, similar choices should present themselves in a relatively obvious manner.</p>
	<p pid="a.1585.2/5">It is interesting to consider the position in other democracies around the world, several of which have been prayed in aid. The White Paper studied other legislatures, going around the world in just five paragraphs. I did not think that it did the subject justice: examples seemed to have been chosen to illustrate specific points, rather than to provide a solid base of evidence for this debate. Also, if we have not done that proper analysis of function it is difficult to see how we can properly judge the composition. That is not to say that I am against election. Many Members have made the sensible point that in a modern democracy those who make the laws should be elected. However, we cannot make judgments on the system of election until we have decided on the role that we want the legislature to undertake; discussion on that should take place first.</p>
	<p pid="a.1585.2/6"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1794" name="Kenneth Clarke">My right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1966" name="John Thurso">the hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross (John Thurso)</phrase> claimed that if the argument that I have enunciated is adopted nothing will happen and we will have no progress, and they also claimed that by changing the form and composition of the upper House we will in some way start a process that will force Members of this House to take our responsibilities to hold the Government to account more seriously. If I were convinced that that would happen, I might well support motions this evening for some form of election in the upper House, but I do not find that argument convincing. I think that the opposite will happen: I think that if this House decides to reform the other place, that is where the reform will stop. That process will convince many Members that they have had quite enough of constitutional change, and it will provide them with an excuse to do nothing about the processes and procedures of this House. I fear that that would be the case. I have thought carefully about this matter, and I have listened over the past two days to the arguments of colleagues who hold a different opinion from mine. I challenged myself to find out whether I would come to a different conclusion, but I do not find their arguments entirely convincing.</p>
	<p pid="a.1585.2/7">The Leader of House has gone on at length about the conventions of the relationship between this House and the other place. I believe that those conventions are sound, given the arrangements that we have. The Leader of the House has acknowledged that a change to a more democratic upper House would lead to those conventions being challenged. He says that the Government's position is that those conventions should remain, but I do not think that they would remain. A democratic upper House would challenge those conventions, and because we would not have had a debate about the proper role of the two Houses and the relationship between Parliament and the Executive, we would not be in a good position to make decisions on that.</p>
	<p pid="a.1585.2/8">On the method of election, I agree with Members who said that a closed list system or a partially open list system would be entirely undesirable. That would entrench the power of the parties. Let me close by reading out a quote. It amuses me to quote the Professor of Government at Oxford university, Vernon Bogdanor, as he taught politics to me and to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1932" name="David Cameron">my right hon. Friend the Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron)</phrase>. He says:</p>
	<p pid="a.1585.2/9" class="indent">&quot;For most people in England...the regions are ghosts, administrative constructs rather than constituencies...Perhaps it is because regions have so little relevance that turnout for European elections is so low&mdash;only 24 per cent. in 1999&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1585.2/10">and just 8 per cent. in some parts of the country. If this House ends up deciding that we need to have an elected upper House, we must make sure that the way we do that&mdash;the role we decide for the upper House, the balance between the Executive and Parliament, and the electoral system and the regions we choose&mdash;engages the public, rather than turns them off.</p>
	<p pid="a.1585.2/11">I intend to vote for the status quo, not because I am particularly happy with it but because I want there to be a challenge to this House to take its responsibilities seriously in challenging the Executive. If we do not undertake any reform of the upper House, that will force us in the not too distant future to challenge ourselves and to reform not only the other place, but this place also.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-03-07a.1590.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1506" speakername="David Jones" colnum="1590"  time="016:50:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070307/debtext/70307-0015.htm#07030793004004">
	<p pid="a.1590.0/1">This has been a fascinating debate and it is clear from contributions from Members on both sides of the House that there is overwhelming support, with a few exceptions, for the continuance of a bicameral Parliament. The issue that falls to be considered by the House today, however, is not the function of the second Chamber, but its composition and the means of arriving at that composition. That is the wrong approach.</p>
	<p pid="a.1590.0/2">If the proposal is that the second Chamber of this Parliament is to be elected, whether wholly or in part, its functions should first be defined. Other hon. Members have commented, and I agree with them, that if the Lords are to derive membership of their House from election, constitutional tensions will inevitably arise in the absence of clearly defined functions. Even if the functions are defined, experience suggests that elected bodies have a tendency to seek to acquire increasingly greater powers for themselves. A case in point is the Welsh Assembly. Less than eight years after its inception, the clamour for additional powers was such that Parliament passed a second Government of Wales Act in 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.1590.0/3">The principal problem is the use of the word &quot;legitimacy&quot;. The White Paper presupposes, and Members appear to accept the proposition, that legitimacy derives from democratic election, and that is understandable, given that the legitimacy of this House derives from a popular mandate. It is wrong, however, to take it for granted that the legitimacy of all elements of our constitutional arrangements derive from election. Indeed, many important elements do not, the most obvious example being the judiciary. Nobody elects a High Court judge or a Law Lord, but they are enormously important elements of our constitution. They make hugely important decisions in terms of public policy and are themselves lawmakers through the process of precedent. The importance of the other place to our legislative system is unquestioned, but whether the Members of that House should also be elected is dubious.</p>
	<p pid="a.1590.0/4">The process of election proposed by the White Paper is also fraught with difficulty. It is proposed that Members of the House of Lords should be elected on a rolling basis, at five-yearly intervals for 15-year terms. It is said that that will legitimise the Chamber, but if legitimacy is equated with accountability it will do nothing of the sort. If a Member of the House of Lords is elected for a 15-year term with no prospect of re-election, it cannot be said that he or she is in any sense accountable. Once that Member is in, he is in. He cannot be removed unless he does something truly dreadful. He will, however, be at liberty, if he so wishes, to break whatever manifesto commitments he has made and embark upon a wholly erratic course with impunity. That Member will not have hanging over his head the sword of Damocles that hangs over the head of every Member of this House, which is the prospect of seeking re-election in four or five years' time.</p>
	<p pid="a.1590.0/5">I also have enormous reservations about the validity of the list system as a means of electing a Member of the Lords. If a Member of the Lords is to be elected for a 15-year term, it means that, potentially and as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2015" name="Patrick Cormack">my hon. Friend the Member for South Staffordshire(Sir Patrick Cormack)</phrase> pointed out, the next member of the list can be called to do service many years after the election, in the event of the death or resignation of the sitting Member. During that time, the replacement may have lost those attributes that rendered him a suitable candidate for elected office in the first place. Nevertheless, that individual, unless he has blotted his copybook very severely in the meantime, will automatically become a Member of the House of Lords. Indeed, I am a living example of that phenomenon. The way the list process operates meant that I was called to be a Member of the Welsh Assembly almost three and a half years after the election in which I stood. I can tell the House that being telephoned out of the blue one afternoon and asked, &quot;Are you joining us tomorrow morning?&quot;, is not a happy experience.</p>
	<p pid="a.1590.0/6">Members of the second Chamber need to bring to their task calibre, wisdom and, in some cases, specialist expertise. We do not need another cadre of elected politicians, because they would often be people whose hearts are probably really in being Members of this House.</p>

	<p pid="a.1591.0/1">We have had an excellent debate, and it is clear that hon. Members have a range of passionately held views. Tributes to the work done in the other place have come from all sides. For example, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1478" name="Tony Wright">the hon. Member for Cannock Chase (Dr. Wright)</phrase>, who argued passionately for a democratically elected second Chamber, paid his tribute, as did hon. Members, such as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1709" name="Robert Marshall-Andrews">the hon. and learned Member for Medway (Mr. Marshall-Andrews)</phrase>, who want no change at all. They agreed that the Lords does good work and performs an important and well known function. Speaking from the Opposition Front Bench, I should like to echo those sentiments.</p>
	<p pid="a.1591.0/2">For some years, the Conservative party has supported the building of a consensus in favour of a substantially elected second Chamber. That is the view of my right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition, and of his recent predecessors&mdash;<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1782" name="William Hague">my right hon.

	<p pid="a.1591.0/3">Of course, I fully accept that that view is not shared by every Conservative. As he made clear only a moment ago, it is not <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2015" name="Patrick Cormack">the view of my hon. Friend the Member for South Staffordshire (Sir Patrick Cormack)</phrase>, who referred yesterday to a little electoral difficulty of his own. I do not agree with him in this debate, but I should like to wish him well in that struggle. It is not the view of Lord Norton either, but people in this place who have studied and discussed constitutional matters in this place&mdash;and I am thinking of people like my hon. Friends the Members forStone (Mr. Cash) and for Aldridge-Brownhills (Mr. Shepherd)&mdash;have made common cause in t<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1794" name="Kenneth Clarke">his debate with my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.1591.0/4">Again, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1613" name="George Young">my right hon. Friend the Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir George Young)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1821" name="Douglas Hogg">my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham (Mr. Hogg)</phrase> have made common cause with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1818" name="Owen Paterson">my hon. Friend the Member for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson)</phrase>. A substantially elected second Chamber was favoured by the late Eric Forth, and it is supported by me and by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1700" name="Theresa May">my right hon. Friends the Members for Maidenhead (Mrs. May)</phrase> and for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin).</p>
	<p pid="a.1591.0/5">In the debate held on <phrase class="date" code="2003-02-04">4 February 2003</phrase>, Eric Forth said that</p>
	<p pid="a.1591.0/6" class="indent">&quot;we require a legitimate and effective upper Chamber to do what Parliament is expected to do. What puzzles and frustrates me is that so many Members in this House seem to be afraid of that idea. The sad truth is that the main challenge to the Houseof Commons is from the Government.&quot;&mdash;[<i> Official Report</i>,<phrase class="date" code="2003-02-04">4 February 2003</phrase>; Vol. 399, c. 163.]</p>
	<p pid="a.1591.0/7">That point has been made time and again in this debate. It is vitally important that we reform not only the second Chamber but this one as well. I know that my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe intends to bring out proposals to that effect, and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1699" name="Nicholas Winterton">my hon. Friends the Members for Macclesfield (Sir Nicholas Winterton)</phrase> and for Stone spoke about that possibility in the debate. Yesterday, my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham rightly said that we must tackle the problem of the elected dictatorship, about which his father famously spoke so many years ago.</p>

	<p pid="a.1595.3/1">No, I will not. I am still replying to the hon. Member for Tyne Bridge. I have not got long.</p>
	<p pid="a.1595.3/2">In the old days, they used to talk about the old Conservative backwoodsmen. They did not turn up all that often, but they used to sway the votes. That iswhat it would be like in the other place underthe hon. Gentleman's option. The Labour or Blair backwoodsmen&mdash;all those people appointed over the last few years&mdash;would come in to sway the votes and ruin things for a Conservative Government.</p>

	<p pid="a.1597.1/1">No, if the hon. Gentleman will allow me, because I was not really dissenting from him.</p>
	<p pid="a.1597.1/2">May I deal with the amendment in the name of the Leader of the Opposition and the leader of the Liberal Democrat party, and explain why I advise all right hon. and hon. Friends, whatever side of the argument they are on, to vote against it? Under the final motion, we propose</p>
	<p pid="a.1597.1/3" class="indent">&quot;That this House is of the opinion that the remaining retained places for peers whose membership is based on the hereditary principle should be removed.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1597.1/4">We can argue about what will happen once the hereditaries are removed, and the subject will come up in any Bill that is introduced. Some say that we should simply end the by-election system and allow the remaining hereditary peers to sit in the Lords as if they were life peers. I think that there is much merit in that suggestion, but I may be in the minority; others have more radical proposals. The issue will have to be sorted out in cross-party discussions in both this House and the other place. A debate on the subject will take place when the next stage of reform takes place.</p>
	<p pid="a.1597.1/5">The Opposition parties' amendment would add the following words to the end of the motion:</p>
	<p pid="a.1597.1/6" class="indent">&quot;once elected members have taken their places in a reformed House&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1597.1/7">The Opposition parties are wrong to imply, as they do in their amendment&mdash;simply through inadvertence, I think&mdash;that that was no part of what my noble Friend Lord Irvine of Lairg set out in the House of Lords when he announced the agreement that led to retaining only 92 hereditary Lords. What he said is correctly set out in paragraphs 3.27 and 3.28 of the White Paper. The word &quot;election&quot; is not mentioned at all; the words that he used were</p>
	<p pid="a.1597.1/8" class="indent">&quot;until the second stage of House of Lords reform has taken place.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1597.1/9">For the avoidance of doubt, I spoke to my noble Friend, the former Lord Chancellor, this morning, and he authorised me to say that the passage in the White Paper, at paragraphs 3.27 and 3.28, is a correct summary of the position. He went on to say, and I am authorised to repeat, that what was agreed in 1999 implied no guarantee of any particular stage 2. It was just a guarantee that there would be a legislativestage 2. Before the Front Benchers jump up, the reason for that is that the commitment was made even before the royal commission had reported, and still less before there had been White Papers, Public Administration Committee reports and so on.</p>
	<p pid="a.1597.1/10">We are not seeking to play a trick on hon. Members; we accept that the removal of the hereditaries should take place in the context of a Bill that reflects the views of this House, as expressed in the votes today, the views subsequently expressed by those in the other place, and any agreement that we can reach. As a matter of historical record, it is simply not the case that what was said in the other place was linked to the inclusion of elected Members in the House of Lords.</p>

	<p pid="a.1598.0/1">I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for generously giving way. It was absolutely clear from what was said in the other place by the then Lord Chancellor that the hereditary peers would not go until reform of the second Chamber had taken place. Indeed, from what the Leader of the House just said, that is whatthe noble Lord Irvine has confirmed. What the Government are proposing in their motion is that the hereditary peers should go, without reform having taken place. That is the point addressed by the amendment.</p>

	<p pid="a.1598.4/1">I am most grateful to the Leader of the House. He knows that we want to get rid of the hereditaries, and he also knows that we believe that it would be entirely perverse if the House voted againsta fully appointed House this evening, but the Government then created a fully appointed House by removing the hereditaries without introducing a democratic element.</p>

	<p pid="a.1598.5/1">The Government intend to bring forward, after consultation, what I think will be a draft Bill&mdash;that may take time&mdash;that reflects the will of the House and of the other place, as far as we can accommodate them. We will listen with care to what the House of Lords says next week. We have no intention of bringing forward a Bill that simply removes the hereditaries, if the House decides on one of the other alternatives&mdash;on one of options 1 to 8 on the Order Paper. It would be mad of us to do so, because the House would quickly amend it. As a matter of record, it is not the case that my noble Friend Lord Irvine tied the undertaking to having elected Members, and it is important that we are accurate about that.</p>
	<p pid="a.1598.5/2">May I deal with the point raised by many hon. Members about the preferred semi-open list system or semi-closed list system&mdash;I draw particular attention to the hon. Member for Chichester&mdash;that was proposed in the White Paper? I have listened to almost all the46 speeches that have been made in the Chamber. The best that can be said as a summary of the proposalfor the semi-open list system, which has been my preference, is that it is judged as better than the closed-list system, but not much more.</p>
	<p pid="a.1598.5/3">We are bound to take account of the voices in the Chamber and the serious objections that have been raised to that proposal. When right hon. and hon. Members on both sides of the House come to vote, they are not being asked at all to endorse the contents of the White Paper. We could have tabled a resolution&mdash;I thought about it&mdash;endorsing the White Paper. We decided not to do so because that would be too contentious and lead to us disappearing down all kinds of rabbit holes. Instead, we tabled very simple resolutions in terms that are clearly understandable. When the House votes on those resolution, I promise that those words, and those words alone, are all that will be indicated as a result of the vote.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-03-07a.1643.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1622" speakername="Michael Jabez Foster" colnum="1643"  time="019:26:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070307/debtext/70307-0021.htm#070307121003472">
	<p pid="a.1643.1/1">I cannot agree that it is an abdication because I suspect that the Government will be prepared to look again at this issue. However, to date, it is certainly difficult to distinguish what has happened. After this evening, I hope that that situation will change.</p>
	<p pid="a.1643.1/2">Why is the Eurostar argument so acceptable to the Government? Nobody else would seem to have bought it. I suspect that it is because Eurostar has produced a number of facts that are simply wrong. If one starts from the wrong premise, one gets the wrong answer. The first argument that Eurostar makes is that the Brussels to Ashford route is little used. In the last few weeks, I have travelled back from both Brussels and Paris. I know that it is only empirical evidence, but there appear to be scores, if not hundreds, of happy passengers leaving the train at Ashford. Their existence seems to be denied by Eurostar. Why should that be so? I give two reasons. The first is that people simply buy their tickets from London. Why not? It is the same price. As a consequence, those joining at Ashford are perhaps ignored and not counted. Eurostar says that that is not quite right, because it checks things out with customer surveys. I was on the train last Friday and by the time I got on at Ashford, the customer surveys had already been sent round and were being collected back. No-one from Ashford was even in the count.</p>
	<p pid="a.1643.1/3">I must also comment on what I believe to be the disingenuous dissemination of information. The &quot;Count down has begun&quot; booklet is apparently a set of facts that supports Eurostar's case. However, in reality it is nothing of the kind. What it says is often factually incorrect. For example, the publication suggests that the average travel time by car from Hastings to the new Ebbsfleet station&mdash;a distance of some 57 miles&mdash;is1 hour 16 minutes. Dream on. Negotiating the A21 is a nightmare and then as a reward one joins the M25, finally negotiating the M25/M2 junction. Doing that journey in 1 hour 16 minutes would mean seeing a blue light following shortly behind. It may just be possible in the dead of night, but then there would be no trains to catch. It is that sort of disingenuous proposition that has made people so angry. The same goes for the information given by Eurostar for the rail connections. It says that Brighton is within 1 hour 13 minutes of King's Cross Thameslink. In fact, the average timetable shows a journey of between 1 hour 18 minutes and1 hour 46 minutes. That is a considerable difference. The facts are simply wrong.</p>
	<p pid="a.1643.1/4">Why is Ashford so important? Its location 45 miles out of London draws interconnecting road and rail traffic away from areas of chronic congestion around the capital. Ebbsfleet will do the reverse, increasing peak tidal flows. Ebbsfleet has a purpose, but not in attracting the current Ashford traffic. So, what do I want from this evening's debate? I want my hon. Friend the Minister to understand that this is not a cry from the wilderness on behalf of my constituents in Hastings and Rye alone. Although many of my constituents, such as Councillor Godfrey Daniel, Councillor Dominic Sabetian, Neil Perry, Rhoderick Powrie, Trevor Sheldrake, Terry Dorrity, Ann Hamilton, Simon Foster and Mike Turner of Friends of the Earth, are exceedingly exercised, this is a much wider cry than that. It is a cry that has cross-party support, with virtually no dissenting voice. I challenge my hon. Friend to find anyone who supports the Eurostar case. The campaign is currently supported by South East Partners' Brussels office, which represents local authorities across the south-east, by passenger groups on both sides of the tunnel, such as Railfuture and the Marsh Link action group, and by, so far as I am aware, not only the hon. Members who are present this evening, but the vast majority, if not all, of the region's MPs and MEPs.</p>
	<p pid="a.1643.1/5">My hon. Friend should not underestimate the strength of feeling about the preservation of this vital service, with the prosperity, convenience and environment of the south-east at stake. He must not be taken in by the superficial figures that Eurostar offers him to support this dastardly deed.</p>
	<p pid="a.1643.1/6">When I initially secured the debate, I thought that all that I would be able to do would be to ask for the Minister's support in my entreaty to Eurostar. However, according to an article in <i> The Guardian </i>on<phrase class="date" code="2007-02-21">21 February</phrase>, it appears that the Office for National Statistics believes that the British end of Eurostar is effectively under Government control because of the Government's stake in supporting the enterprise. If that is the case, I ask that my hon. Friend not only requests Eurostar to think again, but demands that it does so. In the other place, on <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-08">8 February</phrase>, my noble Friend Lord Bassam confessed to a liking for Ashford, but suggested that the Government could not intervene because the previous Conservative Government had committed the enterprise to the private sector. That might have been the case, but if things have changed and the ONS is right, my hon. Friend has a further opportunity to act.</p>
	<p pid="a.1643.1/7">In the short time available for the debate, it has not been possible to explore in detail all the economic and environmental arguments that are available to those who want Ashford International to prosper, and nor has there been time to dissect the paucity of the Eurostar case on which my hon. Friend might have previously relied. I thus ask my hon. Friend to meet me and a delegation of south-east MPs and MEPs, together with interest groups, so that we can persuade him, if he is not yet already persuaded, that Ashford International must be saved for the south-east of England.</p>

	<p pid="a.1645.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1622" name="Michael Jabez Foster">my hon. Friend the Member for Hastings and Rye (Michael Jabez Foster)</phrase> on securing the debate. I also welcome to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1587" name="Michael Howard">the Chamber the right hon. and learned Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Mr. Howard)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1379" name="Damian Green">the hon. Member for Ashford (Damian Green)</phrase>. Last October, I replied to a debate that the hon. Member for Ashford secured on exactly the same subject, so he might find some of my comments vaguely familiar.</p>
	<p pid="a.1645.0/2">I know how much importance Ashford attaches to its international links, so I am pleased to have the opportunity to explain the development of the channel tunnel rail link, the operation of Eurostar international services and the way in which the Department for Transport is working to ensure that the transport infrastructure is in place for Ashford to fulfil its potential as a growth area. I will try to address the main points raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Hastings and Rye.</p>
	<p pid="a.1645.0/3">I should begin by making it clear that despite our arm's length relationship with Eurostar, which is, after all, a private company, the Government have kept a watching brief on consultations over the timetable changes. In that respect, we have noted with interest the statement from the leader of the council and chair of Ashford's future delivery board, Councillor Paul Clokie. He said:</p>
	<p pid="a.1645.0/4" class="indent">&quot;We are of course disappointed at the decision to reduce the number of international train services from Ashford by Eurostar&quot;;</p>
	<p pid="a.1645.0/5">but he went on to add:</p>
	<p pid="a.1645.0/6" class="indent">&quot;Ashford remains one of the few places in England from where Paris and Brussels can be reached via a high-speed rail link within just two hours. The new proposed timetable includes early morning and evening trains which will meet the demands of many existing and new business and leisure passengers.&quot;</p>

	<p pid="a.1646.1/1">I note that the hon. Gentleman wishes to intervene. I suspect that we are about to replicate the exchange that we had in October. I do not wantto suggest that Councillor Clokie supported the diminution in services from Ashford. I simply make the point that he can tell that the high-speed rail link will have a major economic benefit for Ashford, despite the reduction in services.</p>

	<p pid="a.1646.3/1">I accept the hon. Gentleman's point, but of course, it will still be possible to travel by train from Ashford to Brussels, although a change of train will be necessary.</p>
	<p pid="a.1646.3/2">I do not want to dwell for too long on the borough council's views, but it is worth highlighting another point that it has made. It sees the provision of the new high-speed domestic service as being just as important to Ashford's economic growth as the international links. The council anticipates that the high-speed link will lead to additional demand for Eurostar services from Ashford in the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.1646.3/3">To move on to Eurostar and its operations, it is important to be clear that the Government have no formal powers over Eurostar's operational decisions, and that Eurostar is at liberty to set its own timetables, although it has an obligation to operate on a sound commercial business. It cannot be accused of ignoring the views that have been put to it. Following the consultation with Kent county council, Eurostar agreed to introduce an additional stop at Lille on the daily service to Disneyland, to provide Ashford with a connection to Brussels. Following consultation with Ashford borough council, the company agreed to revise the timing of the first departure to Paris to suit local people better. Eurostar is continuing its dialogue with Kent county council, which is the statutory transport authority, and it has shared and explained the research and analysis undertaken on developing future stopping patterns.</p>
	<p pid="a.1646.3/4">My hon. Friend the Member for Hastings and Rye and the hon. Member for Ashford have made comments about the Government's lack of action and intervention. Following representations made last autumn by right hon. and hon. Members on both sides of the House, including the hon. Member for Ashford and the right hon. and learned Member for Folkestone and Hythe, I discussed with Richard Brown, the chief executive of Eurostar, what options existed for maintaining a direct, if reduced, service from Ashford to Brussels following the opening of Ebbsfleet. So far, that intervention has had no effect. I share the disappointment felt by my hon. Friend the Member for Hastings and Rye and other right hon. and hon. Members about the fact that all direct services from Ashford to Brussels will cease, and about the fact that the various stakeholders in the area have not come up with a reasonable package to support even a reduced service.</p>
	<p pid="a.1646.3/5">It is worth mentioning that Eurostar remains committed to Ashford in at least one respect: it will retain its contact centre in the town, which provides employment for some 300 people. From the date of the opening of Ebbsfleet station this autumn, Eurostar will have 16 or 17 trains a day from London to Paris, and 10 to Brussels. Seven of the Paris trains and five of the Brussels trains will stop at Ebbsfleet. The opening of Ebbsfleet has led Eurostar to review its overall stopping patterns to reflect the expected future demand at the two stations in Kent. As a consequence, Ashford will retain three of its six trains a day to Paris, as well as a weekly service which goes to Avignon in the summer and the French Alps in the winter. Those destinations mean that 83 per cent. of current demand for direct services at Ashford will continue to be met.</p>
	<p pid="a.1646.3/6">As I mentioned earlier, the daily Disney train will, in future, also stop at Lille to provide a TGV connection to Brussels. I accept that there may be some remaining demand for a direct service between Ashford and Brussels that will not be met by the alternative arrangements.</p>

	<p pid="a.1648.1/1">I emphasise that I am not a spokesman for Eurostar, but it seems eminently sensible that when Eurostar is calculating journey times and using them as a way of attracting a particular market, it must ensure that those journey times are as low as possible. If Eurostar has made a commercial calculation that stopping every train from Ebbsfleet at Ashford will result in lost revenue because passengers will choose to travel by air rather than by train, that is a valid commercial judgment which we should expect it to make.</p>
	<p pid="a.1648.1/2">Eurostar's research has shown that up to two thirds of the passengers who currently travel to Ashford will find Ebbsfleet equally or more convenient. Ebbsfleet will be served by international trains to Paris, Brussels and Lille. Eurostar believes that, following the opening of Ebbsfleet, the residual number of passengers wishing to travel from Ashford to Brussels will be less than 20 per train, too few commercially to justify a direct service. There is a serious threat that stopping Eurostar services at Ashford as well as Ebbsfleet will extend journey times, to the extent that more passengers would be lost than would be gained&mdash;a point that I have just made, thanks to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1680" name="Norman Baker">the intervention from the hon. Member for Lewes (Norman Baker)</phrase>. The majority of Eurostar customers will travel from St. Pancras, so it is important that journey times are not adversely affected by additional stops for a small number of passengers.</p>
	<p pid="a.1648.1/3">It has been argued by my hon. Friend the Member for Hastings and Rye that one result of the changes will be to encourage passengers who would normally join trains at Ashford to divert to Ebbsfleet, increasing car use and causing congestion on major roads in north-west Kent. It is worth noting that some 90 per cent. of Ashford Eurostar customers travel to the station by car, and that more than half of those drive from outside the county. Ebbsfleet will be more convenient and nearer to most of those customers, and so will reduce total car use.</p>
	<p pid="a.1648.1/4">It is also worth noting that more than 500,000 people per week currently visit Bluewater shopping centre, very close to Ebbsfleet. Ebbsfleet itself, by contrast, will be used by fewer than 25,000 per week. Locally, major improvements to the strategic road network have been carried out to reduce the impact of new traffic flows, and congestion will be minimal.</p>
	<p pid="a.1648.1/5">I emphasise that I understand my hon. Friend's concerns and the concerns expressed by the right hon. and learned Member for Folkestone and Hythe and the hon. Member for Ashford, as well as the hon. Member for Lewes. I know that there is genuine concern in these constituencies that Eurostar's proposals mean that the area is being left with a substandard service. I hope that I have, although I suspect that I have not, been able to reassure hon. Members that most of the demand from Ashford will continue to be met, that there is scope to review services to Ashford in the future in the light of future changes in demand, and that concentrating services at Ebbsfleet, but not to the exclusion of Ashford, makes sense commercially, in environmental terms, and from the point of view of providing the best possible international rail service to the greatest number of passengers.</p>
	<p pid="a.1648.1/6">Let me conclude by informing my hon. Friend that I would be more than happy to meet him and a delegation of parliamentary colleagues and other interested parties if he believes that that would be useful. I have already stated that I have made at least one intervention with Eurostar on this subject; whether I will be in a position to be able to do so in future to any positive benefit remains a question as yet unanswered.</p>
	<p pid="a.1648.1/7" class="italic"> Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="a.1648.1/8" class="italic"> Adjourned accordingly at five minutes to Eight o'clock.</p>
