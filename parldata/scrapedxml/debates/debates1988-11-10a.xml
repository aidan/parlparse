<p>To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland how many flues in houses owned by the Northern Ireland Housing Executive have been relined during the past five years; and what is the projection of numbers for the period up to 31 March 1990.</p>

<p>The chairman of the Northern Ireland Housing Executive tells me that records exist only for the last four years, during which 11,157 flues were relined in specific upgrading programmes. A further 4,285 are expected to be relined by the end of March 1990. Other relinings are carried out in comprehensive improvement programmes, but separate figures are not available.</p>

<p>I thank the Minister for that reply, but he must be aware that many people have purchased their Housing Executive homes through Government encouragement. Is he aware that, unfortunately, many of those people have defective chimneys due to the flawed rubber sausage method which is used to repair defective flues? As many people are financially unable to have those defects remedied, I ask the Minister, especially in the interests of health, to agree to have those chimneys repaired, either by direct labour or by grant-aid.</p>

<p>As much as I should like to help the hon. Gentleman's constituents with the problems caused by their flues, the fact is that they bought the houses from the Housing Executive. If they bought the houses under conditions which were not for any particular reason made clear to them, they can of course take legal action, as I believe some already have. However, the principle of

caveat emptor has to be maintained and, of course, it is really up to the purchaser to sort out the matter with the Housing Executive.</p>

<p>Will the hon. Gentleman keep in mind the great hardship that occurs when this alteration is carried out, as many people have had to leave their homes because of the state of their bedrooms and living-rooms? The workmanship has not been of the best standard in many instances. Will he urge the Housing Executive, when it alters the remaining flues, to ensure that proper facilities are provided while the alteration is carried out, and that compensation for the loss of furniture, carpets, curtains and facilities is paid quickly and properly?</p>

<p>I shall, of course, bring the hon. Gentleman's points before the chairman of the Housing Executive. I am sure he will agree that everything possible should be done to make certain that the tenants are adequately looked after while those operations are undertaken. I should say, perhaps, that the cost involved is &#x00A3;600 to &#x00A3;700. Although I realise that it is an imposition, it is still a fairly small amount of money in comparison with the value of the home.</p>

<p>Will the Minister confirm that the Northern Ireland Housing Executive was responsible for the original design of the flues installed in these houses? Are thousands of houses in my constituency having flues relined because there was an inherent design fault in the original system, and are people at risk for as long as those defective flues are not repaired?</p>

<p>It is because the flues are defective that the Housing Executive is undertaking this programme throughout its stock&#x2014;as quickly as possible. If, of course, the Housing Executive is at fault because of the design, the owners or tenants should take it up with the Housing Executive or go through the courts.</p>

<p>It is not our wish to introduce measures that will offend against the theology or conscience of anyone in the Province, but we do not believe that such a charge could be laid against the plans for integrated education&#x2014;provided that that is what the parents want for their children. So far we have been encouraged by the responses of the churches to this new and significant initiative.</p>

<p>No matter what opposition may come from the churches, and despite any stalling, will the Minister press ahead relentlessly to purge religious apartheid from the schools in Northern Ireland?

<p>I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his kind words and for his many years of strong support for integrated education in the Province.

<p>Does the Minister acknowledge that, prior to this initiative, there was already a high level of integrated education in certain sectors in Northern Ireland?

<p>No, I do not accept that in the past there were strong integrated education facilities in the Province. Of course the hon. Gentleman is absolutely right in saying that, at a number of schools, pupils from both sides of the community are educated together, but he knows that such schools represent a small minority.<br/>
I agree with the hon. Gentleman that, in law, all schools in Northern Ireland are open to any pupil of any or no religious faith. I look to the hon. Gentleman and his colleagues for support in giving parents the choice and the right to choose, which demonstrably so many parents in the Province want.</p>

<p>Since I last answered questions in the House on 28 July, 38 people have been killed in incidents in Northern Ireland arising from the security situation. This includes the eight off-duty soldiers brutally murdered near Omagh. Against this background I have recently been carrying out a detailed and comprehensive review of security measures in conjunction with the Chief Constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary and the General Officer Commanding the Army in Northern Ireland.<br/>
The security forces have shown great skill and courage in their defence of the community. The House will be aware of their successes in recent days in preventing a number of serious attacks and making a number of arrests. So far this year 308 people have been charged with serious offences, including 16 with murder. Almost 500 weapons, some 89,000 rounds of ammunition and more than 9,000 lb of explosives have been recovered. In addition the Garda Siochana has recovered 290 weapons, about 140,000 rounds of ammunition and more than 1,100 lb of explosives.</p>

<p>In the light of the Secretary of State's catalogue of atrocities in our Province, does he agree that it is far from peace, stability and reconciliation? Let us bear in mind the recent murder of a constituent of mine, Reserve Constable McCrone in county Fermanagh, and the massive find of bomb material. I congratulate the police officer who found it on his alertness, which has helped to save the Province from another onslaught by the IRA.<br/>

<p>The hon. Gentleman knows as well as all other hon. Members from Northern Ireland the many steps that have been taken in recent months by the security forces, some of which have undoubtedly contributed to the recent successes. No one can be ignorant of the greatly enhanced activity. I told the House that we would be examining the number of measures that might be taken. The House approved one of them on Tuesday night. I have tried to help the security forces in such a way that if they bring people suspected of serious crimes to court, they will have a good chance of getting convictions. I am also concerned that the guilty should receive the proper punishment for their crimes.</p>

<p>With regard to last night's bomb attack on women and children in the Army homes complex near Londonderry, however desirable it may be to extend the protection accorded to such targets, is that not starting at the wrong end?

<p>Does my right hon. Friend understand that a significant factor in the continuing insecurity in Northern Ireland is uncertainty about its constitutional future? Why does he persist in denying Members of this House, including the elected representatives of the people of Northern Ireland, the right to amend proposed legislation affecting Northern Ireland? Why does my right hon. Friend not follow the policy set out in the 1979 Conservative party manifesto and set up a regional council in Northern Ireland with widely devolved powers over local matters?<br/>
Finally, does my right hon. Friend understand that his continued assertion that Northern Ireland is part of the United Kingdom would be accepted more readily in Northern Ireland and elsewhere if we truly governed Northern Ireland like the rest of the kingdom?</p>

<p>I always respect my hon. Friend's sincerity in these matters. There is no insecurity about the position of Northern Ireland, except that caused by many people who keep talking about uncertainty. The Government's position is clear, and so is that of the House, which has voted overwhelmingly for it. There will be no change in the status of Northern Ireland as part of the United Kingdom without the agreement of a majority in Northern Ireland. I have confidence in that majority and I often wish that more people who raise this point shared my confidence in it. That view, moreover, is overwhelmingly supported by successive Irish Governments. There is no question of insecurity.<br/>
In response to my hon. Friend's second point, I hope that there will be legislation that Northern Ireland Members and hon. Members from elsewhere will have a chance to amend. Without anticipating the Queen's Speech, I suggest to my hon. Friend that he may find plenty of opportunities in the coming Session.</p>

<p>My right hon. Friend has said that Northern Ireland is presently recognised as part of the United Kingdom. Unfortunately, the Anglo-Irish Agreement simply confirms Northern Irleland's existing constitutional status, but under Irish law the Province is part of the Irish Republic. My right hon. Friend has gained nothing from that exchange. I suggest to my right hon. Friend that if he wants to keep terrorists out of sight and out of the way during the emergency, he should institute a sentence of imprisonment for the duration of the emergency and not release any terrorists to go back on to the streets and commit terrorist crimes again.</p>

<p>I note what my hon. Friend says and will not comment further on his last point. The first part of his question makes my point absolutely. Here is a lawyer arguing and sowing in the minds of Northern Ireland people doubt and insecurity that does not exist. Everybody knows that the reality of the agreement is quite clear. There will be no change in the status of Northern Ireland without the agreement of a majority. If my hon. Friend does not know the present status of Northern Ireland, everybody else does, and its status will remain as it is unless a majority want to change it.</p>

<p>I congratulate the chairman of the Conservative party and the Secretary of State on yesterday's comments. May I raise with the Secretary of State the important matter of security at married quarters, about which the hon. Member for Mid-Ulster (Rev. William McCrea) spoke? There is concern that women and children should be properly protected. It is particularly nasty that within the anniversary of what happened at Enniskillen this attack should have been considered. Can the Secretary of State give confidence to the House that the necessary security measures will be taken to protect married quarters in Northern Ireland?

<p>I am glad to see that the hon. Gentleman has signed up to articles 1(a) and 1(b). I will settle for that. Those articles in the Anglo-Irish Agreement show the reality of the situation and I see no prospect of their changing. The hon. Gentleman's first point is a serious one. The House will share my disgust at last night's attack. It is further confirmation that, for the IRA, women and children are fair game. I continue to ask myself what sort of cause can be furthered, or what credit or ambition can be built up for the future, by trampling over the bodies of women and children. I hope that the House will treat, as I do, the statements by the IRA and the attack with the contempt that they deserve. I assure the hon.

<p>The Government believe firmly that privatisation provides the best prospects for Harland and Wolff to achieve long-term viability and it is therefore our intention to return the company to the private sector. The breakdown in negotiations with Mr. Tikkoo was a disappointment, but discussions are continuing with other interested parties. The company chairman, John Parker, is also examining the feasibility of a management-employee buy out and this, too, will receive detailed consideration.<br/>
With regard to Ministry of Defence work, I have made it clear that a privately-owned Harland and Wolff will be free to bid for future contracts. The eligibility of the company for such work would be assessed by the Ministry of Defence in the normal way.</p>

<p>I hope that the Minister will accept that Mr. Tikkoo is to be congratulated on discussing with the Government for so long the possible purchase of Harland and Wolff. However, he should remember that the only thing that Mr. Tikkoo wished to do in the first place was to have a ship built at Harland and Wolff. Why have the Government made it virtually impossible for a publicly-owned Harland and Wolff to do three things: first, to react in a positive fashion to the Tikkoo bid; secondly, to tender for Ministry of Defence work; and, thirdly, to react to the ban on the proposed building of the &#x00A3;8 million dredger, put forward by the south coast shipping company. Surely even the Minister recognises that a publicly-owned company which obtained at least two of the three orders would be far more attractive to the private sector than Harland and Wolff is at present.</p>

<p>We gave every possible support to Mr. Tikkoo in his approach to build the Ultimate Dream cruiseliner and to acquire the yard. That was the basis on which he was content to negotiate. I ask the hon. Gentleman not to sell short the Government's efforts. The Government are in close negotiation with prospective purchasers of Harland and Wolff. It is an integral part of our discussions that substantial orders will be placed with the yard forthwith. If successful, the negotiations will secure the future of the yard and its order book for many years. That is the goal towards which Ministers are working.</p>

<p>The Minister has avoided the question of Ministry of Defence contracts. Will he tell the House why Harland and Wolff was prevented by his Department from tendering for the Ministry of Defence contract for the aviation support ship?

Will Harland and Wolff be allowed to tender for Ministry of Defence work while it is still in the public sector?</p>

<p>I have made it clear that it is obviously not sensible at this critical stage to proceed with other prospective ship orders, as they could be inconsistent with the shipbuilding plans of a new owner.<br/>

<p>How many customers have been put off and how many potential orders has Harland and Wolff not been permitted to tender for because of this mailed fist, or even blackmail, policy that has been used to push through privatisation?

<p>The Government have supported Harland and Wolff to the tune of &#x00A3;260 million in the past five years alone. That demonstrates their determination to support the yard.

<p>The Minister has not explained to the House why he believes that Harland and Wolff would be more attractive with empty order books than with full ones. Is it not the case that Harland and Wolff was excluded from the early stages of the MOD contracts for the AOR vessels? Why does he now seek to ensure that Harland and Wolff will not win that &#x00A3;8 million order and the yard will be sacrificed on the Government's mad ideology on privatisation?</p>

<p>Will the Secretary of State confirm that, in the border brigade area, primacy of operational decision has passed, or been taken, from the police and given to the Army?

<p>If they are, they have not told me. The hon. Gentleman's ingenious question deviates considerably from the real situation. There is no change in the position on police primacy. The Chief Constable has responsibility for operational matters and the Army works in support of the civil power, but in certain respects in the border brigade, and in operations against terrorism, the Chief Constable has delegated certain operational responsibilities and authority to the Army. The Army acts under his authority. That is the position. It is quite clear, it has my full support, and I, the Chief Constable and the GOC keep it under close review.</p>

<p>In terms of attempted terrorist incidents, that is not actually correct. However, I draw the attention of the House to the great energy and determination of the security forces.

<p>When the Secretary of State talks to the GOC, does he recollect that each time he comes to the House to report on the security situation in Northern Ireland he produces a long and sad catalogue of deaths? He also produces a never-ending catalogue of arms and explosives found. Will he remind the GOC that if we could have continuity of frontier operations we would have a much greater chance of reducing the easy flow of arms and explosives from the Irish Republic into Northern Ireland? Since 92 per cent. of IRA murders are unresolved through the courts, does the right hon. Gentleman discuss with the GOC the need to dismantle the command and control structures of the IRA?

<p>The answer that I gave to the hon. Member for Mid-Ulster (Rev.

I am seeking ways in which some of the objectives defined by the hon. Gentleman can be achieved. I am anxious to improve cross-border co-operation and make more effective the work of the Garda Siochana and the Irish Army working in support of it. Those are some measures that can help.

<p>Obviously, deaths of or injuries to any innocent people are deeply regretted. I do not think that there is any serious argument about the purpose of the terrorists killed in that attack. It was a miracle that there were no serious casualties among the security forces. We are often attacked by people who say that the procedures do not properly scrutinise the rule of law and the pursuit of the rule of law. It is worth remembering, as the hon. Gentleman knows, that what I reported on that occasion was the outcome of the scrutiny procedure. Every time a death is suffered by the security forces it is subject to close scrutiny and is the subject of a report to the Director of Public Prosecutions. That shows how we seek at all times to ensure that the rule of law is upheld.</p>

<p>The draft Police and Criminal Evidence Order substantially overhauls and rationalises the general criminal law in Northern Ireland and reflects provisions enacted for England and Wales in the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984.

<p>I made it quite clear that I was grateful to General Jaruzelski for ensuring that I was able to go wheresoever I chose in Poland to see whomsoever I chose to see, to have discussions and talks, not only with Solidarity, but with many independent people, who were able to put their views to me. I was extremely grateful for that. One problem with Solidarity is that there is no other expression of opposition on an organised basis in Poland. Things will be much better when there is a visible focus for people to make their own views known, which will be of great value to the Government. The round table is perhaps the first attempt to try to secure such a forum.</p>

<p>It would probably be kinder not to comment on the business shambles proposed for tomorrow&#x2014;<i>[Interruption.]</i>&#x2014;but as the Chancellor of the Exchequer is apparently prepared to defend himself on television and radio and to give partial information to newspapers about what he did or did not say last Friday, why have the Cabinet refused to provide time to debate the motion criticising the Chancellor which has been tabled in the names of my right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition and others? Is it that the Chancellor is afraid to come and face the music, or are the rest of the Cabinet afraid what he might let slip when trying to defend what he said he did not say? It is not unusual for the Opposition to call for a vote of no confidence in a Chancellor, but it is a rare event for a Cabinet to pass one, yet that is what we have seen today.<br/>
Will the Leader of the House therefore reconsider his decision, or try to get his Cabinet colleagues to reconsider their decision, so that we can debate this important motion, because this matter will not go away? Whatever happens before the Queen's Speech, this issue will not be allowed to rest by us. We believe that the Leader of the House owes it to the Chancellor, to the pensioners who are perturbed about the threat of means testing and to the journalists involved, whose integrity has been thrown into question by the Chancellor, to have that debate, and to have it soon.</p>

<p>The Chancellor of the Exchequer has answered a private notice question in the House and spoken about events outside the House, but I have considered the early-day motion in the name of the Leader of the Opposition. As Leader of the House I must have regard for the views of the whole House. The business that I have announced for Monday is important, and many hon. Members have an interest in it. If the Opposition wish to pursue the question of a debate on their early-day motion, there will be opportunities in the new Session for them to do so.<br/>
I do not accept for a moment what the hon. Gentleman said about the guillotine motion or the Government's legislative programme. As Leader of the House I have to take into account the views of all hon. Members, and it was clear last night that the arrangements between the Government and the official Opposition for dealing with the Housing Bill were not acceptable to the House as a whole. In those circumstances, I was doubtful whether the proposal to take the School Boards (Scotland) Bill would be generally acceptable. That is why I have arranged for the House to have an opportunity tomorrow to debate and reach a final decision on the future handling of both those Bills.<br/>
What the hon. Gentleman said about the Government's legislative programme is complete nonsense. Thirty-four pieces of Government legislation have already received Royal Assent this Session and another two have completed all their stages. The fact is that this Government have succeeded far better than the Labour Government ever did in bringing to completion an extensive and popular legislative programme, and Opposition Members do not like it.</p>

<p>Will the Leader of the House arrange for an emergency debate on Monday


on the Hinkley Point C inquiry? The inquiry is proceeding with a great deal of haste, which is denying objectors their rights to submit proofs of evidence. The inspector has announced that the closure date for submitting proofs of evidence will be in the next week or so, yet objectors are expected to comment both on economic evaluations for nuclear power and fossil fuels and on the Government's proposed legislation for the privatisation of the electricity industry. There is great worry in the country, especially in the west country, about nuclear power.

<i>[That this House unreservedly condemns Jaguar management for the sacking of Transport and General Workers Union convenor Tommy Wheeler who, at 18 months from retirement, was dismissed on Friday 4th November for alleged 'gross industrial misconduct'; regards Jaguar bosses' excuse that his 'crime' was not to ask permission for use of a photocopier on union business, although they have accepted this had always been given in the past, as vindictive in the extreme; questions whether the management took their action because the item Mr. Wheeler was photocopying was the regular parliamentary report of the honourable Member for Coventry South East, which contained allegations that during a six week period towards the end of 1987, 17 shop floor workers at Browns Lane had died of strokes and stress-induced illnesses&#x2014;or whether the company is trying to provoke strikes at the plant in order to ease their cash flow by loss of production and non-payment of wages; and fully supports the industrial action by Jaguar workers in defence of Mr. Wheeler, whose sacking is the latest in a list of victimisations of car industry convenors in Birmingham and Coventry.]</i><br/>
The motion is about the latest vindictive sacking of a car industry convener in the midlands&#x2014;Tommy Wheeler of Jaguar in Coventry. Would not a debate on that allow us to examine Jaguar's real reasons for dismissing him? Was he really sacked for 20p worth of photocopying paper &#x2014;albeit paper containing part of a report that I had done on the increase of stress-induced illnesses and deaths in Jaguar, which has lost &#x00A3;20 million of car production this week? Or was Jaguar trying to intimidate trade unions in order to ease its cash flow problems stemming from the declining dollar and to prevent discussion among trade unionists of this appalling increase in illness and deaths at the plant?</p>

<p>With permission, Mr. Speaker, I should like to make a further statement about the disastrous fire at King's Cross underground station on 18 November 1987. I am publishing today as a Command Paper the report by Mr. Desmond Fennell QC on his investigation under the Regulation of Railways Act 1889 into the causes and circumstances of this terrible disaster. The House will join me in renewing on this occasion our expressions of condolence to the bereaved and sympathy and best wishes to the injured.<br/>
The House will also join in paying tribute to the many people in the emergency services, the staff of London Underground, the public, and the doctors and nurses who showed courage and dedication and gave help in this disaster. I repeat in particular Mr. Fennell's words that a large number of members of the London fire brigade behaved with conspicuous courage and devotion to duty. He particularly mentions station officer Townsley, who died a hero's death, and also the great courage shown by police constable Hanson of the British Transport police, which must have enabled many people to escape with their lives.<br/>
Mr. Fennell has concluded that the fire was started by a discarded match falling into accumulated grease and debris on the track of the escalator, and that it accelerated up the trench of the escalator until it burst into the booking hall causing the deaths of 31 people.<br/>
Mr. Fennell has made 157 recommendations. He regards 33 of these as most important and a further 59 as important. Action is of course already under way on many of them. Many of the recommendations require specific action by London Underground Ltd. to prevent a recurrence. They do, of course, include the most urgent removal of wooden panelling from escalators. I have asked London Regional Transport to have all these recommendations dealt with promptly. Considerable amounts will have to be spent. The plans announced by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer on 1 November already provide in full for all the proposals already put to me for spending on underground safety totalling &#x00A3;266 million over the next three years.<br/>
The investigation has shown major shortcomings requiring a new approach to safety management and fire prevention in the underground and specific safety audits by London Regional Transport. I am calling on both bodies to put urgently into effect new arrangements recommended by Mr. Fennell.<br/>
An enhanced approach is also required from the Railway Inspectorate and I have discussed Mr. Fennell's recommendations with the chairman of the Health and Safety Commission. I have every reason to expect that the present recruiting campaign will bring the inspectorate fully up to complement by the end of January. It will need to be further strengthened for the tasks that Mr. Fennell identifies, including the use of the powers of the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 to enforce measures needed for the safety of passengers on the Underground and, I must add, on other railways. The chief inspecting officer of railways is now organising a special investigation of London Underground with support from the Health


and Safety Executive. It will examine the safety management systems and monitor the implementation of planned safety measures, and will be completed in March.<br/>
The lessons of this report go wider than London Underground and London Regional Transport. I have today written to the chairman of the British Railways Board inviting the board to consider the lessons of Mr. Fennell's report for the management and audit of safety. Letters are also being sent to the chairman of the passenger transport authorities in Tyne and Wear and in Strathclyde.<br/>
My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary will shortly bring forward regulations under section 12 of the Fire Precautions Act 1971 to require specific measures at Underground stations. This is the speediest means to introduce enforceable standards without uncertainty. The railway operators and fire authorities will be consulted on them. My right hon. Friend is commissioning special studies of the best methods to control the spread of smoke. These present difficult technical problems.<br/>
There are also lessons for the emergency services. Copies of the report are being sent to the London fire brigade and London ambulance service. I shall be considering its implications for the British Transport police, and my right hon. Friends concerned will be considering its implications for the emergency services for which they have responsibilities.<br/>
I have to deal with two particular matters. As regards the costs of representation at the investigation, after taking into account the special circumstances of this case, I am accepting in full Mr. Fennell's recommendations.<br/>
Secondly, on the position of individuals, following the fire, Sir Keith Bright offered to resign as chairman and chief executive of London Regional Transport. I asked him to stay during a difficult period, and he did. He has asked me again to accept his resignation, and I have now done so. Dr. Tony Ridley is a member of the board of London Regional Transport, and the chairman and chief executive of London Underground Ltd. He also has given me his resignation, which I have accepted. I shall make fresh appointments in due course, and meanwhile Sir Neil Shields, who is a member of the board of London Regional Transport, has at my request agreed to take on the chairmanship.<br/>
I conclude by expressing to Mr. Fennell and his assessors my warm thanks for a very full and thorough investigation. We must all ensure that the lessons of this tragedy are fully learnt and fully applied. The Government will play their full part to ensure that they are followed up as quickly and as vigorously as possible.</p>

<speech hansard_id="591514" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1988-11-10a.499.0" hansard_membership_id="157" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/3193" speakername="Mr. John Prescott" colnum="499" time="16:09:00">
<p>On behalf of the Opposition, may I express our condolences to the bereaved and join in the tributes to the bravery shown by the people in our emergency services during this terrible tragedy. I congratulate Mr. Fennell on his report and recommendations. The inquiry was limited by the terms of reference laid down by the Secretary of State and that prevented a fuller examination of the real causes of this tragedy. Those causes included the climate created in London Underground Ltd. by the obsession with reducing costs through the continuous reduction of manpower and resources affecting safety, and the need for the responsibility for Underground safety to be transferred to the independent Health and Safety Commission.<br/>
Clearly one would like to have had the report for the three weeks that it has been available to the Secretary of

State. I hope that he will confirm that there will be an early opportunity to debate the report and its implications for the future. The report makes clear that the responsibility for the monumental failure to provide the adequate safety standards that the travelling public have a right to expect lies directly with the highest level of management which enthusiastically implemented such a disastrous policy. There will be few regrets among Opposition Members at the departure of that management.<br/>
Can the Secretary of State inform the House in more detail of his reasons for refusing Sir Keith's offer to resign immediately after the tragedy? Was that refusal based on the fact that Sir Keith and Dr. Ridley successfully achieved the policy objectives of increasing revenue and of reducing costs, staffing and subsidies spelt out in a letter of 20 July 1984 by the present Secretary of State for the Environment to the chairman, Sir Keith Bright? In that letter there is no mention of the importance of obtaining the high levels of safety that are necessary in a public transport undertaking. That letter is a disgrace and was a contributing factor to this terrible tragedy. Sir Keith Bright's success in agreeing to reach these objectives presumably influenced the Government to recommend him for his knighthood.<br/>
Does the Secretary of State accept that, as the inquiry report shows, there exists among London Underground management a feeling that the financial climate ruled out proposals to increase spending in certain areas? These clearly involve the vital areas of safety, equipment, maintenance and staffing which were subordinated to the overall objective of increasing revenue and reducing subsidy as required by the Government. Would it not have been better to use those subsidies for the investment in safety that the Secretary of State now proposes in his statement? Does he agree that that would have been better than saving money for the Treasury? If those subsidies had been used earlier, the tragedy might have been prevented.<br/>
Is the Secretary of State aware that, since this terrible tragedy, there have been four fires per week to which the London fire brigade has been called, and a serious fire every two weeks within the London underground system? What reassurance can he offer to the House that proper precautions are being taken to avoid such disasters? Is he aware of the growing safety fears of Underground passengers, as detailed in the <i>Evening Standard</i> poll last Friday?<br/>
Will the Secretary of State now accept that the institutional changes in the safety responsibilities that he has just mentioned will not be accepted as sufficient by Opposition Members? His promise to bring his Department's safety inspectors up to the proper level is an indictment of his Department's attitude to the enforcement of safety in this matter. Will he now seriously consider the possibility of transferring the responsibility for underground safety matters from his Department's Railway Inspectorate to the independent Health and Safety Commission?<br/>
Finally, does the right hon. Gentleman accept that, as Secretary of State for Transport, he and his predecessors bear a great deal of responsibility for this disaster? His predecessor&#x2014;the right hon. Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury (Mr. Ridley), now Secretary of State for the Environment&#x2014;assured me in the House that, in transferring responsibility for London Transport from elected London representatives to himself, the Secretary of State for Transport would be directly responsible and accountable for safety matters. Will he now accept that


responsibility by following the example set by London Underground's most senior managers and tender his own resignation?</p>

<p>The Act sets out the framework of duties. It is typical of the hon. Gentleman that he should misrepresent my right hon. Friend's attitude. If I am to be told that the Underground was better run when it was under the control of the Greater London council, I shall ask the House to bear in mind the level of investment at that time which led to great neglect of the Underground and which has taken a long time to remedy.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman asked a number of other questions. He implied that the fire was the fault of the Government as they had reduced costs. The inspector stated:
<q>In my judgement there is no evidence that the overall level of subsidy available to London Regional Transport was inadequate to finance necessary safety-related spending and maintain safety standards.</q>
The House will have the chance to study that paragraph. <i>[Interruption.]</i> On the contrary, I have quoted the sentence and the paragraph. The inspector went on to say:
<q>I accept the evidence of the most senior management in London Regional Transport and London Underground that if funds were needed, funds were available.</q>
<i>[Interruption.]</i> If I do, my case will become stronger, not weaker. I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman has taken that tone in this sad and difficult situation.</p>

<p>First, I thank the Secretary of State for his courtesy in supplying me with a copy of the report earlier this afternoon.<br/>
I wish to pursue the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott). Will the right hon. Gentleman confirm that the Act setting up London Regional Transport urges it to bear in mind economy, efficiency and safety? What were the senior management of London Transport to make of an 838-word letter from the right hon. Gentleman's predecessor, the right hon. Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury (Mr. Ridley), which talked only of economy and efficiency and said not a word about safety? Surely they were to conclude that economy and efficiency were more important than safety.<br/>
Does the Secretary of State accept responsibility for the shortcomings of his Department's Railway Inspectorate, which knowingly deployed only one health and safety officer to police the whole of the London Underground and British Rail southern region together? Were he or his Ministers aware that his railway inspectors were insisting on higher safety standards in Hong Kong and Singapore than they were demanding of London Underground?<br/>
Finally, it was accepted at the inquiry that Ministers were responsible for safety policy. Will the Secretary of State therefore tell us to which Ministers the chief inspector was referring on day 79 of the inquiry when he stated that Ministers had criticised the Railway Inspectorate for making too many safety demands on London Underground? Will he tell us, from the evidence in the review of the Railway Inspectorate, published in April 1987, who decided that the inspectorate should not check on the maintenance of operating equipment? If any of the Ministers concerned are still in post, surely they should follow the example set by Dr. Bright and Dr. Ridley&#x2014;and, I hope, the other Ridley&#x2014;and resign.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend the Minister of State gave the hon. Gentleman a full written answer on his last point only the other day. No such instruction as he describes was given.<br/>
As regards the letter written by my right hon. Friend, the House can see from written answers exactly what my right hon. Friend said. The London Regional Transport Act 1984 states that London Regional Transport should have due regard to
<q>efficiency, economy and safety of operation.</q>
That is not qualified by anything later in the Act.<br/>
When my right hon. Friend wrote his letter of objectives to the chairman, at the beginning of the letter he said:
<q>The Act sets the framework of duties for you".</q>
It is crystal clear that he meant that the organisation should pay attention to efficiency, economy and safety of operation.<br/>
Mr. Fennell made some remarks about and criticisms of the Railway Inspectorate. He said that there was not enough "creative tension" between the inspectorate and the Underground. I accept that fully. We must learn the lessons for the future. Four actions have been taken. First, the Railway Inspectorate is setting up a special team with help from the Health and Safety Executive and the London fire brigade to examine the Underground safety management systems and monitor the implementation of the necessary action. Secondly, I have asked the chairman of the Health and Safety Commission for his views on the report. Thirdly, I expect to fill all gaps in the complement

<p>Will my right hon.Friend confirm that the tragedy is unique in 60 years of the operation of the London Underground? Will he also confirm that Mr. Fennell's report establishes that the cause was nothing to do with a lack of investment or personnel? Is it the case that LRT has failed to use all the money that it was allocated? How much higher is the investment compared with that of the former Greater London council management?</p>

<p>I am glad to say that the accident is unique in the history of the London Underground. Most people would consider that on the whole the London Underground had a very good safety record in many years of operation. The inspector has made specific points on the question whether the cuts&#x2014;as they are described by the Opposition&#x2014;in investment or staff led to the disaster. I have already quoted him on the financing of London Regional Transport. He also makes a specific reference to the numbers of staff when he states:
<q>I found no evidence that the reduction in the number of operating or maintenance staff contributed directly to the disaster at King's Cross.</q>
I hope that that canard can be laid to rest.<br/>
As to the question of financing in the past few years, ever since the Government took over from the GLC the annual capital expenditure in real terms has been higher than it was in any of the last five years of the GLC. Today, in real terms, investment in the London Underground is running at double what it was in 1982.</p>

<p>Is the Secretary of State aware that, on 26 October 1987, Sir Keith Bright met a number of London Members of Parliament and expressed deep concern at the directions he was then working under, expressed in a letter reported in <i>Hansard</i> for 20 July 1984 at column 373? Is the Secretary of State aware that that letter requires a reduction in costs of about &#x00A3;95 million a year while maintaining fares at a stable level? Is it not a fact that the budget of the lifts and escalators department of London Underground was cut from about &#x00A3;11 million to &#x00A3;6 million in three years? Whilst the Act to which he referred, the London Regional Transport Act 1984, required, in section 2(2)<i>(b)</i>, London Regional Transport to have due regard to safety, does he agree that the cut in the escalators budget to which I have referred shows an undue regard to economy?</p>

<p>My hon. Friend asks about the capital spending. I can refer him to another remark that the inspector makes which is extremely important when the House and the public judge this matter. I very much regret that this discussion has turned into a debate of this nature. As the inspector says:
<q>There has been a tendency in London Underground in the past for capital expenditure to be less than the budgeted figure.</q>
Far from being restrained, London Underground did not spend money that the Government had authorised it to spend.

<p>I regret that the Secretary of State did not do me the courtesy of letting me have an advance copy of the report.<br/>
Is it not the case that the most dangerous thing about the Fennell report is that it gives no precise explanation as to why the fire fireballed? We are offered a simple explanation or a hypothesis. Will he therefore guarantee that there will be further research into the cause of the fire to try to find a preventive cure? Does he accept that it is dangerous complacency to regard the disaster as a unique occasion and a freak fire? That is the way to slip into the slot of failing to take safety into proper account. Will he therefore guarantee that, whatever money is needed by London Underground over and above what is already estimated, that money will be found from the public purse and not through increased passenger fares?<br/>
Now that Sir Keith Bright and Dr. Ridley have done the honourable thing, will the Secretary of State tell us why


he has not followed the doctrine of ministerial responsibility and offered his resignation; or has that doctrine simply been cast aside in the same cavalier fashion as the Government cast aside their other responsibilities to the travelling public?</p>

<p>When the hon. Gentleman has a chance to read the Fennell report in full, I think that he will find that my resignation is not called for. I agree with him about the great importance of finding a precise explanation for the appalling fire. There are some detailed and scientific explanations for what was a unique fire. However, as the hon. Gentleman was quite right to point out, that does not remove the necessity for every step to be taken to ensure that a fire of such a serious nature does not occur again.<br/>
As for my not being able to send the hon. Gentleman a copy of the report, under the rules of the House I cannot send every hon. Member a copy of the report. I only wish that I had been in a position to send the hon. Gentleman a copy rather than some other hon. Members.</p>

<p>Set against the Secretary of State's arrogant attitude in presenting the report today, the staff shortages and the understanding of members of staff that conditions on the London Underground were dangerous to such an extent that staff were disciplined for handing out leaflets only days before the disaster, do not his messages of sympathy ring hollow?

<p>I have already made my position clear. On staff, the inspector said:
<q>I found no evidence that the reduction in the number of operating or maintenance staff contributed directly to the disaster at King's Cross.</q>
The hon. Gentleman is right about one issue. It is essential in the future to have better trained staff so that they can be more efficient and carry out their duties more effectively. One of the main recommendations of the report points to a lack of effective training in the past.</p>

Friend to read the report in full. There is a chapter about the cause of the flash-over.

Is he honestly saying that he and his colleagues bear no responsibility for what happened when LRT is Government instituted and Government run? Given that Mr. Fennell makes it clear in his report that safety was not given such a high priority as productivity and efficiency, what guarantee is there for the travelling public that the next four years will see safety any more highly regarded than it has been in the past?</p>

London Underground has been starved of resources and that has led to the virtual elimination of uniformed staff under ground. If he thinks that that is a good thing, perhaps he will speak to the Transport police. There is no doubt that financial considerations were put before safety. Sir Keith Bright only followed orders.

<p>I agree with my hon. Friend's first point, which was raised earlier by my hon. Friend the Member for Chislehurst (Mr. Sims). I am strongly in favour of making the smoking ban more effective, but it is difficult to see how it can be done. Mr. Fennell makes two recommendations that may be helpful. First, he says that a byelaw should be passed to make it an offence to drop litter on the Underground. If such a measure were introduced, I am sure that the House would give it general approval. Secondly, he recommends that shops on the Underground should not be able to sell material that could later become flammable. That is a matter that LRT will wish to consider, and I have much sympathy with it.</p>

Is it any wonder that Labour Members hold the Government's policies as much responsible for that fire as the match that caused it? If there were any honour left among Ministers, the Secretary of State would resign instead of acting like Pontius Pilate and blaming everyone except himself.</p>

<p>I am not blaming everyone else; I am merely reporting the conclusions made in Mr. Fennell's report, which I ask the House to read in full. I am content to be judged by those who read Mr. Fennell's report, who will take full account of the investigation that has taken place. I do not know how the hon.

<p>Is my right hon. Friend aware that a number of hon. Members served on the London Transport committee of the Greater London council? If any of those hon. Members, including myself, looked honestly at the figures for capital expenditure, they would have to conclude that the amounts allocated since the Government took control of London Transport have been generous to a point that would be surprising. Anyone who served on the committee during that time should be congratulated. Does my right hon. Friend agree that one of the major lessons to be learnt is that contact and liaison between the London fire brigade and LRT must at all times be wide and deep? When a fire is reported, the fire brigade must always be called.</p>

<p>As the question of finance has been continually raised by hon. Members, the House might like to know that the cash investment figures for 1988&#x2013;89 are budgeted to be &#x00A3;230 million. When the GLC was abolished, the figure was about &#x00A3;117 million. In real terms, it has increased by over 50 per cent., which gives the lie to those who criticise the Government's investment programme.<br/>
My hon. Friend is entirely right about the fire brigade. Until recently, it had not been the practice under any regime for the Underground to call the fire brigade unless there had been an interruption to train services of about 30 minutes. A fire had to be serious before the fire brigade was called. That has been changed completely and the fire brigade is called as a matter of routine, which is to be welcomed.</p>

<p>Will the Minister apply himself to the issue of the Health and Safety Executive? Is he concerned that it has little influence on safety on the Underground? Agency arrangements have been made whereby London Transport precepts money from the Health and Safety Executive, which has no influence although it provides the money. Is it not time that the arrangements were divorced so that London Transport does not inspect itself? An outside body with influence should make the inspections to replace the present cosy arrangement.</p>

I add my tribute to the emergency services which helped at the fire, many of which were based in my constituency.<br/>
The Secretary of State has made much of his decision to bring the Railway Inspectorate for the Underground up to complement in January. What is the currently accepted complement? Why was it not fully in place prior to November 1987? Why were emergency steps not taken in the aftermath of last November to ensure that it was immediately raised to complement?</p>

<p>I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman's remarks in the first half of his question, with which I agree.<br/>
The complement of the Railway Inspectorate is 24. I intend to have that fully in place by the end of January, and, as I have already told the House, I am considering whether the Railway Inspectorate needs strengthening in the light of Mr. Fennell's report. It has proved necessary, quite rightly, to have a special recruitment drive and to reconsider salaries. Budget has never been a constraint in the recruitment of railway inspectors, but there have been serious recruitment problems for a number of years.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend is entirely right. The number of passengers carried on the Underground has increased considerably. Until this terrible disaster, its safety record was extremely good.

For instance, ticket collectors were constantly missing and the exit from King's Cross was regularly closed so that everyone had to enter and leave the same way, which was highly dangerous. Is it not a fact that the number of cleaners at the station had been cut from more than a dozen to just two and that that played a role

in the fire? Is it not utterly futile for the Secretary of State to talk about how much money was there when we could see the cuts taking place all around us, the effects of which were and still are dangerous?</p>

<p>As I undertook to do yesterday, I have made further inquiries of the Second Deputy Chairman of Ways and Means about the Division that took place at 9.51 on Tuesday evening. As will be seen from the <i>Official Report,</i> having collected the voices, the Deputy Speaker stated her opinion that the noes had it. As "Erskine May" states on page 400, if the declaration of the result by the Chair is challenged, a Division takes place.<br/>
The Deputy Speaker's declaration was challenged, by a shout of Aye, as the <i>Official Report</i> shows, and a Division followed.<br/>
What the <i>Official Report</i> does not show, since it was purely mechanical, is that, for the avoidance of any confusion, the Deputy Speaker collected the voices afresh, and then ordered the Lobbies to be cleared. Yesterday there were at least two occasions when the Chair took a similar course when Members did not appear to be totally clear what was happening.<br/>
In response to a point of order from the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Mr. Dobson), the Deputy Speaker indicated that she was satisfied that there was no defect in the procedure by ruling that the Division was in progress. Nothing out of order occurred.</p>

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. I thank you for that explanation. In my view, two matters arise from it.<br/>
The first concerns the conduct of private business and the Government's attitude to it, which has made this a highly contentious issue on the Floor of the House. Without putting words into your mouth, Mr. Speaker, I believe that you share some of the doubts about the way in which such business has been handled. When the Prime Minister comes to vote on a private Bill, although there is no Whip, that in itself makes the matter highly contentious.<br/>
Secondly, following what you have said, I believe that the matter of the voting procedure should perhaps be referred to the Select Committee on Procedure. There is great doubt, especially among the Opposition, about the developments that have taken place, and although I do not contradict your statement about the factual situation, the position is still highly unsatisfactory from our point of view and I must register that fact in the House.</p>

I put it to you that if the rules are breached&#x2014;I accept your statement that in this instance they were not&#x2014;nothing that then follows can make that breach correct.

<p>I can assure the House that I have considered the matter in great detail. My view is that the rules were followed.

<p>Further to that point of order, Mr. Speaker. It is true that occupants of the Chair often say, "I think the Noes have it" or, "I think the Ayes have it." In fact, it is the sort of statement that is made quite regularly, as it was yesterday&#x2014;not because there was any doubt, but because it was the phrase to use. It is not that the occupant of the Chair is not sure; it is just a statement. There were continuing votes yesterday right through until the early hours of the morning. The Chairman of Ways and Means used that phrase many times, not because there was any doubt, but because that is the way that things are done.<br/>
I asked you yesterday to listen to the tapes, Mr. Speaker. Some may say that "Erskine May" has nothing to do with tapes, but "Erskine May" is a very old instrument of our proceedings. We have tapes available, and anyone listening to a tape of that incident will realise that no Government Member, or any Member supporting the motion, said Aye. There was a distinct shout of "No" &#x2014;<i>[Interruption.]</i> Listen to the tapes. There was a distinct shout of "No", with the result that the Chair said, "I think the Noes have it," in the traditional fashion, not in a doubtful manner. Members on the Conservative Benches recovered their senses, realised that they had lost the vote and shouted "Aye". I contend that at that point we had won the vote.</p>

<p>Further to that point of order, Mr. Speaker. I seek your guidance in the hope that we can finally put this matter to rest. Is it not correct that once the occupant of the Chair makes a correct ruling&#x2014;as, in the eyes of my hon. Friends, Madam Deputy Speaker did the other evening&#x2014;you have no power to review that decision? Is that not where the matter should rest? Once a decision has been made, it is final. It is the same for any referee involved in any activity.</p>

<p>Further to that point of order, Mr. Speaker. It is important that a wrong ruling is not put on the record. The House should remember that Mr. Harold Lever was credited with having voted when he was not within the precincts of the House. When the matter was raised on a point of order the next day, Mr. Speaker Lloyd, after taking advice&#x2014;and it was I who suggested that he did so&#x2014;ordered that a correction be made in the <i>Journal</i>. It is not correct to say that if an error has been made it is incapable of correction. It can be corrected.</p>

<p>Further to that point of order, Mr. Speaker. I am grateful for your ruling, which has cleared away much of the vagueness in my mind&#x2014;a vagueness which, I admit, is not uncommon. Two aspects still concern me and I ask for your further help.<br/>
As a member of the Select Committee on Procedure, I need to be able to speak with some clarity. My first point relates to the emphasis that has been placed on occupants of the Chair at other times and on other occasions. Great importance appears to be attached to the gathering of the voices. I have been directly involved on certain occasions and said "No" to a Government proposal. Business has continued and my "No" has been ruled out of order on the ground that I had not said it loudly enough. That appears to run counter to the ruling that you have just given.<br/>
Secondly, you said yesterday that you had no right to review the matter. Do we need your permission to take the matter to the Select Committee on Procedure? Would you be prepared to discuss it with that Select Committee?</p>

The problem was that the sponsor of the Bill, the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Sir E. Griffiths), did not shout "No". He then leapt up and said:

<p>I do not feel that it is necessary to address me with some contempt in the way that you use your voice, M r. Speaker. The point is that there is a sense &#x2014;<i>[Interruption.]</i> It is the truth. There is a sense of grievance on this side of the House over the fact that, on that occasion, there was no call from the Government Benches during the course of a Division. The Bill has slipped through, against the wishes of a majority of Members of Parliament as expressed. The Division took place after the business was over. The hon. Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown) did not shout in the same way as he did on a previous occasion. The hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Sir E. Griffiths) also did not shout. In our view, the Bill should have fallen at that stage. Those who supported the Bill were given a second bite, and we believe that to be absolutely unfair.<br/>
There is a sense of grievance that remains on Opposition Benches, which is being talked about in the Tea Room, throughout the House, and throughout the Opposition. Even at this late stage, even though there is no precedent in "Erskine May", that Division should be overturned, and the majority view of the House as expressed before the Division was taken should be the one that holds.</p>

For some reason or other, a "No" Division turned out to be an "Aye" Division. I do not understand it. The ruling taints the reputation and democratic procedures of the House. A "No" vote turned out to be an "Aye" vote. We voted against the motion. Conservative Members may say that a vote was taken, but the House voted not to go through the Lobbies. It was quite clear that there were no Ayes, but there were plenty of Noes.</p>

<p>On a further point of order, Mr. Speaker. What has characterised the last few points of order is that some hon. Members who mentioned the matter did not play a part in yesterday's proceedings, but have read <i>Hansard.</i> They listened to the tapes, but they were not involved in the debate. Right across the whole length and breadth of the Opposition there are people who have taken the view that something is wrong with that vote.<br/>
You have heard representations from a Tory Member who is well known with regard to procedure, and who has pointed out that corrections have been made. You have also heard my hon. Friend the Member for Cynon Valley (Mrs. Clwyd), who hitherto has not been involved and who told you about a mirror incident in relation to the Felixstowe Dock and Railway Bill, which was also a private Bill.<br/>
We are now dealing with a Bill that will aid and abet that evil regime of South Africa, and some of us will never let this matter drop. It should be looked at further, so I ask you, once again, Mr. Speaker, to listen to those tapes and to come back with a further report before the Session ends.</p>

<p>I beg to move,<br/>
<q>That this House takes note of the draft revised guidelines for handling Members' representations in immigration cases.</q>
The draft revised guidelines were circulated to every hon. Member in July and copies were placed in the Library. I welcome this opportunity today&#x2014;even at this late hour&#x2014;first, to explain our reasons for the draft and, secondly, to outline what the effect of our proposals will be.<br/>
Across Government Departments there is a convention of long standing that hon. Members may make representations to the Minister concerned on behalf of a constituent. The House is understandably jealous of that convention. In immigration it played a particularly important role when no appeals system was available, but it has developed beyond that. Hon. Members' representations today are as likely to relate to outstanding applications as to unsuccessful ones. Equally impotant in immigration, an hon. Member's representation is no longer the only way in which an applicant is able to obtain redress. Since 1969 there has existed an appellate system. This is operated independently of the Home Office, as its transfer in April 1987 to the Lord Chancellor's Department has emphasised. It is an effective remedy; for example, in the last four years about 20 per cent. of appeals to adjudicators have been successful.<br/>
Because these two systems have developed separately, there are inherent contradictions in the way in which they operate. The current guidelines to hon. Members&#x2014;which were introduced by my right hon. Friend the Patronage Secretary in a previous existence in 1986&#x2014;seek to lay down some ground rules for the inter-relationship between the two systems. I believe that most hon. Members have found these guidelines of considerable assistance.<br/>
The guidelines have been a significant document in establishing a clearer understanding of the respective roles of the Department, the independent appellate authorities and the Minister. However, my right hon. Friend the


Home Secretary and I are concerned to provide a more satisfactory service to hon. Members which, at the same time, enables Ministers to carry out their functions properly. We have looked, too, at the arrangements for hon. Members' "stops", particularly in the light of the new visa arrangements. That was the purpose of our review of the guidelines.<br/>
The present volume of hon. Members' representations is an important element. We received 18,000 letters from hon. Members in 1986 on immigration and related matters. Following the visa decision, there were some 13,000 letters in 1987, and the level of correspondence is likely to be the same this year. That means an average of some 250 letters received by my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary and myself each week. The implications of that are clear. Frankly, with that number of letters, Ministers cannot give detailed personal attention to every case. It is sometimes difficult to pick out the important case and give it the attention that it deserves.</p>

<p>No, if my hon. Friend will forgive me, I shall not give way because time is short and I think the House would like me to make progress so that as many as possible Back-Bench Members from all parties may speak. I hope that my hon. Friend will make his own remarks if he is able to catch the attention of the Chair.<br/>
Better arrangements are therefore needed. Our proposals relate, first, to correspondence and, secondly, to "stops". The draft revised guidelines make two changes in relation to correspondence: first, they make explicit for the first time what is our long-standing practice, that Ministers will not normally intervene to take the decision in outstanding entry clearance and after-entry applications.<br/>
There will obviously be exceptions to the normal rule. An hon. Member's letter may explain why an urgent decision on a case is needed, and I may be able to convey that decision in my reply. We shall, as at present, operate the system flexibly. But where there are no special considerations, my reply will simply indicate, as fully and helpfully as possible, where progress on the application now stands.<br/>
Secondly, the guidelines introduce arrangements to enable hon. Members to correspond direct with the immigration and nationality department on routine inquiries. This change addresses directly our concern to provide hon. Members and their constituents with the best possible service. I shall return to the arrangements for it in more detail shortly.<br/>
Our proposals for "stops" involve two changes. The first results from experience of the changes in permitted "stops" introduced in November 1986. At present, a "stop" in relation to a passenger refused entry because he did not have the entry clearance required under the immigration rules will be permitted only if there are exceptional and compelling circumstances. A "stop" for other passengers will be permitted where there is new and compelling evidence which was not available to the immigration officer. In both cases, the passenger has a full right of appeal from abroad.</p>

<p>With respect to the hon. Lady, I should prefer to get on. I suggest that she makes her remarks during the debate and hope that she catches your eye, Madam Deputy Speaker.<br/>
Because this appeal right is available, the change we therefore propose is that for any passenger refused entry, whether or not the immigration rules require him to have an entry clearance, a "stop" will be permitted only if there are exceptional and compelling circumstances which the immigration officer has had an opportunity to consider but has not taken sufficiently into account.<br/>
The effect of this change is that, in all cases, hon. Members will first need to be satisfied that there are exceptional and compelling circumstances which merit special treatment and, secondly, that the immigration officer must be given an opportunity to consider these special circumstances. This reflects the position in law that the power to give or refuse leave to enter the United Kingdom is exercised by immigration officers. With the final version of the revised guidelines, we shall provide hon. Members with fuller details of contact points at the ports and airports; immigration service officers at senior grades will normally be available to discuss cases of difficulty with hon. Members. If an hon. Member is satisfied that the exceptional and compelling criterion is met and that the immigration officer was aware of it before refusing a request for deferment of removal, he or she may contact my private office direct, or out-of-hours the Home Office duty officer, to request a "stop". I should emphasise that in all cases where an hon. Member wishes to request a "stop", he should contact my private office or the duty officer, not the port or the immigration department.<br/>
The second change again reflects the existence of an appeals system. It affects deportation cases and illegal entry cases which have been reviewed by the courts. All cases leading to deportation have rights of appeal, which are exercised before removal. Similarly, no illegal entrant whose case is to be reviewed by the courts is removed before that review is complete. We have therefore decided that where an appeal has been dismissed and the removal arrangements put in hand, it is wrong to continue to allow "stops" which require the Minister to review again, on the same facts, a decision on which an independent review has already taken place. In future, a "stop" in such cases will be allowed only where there is new and compelling evidence which has not previously been taken into account. The position on "stops" for illegal entrants whose cases have not been reviewed by the courts remains unchanged. The procedure will be the same as I have described for port "stops". My private office or the duty officer should be contacted direct if a "stop" is to be requested.<br/>
We are also proposing a common time limit for the submission of representations in "stop" cases. The time limit in the current guidelines ranges between 12 and five days. Because under the new system the hon. Member will have available details of the particular circumstances behind the "stop" request, we have set a time limit of five working days for the receipt of representations. Where the Minister upholds a decision to remove, the delay of four working days between the date of the Minister's reply to the hon. Member and removal remains unchanged. As at present, hon. Members should continue to contact the port direct where the issue is whether a passenger under refusal


should continue to be detained or be granted temporary admission. That is not a matter in which I would normally expect to intervene.<br/>
I mentioned briefly earlier the new arrangements to enable hon. Members to communicate direct with the Department if they wish. That is not a totally new idea. Hon. Members already write direct to local tax offices, local social security offices and so on. Many also already write direct to regional passport offices and I hope that they will continue to do so. We have, therefore, devised new arrangements so that hon. Members may, if they wish, write directly to the immigration and nationality department. Details are contained in the annex to the draft guidelines and the relevant telephone contact point will of course, be included in the final version of the guidelines.</p>

<p>I hope that the hon. Gentleman will have an opportunity to make his observations in a speech during this short debate.<br/>
Much of hon. Members' routine correspondence may benefit from this approach. A random sample of one week's letters from hon. Members suggests that one third could well be routine inquiries. We envisage that it will provide a swifter and therefore better service for hon. Members on routine matters and, equally important, that it will free Ministers to deal with the difficult cases which merit careful scrutiny.<br/>
Hon. Members may also be aware that similar arrangements to those being set up at the Home Office will be introduced at the same time at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. In answer to the hon. Member for Ealing, Southall (Mr. Bidwell), may I say that my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, who regrets that he cannot be present, wrote to all colleagues in July to give advance notice of these new arrangements. They will deal with routine inquiries from hon. Members about immigration applications made overseas. A special unit will be set up to handle these inquiries. It will, equally, remain open to hon. Members to make specific representations to FCO Ministers direct.<br/>
I should like to take this opportunity to announce an important proposal to improve the service that my Department provides to Members of Parliament and to members of the public.</p>

<p>Not at all. Something rather different.<br/>
Hon. Members will be pleased to learn that the Government wish in principle to establish a regional public inquiry office in Birmingham. We have set in hand consultations with staff and their representatives with a view to recruiting and training personnel for the new office as soon as possible. I hope to be able to announce further details later in the year. I know that many hon. Members have in the past suggested a regional public inquiry office to help members of the public with their immigration problems. This announcement today will be welcomed by all who are anxious to see my Department provide an improved standard of service for those personal callers who wish to resolve their particular immigration problems over the counter.<br/>
In that context, I can tell the House that the benefits of the changes in the immigration rules, against which the Opposition foolishly voted earlier this year, are now beginning to show and that at Lunar house both the public inquiry office and the telephone inquiry bureau are offering a much improved performance. <i>[Interruption.]</i> We are taking active steps to recruit additional staff, and I am sure that the hon. Member for Bradford, West (Mr. Madden) will be the first to join me in sending good wishes from the House to all those members of staff and management who have worked so hard to make these improvements possible. We are taking active steps to recruit additional staff, including part-timers, and have started a major recruitment advertising campaign. At the same time we are introducing, wherever possible, improved working procedures to ensure that applications are processed as promptly as possible.<br/>
Finally, it is a parliamentary convention that hon. Members deal with their own constituency matters and not, save in exceptional circumstances, with one another's. We attach particular importance to that principle in dealing with immigration matters.</p>

<p>I referred to it as a convention. I recognise that some hon. Members have a particular specialist interest in immigration and that some people first arriving in this country with no links will not have an evident constituency Member and so are likely to approach the Member for the constituency in which they first arrive or first find accommodation, but these are exceptions to the general rule. My office will continue its practice of normally accepting representations only from the constituency Member. The draft revised guidelines remind hon. Members of this convention, and we have taken this opportunity also to record our practice that the constituency is normally interpreted as the constituency in which a person lives, rather than works, although obviously in many cases these may be the same.<br/>
I emphasise that the revised guidelines are in draft form. If points are made during today's debate, or if hon. Members wish to write to me about them in the next few days and it seems to us sensible to include them in the final version of the guidelines, we shall do so. These are sensible and balanced proposals aimed at giving a better service to Members of Parliament, consistent with immigration procedures and the independent appeal system. I recommend them to the House.</p>

<p>I cannot begin without saying how unsatisfactory it is that the House is left with an hour and a quarter to debate these matters. We had nine minutes of wholly legitimate points of order before we began. Had they not been put, we would have been left with one hour and 20 minutes. That is wholly unsatisfactory for debating a topic which concerns the rights and interests of hon. Members and, far more important, the welfare and perhaps the lives of men and women who seek entry to this country.<br/>
I shall be brief and not give examples to substantiate the general points that I shall make, but I assure the Minister that I, and no doubt my right hon. and hon. Friends, can


provide examples to substantiate every one of the fears and doubts that overcome us when we consider these proposals.<br/>
I welcome the announcement that an office is to be opened in Birmingham. That is long needed, much appreciated and absolutely essential. I take it for granted that interviews will be held in Birmingham and that families living in that area will not be required to travel to Felixstowe or to London. I take it from the Minister's silence that that obvious reform is what he has in mind.<br/>
This is an arbitrary extension of the powers of the Government and, like all such arbitrary extensions, it is dressed up with the pretence that it is done solely to improve efficiency. That is the traditional excuse for authoritarian action which may be and often is crucially damaging to the interests of men and women who are entitled, even under the present rules, to enter this country, but who are wrongly prevented from doing so by the present method of immigration screening.<br/>
For the three categories particularly affected&#x2014;immigrants refused entry, temporary residents threatened with removal and applicants facing long delays&#x2014;it is often only the intervention of Members of Parliament which prevents them from being subject to unchecked action by the Executive. The object of a parliamentary system is to allow the legislature to check the Executive in matters of general policy and specific application. The only check that exists on the behaviour of the Executive in the specific application of immigration rules is for Members of Parliament to intervene in specific cases of visitors, asylum seekers and alleged illegal entrants.<br/>
It is no good the Minister saying that there is a perfectly adequate system of appeals which does not involve Members of Parliament and therefore Members of Parliament can in part be detached from the entire process. Many of the people who come to this country to visit relations are entitled to do so. Others are asylum seekers, in fear and at risk of their lives if they stay in their home country.<br/>
Some are visitors who have not overstayed but who are suspected of doing so. Such people are not best equipped to deal with the complicated Home Office bureaucracy and, if they are able to deal with it, they do so under two adverse circumstances. First, there is the intolerable delay. One of the main jobs of an hon. Member in this area is to try to speed up the Home Secretary and his Department. We all have letters from a year or more ago that tell us that the Home Office will reply as soon as practically possible. That is often 14, 15, 16 or 17 months later. The hon. Member's job is to find justice in terms of time.</p>

<p>I shall finish my speech quickly as I do not want to stand in the way of my hon. Friends who also want to speak.<br/>
The second reason why the intervention of the Member of Parliament is essential is that the appeal system does not offer any real redress to the majority of people who are found to be unsuitable in their application to enter but who should have been allowed in in the first place. Let us suppose that a man from Islamabad comes to this country for a religious festival or a wedding in&#x2014;I pick an example at random&#x2014;the Sparkbrook constituency. If he is turned

away, it is no consolation to him to say that all he has to do is to return to Pakistan and appeal, and that he may be let in in a year and a half's time. The wedding will be over and it may be impossible to finance another trip after making an appeal. It is possible to appeal only after returning to the port from which the trip has been originally made. That is not an appeal in practical terms.<br/>
The Minister, in his circular and in his argument today, has failed to suggest that the general duty of Members of Parliament to intervene on behalf of constituents is in any way protected by the exceptions that are made in the circular. I shall not read them all, but we are told that Members of Parliament may have the opportunity to place a stop on immediate removal if he or she can demonstrate that there are exceptional and compelling circumstances or if there is new and compelling evidence, according to the different categories of intervention.<br/>
That is wrong in principle and unworkable in practice. It is the civil servant against whom we appeal who decides whether an appeal is possible. The matter goes to the Minister only by the good will and grace of the civil servant, so the idea that Members of Parliament have any rights in those matters is wrong.<br/>
I should like to give an example, which I think the Minister has heard about already. Two months ago, a professor of mathematics at a British university, whom I know only by reputation, was returning to London from a mathematics conference at McGill university in Canada. He discovered, to his delight, that he was sitting next to a professor of mathematics from an Indian university, who was renowned throughout the world as an expert in some branch of the subject. To the Indian professor's delight, the British professor said that he had four graduate students who would like to talk to him. He asked him to stay overnight and come to the university. The Indian professor agreed, but when he innocently got off the plane in London, he was arrested, incarcerated and told that, as he had no visa, he must return the following day.<br/>
I telephoned the Minister's private office and was told that it was not a matter for ministerial intervention. The Minister's private secretary said that the Minister was away for the weekend and could not be disturbed, but, after he had been disturbed, the message came back that it was not a suitable case for intervention by a Member of Parliament because there was nothing urgent about it&#x2014; nobody was dying. I confess that I can think of compassionate cases, involving sickness or physical necessity, which are more urgent than that. However, the response from civil servants when we ask for ministerial intervention clearly makes nonsense of the idea that there are exceptions. We oppose the measures because the exceptions are vitiated by the fact that only the civil servant is allowed to decide whether an exception applies.<br/>
I want to speak briefly about correspondence with the Home Office. I intend to send all immigration letters to the Minister and I expect serious answers from him. I do not expect him to write to me saying that the matter has been passed to Lunar house. It is intolerable that Members of Parliament should be told that they are not entitled to receive the Minister's judgment. It is no good the Minister saying that the work is too much for him. The truth is that if we are dealing with any subject, other than ethnic minorities and the immigration of ethnic minorities, additional resources would be made available and there would be a Minister who was able to deal with the job as it went along.</p>

<p>The right hon. Gentleman is making a mountain out of a molehill. My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary wrote to him on 18 July and gave an undertaking that hon. Members will receive full replies directly from the Minister, if they specify that. The right hon. Gentleman knows that. However, once the guidelines come into effect, we shall obviously not feel able to intervene in any case where the guidelines indicate to the contrary. We shall, of course, provide to any hon. Member who writes to us the information that is available about the application and the stage that it has reached. I hope that that sets the right hon. Gentleman's fears at rest.</p>

<p>The Minister has done the opposite. He has referred to my correspondence with the Home Secretary, so I shall remind him of its terms. After a meeting with some of my hon. Friends, I went to the Home Secretary and said that in future we would write to him and we expected him to reply to us. He was courteous enough to say that he would reply. I give notice that I intend to take up and persist in that offer. I shall expect him to give genuine consideration to the letters rather than to write a Lunar house letter in another guise. My hon. Friends and I are not prepared to see the interests of our constituents subject to the inadequacies and inefficiency of Lunar house. I gladly join the Minister in extending good wishes&#x2014;and sympathy&#x2014;to the people who work at Lunar house. The problem is not the people who work there but the burdens that the Minister has placed on them with unnecessary and arbitrary immigration regulations.<br/>
Ministers have an obligation to satisfy hon. Members that their constituents' interests are being properly respected and looked after. I do not accept that a Minister should determine what is a routine matter and what is a matter of principle. It is quite routine to send a letter saying that one expected a reply a month ago or was promised a reply two years ago if one is expecting furniture to be delivered, awaiting the availability of a new car or inquiring about the time that it will take to tarmacadam a road. In immigration cases, timing is essential. We are not in a mood to be told that Ministers will not co-operate with such routine.<br/>
The drift of the Minister's proposals is more important than the details. In the past eight years, hon. Members have become increasingly detached from arguments about imigration cases, as the Government wish. An attempt is being made to exclude us from defending the rights of constituents. That is parallel with the Government's consistent determination to keep out greater numbers of legitimate immigrants and visitors and to pursue the casual overstayer&#x2014;the innocent overstayer&#x2014;with a severity that the misdemeanour does not warrant.</p>

<p>Having held the job that my hon. Friend the Minister of State holds, I should say that I greatly admire the patience, good sense and courtesy with which he carries out his ministerial responsibilities and that I believe that he is right to propose these changes.<br/>
It is absurd that literally thousands of cases should go to Ministers for their decision&#x2014;especially visitors' cases in their present quantity. It is also absurd that Ministers should be regarded as a regular court of appeal against decisions made under the statutory appeal process. My hon. Friend is right to want to tackle the problem. It is like

the Home Secretary being asked to decide thousands of cases on appeal against decisions in the magistrates courts. Ministers should not have to tackle problems on that scale, but that is what is happening with immigration cases at the moment, and it is right to try to get to grips with the problem. Ministers should be able to concentrate on the really important questions that will have a decisive influence on the life of the immigrant concerned. The enormous burden of less important cases makes it remarkably hard for Ministers to concentrate on such issues.<br/>
The question has always been: what should we do about the problem? I have to confess that in my time we failed to do anything effective and merely operated the system. In theory there was always the attractive option &#x2014;an option favoured in the Wilson report&#x2014;of setting up an immediate court of appeal or adjudication system that could pick up cases virtually the next day and decide whether immigration officers had made the right decision. We have to acknowledge that the scale of visitor entrance and the multiplicity of ports of entry have made that a practical impossibility, and we therefore need the kind of approach contained in the draft guidelines.<br/>
At this stage&#x2014;the stage between the publication of the draft guidelines and the appearance of the final guidelines &#x2014;my hon. Friend should consider one or two matters carefully. First, I do not entirely agree with the wording of the draft guidelines as they affect the philosophy of how to approach constituency cases. There is a firm convention in the House that we do not pick up each other's cases&#x2014; certainly not without permission&#x2014;but that is based on respect among hon. Members, and Ministers should avoid putting themselves in a position in which they may be seen to be policing that convention. I hope that my hon. Friend will think again about the present wording, which seems to me to imply&#x2014;to a greater extent than is wise&#x2014;that Ministers will determine this issue. I have never heard of Ministers in other Departments saying that they will not pick up a case because it comes from outside the constituency of the hon. Member concerned, and it would not be right for the Home Office to take that view. I do not think that such a change would undermine what my hon. Friend seeks to do, and I hope that he will think about it carefully.</p>

<p>No. I shall follow the practice of not giving way.<br/>
Secondly, it should be made explicit in paragraphs 9 to 14 that, although the members of the Minister's private office will take certain actions' regarding removal or otherwise, they are at all times the servants of the Minister. The wording of that part of the guidelines seems to have a flavour of giving them a more free-standing role than is proper. It is only a matter of wording, but the Minister must always be responsible for the actions of his private office and there should be no doubt about that in the guidelines, although over the years successive Ministers, including myself, have been superbly served by those in their private offices.<br/>
I am not sure that I entirely agree with the statement in paragraph 10 that removal will be deferred only where there are
<q>exceptional and compelling circumstances &#x2026; which the immigration officer has had an opportunity to consider but has not sufficiently taken into account.</q>


It is right that the guidelines should contain such a provision, but if there is to be further consideration at all we should at least be prepared to consider factors that have not been considered by the immigration officer. The guidelines circumscribe too narrowly the conditions in which matters should be reconsidered. After all, the point of going to the Minister is to bring before him new factors not necessarily considered by the immigration officer.<br/>
Let me come to what is in many ways my most important point. The quid pro quo of a speeded-up system that rightly imposes fewer burdens on Ministers is that there must be an acceleration of the rate of handling of appeal cases. We all know that in many cases it takes far too long to deal with appeals. I know that my hon. Friend is very keen to improve the administrative machinery. He has taken a number of effective steps, and we were glad to hear his announcement today. Nevertheless, I hope that he will do all that he possibly can to ensure that the appeal process is speeded up. I know that much of the responsibility for that lies with the Lord Chancellor, but it is a matter for the Government, and it is a matter of great importance.<br/>
My hon. Friend did not touch on one aspect of the process which has concerned the House. Perhaps he can report on whether the new guidelines on asylum cases, which were very much improved after a good deal of discussion, are working satisfactorily.<br/>
Having said that, I believe that my hon. Friend is right to introduce procedures. I hope that he will think about the points that I have made but I shall certainly support him if there is a Division tonight.</p>

<p>I was surprised to hear the Minister say that he proposed to introduce the guidelines with the intention of improving the service to Members of Parliament. I am not aware that hon. Members have shown any sign that they are dissatisfied with the service that they have had&#x2014;in the sense in which the Minister has interpreted it. I should be interested to hear whether any of the proposals arise from recommendations made by hon. Members who have had occasion to deal with him frequently on immigration matters. The House feels that the changes in the guidelines have more to do with administrative convenience than with the strengthening of hon. Members' democratic effectiveness.<br/>
Immigration cases obviously are exceedingly difficult for officials to handle, and it can bring Governments into disrepute with foreign Governments if they are not properly handled. It is wrong to treat hon. Members as though they are in some sort of adversarial relationship with the Home Office and its Ministers and officials when they are seeking by their intervention to make the handling of a case more sensitive and to ensure that there is no miscarriage of justice.<br/>
The fact that rules are being tightened to reduce hon. Members' effectiveness and limit the circumstances in which hon. Members can intervene will transfer to hon. Members a considerable amount of work that should properly be handled by officials and Ministers. They are to be expected to make difficult judgments about whether exceptional and compelling circumstances exist which

have or have not been taken into account in the quasi-judicial procedures. I believe that hon. Members' duties are properly discharged if they make a prima facie judgment, but what is now proposed is that hon. Members should establish&#x2014;as though they were a court with the ability to sift and evaluate evidence&#x2014;whether certain factors have been sufficiently taken into account. That is especially true in respect of visitors, those seeking asylum and illegal entrants. They are asked to judge whether there is new and compelling evidence.<br/>
I admit that the Minister did not have much time to explain the matter to us, but it appeared that he proposed to issue detailed information about what had happened in the judicial review, so that it would be possible for Members of Parliament to consider whether what they had been told was in fact a new point that should be taken into consideration. If that is the case, an extraordinary complexity has been added to the procedure, which, far from simplifying the process, will greatly complicate it.<br/>
I do not wish to repeat the points that have been well made by the right hon. Member for Birmingham, Sparkbrook (Mr. Hattersley), who speaks with more personal familiarity of these cases than me and many other hon. Members, but I wish to raise one or two points that he did not touch on.<br/>
In the case of a person seeking asylum, the Minister apparently will not agree automatically to defer removal where there is a safe third country to which that person may go. How is it to be determined what is a safe country? Is the Minister proposing to issue a list of safe countries? Is it to be countries that are subscribers to international conventions which show that they are suitable places for people to go to? I believe that, if it is a purely subjective judgment being operated by the official, it would be appropriate for Members of Parliament to intervene and give their appraisal. The Minister should not bind himself in advance, but should consider each case on its merits.<br/>
On the question of deportation and illegal entry, the Minister's prior decision to intervene only if there is new and compelling evidence appears to be unacceptably binding his hands.<br/>
The proposal that the procedures on stops should be exercised within five working days is impossible to present as one which is in the interests of Members of Parliament or those whom they are seeking to serve. In the light of the new heavier responsibility that the Minister is putting on Members to evaluate evidence, it will be much more difficult for them to do so if it has to be packed into that confined time. Speaking as one whose post and communications with Lunar house are perhaps more difficult than those of other hon. Members, I believe that the Minister should look very hard at that proposed reduction from 12 to five days. I cannot see what advantage there is in that.<br/>
With regard to the constituency Member and his role, it is a generally correct principle that hon. Members should not take up each other's cases, but exceptions to that should be recognised by the Minister. There are some hon. Members who almost as a point of principle will not take up immigration cases. It is bad for our race relations policy and for our relations with other countries if an individual is deprived of a right by finding himself in such a constituency. I hope that the Minister will take that point into account when interpreting his guidelines on constituency Members.<br/>
On the question of a direct approach to the


immigration and nationality department, I have no quarrel whatever with a facility being made available which hon. Members in some cases may feel is appropriate. If that reduces the burden of work on Ministers' Departments, that must be welcomed and justified. However, it must not take away the Member of Parliament's judgment whether that facility is the appropriate one to use in the circumstances. The Member of Parliament has a constitutionally important right to be able to call to account the Government through the Minister, and not for the action to be taken in his name by some junior departmental officials.<br/>
I recognise that the scale and volume of these cases is such that it is appropriate for the Minister to review the effectiveness of the existing rules, but the size of the problem is to some extent being diminished&#x2014;partly through substantive changes in the law&#x2014;and therefore it is not the appropriate time to change the guidelines in the manner recommended by the Minister. I was unhappy about the changes, and especially about section 5 of the Immigration Act 1988, which I believe is doing a number of people grave injustice in removing effective judicial review.<br/>
The Member of Parliament's stop is the only safeguard which exists to give an effective remedy to those whose right of appeal can be exercised only once they have left the country, which represents a substantial number of cases. That cannot be satisfactory, and the Minister must reconsider that.</p>

<p>I believe that the hon. Member for Ealing, Southall (Mr. Bidwell) and I are two of the most frequent correspondents with the Home Office on this subject. That has been confirmed informally, if not exactly statistically. I pay tribute to the Minister's private staff for the way in which they deal with these problems and the courtesy that they extend to hon. Members.<br/>
On the last occasion that the guidelines were discussed in the House, my principal anxiety was the large number of visitors with modest means who were arriving in Britain and being turned back at the airport, having been told that they could not afford to come for a holiday. That caused distress to many people. I am happy to say that, by and large, the introduction of the visa system has eliminated that misery at the airport, at least for those who come from the countries about which I am concerned.<br/>
My principal anxiety now is about marriages and fianc&#x00E9;es joining their husbands-to-be. Undoubtedly there are bogus marriages between people who go off after the formalities have been approved by the Home Office; plainly they never intended to have a genuine marriage. However, I believe that there are substantial numbers of genuine relationships which are not getting through the system. If a marriage was proved to be genuine, either immediately or over a period, I would like it to be made possible for that couple to be able to surmount the hurdles presented by the Act.<br/>
It is absurd to say that Members of Parliament cannot get satisfaction from local offices and from individual departments. We receive many thoroughly satisfactory letters from DHSS offices and from inspectors of taxes,

and I am prepared to try to get a satisfactory answer from the immigration and nationality department. If I do not, I shall be on to the Minister very quickly.<br/>
The matter which concerns me about the guidelines is the time limits, and especially the five-day time limit. Will the Minister ensure that the same conventions for time limits, which were agreed in the previous guidelines, are observed so that there is no change of administrative practice by his Department? It was only the willingness of his Department to accept a holding letter, when one could not get the full representations in within the five days agreed by his predecessor, that actually made the existing system in some cases tolerable. I hope that there will be no administrative changes. I associate myself with the arguments of my right hon. Friend the Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Raison), and I hope that consideration of them will continue.</p>

<p>When the Minister introduced the revised guidelines today he presented them as though they were just and reasonable and were intended to assist hon. Members and perhaps, as a by-product, to assist himself because a burden will be lifted from his shoulders. I do not believe that that will happen. He should ask himself why he receives so many thousands of letters every year from hon. Members. It is because reality is much more stark than he would have us believe.<br/>
I want to use this opportunity to express my concern and the concern of many of my constituents who originated in the Indian sub-continent about the long delays that occur when dealing with applications for the entry clearance of their relatives.<br/>
I am sure that everyone would accept that someone legally settled in this country is entitled to have his wife and children, below a certain age, to join him here. Many of my constituents, however, face delays of months and even years on receiving decisions on applications they have made for their families to join them in Oldham.<br/>
Over the years those delays have built up to such an extent that I took one case to the ombudsman to see if he could investigate exactly what had happened. Some considerable time later the ombudsman prepared a report and submitted it to me. It informed me that the wife of Mr. Ali, the constituent concerned, was interviewed at the British High Commission in Dhaka on 23 April 1986&#x2014; after the application had been made on 27 March. She was told that her husband would have to be interviewed in the United Kingdom before the matter could be dealt with properly. I received a letter from my constituent complaining about this on 27 March 1987, because, nearly a year later, no further action has been taken. In other words, his wife was interviewed and told that her husband would have to be interviewed here and yet, a year later, that had not happened.<br/>
I asked the ombudsman to consider the case, which he examined carefully. He outlined a catalogue of disastrous actions, which I would love to read out to the House, but I know that hon. Members would not want me to delay them. I hope that the Minister will consider the case. One of the examples given by the ombudsman was that the application had been placed on the wrong pile and did not reach the top of that pile as was expected at a certain time. He added:


<q>unfortunately at about that time the entry clearance officer had suffered serious family problems which had necessitated his absence from the office from July to September during which time no action had been taken on &#x2026; the application. The Principal Officer said that the ECO's outstanding cases should have been taken over by another officer during the ECO's absence, but this seemed not to have happened.</q>
It is all extremely loose and unfortunate, especially for my constituent. I have every sympathy for the entry clearance officer, who was facing some difficulties of his own, but I have just as much sympathy for my constituent. He had to wait a year between when his wife was interviewed and when he was interviewed to see whether she could join him with their children. That placed his marriage under some strain and caused him problems.<br/>
Although the Minister may have sympathy for my constituent, he may suggest, as was suggested to the ombudsman, that it was an unusual case. The ombudsman reported:<br/>
<q>The Principal Officer said that the Head of Immigration Section in Dhaka had every reason to believe that this had been an isolated case</q>
It is not an isolated case. I asked the Oldham council for racial equality to find some similar examples and I could give details of the cases it gave me, but time is short. They include people who were interviewed in Dhaka in the middle of 1986. The second interview of the relatives, to be held in Liverpool, was delayed for eight months. A further interview was required, but that suffered an 11-month delay. Between the three interviews, 20 months had elapsed. After two years had passed no decision had yet been reached. That is not the isolated case of which the ombudsman spoke; it is just one of many cases that can be substantiated.<br/>
When the Minister speaks about trying to help us and helping himself, he should think about the people we should help&#x2014;those people who wait months, even years, for their wives and children to join them. Let us do something to expedite their cases. To suggest that the best thing to do is to write to Lunar house is nonsense.</p>

<p>The proposals are sound and sensible, and I believe that they should have been implemented long ago because the system was becoming increasingly unsatisfactory and often abused. Few hon. Members would not agree.<br/>
I have been as guilty as anyone in seeking stop notices on arrivals, often without being in possession of the full facts. I did it because it was expected of me. Any hon. Member who was approached in those circumstances had to give good justification for not asking the Minster or his office to intervene. It was well known that a stop notice was practically automatic&#x2014;that is what happened if an hon. Member was co-operative. Because of the weight of correspondence to which my hon. Friend the Minister has referred, people were coming in illegally and staying five or six months before the Home Office dealt with their case.<br/>
I am amazed by the dedication that has been shown by my hon. Friend, by his predecessor&#x2014;the Government Chief Whip&#x2014;and my right hon. Friend the Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Raison) who all spent hours and hours on the cases. Given the weight of correspondence imposed

upon them, it was impossible for any human being to reach the right judgment in every case. Therefore, the guidelines are right.<br/>
The Minister is correct to talk about the need for exeptional and compelling circumstances because we must be able to make representations on those cases which we genuinely believe to be worthwhile. I have had two or three cases recently when my hon. Friend has taken into account those circumstances. They have not all been coloured immigration cases.</p>

<p>I can talk about this because I represent an area of high immigration. I want to see justice for those who genuinely want to bring in people who have a right to enter. This issue cuts right across the world. My hon. Friend frequently brings his judgment to bear on compassionate cases, and we are grateful for that.<br/>
I wish to sound a note of dissent. I am not sure about this business of writing to Lunar house, except in highly technical cases. People outside this place have a touching faith in Ministers' ability to get things done. As a Member of Parliament of some experience, I have found that if I go to what they regard as second best they will ask me why I did not approach the Minister if they are turned down. So I might have to go to the Minister in the end, anyway. We must certainly reserve the right to approach him if we have any doubts about a case.<br/>
In other respects these guidelines are sensible and I hope that they will be ratified. I think they will work smoothly.</p>

<p>The Minister comes before the House as living proof of the Government's incompetent handling of immigration policy during the past 10 years.<br/>
On 16 November 1987 the Home Secretary came before the House to tell us that the Immigration Bill, which became the Immigration Act 1988, would provide a better customer service. Let us quickly examine the record: it is a catalogue of incompetence.<br/>
At Lunar house, 267,000 letters lie unopened. That has earned the condemnation of the Home Affairs Select Committee, which described events at Lunar house as scandalous. There are delays in dealing with applications for naturalisation of up to two years. It takes nine months for a person wanting to join a spouse here to be interviewed in posts abroad. This year 77,000 passports were at Lunar house until the Minister discovered them, started to photocopy them&#x2014;not in person&#x2014;and sent them back to applicants. People have to wait for up to a year for applications for dependants to be considered.<br/>
The Immigration Act 1988 came into force on 1 August this year, further restricting the rights of appeal of citizens of this country and of those seeking to come here, and breaking promises made by successive Labour and Conservative Governments. Yet, in his letter of 18 July to hon. Members, the Minister said, in paragraphs two and four, that he intended to provide a better service for hon. Members. We did not believe the Home Secretary last year and we do not believe him now.<br/>
A fundamental shift in the rights of Members to intervene in immigration cases is being proposed. Since my


election last year as the Member for Leicester, East, I have taken up more than 4,500 immigration cases. I give a third of my parliamentary salary to employ an extra person in my office just to deal with those cases. Each week I send on average 25 letters to the Minister's private office. They do not inquire after his good health; they are inquiries about applications for leave to remain and about delays in cases. Every letter is vital to the people who come to my surgeries and who live in my constituency and in those of other hon. Members. These people have an absolute right to go to see their Members of Parliament, and Members have an absolute right to contact the Minister and expect a reply.<br/>
The Minister is trying to transfer the correspondence from his office to Lunar house, which has often been affectionately called Loony house by my hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, West (Mr. Madden). And what is happening at Lunar house? Two hundred and sixty seven thousand letters lie unopened, the morale of members of staff is low, there are delays, and there is chaos. Apparently, the ability of the immigration service to hold on to staff at Lunar house is so limited that they are losing them daily to the insurance companies in Croydon.<br/>
I join in the tributes paid to the Minister's private office, which I have found extremely helpful. When I ring the office, Colette, Sharon, or Trixie or Dixie, or whoever works there, are helpful, and we come to know the people we are dealing with. When we visit the Minister's office we know that his private office lies just outside his door and that members of staff are present to consult him on matters of importance. I do not want to write to Lunar house. I shall join my right hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Sparkbrook (Mr. Hattersley) in continuing to write to the Minister.<br/>
I welcome the establishment of an office in Birmingham. It would be nice to have a local immigration and nationality office in Leicester, Bradford or Manchester. On the analogy with local tax and DHSS offices, it would be useful to have these offices in our constituencies.<br/>
I do not think that the Minister understands the hardship and distress that people undergo queuing at Lunar house or going to the passport office and waiting for a response. I, too, deprecate the idea of removing our right to intervene and stop the removal of people who enter this country. Under these guidelines, anyone who enters the country, visa national or non-visa national, cannot have a Member of Parliament intervene on his behalf unless he can demonstrate exceptional and compelling circumstances. That is a matter of grave importance.<br/>
The Minister tells us that we can always contact the out-of-hours telephone number, which I have done several times. When I ring it, I do not speak to the Minister. I get a civil servant who then contacts another civil servant at the airport&#x2014;and they make the decision.<br/>
I have tried to get in touch with the Minister about matters of importance during the summer recess and at times in the parliamentary Session when he is globe trotting in his other guise as the Minister with responsibility for broadcasting. When attempts have been made to contact him, he has not been able to give us a reply. In one particular case, the Minister had gone on holiday to an island in the Outer Hebrides and was not contactable. His private secretary informed me that there was no way in which I could contact the Minister but that they would send a helicopter to drop his box. Apparently, there was no one else on the island and there were no

telephone communications with it. The Minister failed to read a document that was dropped in the box, so the person concerned spent an extra week in custody at Heathrow.<br/>
I do not intend to honour the guidelines telling us not to intervene in the cases of people who live in other constituencies but come to us because their Members are not sympathetic. I have given notice to the hon. Member for Northampton, North (Mr. Marlow) that I am raising this matter about him this evening. It concerns a case of a month ago and a person who lived in the constituency of the hon. Member for Northampton, North. This person went to see the hon. Gentleman to ask him to put a stop on the departure of another person. The hon. Gentleman refused, so this person went to my right hon. Friend the Member for Sparkbrook, who put a stop on the departure. The person then came to me, and I did, too.<br/>
The hon. Member for Northampton, North was so furious that he rang the Minister's private office and said that he refused to accept any other stops and that the person would have to leave the country. These guidelines mean that people who live in constituencies with unsympathetic Members become the prisoners of the prejudices of those Members. People should not he put in that position.<br/>
I am not prepared to accept the time limit of five days. It is utterly impossible to process representations within that time. If a stop is put on, for example, on a Sunday evening, I come to Parliament on a Monday and my first opportunity to see my constituent would be on the Friday of the week following the stop, by which time five working days would have been completed. These are complex matters; people may require the intervention of linguists who speak, for example, Punjabi or Gujurati. We must ensure that they get more advice&#x2014;</p>

<p>Does my hon. Friend agree that five working days are particularly problematic in the cases of people who seek asylum as refugees?

Friend agree that it is now imperative that the Home Office sets time limits on its own considerations, and the Foreign Office does likewise?<br/>

<p>I agree with my hon. Friend. The Minister may find that the guidelines are challengeable in the courts


and that they will result in the abrogation of his responsibility as the Minister responsible for immigration. In my view, it is open to people to challenge the guidelines on the ground that they fetter the Minister's discretion to intervene. Much could have been done to improve the service. The recruitment of more staff, the allocation of more resources and assurances that immigration officers would act quickly in dealing with cases would be more helpful than restricting the rights of hon. Members to intervene.<br/>
How many people did the Minister consult before he came to his decision about the guidelines? How many law centres, Members of Parliament and people associated with immigration matters did he consult? He came to Leicester recently and attended a luncheon given by Leicester Inner City Conservative Association. In a letter dated 24 August the association said:
<q>We are extremely fortunate to obtain the services of Mr. Timothy Renton, M.P.".</q>
The association proposed to charge &#x00A3;8 per head for the luncheon, but nobody wanted to go to see the Minister and the association had to offer free meals.<br/>
The right of hon. Members to intervene in immigration cases is a lifeline to many of my constituents. Hundreds of thousands of people in this country and abroad look to their Members of Parliament to intervene in this way. I do not know whether the House realises it, but yesterday in all parts of Britain we celebrated the festival of Diwali, the festival of light. It is a very important Hindu festival, but many people could not take part in celebrating it because they are anxiously waiting for husbands, wives, children or other dependants who are locked into the bureaucracy of the Home Office and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.<br/>
Today the Government say that the time limit will be five days. Next week they will say it is to be 24 hours and then they will abolish it completely. I hope that hon. Members from all parties will join us in refusing to allow our rights to be abrogated in this way and will help us to ensure that this lifeline is retained for our constituents.</p>

<p>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak in the debate, and I shall be brief because we look forward to hearing the Minister's reply.<br/>
I welcome the guidelines. It is essential that the Minister should have time to give proper consideration to exceptional cases, which require his discretion or which contain anomalies that need to be properly examined. He cannot be expected to do that if at the same time he is expected to give his individual and personal attention to routine inquiries.<br/>
If the right hon. Member for Birmingham, Sparkbrook (Mr. Hattersley) carries out his stated intention of continuing to send anything and everything to the Minister, cases that require time, ministerial intervention and careful consideration will suffer. I do not understand why hon. Members handling immigration cases should think that they should be able to handle them in a way that is different from the handling of other cases. If a constituent comes to see me or telephones about a tax problem, I do not rush off to my right hon. Friend the Chancellor. If a constituent telephones about a social security problem, I do not go to my right hon. Friend the

Secretary of State for Social Security. I go to my right hon. Friends only when I am fully satisfied that I cannot get the matter resolved expeditiously and satisfactorily at a different level. I expect to have to react in the same way to immigration cases.</p>

<p>I am sorry, but there is not enough time.<br/>
The right hon. Member for Sparkbrook said that this was an authoritarian measure. I can imagine few things more authoritarian than an hon. Member being able to intervene arbitrarily in the procedures and course of justice and put on a stop, even though that hon. Member has very little information. It is right that hon. Members should take the responsibility that the hon. Member for Caithness and Sutherland (Mr. Maclennan) felt they should not have to take. Hon. Members must satisfy themselves that they are intervening with just cause, and not merely for the sake of it and automatically. If the guidelines encourage a greater sense of responsibility on the part of hon. Members and greater efficiency and discrimination in the Minister's office, they will be most welcome. I support them.</p>

<speech hansard_id="591693" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1988-11-10a.538.2" hansard_membership_id="4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2069" speakername="Ms. Diane Abbott" colnum="538" time="18:45:00">
<p>Conservative Members have asked why hon. Members should have more rights in immigration matters than in matters affecting taxation or whatever. I shall enlighten them. Immigration matters are nearly always matters of life and death and of extraordinary personal significance. We intervene on behalf of people who fear that if they are deported they will face death. We intervene on behalf of children and grandparents coming to visit their families, sometimes because of sickness or because a member of the family may be dying.<br/>
Immigration matters require greater powers of intervention by hon. Members because the personal issues involved are of such serious moment and, increasingly, because the decisions by immigration officers at ports of entry are arbitrary and unfair. In such cases we are the only recourse. Week in, week out, I have to deal with people who have been stopped at the airport because the immigration officer thinks that they are not coming here for a holiday. The immigration officer does not have to prove his case, and people are just sent back.<br/>
If Conservative Members did the work on immigration cases that my hon. Friends and I do they would understand the seriousness of the issue. The only substantive reason given by the Minister for altering the guidelines is that hon. Members are putting on too many stops. He said that there was too great a weight of correspondence. I and my hon. Friends argue that if the only problem is too great a weight of correspondence, why does the Minister not make more staff available to deal with the correspondence? It is no part of the job of a responsible Minister to curtail human rights on the basis that too many people are exercising those rights. It is wholly illiberal to curtail people's rights on the basis that too many are seeking to exercise them.<br/>
Many times in his speech the Minister said that the Government wished to provide a better service. The guidelines will not provide a better service; they will simply mean that many more people will be turned away at the


ports. We would not have to exercise the right of stop so often and at such an increasing rate if it were not for the increasing number of apparently arbitrary decisions by immigration officers at the ports.<br/>
The Minister claims that he wants to provide a better service for our constituents and for people seeking to visit their families. If the Minister is anxious to improve the service and human rights, especially in the case of refugees who had their right of appeal curtailed in legislation presented earlier this year, then, even at this last minute, he should withdraw these rules which thoroughly interfere with the rights of hon. Members and provide the staff to answer our queries.</p>

<p>I am grateful for the opportunity to participate briefly in this debate. I am also grateful to my hon. Friend the Minister for the courtesy and speed with which his Department has handled difficult asylum cases involving citizens from Romania and the Communist bloc and north African workers in my constituency.<br/>
I wish to focus on one point that has arisen from the debate. We want people to come to this country from abroad and we are keen to encourage the tourist industry, but we must bear in mind that entry into this country is a privilege, not a right.<br/>
As Members of Parliament, we should consider our role in examining the cases of people who wish to come to this country and remember that we are not the final arbiters. We can merely plead one side of the case.<br/>
I have often received touching accounts of difficult situations, which I have put to Ministers, and argued cases in court, but that is not the whole of the matter. There is often another side to the case. It is for those people charged with the arbitration of those matters to decide such cases. This country has one of the fairest systems in the world. Nowhere else in the world is one allowed an appeal against a refusal of a visa and an appeal against a refusal of right of entry. We must consider our role in that light.<br/>
Members of Parliament can play an important role. I am glad to have played that role and been of help to some of my constituents who have found themselves in difficult circumstances because they have been refused entry to this country. However, if some of us refuse to co-operate with the system, it will break down to an even greater extent than has been suggested by the hon. Member for Leicester, East (Mr. Vaz). It will create chaos and give some people a privilege. The Home Office's operations will come to a stop while a person's case is taken out of the file and submitted to my hon. Friend the Minister, who will then write a letter. The case will then go back in the file, but, in the meantime, progress on all other cases will be halted. Cases will not, therefore, be handled fairly.</p>

<p>The right hon. Member for Birmingham, Sparkbrook (Mr. Hattersley) will tell the House, "I do not care what the Government decide or what system is put forward.

<p>I must, of necessity, be brief, but I wish to give one example of an inhuman attitude by an immigration officer in Delhi. The Foreign Office reconsidered the case&#x2014;a chap who wanted to come to his brother's wedding&#x2014;but said that he could not come because he had a farm 170 miles from Delhi and only a 16-year-old son to leave in charge of it and he did not know the name of the bride in Britain. That was given as sufficient reason to refuse him entry for a visit.<br/>
The appeal process is a farce because the purpose of the visit has long passed by the time the appeal is heard. We have heard a great deal about these matters from Conservative Members and even more from Opposition Members who are deeply involved. The right hon. Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Raison), a former Minister who dealt with immigration matters, showed that all is not right. The immigration system is inhumane. It is subject to considerable delays and needs a thorough overhaul. Hon. Members are right to protest. Those who apply for entry to this country, whether black, brown or white, should be treated by hon. Members in the same way as they treat their constituents.</p>

<p>This has been a short but worthwhile debate. I am grateful to hon. Members for the sensible points that they have made regarding a matter that relates directly to hon. Members' conventions and privileges. I appreciate the realistic view that some hon. Members, particularly Conservative Members, have expressed about representations and what they can achieve, and I shall reflect upon all the comments that have been made. We shall shortly publish the guidelines in their final form, with a view to implementation on 3 January 1989, and we shall ensure that all hon. Members receive clear advance notice of that.<br/>
I wish particularly to thank my right hon. Friend the Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Raison), who has great knowledge of this subject, my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Feltham and Heston (Mr. Ground) and my hon. Friend the Member for Warwick and Leamington (Sir D. Smith) for their support of the draft guidelines and for the messages that they asked me to pass on to my private office, which I shall certainly do.<br/>
I wish to deal with the point raised by my right hon. Friend the Member for Aylesbury about the UKIAS referral system for dealing with asylum applications in this country. I am pleased to be able to tell him that the revised system, which came into operation on 1 September, is running smoothly and in a good co-operative spirit. As he will know, we consulted carefully and at great length about this with both UKIAS and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.<br/>
There is no guarantee that any individual case will be referred to UKIAS, but it is expected that referral will be the norm. So far, only a handful of cases have been referred to me, as the Minister involved, where UKIAS and our immigration service have not been able to agree on the appropriate treatment of the refugee applicant. So far,


that is working well. I hope that the hon. Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington (Ms. Abbott), who raised that matter with me, will take comfort from that answer.<br/>
My right hon. Friend the Member for Aylesbury raised the difficult question of receiving representations only from constituency Members. We should not have hard and fast rules about that.</p>

<p>I cannot give way to the hon. Gentleman.<br/>
When my right hon. and learned Friend the Patronage Secretary introduced his guidelines, there were no hard and fast rules on the subject. If my right hon. Friend reads the new draft carefully, he will see that there are no hard and fast rules now, but it is a difficult matter. He will realise that a constituency Member finds it extremely irritating to discover that another Member has taken up a case involving one of his constituents in which he has declined to intervene because he did not think the case was good enough, after having looked into it and discussed it with the immigration service.</p>

<p>No. I have told the hon. Gentleman that I will not give way.<br/>
The constituency Member finds that another hon. Member has taken up the case, is in touch with my private office and is requesting that the removal be deferred. We shall continue to operate tactfully and carefully in this matter.<br/>
The hon. Member for Oldham, Central and Royton (Mr. Lamond) raised a difficult point, which worries many people, about delays in immigration service interviews. Priority is given to entry clearance interviews, but some delays may occur during peak periods. With improved working procedures, we are trying to shorten those delays.<br/>
We heard nothing tonight from the right hon. Member for Birmingham, Sparkbrook (Mr. Hattersley) about what he would do to improve immigration procedures. However, that is typical of his attitude to those problems &#x2014;all words, all opposition and no constructive suggestions.<br/>
Meanwhile, we will continue to improve procedures at Lunar house and services to Members of Parliament. That is why I recommend the draft guidelines to the House.</p>

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. There is, as you know, a convention that if hon. Members are to be referred to in a debate, they are told in advance that that will happen. I understand that I was referred to in the previous debate. I also understand that it was said that I had been told that I would be referred to. That is not the case.<br/>
I tried to find out what had been said about me and, from what I understand, it was basically total nonsense. My position is the same as that of any right hon. or hon. Member. If I am approached by a constituent, I will look into the matter carefully and take great pains to do what I should for him. As you are aware, the guidelines say that if there are new, exceptional and compelling circumstances&#x2014;</p>

<p>Further to that point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I informed the hon. Member for Northampton, North (Mr. Marlow) that I intended to mention him in the debate. I wrote the note myself and, because I was participating in the debate and could not leave the Chamber, the note was given to my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington (Ms. Abbott) and she put the note in the hon. Gentleman's pigeon hole. If he does not clear his pigeon hole or look at his correspondence, I am not responsible.</p>

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. Are you aware of the difficulties that right hon. and hon. Members have had in obtaining information about the allocation of time for the numerous outstanding amendments to the Housing Bill, which we are to debate tomorrow? The Clerk of the House and his colleagues were most helpful in dealing with inquiries. I have just been told that a copy of the allocation of time motion will be made available to me. Whether it was known that I would be raising a point of order, I cannot say. Is it not a serious inconvenience to right hon. and hon. Members, and a discourtesy to the House, that the motion on the allocation of time was not made available earlier? Is there anything that you can do to assist us?</p>

<p>Further to that point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I and people in my office have been making inquiries about that matter during the day in order to find out about the Government motion, which may now have been laid in the Table Office. As the Leader of the House is present, it would be helpful if he could tell us whether the Government motion has now been laid in the Table Office, or, if not, when that is likely to happen. As the debate is occurring on a Friday, the allocation of our own time needs to be planned in advance. A statement would be helpful.</p>

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I am only trying to be helpful to the Chair. I do not often raise points of order, but the hon. Member for Northampton, North (Mr. Marlow) causes trouble in the Chamber by shouting and yawping from his seat and often has to be pulled up by the Chair.

<p>Further to the brief statement made by the Leader of the House, Mr. Deputy Speaker. Hon.

<p>I beg to move, That the Bill be now read the Third time.<br/>
The Bill is promoted by Northampton borough council and has the unanimous support of the Conservative party, the Labour party and the Social and Liberal Democratic party. It covers a number of miscellaneous matters of local interest. One of the main parts of the Bill responds to public demand in Northampton to continue for a period rights of burial in a cemetery where loved ones have booked a place. Those rights are about to expire. Unless the Bill is passed, many bereaved families will be unable to bury their loved ones properly.<br/>
The Bill rationalises certain local charities and modernises the law relating to local freemen. It also repeals certain spent enactments. The Bill has completed its passage through the House of Lords and has completed all its stages here, except Third Reading. No objection was taken to it during previous stages, and the Bill went to an unopposed Bills Committee. The promoters respectfully submit that the Bill should be given its Third Reading.</p>
</speech>
<speech hansard_id="591735" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1988-11-10a.547.3" hansard_membership_id="1020" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2422" speakername="Mr. Andrew F. Bennett" colnum="547" time="19:22:00">
<p>My name appears on a blocking motion to the Bill, so perhaps I should say a few words about it.<br/>
I and several of my hon. Friends have been blocking private business for the past few days to draw attention once again to the need to reform the private business procedure. A Joint Select Committee reported on the private business procedure and made some sensible proposals. It is important that the House should be given an early opportunity to discuss that report. We hope that the Government will provide an early opportunity to amend the Standing Orders for private business. My intention in tabling the blocking motion is to persuade the Government that we should have a debate on this subject at an early stage.<br/>
Having tabled the blocking motion, I received a letter about the Bill which illustrated the need to reform the private business procedure. I suspect that, with the exception of the hon. Members for Northampton, North (Mr. Marlow) and Northampton, South (Mr. Morris), the majority of hon. Members know little about the detailed circumstances of Northampton. Therefore, we are not best placed to pass legislation dealing with Northampton. Local provision should be made in Northampton, without recourse to a Bill in the House. The private Bill procedure does not allow the people of Northampton to influence this legislation. Matters are quickly taken out of their hands and put into those of hon. Members.<br/>
I had assumed that the Bill was not opposed, because it went into an unopposed Committee. I had assumed that it was a measure that everyone in Northampton wanted. However, I received a letter from the secretary of the Kingsthorpe Grove Allotment Association, D. F. Randall, who said that the Bill was advertised last year for presentation to Parliament in the 1987&#x2013;88 Session and, as is required under the private Bill legislation, a notice appeared in the <i>Chronicle and Echo</i> in Northampton on 10 December. It stated that any local people who objected to the Bill should make representations about it. He said that

objections had to be made over Christmas, which was not convenient for many people. It was felt that local residents did not have a good opportunity to make representations about the Bill before it came to Parliament.<br/>
The writer says that the association had contacted the chief executive of Northampton council asking for explanations about clauses of the Bill, but did not receive a satisfactory reply, which is deplorable. I have no way of checking whether that is accurate, but the writer says that, despite requests for information, the chief executive was unwilling to meet the association to discuss the matter.<br/>
The association has experienced considerable difficulty in discovering what is contained in the statutes that are to he repealed. I am not in a position to judge whether the secretary of the association or the chief executive is right in these matters, but I should like an assurance from the hon. Member for Northampton, South that the repeal of 11 local Acts will not lead to a loss of local footpaths or rights in the area. That is the burden of the letter from the secretary of the association ane from two other people in Northampton.<br/>
Those local Acts go back to the fourth Bill of the reign of Henry VII and An Act for the Convent of Saint Andrew in Northampton. Most of them conferred a right of way and access to commons in Northampton. It has been suggested to me that by passing this legislation those rights and footpaths will be removed. If I am wrong, I shall happily give way to the hon. Member for Northampton, South and accept his assurance and that of the promoters that not one footpath will be lost.</p>
</speech>
<speech hansard_id="591736" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1988-11-10a.548.0" hansard_membership_id="9530" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/30514" speakername="Mr. Michael Morris" colnum="548" time="19:22:00">
<p>I am surprised that the hon. Gentleman has received such a letter, because the interested parties made representations to my hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, North (Mr. Marlow), myself and the chief executive, and meetings were held to consider the Bill. I have corresponded with the chief executive, following at least two requests from my constituents. I cannot give the assurance that the hon. Gentleman wants, first, because it is not in my constituency and, secondly, because although he has had time to raise this point with me he has not done so. If he had done so this afternoon, I could have made a telephone call. If he had given me notice, I should have been delighted to give him the assurance that he wants. All the people of Northampton, the elected representatives of the Labour party, the Conservative party and the minority parties take footpath rights extremely seriously, and I cannot believe that any action would be taken that would undermine those rights.</p>

<speech hansard_id="591737" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1988-11-10a.548.1" hansard_membership_id="1020" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2422" speakername="Mr. Bennett" colnum="548" time="19:22:00">
<p>I am disappointed that the hon. Gentleman cannot give me the assurance I want. While I continue my speech, perhaps he will have a word with the agents of the promoters to see whether they can give that assurance. As I understand it, they are normally in a position to brief hon. Members who are sponsoring a Bill. I am surprised that the hon. Gentleman accepted responsibility for sponsoring the Bill without understanding what it would do. That illustrates my original point. If the hon. Gentleman introducing the Bill does not understand it sufficiently to be able to give assurances about footpaths, we are in a difficult position.</p>
</speech>
<speech hansard_id="591738" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1988-11-10a.548.2" hansard_membership_id="9530" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/30514" speakername="Mr. Michael Morris" colnum="548" time="19:22:00">
<p>The hon. Gentleman seeks to bowl a fast ball at 7.29 pm with a letter that I have not seen, but which is presumably genuine. He had plenty of


time to tell me about it earlier. The main emphasis of the Bill is on a cemetery. The other elements are subsidiary matters flowing from a perfectly normal tidying-up process. I accept that the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett) has a deep and genuine interest in the Ramblers Association, and it is perfectly justifiable for him to pursue that interest in the House. Nevertheless, it would have been courteous to warn me that he would seek reassurance on that matter. I shall, however, do my best to double-check the situation in the next few moments.</p>
</speech>
<speech hansard_id="591739" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1988-11-10a.549.0" hansard_membership_id="1020" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2422" speakername="Mr. Bennett" colnum="549" time="19:22:00">
<p>I apologise if I did not give the hon. Gentleman sufficient notice. I assumed that he would be able to answer questions of that kind. That is precisely the problem with private business. I objected to the Bill, not because I had taken the trouble to consider its merits, but as a means of pressing for time to debate the private business procedure, which I regard as entirely unsatisfactory.<br/>
Having put down the blocking motion last week, I received a phone call on Monday from an individual asking me to raise certain objections to the Bill. I explained that I could not deal with the matter on the telephone, but that if I received a written submission I would consider it. The documents arrived in this morning's post. Had I not been on a Statutory Instruments Committee, I might have had time to pursue the matter this morning. The hon. Member for Northampton, South will appreciate that Members of Parliament have many responsibilities.<br/>
I have a feeling that people come to me about matters relating to private business because I understand the procedure, so I tend to get dragged into situations of this kind. All that I am doing today is suggesting to the House that it is high time we reformed the procedure so that we do not end up with debates of this kind in which I have to raise questions about footpaths in Northampton, when I have very little time in which to consider the Bill.</p>

<p>I simply wish to reinforce the point made by my hon. Friend for Northampton, South (Mr. Morris), that the most important aspect of the Bill, and the reason why it is being presented, is to allow certain burials to take place in the graveyard in future. It is probable that such burials would need to go ahead at the rate of about one per month, so if the Bill is delayed many people who have lost their loved ones will be deprived of the right to bury them according to their wishes. I am sure that the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett), as a caring and compassionate Member of the House, will take that into account and do what he can to facilitate the progress of the Bill now that he has received the undertaking that he sought.</p>

<p>I appreciate that point. It illustrates the faults in the private legislation procedure. Had Northampton council produced legislation simply to deal with cemeteries, I should not have received a letter

requiring me to seek assurances about footpaths. In fact, someone in the council offices pointed out that a local Bill of this kind cannot be promoted very often because of the pressures on parliamentary time and the pressures of promoting such a Bill, and a whole host of other little bits are then put into the Bill, making it far more complicated for local people to consider. That is where the procedure starts to go wrong. We end up with a Bill, the primary purpose of which is to ensure that a cemetery remains open and burials can continue to take place&#x2014;I appreciate all the reasons for that&#x2014;but which has all kinds of other pieces of legislation tacked on to it.</p>

<p>An assurance has been given, but how do we know that it will come into effect if it is not in the Bill? Perhaps my hon. Friend can reassure me, as I am somewhat sceptical.</p>

<p>The assurance about footpaths and commons is thus as good as one written into the Bill and I do not query it. I merely stress that this is not the right way to proceed in legislating either for the cemeteries in Northampton or for the footpaths there. The best people to make those decisions are the people of Northampton, who have the necessary detailed knowledge.<br/>
As I shall make clear on one of the carry-over motions, it is extremely important that the new procedures recommended for private business should be introduced at the earliest possible moment. We should then not need to have what I regard as a series of thoroughly unsatisfactory debates. Looking around the Chamber, I see several hon. Members who were here on Tuesday night. I cannot believe that many of them found that debate satisfactory. Having obtained the necessary assurances about the Bill before us, I merely seek to impress upon the House the need to reform the procedures for private business as soon as possible.</p>

<p>I was not here on Tuesday night when two other Bills and carry-over motions were debated, so I come new to the subject, but I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett) that it is unsatisfactory to have a debate on what is simply a carry-over motion.</p>

<p>I am sorry, Mr. Speaker. The others were carry-over motions, but this is a Third Reading, so it may be better if I keep my comments on carry-over motions for the next debate.<br/>
It is extremely difficult for hon. Members to know exactly what is going on with all the various private Bills. I find no difficulty in coming new to this Bill and listening to the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish, who expressed genuine concern


about the possible blocking of footpaths and access to commons. I was glad to hear the hon. Member for Northampton, South (Mr. Morris) give what I understood to be a categorical guarantee that nothing of the kind would happen, but that should have been made clear in the Bill much earlier. If there is any fault in the procedure for private Bills on Third Reading, it is perhaps that insufficient time has been left for my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish to allay the worries of ramblers and others about access to footpaths. Matters of that kind should have been made clear well before Third Reading. We could then stick to the real purpose of the Third Reading debate&#x2014;whether to take the Bill and like it, with all the various powers that it includes, or not to like it and not to take it. <i>[Interruption.]</i> Does the hon. Member for Southwark and Bermondsey (Mr. Hughes) wish to intervene?</p>

<p>The other problem with the private Bill procedure is that it tends not to be honest. I will explain what I mean by that. People tend to make speeches for reasons connected not so much with the Bill before the House as with others that may follow. I do not suggest that any such thing is happening today, but that it a perfectly honest procedure with a clear purpose and one that has doubtless been used in the House for many years. I am not sure whether my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish can give me an immediate answer, as he has already spoken once and would need the leave of the House to speak again, but can he encapsulate in two or three sentences why he thinks that the private Bill procedure is unsatisfactory?<br/>
If a Bill commands general support, by and large the Bill is passed. Sometimes people want to delay a Bill because they want to block debate on a later Bill. However, I do not believe that any Bill that should be passed has not been passed reasonably quickly. If such a Bill has been delayed, it has been only for a few days or weeks at most. However, some Bills do not receive the general support of the House. It might be that a particular group feels that there is something nasty about the Bill and they do not want it to be passed. If such an opinion is represented by only a small group, that group does not have its way. However, it has a little power because it can delay the Bill for more than a few days or a few weeks.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish has probably tabled more blocking motions than any other Member. He knows more about such tactics than the rest of us put together. However, at the end of the day hon. Members cannot stop a Bill unless a majority vote for that. They simply have the power to delay it. Because the promoters wish the Bills to be dealt with speedily, they tend to see sense. Opposition concentrates their minds. That is a positive aspect of the procedure on private Bills. If I had a well-founded objection to a Bill, and I shouted "Object" to block the Bill, the promoters and their colleagues would soon ask me why I objected and whether there was any way in which they could overcome my objection. Such a practice is not followed by the Government&#x2014;certainly not a Government with such a large majority. They do not take any notice of anybody.<br/>
If the promoters of a Bill believe that an hon. Member has serious worries about it, they will try to discover the

reasons. If they feel that an hon. Member is merely deploying certain tactics to block another Bill, they will put up with that, provided that their Bill is passed at the end of the day. If an hon. Member seriously feels that there is something wrong with the Bill, the promoters will ask whether they can help to alleviate the concerns and attempt to discover whether there is any common meeting ground between the parties. It is good that we are having a short debate on this Bill. Already the promoter has given a categorical assurance that no footpaths will be blocked and ramblers can continue to use them.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend asked whether, in a few words, I could explain what was wrong with the private Bill procedure. I cannot. The Joint Committee on Private Business has published a report, and anyone who reads it will see the recommendations for reform of the procedure. When we reach the carry-over motion for the next Bill, I shall say more about that and illustrate why the report argues that we should not regularly give permission for Bills to be carried over. I do not wish to say anything more about the Bill now before us.</p>

<p>I, too, will not say a great deal more. We occasionally have to deal with carry-over motions and I shall refer further to those in our later debates. There appears to be general assent for Third Reading of this Bill. I await with interest to hear whether the sponsor and other hon. Members think we should give it a Third Reading.</p>

<p>I shall be brief. I have visited Northampton on several occasions, but I do not intend specifically to comment on the details of the Bill, although I welcome the concessions made by the hon. Member for Northampton, South (Mr. Morris).<br/>
The wider issue of how we deal with private Bills will come before us later, but I think it appropriate at this time to make one or two comments. We are in the last days of this Session of Parliament, and I feel it appropriate to say that this House sits longer, by the hour, than any other legislature in the world. We are miles ahead, and the other place is second only to us. One reason that we sit for so long is that we must deal with a great deal of business that, quite honestly, would be better dealt with elsewhere. Because we do not have a devolved system of legislation, as do many other countries, it cannot be dealt with elsewhere. Because there is no forum for debate in Scotland, Wales the regions and the counties, it must be dealt with here. I am sure that a more informed debate would take place if a Bill such as this, dealing exclusively with Northampton matters&#x2014;or, indeed, any of the others listed for debate tonight&#x2014;were debated in places other than the House.<br/>
Of course, if we were debating the Channel tunnel&#x2014;the Bill was hybrid, being part private and part public&#x2014;the House would be the proper forum because the matter would be of national importance. However, in general, private legislation is specific to the area in question, as are the Bills before us tonight.<br/>
I admit that I have not read the report in detail, although I understand its general tenor. I hope that we will soon consider the inter-relationship of our procedures, which certainly need reforming, with the constitutional structures within which we force ourselves to debate


matters that would more appropriately be debated elsewhere. We should consider what to do about our constitution so that we do not have to deal with matters that would he better dealt with in the nations and regions of the United Kingdom.<br/>
Whatever we do, and for as long as we have a procedure that ensures that legislation goes through this and another place, there should be a proper way in which representatives&#x2014;either through interest or as constituency Members&#x2014;of those affected by the Bill can make their views felt and, if necessary, delay specific legislation so that their concerns may be partially met. The opportunity for a Bill to be challenged by local representatives of the area affected is appropriate for debate, whatever the Bill. Whatever new procedures might be devised in the new Session of Parliament, I hope that that aspect will be retained.</p>

<p>I should like to speak briefly and suggest that we should consider carefully whether to consent to the carry-over motion. We should consider this issue carefully because the Select Committee on Procedure stated that it did not feel that carry-over motions were a satisfactory device and that if we are to continue to have private legislation, in normal circumstances attempts should be made to ensure that the private legislation completes its passage through the House in one Session or in two at the most. As the House knows, we have just had a longer than normal Session, so there should have been more opportunity for the promoters to get their legislation through than would be the case in a normal Session.<br/>
It is a good parliamentary rule that public business has to be completed in one Session and that if it is not completed in one Session it must start all over again. That means that we can proceed with business in an orderly way. If certain business is not completed by the end of the Session, it is cleared away and people will have second thoughts.<br/>
However, that procedure does not apply with private business. The argument is that the promoters will have gone to considerable expense. In some cases, the petitioners also will have gone to considerable expense in, for example, briefing counsel and possibly in appearing before the Committee. It would be unfair if at that stage the Bill were then thrown out because of lack of time and a new Bill had to be introduced.<br/>
I am sure that anyone who has read the report on private business will agree that there is clear evidence that

a lot of legislation has gone through the House under the guise of private business, although it could have been dealt with in other ways. It is high time that the House adopted the recommendations in the report and made it clear that it does not see private business as a cheap way of getting round our planning legislation or as a cheap way of promoting something that the promoters consider desirable or as a way in which local arguments can be sidelined with people who do not know the local details making the decisions. At the moment the procedure is a farce in that any hon. Member who serves on a private Bill Committee must have no knowledge of what is going on, yet that person has to sit in an almost quasi-judicial capacity.<br/>
Therefore, the House should consider carry-over motions carefully. I hope that my hon. Friends will make it clear that, if this carry-over motion is carried, they will not expect any more carry-over motions for the Port of Tyne Bill <i>[Lords];</i> they will expect the legislation to be completed within the next few months. Indeed, by this time next year we expect private business to be so reformed that carry-over motions will be brought before the House only rarely, if at all.<br/>
I want undertakings from the Government that they will facilitate the opportunity for a debate on the report and that they will bring forward amendments to the Standing Orders so that we can introduce a new procedure at an early stage. I am disappointed that the Leader of the House is not in his place because I had hoped that he would give that undertaking. I raised this matter with him at business questions today and he said that he thought that he would be able to find time for an early debate before the Government had produced their response to the Select Committee. However, he did not give any further undertakings about how soon the debate would take place. I understand that there are rumours that it might be in January or in early February.<br/>
I am not sure whether the Chairman of Ways and Means is in a position to intervene in the debate and to give us some sign of how he, as Chairman of Ways and Means, feels about whether the new procedure will be debated and introduced. I am well aware that he has taken a great deal of interest in the setting up of the special Committee to investigate procedures. Indeed, he gave evidence to the Committee. I am also well aware that you, Mr. Speaker, have in the past taken a great deal of interest in private business and that you are aware of many of its problems.<br/>
I hope that there will be an early opportunity for a debate. I should have preferred the Government to give us that assurance, because I put it to the Whips that if such a Government assurance had been forthcoming, I should not have had to press very much more tonight in regard to the other carry-over motions and the Government might be able to get back to their business at an early stage. However, it does not look as though anyone will offer me those assurances.<br/>
Although the Government have had time to consider the private Bill procedure, one is left with the slight suspicion that they still have an enthusiasm for private business because they sometimes seem almost to resort to it. The county council "jumbo" Bills are an example of the Government seeming to implement their legislation through private business. I am sure that anyone who listened to the debates on Tuesday night would have been left with the suspicion, especially if they looked at the


voting figures, that those two Bills relating to the import of coal were being promoted with clear Government support. Those Bills should not have been considered as private legislation. They should have been dealt with through planning applications in the locality and if it was necessary, for the country, to take a policy decision to import coal, that should be done through public rather than private legislation.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman knows far more about procedure generally than I do. My question relates exactly to the matter that he has raised.<br/>
Has it traditionally been the policy and the procedure of the House that the Government should take a Government line on private Bill matters when there is an alternative way of dealing with the issue by normal resolution at county or other level? I remind the hon. Gentleman of the example of the Hampshire (Lyndhurst) Bypass Bill which interfered with the legislation on the New Forest. That issue could have been dealt with by amendment of statute, but a private Bill was enacted. Although it has since died, the Government intervened to ensure that the Bill was given a Second Reading with Government votes. That Bill was very much a breach of the policy of protecting the New Forest. We have seen other examples. As a matter of history, is there a pattern to suggest that the Government should not intervene in that way and seek to impose their policies?</p>

<p>I appreciate that point, Mr. Speaker. The Port of Tyne Bill illustrates the problem of private legislation because in so far as the port is being extended as a result of legislation that should be covered by local planning procedures. However, as far as certain harbour works and alterations to the coastline are concerned, such as the placing of buoys, such matters have traditionally been dealt with by private legislation. I am not convinced that it is necessary to use private legislation for such matters. The planning aspects should be done through planning procedures and it would be perfectly reasonable to have special orders to deal with the harbour works. That is investigated in the report on the reform of private business procedure.<br/>
For most of last century and before, the House spent a great deal of time on private legislation, but since the introduction of local government planning legislation in 1947 the need for private business seems greatly diminished. Now it is almost a historic carry over. Last century there was a great deal of wheeling and dealing on private legislation. A Bill was introduced for a railway from London to Birmingham and a bribe had to be offered to the people of Northampton that the railway would not go through Northampton so that the then Member for Northampton would not cause a fuss in Parliament and stop the legislation. The people of Northampton wanted to keep the railway as far from the town as possible and certain noble interests wanted to keep the railway off their land. On the other hand, certain private landowners managed to get their own private railway station through

private business. But throughout that wheeling and dealing the Government were supposed, at least officially, to remain neutral. In private business the Government did not whip or organise.<br/>
I have been in the House since 1974 and the firm tradition has been that private business was the business of Members, and not a matter on which the Government or Opposition issued Whips, although there were occasions when individual Members issued Whips. In answer to the hon. Member for Southwark and Bermondsey (Mr. Hughes), it is only recently that the Government have adopted an attitude on private Bills. The best example of whipping on private business is the Felixstowe Dock and Railway Bill, and we saw the same process on some coal measures. The Government have an opportunity to express their view in Committee and it is then that they should do so.<br/>
It is high time that we got round to introducing this legislation. I am disappointed that tonight the Government cannot assure us that they will get on with the reform of private business and that carry-over motions will be a thing of the past. We have before us a whole series of carry-over motions, and I appeal to the Government Front Bench to have a word with the Leader of the House and suggest that the sooner he gives assurances that we shall have an early opportunity to debate the report on private procedure, the less need there will be for my hon. Friends and me to chivvy the Government and complain about this procedure.<br/>
I hope that tonight we can at last give an indication to the promoters and the Government that we are not satisfied with carry-over motions, and issue a warning to anyone thinking about presenting private business next Session that we shall expect them to complete it in one Session, and not to plan for a carry-over motion. If the matter is non-controversial, why has it taken nine months to get the Bill so far? If, on the other hand, it is controversial, should we be dealing with it? We should not.<br/>
I hope that at an early stage the Government will give us better assurances that these procedures will be reformed.</p>

<p>The Bill has passed unopposed through the House of Lords. It redefines in up-to-date terms the duties and powers of the authority. It provides for the authority to issue general directions for ensuring the safety of vessels and persons using the dock, and it enables the harbour master to give special directions to particular vessels where necessary. The Bill contains provisions which enable the authority to regulate the placing and other related matters of lights which might interfere with the safe navigation of the channels by vessels. It seeks to increase the safety of those who use dock roads by enabling certain provisions of the general road traffic legislation to apply to those roads. It also effects an uprating of certain penalties and modernises the procedure for confirming port bye-laws. It empowers the authority to bring about the development of land within the port which is no longer needed for port purposes.<br/>
The House will know that I have no direct connection with the River Tyne. My constituency is on the Tees. I have been asked to make it clear that the two blocking motions tabled by my hon. Friends the Member for Yarrow (Mr. Dixon) and for South Shields (Dr. Clark)


were intended to enable my hon. Friends to speak with the promoters and have certain questions answered. I do not need to explain to you, Mr. Speaker, how one can get caught up with business in this House. I am having to make this statement on behalf of my hon. Friend the Member for Yarrow because he is the Opposition Deputy Chief Whip and his presence is required elsewhere. That is why he has to put up with a second-rate right-handed lieutenant.<br/>
I make this statement so that the House understands that my two hon. Friends who wish to block the Bill are happy to agree with the carry-over motion so that in some weeks' time they can clear up matters with the promoters. To seek to block a carry-over motion now would be grotesquely unfair on those who did not expect the Standing Orders of the House to be changed so suddenly.</p>

I wonder whether the Chairman will consider the following case, which may occur this year or next. Let us suppose that a carry-over motion is put forward this time next year on behalf of the promoters of the Associated British Ports (No. 2) Bill and the North Killingholme Cargo Terminal Bill. Let us suppose also that we manage to hold up those Bills for another 12 months, so that they fall within the new system. Would they have to start from afresh, rather than be carried over? There will always be Bills in the pipeline, whenever the new procedure is introduced. What will happen to those Bills when the new procedure is evolved? Will they wait continually? Each year there will be Bills waiting for carry-over motions. Unless the House accepts the argument for stopping a Bill in its tracks, the new procedure will never be implemented.</p>

We have been given the chance to listen to the views of hon. Members on this important matter, and I am pleased that there is so much interest in it. I am determined that the Joint Committee, having worked so hard and for so long, will see its labours bear fruit. We must not allow the report

The terms of the debate are strictly limited, so I cannot say&#x2014;as I should&#x2014;that the Bill will be an aid to jobs in Grimsby, which would otherwise be threatened, or that proper means for the disposal of effluent is essential and will improve the environment.

<p>I am satisfied that there will be. The Bill seeks to be an improvement on the River Humber (Burcom Outfall) Act 1986, which gave Tioxide powers to construct an outfall into the Humber to enable waste to be discharged into deeper water, where it could be more readily dispersed. That is a considerable environmental improvement and Tioxide must have an efficient means of waste disposal to safeguard jobs in the factory, which is in Grimsby.<br/>
Under the 1986 Act there had to be an agreement to protect the interests of Associated British Ports, as the conservancy authority. That agreement was not reached in time, so the Bill is an attempt to improve the position in those negotiations. It will probably be unnecessary, because agreement has been reached, although it has not been finalised. I hope that we can safeguard the Bill by allowing it to be carried over to the next Session, just in case any breakdown occurs. We should not throw away the work that has gone into the Bill.</p>

<p>Did my hon. Friend say freemen or "freemasons"?</p>
</speech>
<speech hansard_id="591825" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1988-11-10a.564.10" hansard_membership_id="3373" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2478" speakername="Mr. Brown" colnum="564" time="20:29:00">
<p>It is important to get that right. I assure my hon. Friend that I said "freemen," not "freemasons", although it would not be unusual if they had something to do with it. As far as I can tell, they are not specifically interested in the matter. Of course, as my hon. Friend would be the first to point out, one cannot always tell whether they are involved. However, that is irrelevant to the matter in hand.<br/>
Newcastle upon Tyne city council has unanimously agreed to promote the Bill, which is supported by the Labour majority, the Conservative minority and the much larger Liberal minority on the council. Incidentally, the Liberal representation on the city council is now twice the size of the Conservative representation, which shows how things are going in the north of England.<br/>
The Bill has been delayed, and it has been delayed for a good reason. It was being blocked by my hon. Friends the Members for Tyne Bridge (Mr. Clelland), for Newcastle upon Tyne, North (Mr. Henderson), for South Shields (Dr. Clark) and myself. I take careful note of the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett) about the reasonableness or otherwise of carrying a Bill over from one Session to the next, but with this Bill we have a good reason. My hon. Friends and I, who have the honour and privilege to


represent communities on Tyneside, objected to the Bill because we did not believe that it contained sufficient safeguards to protect two principles which we believed to be encapsulated in existing legislation and which were highly desirable for our communities.<br/>
First, we thought that the Bill ought to protect the right of public access to the town moor&#x2014;not just for the freemen of Newcastle but for all the citizens of Newcastle and for all those who come to visit the city. That has hitherto been the practice, although it has not been the law. We understand that such free access was intended in previous Acts, although it was not specifically stated.<br/>
We had a second objection. The Bill consolidates all previous legislation relating to our town moor which goes back 300 years and comprises a number of different Acts of Parliament. We suspected that it might enable the leader of the city council&#x2014;the city council owns the freehold, although the freemen hold the lease in perpetuity&#x2014;to bring pressure to bear on the freemen's association, which is not well funded, to sell part of the town moor for a car park or for a property development. The citizens of Newcastle feel very strongly that the town moor should be there for them to enjoy and that it should not be sold to property speculators. To prevent the leader of the council or anyone else from selling the town moor to property speculators we blocked the Bill and opened negotiations with the freemen, who wished to ensure its passage through the House.<br/>
Those negotiations have been entirely successful and we have inserted clauses that wholly protect the public right of access and prevent&#x2014;as solidly as anything could&#x2014;the alienation of the moor from the people of Newcastle. Because we argued and fought to secure those concessions, it was reasonable to delay the Bill, and it is now reasonable to carry it over into the next Session.</p>

<p>I congratulate my hon. Friend on getting such a good deal out of the promoters. However, that is no reason why Bills should be carried over in future. If the promoters know that it is difficult to obtain a carry-over, their minds will be concentrated and they will negotiate before the Bill reaches Parliament or early in its parliamentary proceedings. Because carry-over motions are now so commonplace, there is a temptation for everyone concerned in the negotiations to spin out the proceedings. I hope that in future promoters will come to the negotiating table much more quickly.</p>

<p>I wholeheartedly agree with my hon. Friend. If our perfectly justifiable requests to safeguard the moor from property developers and to safeguard public right of access to it had not been conceded, we should have held the Bill up indefinitely.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett) has made a very good point and we are right to thank him for it. I agree that he is right to hold out for safeguards and protections, but there is an additional point to be made. Not only do the promoters know that Bills can be carried over&#x2014;especially under the Tory Government, for whom carry-over motions are becoming the order of the day&#x2014;but they can milk the ratepayers of Newcastle and elsewhere. In the knowledge that they can get a carry-over motion at will, the

promoters can say, "Let us carry over the Bill for a year, or even two, and all the time we can put in bills for big fat fees." The people of Newcastle will have to foot the bill. A carry-over motion will benefit the promoters, their agents, the lawyers and all the rest who can make a fat killing by carrying-over a Bill. They might have dragged my hon. Friend to the point at which he gave way&#x2014;in this case he refused&#x2014;and they would have lined their pockets as a result.</p>

<p>I have great sympathy with that intervention. I greatly resent the amount of public money that is spent on lawyers&#x2014;unnecessarily in my view. My hon. Friend the Member for Bolsover (Mr. Skinner) touched on an apposite point. At one stage in our negotiations the city council was using its power of funding as a weapon in its negotiations with the freemen of the city. In my view, that was wrong. In all our dealings with the freemen of the city of Newcastle, they have behaved perfectly properly and, like us, have sought to protect the town moor in its existing form and prevent the encroachment of property developers. My hon. Friend the Member for Bolsover rightly hinted that others involved in public life would not have been unhappy for the Bill to have been passed in its earlier form, conceivably their enabling the alienation of open lands in Newcastle to property developers. I stand strongly against that, as do my hon. Friends who represent the city.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish referred to the abuse in the House of private business in an attempt to get round planning constraints. I wholeheartedly agree with him, although this Bill does not deal with planning matters. It is an attempt to consolidate 300 years of legislation into one Bill. Where matters such as rights of herbiage do not translate easily into modern legislation, the Bill clarifies them in as fair-minded a way as possible and the draftsmen have sought to resolve any ambiguities that exist.<br/>
My hon. Friends and I are satisfied that the Bill protects the interests of the citizens of Newcastle and that it will prove a strong safeguard to preserve the town moor in its present form, so that it cannot be encroached upon by property developers. I hope that the House will allow the Bill to be carried over into the next Session and proceed to the statute book thereafter.</p>

<p>I urge hon. Members to agree to this Bill being carried over. Many of my hon. Friends and other hon. Members will be aware that, for some considerable time, I have been urging this House to encourage London Regional Transport to go ahead with the improvement of Angel Underground station. That is precisely the purpose of the Bill.<br/>
Angel is almost certainly the worst station in the entire Underground system&#x2014;many hon. Members will have had personal knowledge and experience of that. The Bill contains a number of important measures to ensure that improvement work can go ahead. Principally those measures involve the removal of the present lifts, which work, at best, sporadically, and, at worst, not at all, and their replacement with new escalators leading to a new ticket hall and entrance to the station to be built on Islington high street.<br/>
In addition and most importantly, the Bill contains the provision for the removal of the island platform which is located in the middle of the tracks at the station and its substitution by proper normal platforms as in other stations on the Underground system. Presently the island platform is extremely dangerous, especially with the enormous increase in the numbers of people who use Angel. In recent years, in the immediate vicinity of that station a large amount of office development has taken place. That has meant that the number of people using that station has considerably increased. During the rush hour the press of people trying to get on and off the island platform has become great. The obvious danger to passenger safety should be all too clear to the House, especially on the day when we have considered the report of the inspector into the King's Cross tragedy. The safety of passengers in other stations on the Underground system should be uppermost in our minds.<br/>
The Bill will seek to put many of the problems right and it is important that the carry-over motion is passed by the House to ensure that the necessary work can take place as quickly as possible.<br/>
It is not entirely the fault of the promoters that a carry-over motion has become necessary. The Bill was tabled at a fairly late stage of the Session principally and regrettably because it took the Government some considerable time to come forward with the capital funding necessary to ensure that the work could proceed. I am delighted that that financial commitment has now been made by the Government to ensure that that work can be done, but it is a pity that it took so long for that commitment to be forthcoming. There were also lengthy discussions between London Regional Transport and the borough of Islington about the precise way in which the work should be carried out, the location of the new entrance and the detail of the necessary construction to improve the station.<br/>
All those discussions have now reached a positive conclusion and there are no outstanding petitions against the Bill.</p>

<p>Will my hon. Friend put our minds at ease so that we may be absolutely sure that there are no outstanding petitions and that all the problems have been solved? I apologise to my hon. Friend for not being absolutely in the know about what has happened to this Bill, but there are many private Bills and it is simply not possible for any Member to know exactly what is going on at any stage.</p>

<p>I can certainly assure my hon. Friend on that point. The motion specifically says that there are no outstanding petitions against the Bill. I urge hon. Members on both sides to vote for the motion. My constituents and I have asked for these works for many years. At long last, in the past year, we have secured the agreement of LRT and the funding commitments from the Government that will ensure that they can go ahead.<br/>
The station is in dire need of improvement. Safety considerations are overwhelming, and I very much hope that proceedings on the Bill can be concluded in both Houses as rapidly as possible so that the works can commence as soon as possible.</p>

<p>I am in complete agreement with the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith).<br/>
I should declare an interest as a director of a company which has recently moved to the area close to Angel tube station, in White Lion street. The building is used by more than 400 accountancy students each day. It is symptomatic of the improvement in the area that many businesses are moving into the streets surrounding the tube station, and it is only right that London Regional Transport should succeed in upgrading the station, thereby improving the conditions of houses and businesses in that part of north-east London.<br/>
I hope that the Bill will have a speedy passage and that LRT will treat safety as a priority, remembering that litter and the general lack of cleanliness helped to fuel the awful tragedy at King's Cross. The station is a disgrace at the


moment and the improvements will increase the comfort of residents and business users and of all who travel through the area. I welcome the Bill.</p>

<p>I do not intend to vote against the Bill, which, on balance, is a good one. I do not know the details of the changes to the Angel station. Perhaps the Bill's promoters or my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith) can provide me with reassurances that will enable me to vote for the Bill with enthusiasm rather than passivity.<br/>
We know LRT's record. I do not blame it for trying to cut the manpower and womanpower involved in rubbish collection, maintenance and servicing the Underground system. LRT is the monkey in the game: the organ grinder is the Department of Transport. The Secretary of State for the Environment is the man who should have resigned over the King's Cross disaster if he had had any integrity.<br/>
The Department of Transport has authority over LRT's actions. It is plain for all to see that any Bill brought forward by LRT will be coloured by the financial constraints of the Department of Transport. We now have what are called Thatcherite policies&#x2014;value for money, efficiency and no waste&#x2014;</p>

<p>My hon. Friend is right, in general terms, to be sceptical about the role of the Department of Transport&#x2014;especially that of the Secretary of State&#x2014;in the funding of LRT. The Angel tube station is on the City branch of the Northern line, which is the Cinderella of the Underground service. Many improvements in the frequency of trains and quality of service are needed, and I am already pressing the Secretary of State for them.<br/>
My hon. Friend asked about the specific works that are included in the Bill. I refer him to the estimates of expense, which have been tabled and are before the House. The overall total is nearly &#x00A3;45 million. That is the amount required to carry out these important works at Angel Underground station. That is a substantial and an adequate amount.</p>

<p>I am grateful to my hon. Friend for seeking to reassure me on these matters. The estimates come to about &#x00A3;44 million, and that is a lot of money. On the other hand, in today's world, and at today's prices, I wonder what one would get for that amount.</p>

<p>Without disputing the need for the work to be carried out at Angel station, some of us will be anxious to know whether the expenditure there will be within a far too limited budget, which will mean that the needs of other Underground stations may be neglected. Is my hon. Friend aware that unless we have an assurance that other funds will be available we shall have some hesitation in supporting our hon. Friend the Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith) because he may wish to put too many of the rather limited number of eggs in a basket that is rather too small?</p>
</speech>
<speech hansard_id="591870" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1988-11-10a.574.1" hansard_membership_id="8398" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/3027" speakername="Dr. Marek" colnum="574" time="21:02:00">
<p>I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his intervention. Perhaps he will have a chance to develop his ideas later in the debate.<br/>
We are debating a carry-over motion because certain things should have been done in a certain way and were not. That has created problems. Every hon. Member has a right to worry about what is going on and to wonder whether the &#x00A3;44 million will be spent properly. Secondly, is it sufficient to undertake specific works? I shall deal with one or two of the things that I mean.<br/>
In the past six or seven years, London Regional Transport has undertaken works in such a way as to spend the minimum amount of money necessary to get the public to use the Underground. It has not spent a penny more than was necessary, yet if it had spent a few more pennies it could have given the travelling public the comfort and the luxury that they desire.<br/>
The Underground walkways are far too narrow, and at times during the rush hour there is simply not enough room for people to get to or from the platforms. The frequency of service at some Underground stations is such, perhaps because of out-of-date signalling equipment or because there are not enough trains, that many people on the platform cannot get on the train and have to wait for the next one. In some cases people are not allowed on to the platform.<br/>
This important Bill is about the refurbishment and rearrangement of the Angel Underground station. The question that we must ask about any carry-over motion is whether the promoters of the Bill have got it right, so that the money will be properly spent and the House can give a fair wind to the motion. The other question that we must ask is whether the money will be spent in a cheeseparing way, because, given the expected increase in passenger traffic, very soon, and perhaps even before the works are completed, we shall see that the works were inadequate and that too many passengers are using the station in unsuitable conditions.<br/>
That is why we must consider whether we should allow the Bill to go through, or whether we should stop it at this stage because the House believes that the money is insufficient or is not directed appropriately and it is better to ask the promoters to think again.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Islington, South and Finsbury has persuaded me that it would be reasonable to allow the Bill to be carried over into the next Session, but I wish to ask a few simple questions. The answers may be in the Bill or may already have been given in Committee, but it is difficult for any hon. Member to know the details of a private Bill. I apologise if I ask questions to which I should know the answers, but I should like to know whether escalators will be provided from ground level to the booking hall. That is important. We should all


welcome &#x00A3;44 million being spent to refurbish the Angel station. If these questions can be answered in the affirmative&#x2014;</p>

<p>Order. I am extremely tolerant when I am in the Chair, but we are now going into deep water. I remind the hon. Gentleman&#x2014;if I may have his attention&#x2014;that this is a carry-over motion and that we are not now dealing with the details of the Bill.

<p>My hon. Friend the Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek) suggested that I intervene, and I shall do so very briefly. I shall certainly bear in mind your reminder to the House that this is a very narrow matter, Madam Deputy Speaker. I shall restrict my remarks to that narrowness.<br/>
My basic concern is about escalators and the time scale to which my hon. Friend referred. Occasionally I have to use Pimlico Underground station. During the past four or

five months, whenever I have used the station, an escalator has been closed for what is said to be repairs. I was told that it was under repair last week, the week before, the week before that and way back in June or July. I am worried that if we agree to the carry-over motion, presumably it will be quite some time before the Bill is given further, and presumably final, consideration in the next Session, and it may be that the Pimlico escalator will be waiting for months while London Regional Transport tries to make sure that the &#x00A3;40 million or so earmarked for Angel station remains available for that station.<br/>
I feel somewhat hesitant about making that point because I have quite enough to do to represent my impoverished, hard-hit Yorkshire constituency, but since the Conservatives who control the City of Westminster spend their time selling public assets for extremely small sums of money, and, presumably, travel around in chauffer-driven cars and do not know what is happening to their constituents who have to climb down a very long staircase, which must be distressing for the aged and the disabled, I feel entitled, even though my constituency is 170 miles away, to offer this very narrow point for the consideration of the House.</p>

<p>I am grateful to my hon. Friend for giving way.

<p>I have been in order from the start of my remarks.<br/>
I do not believe that we should oppose the Bill, because we should sustain the case put forward by my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith). The needs of his constituents are such that even if it leads to Angel, Islington, having a higher value on a Monopoly board, which it may as a result of the investment in his constituency, it is right that the elderly and disabled people in his constituency should have their interests served. I hope that the carry-over motion will be passed and that the legislation will move on rapidly. During the period of delay, however long it may be, I trust that London Regional Transport will find a corner of its heart, a little of its money and perhaps a trifle of its commitment to ensure that the escalator at Pimlico station is repaired after these many months.</p>

<p>I want to raise an important item which I should have mentioned earlier. It is not a detail, but is a major alteration. My hon. Friend will be aware that a London Regional Transport plan is to be published within the next few months. That will propose vital alterations to public transport in the London area. One of the suggestions is for a lozenge-shaped, fast transit system with one apex of the lozenge at Angel and the other in the south-west of London. That is a major plan for London and I wonder whether the Bill, if it is worth carrying over, will take account of any proposals that might come from that major addition to London Regional Transport.</p>

<p>I would not take up those comments, because my hon. Friend the Member for Wrexham may be causing difficulties. If he makes this matter more complex, there is a risk of delay. We must not give the Government too many things to think about at the same time. If we do, the delay will be considerable.<br/>
I do not oppose investment in transport. I have every sympathy with people who live in London, but I hope that those who live in south Yorkshire, who also need more money for public transport, will receive support. The pensioners in and around Hoober Stand, the highest point

of my constituency, have no bus service, and many of them are too old to walk the considerable distance to a bus stop. People such as that need to be considered.<br/>
If we facilitate the Conservative Members who feel that London Regional Transport should have investment, we should congratulate them on their service and support for the public sector. It is nearly as commendable as the devoted service that my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, South and Finsbury has given to his constituency. I hope that Conservative Members will accept that a higher priority needs to be shown to public transport in other parts of the country, not just to the escalator at Pimlico, but to the pensioners and disabled in rural areas who have been hit harshly by the appalling public transport policies that the Government have slavishly pursued.<br/>
I hope that London Regional Transport will have heard my comments about the escalator at Pimlico. I certainly would not wish to oppose the progress that my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, South and Finsbury's constituency desperately needs.</p>

<p>I received some helpful assurances earlier from the Chairman of Ways and Means about the principles of private Bills. The Bill gives me an opportunity to return to some of the issues raised in the special Committee's report on private business procedure.<br/>
In the previous debate we witnessed what I often refer to as the blackmail effect, whereby hon. Members can block or slow down the effect of one Bill to peddle constituency interests or other interests. That is a common feature of transport Bills, especially those introduced by British Rail. Examples of London Underground stations not functioning efficiently can be brought to the House's attention on Bills such as this. Unless the promoters improve the Bill, hon. Members may delay it.<br/>
If it is reasonable for London Transport to impose penalty fares on people who do not have tickets, surely those people should be able to impose a penalty on London Transport if its facilities are not working. We have heard examples of such failings from my hon. Friend the Member for Wentworth (Mr. Hardy), who mentioned Pimlico, and the hon. Member for Southwark and Bermondsey (Mr. Hughes), who mentioned Wapping.<br/>
The Bill should not be promoted as a local private Bill. If people are to be subjected to penalty fares if they travel on trains and buses without a ticket in London, surely the same should apply in Bristol, Manchester, Birmingham or elsewhere. If penalty fares are to be introduced, they should be made the subject of national legislation moved by the Government so that people who move from one part of the country to another know exactly what the rules

and regulations are and what the consequences will be if they do not obtain a ticket. There is no possible justification for having one scheme of penalty fares in London but another in Sheffield or elsewhere. The willingness of the House to allow carry-over motions or Bills such as this to proceed under the private Bill procedure is an encouragement to the Government not to take national measures but to allow private business to proceed in a piecemeal way.</p>

<p>One needs to consider all the issues involved while remaining in order. I have been fortunate enough to travel on trains on the continent. It was extremely useful to be able to buy one's ticket on the train. In this country, we have to pay before we get on the train. My hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett) is rightly stressing the way in which penalty fares should apply throughout the regions. South Yorkshire had an excellent bus service before it was destroyed by the Tories. London Transport should be considering the system that we previously had in south Yorkshire, which was tremendously popular with the people of south Yorkshire. The tragedy is that British Rail appears to be learning nothing. It is merely seeking ways and means of collecting money, and I do not argue with that, but if people had concentrated their minds a little more we might not have had the tragedy at King's Cross that we discussed earlier today. British Rail should perhaps consider its priorities and try to ensure that people, when travelling, are a great deal safer than they are now.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend illustrates the point. We should not be considering penalty fares in terms of piecemeal legislation of this kind. There should be one scheme for the whole country so that people who move from one area to another will know what the rules are. It seems very odd to have one set of penalties in one part of the country and another elsewhere. This is a good illustration of the need to develop national legislation to deal with the problem of fare dodgers rather than having individual Bills of this kind. It is thus a good example of a carry-over motion that we could defeat so as to remind the promoters of private Bills that they should not take the House of Commons for granted and should look for ways of developing public rather than private legislation. That would certainly be most useful.<br/>
If, on the other hand, the promoters succeed in getting their carry-over motion, they must consider how they intend to justify the penalty system contained in the Bill. The penalty for travelling on a bus or on the Docklands railway without a fare is a &#x00A3;5 fine, but on trains it is &#x00A3;10. In my experience, it is fairly difficult to get on a bus without paying a fare or having the opportunity to do so as there is usually a driver at the entrance or a conductor inside the bus to issue tickets. In most circumstances, therefore, it will be fairly clear whether a person is trying to avoid payment. Moreover, if a person does not have the necessary fare at that moment but has an urgent need to travel it is possible to explain the circumstances to the driver or conductor and hope to be allowed to pay later.<br/>
On the railways, and especially the Underground, however, the situation is far more complicated and it is fairly common for people to have to board a train without having had the opportunity to purchase a ticket. Service at Westminster tube station is generally very good, but at


11.30 or 11.45 in the evening the individual in the ticket office may be busily engaged in counting the day's takings and unwilling to issue a ticket, preferring the would-be traveller to pay at the other end. That may cause considerable difficulty for the individual who, to satisfy the conditions laid down in clause 5 of the Bill, has to prove that there was no one available to issue a ticket. Perhaps the Minister for Roads and Traffic, who is present in the Chamber, can tell us whether a person busily counting the day's takings would count as a person available to issue a ticket even though he might not wish to be distracted from his counting and if the would-be traveller lingers any longer at the window there is a good chance that he will miss the last train. The position is fairly vague.<br/>
It is often quite difficult to tell whether it will be possible to obtain a ticket at a tube station. There may be a machine issuing 50p tickets, but all the other machines may be shut down and the ticket office closed. In those circumstances, difficulties may arise under clause 5(2)<i>(b)</i>(ii). We should not be considering this legislation through the private Bill procedure. Legislation on penalty fares should be national, not local, because it would then be subject to much more vigorous scrutiny.<br/>
A private Bill may or may not be debated on Second Reading. Often it goes through without debate because no one has been alerted to its consequences. A Bill dealing with penalty fares is not really of local interest, so unless someone is especially concerned about the civil rights of individuals&#x2014;</p>

<p>I do not quite understand what my hon. Friend is saying. Will penalty fares be automatic, regardless of any mitigating defence? For example, what happens if someone decides to extend his journey? What if he were given the incorrect fare when he began his journey? Will mitigating circumstances be taken into account, or will the penalty be automatic?</p>

<p>I must be careful not to stray too far into the detail of the legislation as we are simply debating a carry-over motion. I refer my hon. Friend to clause 5, which deals with penalty fares in trains. I am sure that the fact that the wrong fare had originally been issued or that there was no one available to issue the ticket would be a reasonable defence. I am not sure whether changing one's mind during the journey would constitute a reasonable defence.<br/>
I am trying to explain why private legislation is not the best way to deal with these matters. At best, Second Reading takes place between 7 o'clock and 10 o'clock&#x2014;a maximum of three hours. If votes have taken place at 7 o'clock, even less time is available. It is much too short a time to debate such a matter as the rights and wrongs of penalty fares. Following Second Reading, the Bill goes into Committee, where petitioners are heard. If a member of the public is well organised, he may present a petition against penalty fares.<br/>
The Government have the opportunity to put their point of view, but there is no opportunity for the detailed scrutiny that a Bill would normally receive in a Standing Committee. The number of Members serving on a public Bill Committee is substantial, and each has the opportunity to table amendments. There would be real scope for those outside to make representations to their

Members of Parliament on, for example, what would constitute a reasonable defence&#x2014;the question asked by my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, South (Ms. Primarolo).<br/>
Although the public Bill procedure is not perfect&#x2014;indeed, some would criticise it&#x2014;it is far more effective than private legislation, which has a Committee of only four people who decide between different vested interests. They act almost as judges. The private Bill procedure is inappropriate for this sort of legislation.<br/>
Once a private Bill has been through its Committee stage, it returns to the Floor of the House, and I accept that, from then on, the procedure for Report and Third Reading is exactly the same as that for public Bills. There is a tendency for private Bills to be nobody's responsibility. The Government have a responsibility to put forward public Bills, and the Opposition have a responsibility to scrutinise them. The issues in Bills are then examined. Private legislation is promoted by organisations outside the House. They persuade an hon. Member to pilot a Bill through the House, and often give that hon. Member little information about it. It is then merely a matter of luck whether other hon. Members take the trouble to read the Bill.<br/>
I have been amazed at the number of occasions on which I have picked up a Bill, started to raise one or two points in the House, and then other hon. Members have raised a series of other issues because they have taken the trouble to read the Bill and see its implications. It has often been pure chance that I have taken any interest in certain Bills.<br/>
It is inappropriate to use private legislation for such a fundamental principle as whether there should be penalty fares for fare dodgers. If fare dodging is a national problem, it should be subject to national legislation.<br/>
The way in which private and public legislation can be muddled is interesting. This is a private Bill, and its promoters have tried to get it through Parliament on that basis. However, there is a problem with private legislation, and that is how to take account of inflation when setting fees. The promoters then dodge the problem by using the public Bill procedure to allow the Secretary of State, by order, to prescribe any increase.<br/>
We have a peculiar situation. Although the Bill has short-circuited the normal scrutiny of a public Bill to catch fare dodgers, when they consider whether &#x00A3;5 or &#x00A3;10 will be appropriate for all time, the promoters turn to the dodge that, in future, the Secretary of State will be able to lay an order to increase or decrease the amount. They then follow the procedure of least parliamentary scrutiny, and that is to lay an order that is subject to annulment. All hon. Members know the difficulties in praying against an order and defeating it. The process is in favour of the Government and stacked against ordinary hon. Members. If it is reasonable for the promoters of the Bill to take powers to require the Secretary of State to vary penalties from time to time, the matter should be subject to an affirmative order. It will be possible for the House to debate that point when the Bill comes back to the House.<br/>
On this occasion it would be useful for the House not to support the motion and for the Bill to be lost at this point. If London Regional Transport or any other transport undertaking considers it necessary to have penalty fares, it should lobby the Department of Transport to legislate on penalty fares so that people know exactly what is happening.</p>

<p>I echo the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett). I do not intend to detain the House for long, but I have considerable sympathy with the argument, and I can illustrate it by telling the House about my experience this week.<br/>
Earlier this week, I had to go to Bonn. I could not go the night before, because we were busy opposing another piece of private legislation even more pernicious than this one. I had to get up quite early in the morning to go to Heathrow. When I got to the Underground station, no one was there. As I had to catch the early flight to attend my meeting, I had to board the train without a ticket. Obviously, one pays at the other end. As far as I can see, one cannot get out at Heathrow without paying, and it was certainly not my intention to do so. I strongly disapprove of those who do not pay their way. There are far too many tax dodgers on the Conservative Benches for us to endorse any other view.<br/>
I had completed about three quarters of my journey when an inspector boarded the train. I explained that I could not buy a ticket because there was no one at the Underground station where my journey had begun. He was extremely courteous, and I paid my normal fare. It is wrong that even in London, where there is high unemployment, those responsible for public transport cannot employ people to sell tickets at the beginning of a journey.</p>

<p>I know from experience that my hon. Friend is impeccably dressed when he travels abroad to represent this country. I wonder what the ticket inspector's attitude would have been had my hon.

<p>As a matter of fact, a young man wearing jeans, which were not particularly new&#x2014;I think that is the most charitable way of putting it&#x2014;was in exactly the same boat and he was treated with considerable courtesy by that honourable and experienced inspector or ticket collector. However, the fact remains that that inspector could have been subject to considerable criticism and abuse because people do not like being put in a position of having to travel without a ticket simply because of the mean approach to the employment of people. As I have said, there is high unemployment even in London. It seems that our society has reached a point where adding to the labour force is regarded as almost a crime if there is any way to avoid doing so. It seems absurd for us to pass legislation that will strengthen that reluctance to employ people and to give them responsible jobs.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish is right. This is not the way to deal with matters that involve such serious principles. We should argue this approach in a proper debate, not in this travesty of a procedure where most Members of Parliament feel that, as this is a matter for London Transport, it is not for them. I believe that the principle is important, and I am delighted that my hon. Friend has suggested that we should ensure that there is a substantial debate. I hope that the Minister will comment on this matter&#x2014;</p>

<p>Well, he should, because he is saying that people are to be frequently placed&#x2014;perhaps more frequently placed&#x2014;in the embarrassing position of having to board public transport without having paid the fare and then run the risk of being criticised, embarrassed or made to feel guilty when there are no grounds for criticism, embarrassment or guilt. The Government have a responsibility, and the Minister should be asked to reconsider his negative response&#x2014;a curt shake of his head &#x2014;to my suggestion that he intervene.<br/>
There is an element of confusion in clause 5(2)(a), although perhaps lawyers in the House would not find it as confusing as I do. It seems that the Minister, or the sponsor of the Bill, may say that my point about people travelling without a ticket has been covered. Clause 5(2)(a) states:
<q>A person &#x2026; shall not be liable to pay a penalty fare under this section if at the time when and the station where he started to travel on the train service there were no facilities available for the sale of the necessary fare ticket for his journey.</q>
In other words, he may be excused.<br/>
It is a bit much that we have to pass a Bill to say that people will be excused a penalty when they are not in any way at fault. Would it not be better to ensure that such a position never arose? Would it not be better to ensure that we do not clutter the House of Commons with unnecessary private legislation when proper employment policies could be pursued? Is that not a sufficient argument for the Minister to take the trouble to get to his feet and say a word or two on the subject? He should reconsider it.<br/>
The confusion is that, while there appears to be some degree of exclusion in clause 5(2), paragraph (c) states that if a notice was displayed or an authorised person in uniform gave permission, the penalty would not be applied. If clause 5(2) is satisfactory, why do we need paragraph (c)(i) and (ii)? The Bill should be reviewed and the principles considered. London Transport and any other public transport authority should ensure that it employs a sufficient number of people so that ordinary decent citizens are not severely embarrassed.</p>

<p>Yes, I have a nice tie, and a nice pair of braces too, which I am wearing for the first time tonight. But I digress. The Minister is leading me down the wrong path.<br/>
I do not object to the carry-over motion, although I agree that this matter should be subject to national rather than local legislation. I agree, too, with my hon. Friend the Member for Wentworth (Mr. Hardy) that tickets should always be available for people when they set out on a journey. They should not be forced to travel without tickets. That relates to employment, and people should be employed in those jobs as they provide an important service.<br/>
I am worried about penalty fares and would not like them cast in stone. There must be flexibility. All hon. Members will know of cases of violence against those who work on our buses and tubes. There have been appalling cases, involving deaths. Only recently work was stopped at Leyton garage for the funeral of a bus conductor who was


assaulted and died as a consequence. I am worried that if we set penalty fares in stone they could become a reason for violence. Even if the sum involved is small, a person who does not have that small sum might think it better to hit the conductor or driver and get away without being caught. At present there is a big advertising campaign about getting a ticket rather than a criminal record, and I agree with that, but violence is connected to that.</p>

<p>Does my hon. Friend agree that if inspectors are expected to collect penalty fares, as is proposed, the inspector will end up carrying large sums if he catches many offenders? The legislation should discourage people from carrying substantial sums. The more we can persuade people to pay other than in cash, so that no one is tempted to assault an inspector and grab the money, the better. If this were national legislation, we should consider the safety of inspectors who collect penalties.</p>

<p>That is an excellent point. I agree that in the present climate vast amounts of money should not be carried around because that is almost an invitation to assault.<br/>
I have not been fully briefed by LRT&#x2014;perhaps other hon. Members have&#x2014;about potential violence and how it could flow from penalty fares. The promoters do not seem to have made that clear. For example, have the trade unions been consulted? I should have thought that that was vital.<br/>
I acknowledge that the courts have an important role to play. In general, I favour lighter penalties. I make no bones about that. This country imposes some of the heaviest penalties in Europe. I think that sentences should be much lighter. However, we should take into account the social element in sentencing and the courts must deal rigorously with assaults on bus drivers, tube workers and others in the public transport services. I am in favour of harsher sentences in those circumstances.<br/>
There is also the question of fares. At the moment, fare increases are well above the rate of inflation, and that seems to have been so for a number of years. That may mean that more people will be tempted to try to avoid paying their fares, which again could lead to potential violence. I should not object to penalty fares if they were being introduced against a background of cheap fares,

giving people no excuse for trying to avoid payment, but while fares are increasing well above inflation there is a problem.</p>

<p>Clause 8 requires a person to give his name and address if he cannot pay the penalty fare immediately.

<p>I take part in the debate as a Member sponsored by the National Union of Railwaymen, but I also have a personal interest in ensuring that the Bill is the best that can be produced. It seems to me that it would not do any harm for LRT to take the Bill away and bring it back in a much improved form.<br/>
My hon. Friends have made all the points that need to be made. It is important that those who have to exact penalty fares should not be subjected to violent attacks. Would it not be better if the system were properly staffed so that it was difficult to escape payment? That would mean that fewer penalty fares would have to be collected.<br/>
Clause 5(5) implies that a person is guilty until he can prove himself innocent. Surely it would be better to phrase that provision so that a person is deemed innocent until proved guilty. I wonder whether the employees represented by their unions have been properly consulted.<br/>
It must be in the interests of everybody that no one should get away with not paying the proper fare. That is anti-social, wrong, and it should be stopped. But should it be stopped in this way? I do not believe that the Bill is the right way forward.<br/>
It would not do any harm whatever for London Regional Transport to take the Bill away and perhaps talk to the unions, the London boroughs and people in the community to find out how they would want such a system to operate.</p>

<p>I beg to move,<br/>
<q>That the draft Consumer Protection Act 1987 (Commencement No. 2) Order 1988, which was laid before this House on 28th July, be approved.</q>
The purpose of this commencement order is simply to put into effect the provisions of the Consumer Protection Act 1987, which repeal the Trade Descriptions Act 1972. I am aware of the widespread concern that the prospect of this repeal has aroused, both publicly and in this House, since it was announced in October 1986. The issues here are more complex than they might at first appear and have not always been perfectly understood. I hope, therefore, that it will assist the House if I spend a little time outlining the background.<br/>
The 1972 Act requires goods made abroad but supplied here bearing a United Kingdom name or mark, or anything likely to be taken as such, also to be marked with a conspicuous indication of their country of origin. I should stress that the Act does not require United Kingdom-made goods, nor imported goods without markings, to be marked with their country of origin. Nor does it require goods to he origin marked as a condition of entry to the United Kingdom. This has not been required since 1968.<br/>
The 1972 Act originated as a private Member's Bill in response to fears, especially on the part of industry, that imported goods would be widely supplied under well known United Kingdom brand names which could suggest that they were of United Kingdom origin. Those fears sprang from the ending of compulsory origin marking of imported goods as a result of the Trade Descriptions Act 1968. That Act revised and reformed the then existing merchandise marks legislation, but did not re-enact the origin marking requirements of the Merchandise Marks Act 1926. The 1926 Act, first, required the origin marking of imported goods bearing the names of United Kingdom traders; and, secondly, conferred powers to require the origin marking of unmarked imported goods, either at point of sale or of import. By 1968 more than 100 such orders had been made in relation to specific goods. They were preserved for a transitional period of three years. The object of the Trade Descriptions Act 1972 was then to re-enact the principal requirement of the 1926 Act at the end of that transitional period.<br/>
That was supplemented in 1981 by the Trade Descriptions (Origin Marking) (Miscellaneous Goods) Order, which required virtually all clothing and textiles, footwear, cutlery and domestic electrical appliances to be marked with their country of origin at the point of retail supply, irrespective of whether the goods were made in the United Kingdom or abroad and whether or not they bore any brand names or trade marks. The order was made on the basis that such information was generally useful to the consumer.<br/>
Fairly soon after it was made, the order was the subject of European Community infraction proceedings and, although vigorously defended by the United Kingdom before the European Court of Justice, it was found to be incompatible with article 30 of the treaty of Rome, which prohibits barriers to imports between EC member states.

In the court's view, the effect of that legal obligation was to enable consumers to distinguish between domestic and imported goods, and thus to assert any prejudices that they might have against products solely because of national origin. This was likely to have the effect of increasing the costs of imported goods and of making it more difficult to sell them on the United Kingdom market. The court also rejected the argument that the requirement was necessary to protect the consumer. If it were advantageous For manufacturers to indicate national origin, they were quite free to do so voluntarily and legal compulsion was unnecessary. The protection of consumers was adequately safeguarded by measures prohibiting false or misleading indications of origin and these measures were not called in question by the treaty.<br/>
As the House knows, two years ago the European Community Commission commenced further formal infraction proceedings against the United Kingdom on the ground that the 1972 Act was also incompatible with article 30 of the treaty of Rome. After careful consideration of the legal position, especially the earlier decision of the court, we concluded, reluctantly, that the United Kingdom could not expect to be successful in defending the Act.<br/>
I think that it is important that the current Commission challenge is seen against that background. Article 30 of the treaty prohibits quantitative restrictions on imports between member states or measures having equivalent effect. Case law has established that this includes any trading rule enacted by a member state which is capable, directly or indirectly, actually or potentially, of hindering intra-Community trade. The treaty provides certain exceptions to this rule, but they do not include the purpose of consumer protection other than the protection of health or life. Again, however, the case law has recognised this as a legitimate purpose for national measures provided that certain conditions are fulfilled. In the context of the 1972 Act, the major considerations are that a measure must serve a necessary consumer protection requirement; that it must be proportionate to that purpose, that is to say, it must go no further than is necessary to achieve it; and that there must be no discrimination between United Kingdom goods and those of other member states.<br/>
While we and the Commission fully accept the necessity of protecting consumers from misleading indications, I am afraid that the 1972 Act clearly exceeds those conditions. To begin with, it imposes no requirements in respect of British-made goods: it applies only to imported goods, including those from other member states. The original complaint triggering the EC's challenge was from a multinational company that was the proprietor of the same trade mark in all the member states. It produced goods in a number of member states. Because it applied its own trade mark to those goods&#x2014;a "UK mark" by definition under the 1972 Act&#x2014;it was obliged also to indicate the country of origin on those goods in order that liability to prosecution would be avoided when the goods were supplied in the United Kingdom. Clearly, therefore, the Act discriminates between United Kingdom goods and goods from other member states.<br/>
While the 1972 Act may have been conceived originally to prevent the consumer from being misled about the origin of goods, in this case by using the criterion of United Kingdom names or marks, it goes considerably further than that. Virtually any name or mark used in trade in the United Kingdom falls within the definition of


United Kingdom name or mark, whether or not there is anything potentially misleading about it. Names such as Renault or Volkswagen are, as defined by the Act, United Kingdom names, and country of origin must be indicated even though there may be no question of the consumer being misled as to the country of manufacture. Such names applied to goods made here would not require origin markings. Similarly, a trade mark in the form of a logo or purely pictorial device is deemed by the Act to be potentially misleading as to origin, even in cases where it carries no such connotation. In those respects the requirement to origin mark goes further than is necessary to prevent consumers from being misled, which is a recognised consumer protection purpose.<br/>
I have spent some time explaining why it is not realistic for the Government to take this issue before the European Court of Justice. I have done so because I believe that this may not have been fully appreciated when the issue came to a head in late 1986, and in subsequent exchanges in the House during the passage of what is now the Consumer Protection Act 1987, when there was a feeling that the Government should have pressed the matter to that end. I hope that I have demonstrated to the House's satisfaction that this would serve no purpose.<br/>
More positively, however, when we accepted the Commission's view of the 1972 Act in terms of EC law, we also made it clear that the United Kingdom intended to institute a successor regime, compatible with treaty obligations, to take effect upon the repeal of the 1972 Act. My predecessors made this clear in answer to a parliamentary question by my hon. Friend the Member for Southend, East (Mr. Taylor) on 1 December 1986, in subsequent answers to other hon. Members and in the debates on the then Consumer Protection Bill.<br/>
A second order, the Trade Descriptions (Place of Production) (Marking) Order&#x2014;which I will call the marking order&#x2014;was also laid before the House on 19 October to fulfil this commitment. The marking order represents the outcome of wide and lengthy consultation with interested parties, and we have also secured the acceptance by the EC Commission of its terms. Although the marking order is not the subject of this debate, it may be helpful to the House if I explain what it does.<br/>
The marking order is made under the Trade Descriptions Act 1968. This Act makes it an offence for a person in the course of a trade or business to apply a false, including misleading, trade description to goods, or to supply or offer to supply goods bearing such a description. A trade description is any indication given in respect of a range of characteristics of goods, including their place of manufacture or production. The Act does not, however, give any guidance as to the circumstances in which a possibly misleading, as distinct from a false, indication of origin should be corrected, or how that should be done. Section 8 of the Act, under which the marking order is made, confers powers to require the marking of goods with information.<br/>
The aim of the marking order is, therefore, to set out the circumstances in which a positive, corrective indication of origin is required in order not to commit an offence under the 1968 Act. The essential trigger mechanism is whether the presentation&#x2014;that is, the packaging, marking, get-up or other indications&#x2014;of goods would

create the impression that they were made somewhere other than where they were actually produced or manufactured. Regard must be had of the totality of the presentation of goods, although certain relevant indications, such as flags, names, persons and so on, are specified in the schedule to the order. Failure to mark goods in the circumstances in which this is required would amount to an offence under section 8(2) of the 1968 Act by anyone supplying or offering or exposing for supply the goods in the course of trade or business.<br/>
I outlined earlier the limits imposed by European Community law on national measures of this kind. The marking order does not protect any one national origin. It would apply to misleading suggestions of, for example, German origin as well as of United Kingdom origin. There is, therfore, no element of discrimination against other member states' goods. In European Community terms, as I have said, the 1972 Act may be attacked on the grounds that it is applicable only to imported goods and is directed only to the potential for consumers to be misled as to United Kingdom origin. Moreover, the 1972 Act relates to the use of United Kingdom names or marks per se, whether or not they necessarily suggest United Kingdom origin. The marking order is intended to apply in any circumstances in which purchasers are likely to be misled, and is therefore concerned with the totality of the presentation of goods. The use of a particular language or trade mark is not in itself to be considered as necessarily indicating a particular origin, but, taken in the context of the presentation of the goods as a whole, it may be.<br/>
The marking order has been clarified and revised in a number of ways as a result of consultation on its terms. In particular, it now requires a statement of the country of origin of goods as distinct from any other expression of their place of manufacture if the latter could in itself be misleading. If, for example, goods were marked "Made in Sheffield" when they were supplied in the United Kingdom and in reality that marking refers to one of the Sheffields in the United States of America, then the actual country of manufacture would have to be shown. I think that this should allay the concern of manufacturers who pointed to the use of specific place names on goods made elsewhere with the apparent intention of misleading.<br/>
The marking order comes into effect on 31 December this year.<br/>
I think it is fair to say that, in consultation on the marking order, interested parties&#x2014;industry, trade, consumer associations and enforcement agencies&#x2014;have generally accepted that there are now very clear limits on the scope for compulsory origin marking and that the order represents the most that is workable on a national basis, within the confines of our European Community obligations.<br/>
I am well aware, however, of continuing concern about orgin marking in the wider context, primarily about goods made elsewhere in the world which are supplied here bearing well-known European names, United Kingdom or otherwise. While such names may not in themselves indicate origin, they may well be closely associated with goods from specific countries or places. Consumers might well assume from some brand names that, for example, electrical or electronic goods were of German or Japanese origin, simply because of such generalised associations. It is not possible, as I have indicated, to go this far in our


national legislation on a unilateral basis, and the only possible solution to these outstanding concerns is a European Community regime.<br/>
Although the European Community Commission has not, in the more recent past, shown any positive enthusiasm for such an approach, it was not clear whether that reflected the views of the majority of member states. It appears that most member states have some form of regulation of origin marking. A number have modified their requirements as a result of infraction proceedings by the European Community Commission and we understand that several currently face such proceedings in respect of their national legislation. In the light of this, we decided that a way forward might be to establish whether there is any consensus among member states on the desirability of a Community origin marking regime. Such a regime might, of course, take one of a number of forms &#x2014;for example, a Community-wide requirement, along the lines of the 1972 Act, requiring the country of origin to be indicated when imported third-country goods have the names or marks of persons carrying on business within the Community. I have received a good measure of support from United Kingdom industry for such an initiative, and it is one which I am pursuing. I have written both to the Commission and to my opposite numbers in the other member states on this issue. However, I have to warn the House that progress will be neither easy nor speedy. I have spoken at some length about the past, present and future considerations surrounding these developments&#x2014;</p>

Whether or not it would be for the Department of Trade and Industry to play any part is quite another matter.

<p>I congratulate the Minister both on his appointment and on the passion and eloquence with which he moved this interesting order. He is positively becoming an oratorical Demosthenes of orders. It could not have happened to a nicer guy.<br/>
The order shows the reality of grovelling subservience to the Common Market that lies behind the Government's oratorical flourishes against the Market. We see the

spectacle of the Prime Minister going round in the broad light of day making loud anti-Common Market and anti-communautaire noises so that she is becoming almost the football hooligan of Europe. It is reported that, when President Mitterrand was asked why he has bilateral talks all the time with the West German Chancellor and does not include Mrs. Thatcher, he said, "Because she disturbs us." That is the noise that the Prime Minister is making for home consumption to conceal the reality of grovelling subservience that we see in the order tonight.<br/>
We see that subservience in the abdication over the Cloft scheme for aid to the wool industry and we saw it when the aid for Rover was reduced. We see it in the VAT debacle because VAT has to be imposed on new construction. We see it in the increased taxation on beer to bring it up to the level of wine, in the way that the Single European Act was rushed through the House and in the way in which the increase in contributions has been conceded almost without a murmur despite the fact that last year our net contribution to the budget was &#x00A3;1&#x00B7;7 billion. All that is the reality of subservience behind the Prime Minister's loud anti-European noises.</p>

<p>The answer is straightforward. The Prime Minister is doing this as a tactic for home consumption in order to conceal her own subservience to the EC which is illustrated in this order.<br/>
Effectively the Common Market has got us by the rebates. A rebate was conceded to Britain as a gesture, but it was not accompanied by any reform of the fundamental financial basis of the Common Market. We can be threatened with revocation of that rebate and the Prime Minister can be kept in line. She gets that rebate quamdiu se bene gesserit.

<p>I apologise, Mr. Speaker. If the Prime Minister does not obey the instructions and accept the humiliations that are forced on her by the EC, the rebate will be effectively revoked. Tonight, in this order, we are rushing to submit&#x2014;without even being instructed to submit&#x2014;to what we think the European Court will want us to do. There can be no procedure more humiliating than that.<br/>
The 1972 legislation that we shall eliminate through this order was right and fair, has worked well and is a vital piece of consumer protection. It is an opportunity for people to encourage domestic industry by discriminating in their choice against imports. It is a right for those who want to say, "I would rather support jobs in this country than pay increased taxation to support the large numbers of unemployed generated by the scale of imports,


particularly from the EEC." The EEC has about 40 per cent. of the car market in this country and it is people's right to discriminate against that in their choices.<br/>
It is also people's right to discriminate against regimes of which they do not approve. I draw attention particularly to the question of the boycotts by individuals or Governments of South African produce. That is one way of bringing that country to make concessions domestically. South Africa needs a trade surplus to offset the huge cost of capital flight and its debt repayments. If Governments will not do that&#x2014;and Governments should do that&#x2014;the consumer should have the right, by knowing that the origin of goods is South African, to discriminate against them. We can discriminate through the 1972 legislation against manufactured articles that come into this country from South Africa&#x2014;the kitchenware, plastic goods, paper, printing, textiles and finished garments. There is a right and a principle case for consumers to be able to discriminate against goods of whose origin they disapprove and thus bring effective pressure to bear on those regimes. That right is effectively eliminated by the order.<br/>
The order also eliminates information behind consumer choice. Consumer organisations have objected to the repeal of the 1972 legislation because the information that allows consumers to choose is important. Consumers need to know where the materials that they buy come from. All that choice, discrimination and educational information sanctioned by the 1972 Act will be struck down. Although that Act was a private Member's measure, it was actively supported by the Government. The Under-Secretary for Trade and Industry at that time, the right hon. Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury (Mr. Ridley), spoke of it as
<q>a Bill which is not in conflict with our international obligations or, indeed, the whole drift of thinking on world trade".</q>
He said that the Bill should be supported for the right reason because
<q>it would afford a greater measure of protection against deception of the consumer, and I commend it to the House.</q>
He also said:
<q>For example, a consumer might want to buy British goods instead of South African goods because he is patriotic or because he is antipathetic towards the country concerned. That is a valid reason for a consumer's choice".</q>
That reason for consumer choice is being removed. The right hon. Gentleman went on to say:
<q>As far as I know, the Common Market Commission has not proposed any common action on this and has no direction under consideration. It is a matter left primarily to individual nations.</q>
When the then hon. Member for Sheffield, Hillsborough, Mr. Darling, commented
<q>I do not think that issues of this sort appear in the Rome Treaty. I am sure that if there is any contravention the Under-Secretary will tell us.</q>
the right hon. Gentleman replied:<br/>
<q>No."&#x2014;[<i>Official Report,</i> 25 February 1972; Vol. 831, c. 1682 and 1734.]</q>
I do not know whether that was a case of the right hon. Gentleman being his normal, helpful self and refusing to answer the question. I take it that he meant that that did not contravene the treaty of Rome, yet that is exactly why we are now repealing this legislation. It is humiliating for

this country to have to repeal valid legislation in that fashion without even being told or instructed to do so. We are doing so voluntarily, as a submissive offering.<br/>
As it was projected in 1972, when we were told that it did not contravene the treaty of Rome&#x2014;although we are now told that it does contravene the treaty of Rome&#x2014;it was just another item on the agenda of deceit that was presented to the country to persuade it to join the Common Market in 1972. It was on a par with Lady Tweedsmuir in the other place saying that there would be a veto over fishing legislation. It was on a par with the pamphlets that were distributed saying how much better off we would be and how much better the weather would be if we entered the Common Market.<br/>
The Minister has told us the sad saga that has forced us to withdraw valid and important legislation passed in 1972. The order of 1981 was struck down under article 30 of the treaty of Rome. It is nonsensical because one of the countries that objected to that was West Germany which is foisting on the Common Market butter imports from East Germany, with no hint of their origin, as if they were produced in the Common Market. It is nonsensical because this country has a higher proportion of its domestic markets taken by imports&#x2014;particularly EEC imports&#x2014;than any other country within the EEC. Yet our legislation is attacked in this fashion and our Government rush to submit to the EEC before they have even been asked.</p>

<p>My party supported the legislation in 1972 for a number of very good reasons which the hon. Gentleman will see if he reads the debate. Therefore, he is incorrect.<br/>
The Government are incorrect to submit to the Common Market before being asked. It is not as if the European Court which struck down the 1981 order was a body dedicated to the pursuit of abstract justice or to a serious consideration of the issue. The European Court, which this country has an instinctive tendency to obey, is machinery for pursuing European federalism, for advancing the case of a stronger, more united Europe. That is its commitment. It is not a legal court deciding on the abstract justice of the case. Its purpose is to advance European unity, and it is doing that through this kind of legislation. Therefore, we should not rush to submit to that court or to its decisions.<br/>
Other countries have a long backlog of judgments against them on which no action has been taken by the Governments concerned. As the Minister pointed out, other countries in the Common Market&#x2014;and I wish that he had listed them&#x2014;have origin marking legislation which has been left intact and which has not been struck down in the way that our legislation has, although our country imports most from the EEC. Other countries have various ways of getting around the decisions of the European Court, particularly through legislation passed at regional level or decisions taken at regional level by the German lander, for example, which the court is very slow to deal with. Yet we rush to obey the European Court as if it were some abstract decision on the justice and merits of the case. It is not, and we should not rush to obey it before being asked.<br/>
We have tied our own hands by passing the European Communities Act 1972. If we continued to enforce the law of 1972, and if an importer contested or defied that law, we could not bring him before our courts because our courts would have to rule that European law was superior to ours, because of the European Communities Act 1972. That is the humiliation. The Prime Minister should do something about that matter rather than talking a lot of hot air about her sentiments on the Community when our hands are tied. She should be tackling that issue. Only on that basis can she say what she does.</p>

<p>Personally, I would take the cash in hand and waive the rest. But if the hon. Gentleman had been listening to what I was saying, he would have realised that that is not in any sense what I am arguing. The Prime Minister is beating the anti-Market drum and whipping up support at home while the Government are submitting to every humiliation that the Commission lays before us. The only way to create a certain amount of distance, which we will have to create if we are to rebuild British industry and make the economy strong, is to repeal section 2 of the European Communities Act 1972. It is the Prime Minister's decision, not mine. That action should be behind her words, particularly when we remember that we have turned the 1970 surplus in manufactured trade, which at today's valuation would be about &#x00A3;4 billion, into a deficit which is this year running at &#x00A3;14 billion on an annualised rate. That is a turnround of &#x00A3;18 billion in manufactured trade and represents the export of more than 1 million jobs to the EEC. In spite of that, the Minister is asking us to submit to the humiliation of repealing our own legislation before we are even asked to do so.<br/>
The Government have twisted and turned on origin marking. They have tried to decide what to do and have held consultations. The order that is still to come is the Government's fig leaf. They have been saying, "Don't press us on this issue. We shall produce something good." Fortunately, we shall have a chance to debate that issue again, and that is welcome. I am worried about what the Government will put in place of the Trade Descriptions Act 1972. I do not think that it will be adequate. An order under the Trade Descriptions Act 1968 deals with goods only if they are presented in such a way as to deceive the purchaser about where they are produced. The new legislation might be called the Amstrad order. What will the order do about Amstrad or Ford cars which are not made in Britain? What will it do about Vauxhall&#x2014;a British name&#x2014;cars, most of which are imported from the EEC? We are worried about what the effects of the legislation will be. It will be no satisfactory substitute for the 1972 legislation, which we should not have rushed to strike down in this way.<br/>
The 1972 Act has served us well. It is humiliating for the Government to strike it down. We do not propose to support them in their humiliation. We are against the repeal of the 1972 legislation. Rather than voting against them, we propose to subject them to the more exquisite torture of letting them dangle in their own wind for their own supporters to deal with. I do not propose to embarrass the hon. Members who signed the amendment, which has not been called. I am sure that those hon. Members will have the courage of their convictions. I do not propose to embarrass them by bringing the Opposition into play in their support because that might frighten them off. They might be afraid that they will defeat the Government. I want them to have the guts to vote in support of the views expressed in the amendment, which is right. They can do it. They can resolve the Government's schizophrenia in the only way it can be resolved&#x2014;within the Tory party itself.</p>

<p>Most of us are delighted to see my hon. Friend the Minister on the Front Bench, knowing that he has made some dramatic and impressive speeches from the Back Benches. However, he gave the impression tonight that perhaps his heart is not in his case. I may be entirely wrong. It is fair to say that having a debate of this magnitude late on a Thursday gives the impression that no one will be aware of it or take note of it, except possibly that splended organisation on Radio 4, "Yesterday in Parliament".<br/>
It is interesting to see the number of Conservative Members present at what would otherwise be a debate in the presence of three or four of the old faithful. That shows that Conservative Members are beginning to become worried&#x2014;my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister spoke of this in Brussels&#x2014;about the transfer of power to Brussels and decisions of Parliament being changed by foolish bureaucratic decisions.<br/>
We should appreciate what we are being asked to do. We are being asked to repeal, root and branch, an Act that was passed unanimously by Parliament in 1972. It was supported by Ministers because it made a major contribution to consumers. It provided them with information, it was not in conflict with our international obligations and, most important, it afforded the consumer a greater degree of protection against deception. We are repealing an Act that every hon. Member supported because it was good for consumers and because it gave information that would help them. We are chucking out that legislation and destroying it because of the views of the non-elected EEC Commission.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Minister will know that it does not matter whether the order is approved or rejected. The Government do not have the power to implement the 1972 law because of the Commission's views, and because of a decision of the European Court. To that extent, the order is irrelevant, but it is important constitutionally.<br/>
Why are powers being taken away from the people? Why should housewives not know where goods are made? Why do they want to know? Ministers have said that, for different reasons, people might want to support British industry. The marking of goods created jobs and helped our trade balance. It encouraged British industry, and we should be concerned about that at a time when the Government's economic policy is being put at risk by a trade deficit, almost all of which is with the EEC.<br/>
Some people have prejudices and do not like certain foreign countries. Some do not like the Soviet Union, or South Africa, and say, "Given the choice, I should prefer not to buy goods made in that country." Some, for good or bad reasons, think that goods made in certain countries are reliable, but that those made in others are not. Many of our constituents take such decisions daily.<br/>
Why is that right of choice being destroyed. The EEC Commission said that
<q>it enabled consumers to assert any prejudices that they might have against foreign products.</q>
If consumers are told the truth, how will it distort trade in Europe? If something is made in France, Germany, Japan or Taiwan, why should consumers be denied that information by the action that we are taking tonight? Why

should the unanimous decision of Parliament be overturned merely because of the views of the EEC Commission?<br/>
There is another aspect of the matter about which colleagues will be genuinely concerned. We have recently witnessed the changes in the EEC's powers to deal with dumping. Dumping used to be selling goods cheaper than cost price or the price charged on the home market. The Commission has extended that to market share. Before the Trade Descriptions Bill was approved by Parliament on 25 February 1972, the Government were asked specifically, because we were contemplating membership, whether it would be contrary to the treaty of Rome. The clear and precise answer given was that it would not be contrary in any respect.<br/>
The action that we are taking tonight is important constitutionally. Whether we approve the order or not, the Act will be dead because of the Commission's decisions. What we do tonight does not matter at all.<br/>
On the other hand, it is vital for us to realise what is happening to our country and our sovereignty. EEC bureaucracy, which is non-elected, is requiring the British Parliament to overturn a measure designed to inform and protect consumers which we passed after weeks of debate. To that extent, what we are doing is serious and we are right to draw attention to what is happening.<br/>
I hope that the Prime Minister's words in Bruges will reflect a change in our attitude towards the EEC. We are in the Common Market and we really have no way of leaving. The only country to leave was Greenland, and it got out only by getting a Bill passed in every member state, and that could never happen to us. We must get away from the situation in which a non-elected body can tell individual member states, for no good reason, to abandon legislation. This is bureaucratic law rather than parliamentary law.<br/>
What is achieved by denying information to consumers? Does it restrict trade to tell people that goods are made in, say, Japan or Taiwan? People should be told the truth. That is what the previous measure did and, in doing that, it served a useful purpose. If a referendum were held in Britain asking people if they wanted to know where goods were made before they purchased them, the vast majority would say yes.<br/>
Tonight we are making a major change in our constitution. An encouraging aspect is that, while, sadly &#x2014;with some honourable exceptions&#x2014;Labour Members are not discussing these Euro issues, my hon. Friends are becoming greatly concerned about the way in which bureaucratic decisions are interfering unnecessarily with our affairs. We are getting fed up with the way in which the Common Market is more and more reflecting all those things against which our splendid Prime Minister is fighting.<br/>
While I am delighted to see the Under-Secretary my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Mr. Forth) at the Dispatch Box, I hope that in future he will fight hard to get the EEC to reflect the true meaning of Thatcherism and Conservatism and get away from this nonsense of bureaucracy taking powers away from consumers for no good reason.</p>

<p>I join my hon. Friend the Member for Southend, East (Mr. Taylor) in congratulating my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Mr. Forth) on his appearance at the Dispatch Box, I wish him every success in his new office.<br/>
We have been intent on increasing consumer protection, particularly in foodstuffs, and more and more the trend is for manufacturers to declare all ingredients. Until now, all foodstuffs consumed in Britain have been subject to inspection by the nation's health inspectorate. With the implementation of the single European market that will cease; imported food will no longer be guaranteed by our own inspectorate as being of the standard, quality and purity that we have come to expect. Such inspections will be made by the inspectorates in the various producing countries.<br/>
That presents us with a dilemma, for the public will undoubtedly wish to discriminate in the food products that they consume. They are bound to have reservations about the source of certain products, and particularly about whether the standard of inspection in the countries of origin are commensurate with the standards which have traditionally been enforced in this country, and which we shall continue to enforce for home-produced products. The order is inconsistent and poses a dilemma for the Government because it effectively denies the consumer knowledge of the original source of the food.</p>

<p>The hour is late and I shall not detain the House for more than a few moments. I simply wish to record my sadness at debating this order tonight. I sound that note of sadness on several different counts. First, I sound it in the direction of my hon. Friend the Minister. I well recall him in his former seat below the Gangway, unsheathing his sword so that, with measured tones, he could plunge its point into Minister after Minister who introduced measures that trod, by even a small margin, on British sovereignty.<br/>
I could hardly believe my ears tonight as I listened to my hon. Friend's high-speed, staccato delivery as he rattled through some amazing phrases. He said that Renault and Volkswagen were really United Kingdom names; that we were doing the most that was workable within the constraints of our European obligations; that progress would be neither easy nor speedy; that the totality of presentation did not need British marks upon it. It recalled to mind the opening words of Browning's famous poem, "The Lost Leader":
<q>Just for a handful of silver he left us,</q>
<q>Just for a riband to stick in his coat.</q>
I do not mean to do more than treat my hon. Friend to the sort of treatment that he gave out in his day. He dished it out pretty well, and it is right that he should take it tonight.<br/>
I am sad not simply because of such a change of tone by my hon. Friend. He will have plenty to time of repent at leisure in due course. The sadness is that the order affects this sovereign Parliament, of which we are all so proud to be Members. The 1972 Act was a good Act. It was introduced by someone who I have not always praised for his goodness towards the British consumer&#x2014;my right hon. Friend the Member for Old Bexley and Sidcup (Mr. Heath), who is not present tonight. It was his Government who, in 1972, introduced a robust measure that was supported by both sides of the House. It was intended simply to defend the interests of the British consumer. My hon. Friend the Member for Ludlow (Mr. Gill) made the important point about the significance or origin markings on foodstuffs. That could apply across the whole range of consumer goods because it would be in the interests of the British consumer. It is sad that an Act of Parliament should be swept away at an hour of night when most sensible people are drinking their Horlicks or Ovaltine and saying, "Me for bed, so goodnight, darling." The 1972 Act has been ambushed and swept away.<br/>
Above all, what is happening tonight is sad for parliamentary sovereignty. The great British public has difficulty in understanding what is meant when we say that sovereignty is being eroded. They should witness this scene tonight, when an Act of Parliament that passed through all its stages only a few years ago is obliterated from the statute book, on the nod, and without any real pressure from Europe, simply because the Government are suddenly in a genuflectory mood, willing to bow the knee and get rid of the Act before anybody can cause any trouble.<br/>
What a sadness that must be for my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister. In Bruges, she said:
<q>Europe will be stronger precisely because it has France as France, Spain as Spain, Britain as Britain, each with its own customs, traditions and identity.</q>
She might have added, "But no longer with its own origin markings."<br/>
Something of importance is going on the nod, quietly, and, frankly, in a rather humiliating way. A piece of British sovereignty is being thrown out the window. I am sad about it, and I wish to record my protest tonight.</p>

<p>I shall not detain the House for long, but one or two practical points in the legislation worry me. I expect that you will be aware, Mr. Speaker, that one growth industry is wine production, and we are rapidly becoming international experts in its development. The trouble is that we are running into a little competition from France and German wine producers. They put "Produce of France", "Bottled in France" or "Bottled in Germany" on their wine bottles. That discriminates against English wine producers who want their wine to have a fair share of the market and do not want to be discriminated against in preference to French or German producers.<br/>
I ask my hon. Friend the Minister, whom I congratulate on his presence on the Government Front Bench, whether an English wine producer would be able to go to the EEC and demand that French wine producers remove the words "Produce of France" from their bottles.</p>

<p>Is it not even more important that wine consumers should have some idea of


where the stuff comes from? Wine from various EEC countries which most of us perhaps regard as undrinkable or wine that might possibly be regarded as French but which comes from north Africa might be discriminated against.</p>

<p>One could take that point of view, but labelling is surely a thing of the past. I am trying to establish to what extent the legislation will permeate through to everyday produce items.<br/>
I am intrigued also about what will happen when a cargo of Welsh lamb arrives in France. At the moment, lamb is clearly produce of Wales, but it will presumably become European lamb&#x2014;Euro lamb. Is that another reason why the legislation is advantageous&#x2014;that the French will no longer be able to stop the arrival of Welsh lamb, because there will be no such thing; it will be Euro lamb?<br/>
A more substantial matter relates to the car industry, in particular Nissan in Sunderland. One of the highlights of overseas investment in this country is Japanese involvement in much of our industry these days, be it video cassette recorders, television sets, electronics products or, in this case, cars. The difficulty arises in getting other countries to accept that such products are originally created in this country.<br/>
Presumably, under this legislation, that obstacle to our exporting cars throughout the EEC will be removed, because they will be considered Euro products. Therefore, France will not be able to stop the arrival of loads of Nissan Bluebirds, because it will no longer be valid for it to point the finger and ask where such cars originated. The cars have come from this country. There is no longer any need for them to be marked "Made in England with parts from Japan." They can simply be marked "Euro made."<br/>
Although there are some practical problems for the consumer, there are great opportunities for our wine makers, Welsh lamb, car and electronics producers to open new markets in Europe. Hitherto some markets have been closed to our products because the relevant countries were not satisfied that the goods were of United Kingdom origin.</p>

<p>I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way, but hesitate to point out that he has got it all wrong. The order has no effect in the Common Market; its only effect is in this country, where it deprives the consumer of the weapons to discriminate against imports. People are increasingly resentful of the high proportion of our domestic market that is taken by imports and by the number of British firms that are being taken over by foreign firms. The order deprives people of the ability to do anything about that, and it has no effect on getting our goods accepted in Europe.</p>

<p>I am grateful for that intervention. What I am seeking to establish is the element of two-way traffic. If we are not entitled to put our country of origin on our products, it follows that, if it is to be a fair and stable market, neither can the country of origin be mentioned on products coming in from Europe. Perhaps my hon. Friend the Minister will enlighten us on those points.</p>

<p>I am sorry that I was not here at the beginning of the debate. I am also sorry that the Government lost their hundred and did not move the business motion, which is what I had expected them to do. As the annunciator in my room is not working, I was unable to be here at the beginning of the debate because there was nothing to indicate that it was starting. If the annunciators are not providing the information, they should be ripped out throughout the House.<br/>
I accept that I should have been here&#x2014;there were good reasons why I was not&#x2014;because the order is important to the wool textile industry, which is based in Bradford. The industry has sent me a brief and a note from the chairman and managing director of Centaur Clothes of Leeds, Mr. J. D. Jackson, who is probably a supporter of the Conservative party. WOOLTAC&#x2014;Wool Textile and Clothing Industry Action Committee&#x2014;is supported by both Labour and Conservative local authorities, and both have expressed their concern; which is based on reality.<br/>
That organisation, which, as I have said, is supported by both major political parties, points out its concern at the repeal of the Trade Descriptions Act 1972, by stating:<br/>
<q>This Act is being repealed because the European Commission have initiated infraction proceedings against it, and the Government believe it could not be successfully defended in the European Court.</q>
I am sorry that I missed the Minister's opening words, but I wonder why the Government did not try to act in the European Court and why they have given up before they have even got there. That suggests a different spirit from the view expressed by the Prime Minister in her Bruges speech. If the Prime Minister was expressing the view that the Common Market is becoming too federal and that we should stand up to it, surely the Government should be using all the machinery that is available to them.<br/>
The replacement legislation in the form of an order under the Trade Descriptions Act, the Trade Descriptions (Place of Production) (Marking) Order, is not as effective as the original legislation. Indeed, it is so soggy that the letter sent to me states:<br/>
<q>Former Industry and Consumer Affairs Minister John Butcher gave a commitment to WOOLTAC earlier this year that more detailed guidance would be provided as to what constitutes a misleading presentation of goods under the new Order.</q>
Perhaps the Minister outlined the detailed guidance, but he will no doubt refer to it when he replies to the debate. I shall examine <i>Hansard</i> in great detail when it is published tomorrow. It is important to note that the guidance does not have any legal effect. The legal application is in the order, not in the Minister's guidance. The Minister's guidance can be ignored.<br/>
The truth is that the Department of Trade and Industry is scared stiff that the European Commission will threaten to take it to court again. So it has produced a soggy, vague, unsatisfactory order and tries to appease manufacturers, many of whom support the Conservative party, by saying that the Minister's guidelines will provide a satisfactory background.

<p>Many statutory instruments are published with a great deal of guidance. The Committee has said that statutory instruments should stand on their own and should not depend on guidance. The law is set out in the statutory instrument, and guidance&#x2014;whether it is from the Department of Health or the Department of Social Security, which issue shoals of guidance documents, handbooks and leaflets, or from the Department of Trade and Industry&#x2014;should not be relied upon.<br/>
The Prime Minister says that the Common Market is becoming stronger. She disagrees with the view of the President of the Commission that in 10 years' time 80 per cent. of legislation will emanate from the Common Market, not from state Parliaments. Yet she is allowing the erosion of legislation by the Government.<br/>
The wool textile industry has invested heavily. It is not antique. The textile and clothing industry is one of the largest employers in the country, employing more than 500,000 people, and is of vital importance to the economy. The industry, certainly in Yorkshire, is worried about the erosion of jobs by imports and about the fact that consumers will not now be able to make a fair judgment. If they wish to buy cloth made in Japan, West Germany or the Prato region of Italy, which is still producing subsidised woollen products because it can get round the social security provisions, thus producing a 10 per cent. price advantage&#x2014;it has been investigated by the Commission, but with no positive result in terms of equality of competition&#x2014;people should have that information of origin. But they are denied it because the Government have yielded to the Commission, which does not want a group of countries to work together. It wants a complete Euro blur, and that is what this order is about.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman suggests that the wool textile industry is worried about the order, but the brief that he received says:
<q>Overall WOOLTAC feel the Government have pressed the European Commission hard to achieve protection as near as possible to that available under the 1972 Act.</q>
Furthermore, having attended many meetings of WOOLTAC, which is supported by trade unions, the Labour party, Conservative authorities and employers, I must tell the hon. Gentleman that although there is anxiety about imports&#x2014;especially unfair imports&#x2014;there is a strong feeling that the new regime being introduced to replace the 1972 Act will be sufficient protection for jobs in the textile industry in west Yorkshire.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman omitted to mention the four points of qualification in the briefing which follow that. First, WOOLTAC wants the approval of the Consumer Protection Act 1987 (Commencement No. 2) Order 1988 to move in parallel with approval, through the affirmative resolution procedure of the Trades Descriptions (Place of Production) (Marking) Order, to ensure no gap in protection. Secondly, WOOLTAC emphasises the desirability of a European Communitywide scheme of origin marking for imports to the EC. The Minister has been "sounding out" member states on that and we would expect him to make a statement of the results. Thirdly, WOOLTAC emphasises the need for adequate resources for effective enforcement

of the new order, and the fourth part relates to the point I mentioned earlier about the former Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Industry and Consumer Affairs. WOOLTAC has enumerated those four important qualifications. In his "sounding out", has the Minister received an assurance from Italy that subsidised exports to this country from the Prato region will stop? He may receive assurances, but they are not put into effect.<br/>
As the hon. Member for Keighley (Mr. Waller) knows, the industry has been pressing the Department to do something about imports of Turkish acrylic fibre yarn, which have shot up to more than 4,000 tonnes from virtually nothing. The Government cannot take any action themselves, but must go to the Commission. The Commission wants to see greater damage to the industry before it will begin to take action, and that means either more unemployment or short-time working. The power to apply criteria for fair competition has gone from the Government, whatever the Prime Minister may say in her speeches in Bruges and elsewhere. It has shifted to the Commission, whose priority is not the United Kingdom textile industry or other United Kingdom industries which manufacture goods for sale, but the complete harmonisation of every standard it can lay its hands on inside the Common Market. It has been unsuccessful, as I showed with textiles in the Prato region of Italy, and there are many other examples which, unfortunately, I have not time to go into now.</p>

<p>I shall conclude my remarks because I want to give the Minister a chance to make a few closing comments.<br/>
We are in great difficulty. The hon. Member for Keighley may say that WOOLTAC has been prepared to compromise and to say that it hopes that the new regime will be as good as the old one, but the reality is that it is unlikely to be so. The old Department of Trade had a strong element of Euro-fanaticism and made compromise after compromise to the Common Market. That was when I was a Minister in that Department, and no doubt it has done so ever since, so I am worried.<br/>
The wool textile industry has invested and is a modern industry. The workers have accepted all sorts of changes in working practices. They work 24-hour shifts and have accepted new machinery which covers a much wider range of output. Productivity has increased. Yet there has been a continuing erosion of jobs ever since 1970. Under the last Labour Government there was an increase in employment in the wool textile industry in 1978, but since that high point it has declined.<br/>
A passage in the action committee's letter reads:
<q>I write requesting your help concerning the provision of adequate origin-marking legislation, which as you may know has been of concern to the Wool Textile and Clothing Industry Action Committee for some time now.</q>
I fear that the cause for that concern will rear its head again. We are seeing another example of the Government's power to act being eroded by the Commission, and it will


be followed by further examples that will further erode the rights of the elected Government of the day. I happen to disagree with the elected Government of the day, but they were elected and they have certain responsibilities to undertake. Their powers to act, however, are being eroded by the Common Market.<br/>
The erosion will continue until we repeal section 2 of the European Communities Act 1972. If that is not done, we shall continue to be confronted with orders of this sort. The Government's room for action is being limited by non-elected appointed commissioners, who put the interests of some vague, shadowy and amorphous notion of a United States of Western Europe before the interests of the workers of the individual states and their employers.</p>

<p>Orders of this sort come before the House week after week, month after month. They will come before the House year after year. We have been promised by one Minister after another&#x2014;it does not matter which party is in office, and that is one of the tragedies&#x2014;that no contravention will be made without the authority of the House. However, we continue to approve orders and, as Mr. Delors said, 82 per cent.&#x2014;[HON. MEMBERS: "80 per cent."] Does it matter whether it is 80 per cent. or 90 per cent? Mr. Delors has said that in due course 80 per cent. of our laws will be enacted as a result of what happens in Brussels.</p>

There are still a few members of the Labour party&#x2014; Socialists&#x2014;who will never surrender to people like Jacques Delors. We should remember that the country that is making all the money in the Common Market is West Germany. It has a balance of payments surplus this year of &#x0024;40 billion equivalent. Britain has a deficit of &#x0024;13 billion equivalent. By God, there are some who say that Germany lost the war. The Prime Minister and all the rest of them have helped West Germany on its way.</p>

<p>I shall not detain the House for very long tonight. My remarks will be in the form of a question to the Minister, which I ask him to answer in his concluding remarks.<br/>
On balance, I regret the disappearance of origin marking as enshrined in the Consumer Protection Act 1972. Nevertheless, I recognise that, if we are moving towards a single European market and if that single market is to mean anything at all, we must have one domestic market. Therefore, it does not make too much sense to distinguish between different origins within the Community, and it would not make much technical sense either. Given the immense amount of integrated manufacturing, subcontracting and consortium manufacturing that takes place within the European Community, origin marking by individual countries within the Community probably would not make too much semantic sense. Nevertheless, those considerations do not apply to goods imported into the Community from outside.<br/>
The Minister referred to the representations&#x2014;which I know that he has received&#x2014;from a number of industrial groups which are in favour of introducing some form of Community origin marking. There are various ways in which that can be organised, and I shall not detain the House by describing them in detail. My hon. Friend did say, however, that he was a little pessimistic about the chances of persuading his Community colleagues to accept a solution along those lines, and that he envisaged a number of difficulties. The Minister did not say what those difficulties were, but a number of people who will be listening to the debate, both inside and outside the House, will be interested to have his assessment of them. I should be grateful if he would enumerate them, at least briefly, and give us some confidence that he will not abandon the attempt to persuade his Community colleagues to move in that direction.</p>

<p>This has been a revealing debate, not just because of the tributes that have been paid to me, for which I am grateful and which I accept with traditional humility from the Dispatch Box, but because of the attitudes and motives displayed by those who have questioned some of the elements of the order.<br/>
The expressions and words used by the hon. Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell) and by my hon. Friend the Member for Southend, East (Mr. Taylor) were especially interesting. The hon. Member for Great Grimsby based much of his argument on people's right to discriminate. I always thought that Opposition Members were rather wary of discrimination and were against it. When it comes to this matter, however, they are in favour of it.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Southend, East based much of his argument on the right of people to exercise their prejudices. I am sure that my hon. Friend is one of least prejudiced of men, yet he based his argument on some sort of god-given right of consumers or housewives to exercise a degree of prejudice, or, as the hon. Member for Great Grimsby has said, discrimination, when distinguishing between goods originating from different countries of the Community.<br/>
Many references have been made to the Prime Minister and her stated views adumbrated at Bruges. I remind the House that one of the things that my right hon. Friend emphasised over and over again was her belief in the importance of a genuinely free market in the Community. She also emphasised the importance of a market that would be as open as possible to non-Community imports. Therefore, we do not believe in a "fortress Europe" approach. The order is at one with that desire as it attempts to improve the possibilities for the freest movement of goods within the Community without prejudice or discrimination. I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Southend, East and the hon. Member for Great Grimsby will concede that that is an important element of the Community's aims. It is also what my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister wants to see happen in the Community.<br/>
I made it clear that, at present, there is no universal origin marking requirement even under the terms of the Trade Descriptions Act 1972, which has been much praised by hon. Members. That Act requires imported goods to be origin marked only if they bear a United

Kingdom name or mark. Many of the implications that have been made tonight are not true, even within the terms of the 1972 Act.<br/>
Much play has been made of the belief that what is going on here is unparliamentary and undemocratic and that this is some sort of sordid measure being rushed through late at night. My hon. Friend the Member for Thanet, South (Mr. Aitken) made such claims. The origins of the order, however, were contained within the provisions of the Consumer Protection Act 1987, which went through this House in the proper, full parliamentary manner. It was debated and democratically dealt with. The order is simply the culmination of what was set in place by the Act. To suggest that something unparliamentary is happening is ridiculous. The order has been given a generous amount of parliamentary time and many hon. Members have been able to make valuable contributions. The order has received the full examination of the House and, if it is approved tonight, it will have received proper parliamentary scrutiny.</p>

<p>In 1987 the Consumer Protection Bill was rushed through a few days before the House was dissolved.

They have not done so and, therefore, the pretence on which that reception was based has been removed.</p>

My hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Mr. King) asked whether wines and lamb could be labelled with their countries of origin. The answer is yes. Producers are free to identify the country of origin of their products if they think that is to their benefit. Nothing in the order will prevent British manufacturers or producers from proudly proclaiming that their products are British&#x2014;</p>

<p>I am not sure why the hon. Gentleman shouts that at me. He is probably saying that we must not confuse this order with the much discussed matter of contents and origin, particularly of vehicles. The definition of origin for that purpose is contained in section 36 of the Trade Descriptions Act 1968&#x2013;I am sure the hon. Member for Great Grimsby is well aware of this&#x2014;which defines the country of origin as where the goods
<q>last underwent a treatment or process resulting in a substantial change.</q>
I know that my hon. Friend the Member for Northfield is well acquainted with that definition. He and many others still struggle with it; it continues to pose difficulties. But it


has nothing to do with this order. I mention it only to clarify that and to remind hon. Members that the order is different.<br/>
The hon. Member for Bradford, South (Mr. Cryer) made some uncharacteristically inaccurate remarks. He knows as well as I do that as soon as this country joined the European Community in 1973 we acknowledged the role of the Commission in Brussels in policing the measures passed by the other bodies in the Community. We also acknowledged the European Court of Justice as the ultimate arbiter of the relevance and validity of Community measures. Tonight, we acknowledge that again. As a member of the Community we acknowledge the role of the Commission. The hon. Member for Bradford, South has the great distinction of holding a dual mandate as a Member of this place and as a Member of the European Parliament in Strasbourg. Surely he would not deny the legitimate role of the European Court of Justice or the Commission. He is an elected member of the third great body of the Community and it would be remiss of him to deny the roles of the other two.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding (Mr. Davies) made the relevant point that, given the degree of integrated manufacturing&#x2014;Vauxhall may be a case in point&#x2014;in the European Community these days, origin marking intra Community countries is probably irrelevant. It becomes even less relevant with increased integration. We are now going to try to persuade our colleagues in the Community to set about deciding on a workable origin marking regime that will apply to countries outside the Community.<br/>
This order essentially applies to the movement of goods inside the Community; the Government and the Prime Minister are committed to that.

<p>First, I thank the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster for coming to reply to this Adjournment debate. However, a statement should have been made to the House about the privatisation of Girobank before now. It should not have taken an Adjournment debate to bring the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster here. There should have been a debate in Government time on the Government's proposal&#x2014;a major privatisation proposal&#x2014;affecting the 6,000 people who work for Girobank and all those who work in sub-post offices throughout the country which are mostly dependent on Girobank for their business. It also affects pensioners, the unemployed and everyone who receives cheques from Girobank. It is a major privatisation that does not need legislation. Therefore, the Government should report to Parliament on a regular basis, explain what is happening and enable debates on their proposals to take place.<br/>
Girobank is very successful. Since 1968, when it was established by a Labour Government, Girobank has grown into a successful banking arm of the Post Office. It now has about 2&#x00B7;5 million customers, and in 1986&#x2013;87 it made a profit before tax of &#x00A3;23&#x00B7;1 million. It is a successful financial institution in the public sector. As I have already said, it employs 6,000 people&#x2014;5,500 in my constituency.<br/>
Most EEC countries have a public sector Girobank. It provides competition in those countries in the same way as it does in Britain, where it offers customers a real alternative to the major clearing banks, and it has enhanced competition. As well as creating jobs on Merseyside and keeping the local community alive, Girobank has created jobs in Edinburgh, Leeds, Ashford in Kent, Birmingham, Bristol, Belfast and London. Girobank pioneered free banking and brought banking to the doorsteps of many rural areas about which many Conservative Members are concerned.<br/>
Labour Members see no reason why Girobank should be privatised and why the Government should have made the proposal to sell off Girobank in the first place. It will not increase or enhance competition, and the way in which it is being done will not extend share ownership in any way whatsoever. If it is kept in public ownership and further developed, competition will continue.<br/>
However, in June the Secretary of State for Health, the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke), when he held the post of Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster announced that Girobank would be privatised&#x2014;for doctrinaire reasons, presumably, as there were no other grounds&#x2014;that it would not be a flotation, but that it would go out to tender, and certain conditions were set down. On 7 June, the Minister said that Girobank was a successful bank
<q>with a particular strength in money transmissions and handling deposits of corporate cash.</q>
He said,
<q>Girobank &#x2026; needs to expand vigorously".</q>
Indeed, it is in the process of doing so in the public sector. The right hon. and learned Gentleman said that the Post Office had agreed with the Government to privatise Girobank and that Girobank would be offered for sale to

a financial institution or other suitable company. He said that suitable bidders for the bank would be given the opportunity to tender, and that has happened. He said that in deciding on a buyer the price would be a major consideration in order to ensure a fair deal for the taxpayer. The figure of &#x00A3;200 million was in the Government's mind. He also said:
<q>weight should be given to &#x2026; a purchaser who will widen choice"&#x2014;</q>
that is important&#x2014;
<q>for the general public in banking services.</q>
He also said that the purchaser should be
<q>capable of developing and expanding Girobank's business.</q>
He said that the close links between Girobank and Post Office Counters would be safeguarded and that
<q>prospective purchasers will be invited to propose arrangements to enable management and employees to share &#x2026; in the future success of the business."&#x2014;[<i>Official Report</i>, 7 June 1988, Vol. 134, c. 713.]</q>
The right hon. and learned Gentleman said that the purchaser would have to satisfy the strict requirements of the Bank of England, and the Government went on to rule out a management buy-out or a consortium bid.<br/>
The Government employed a company of merchant bankers, Schroder, to deal with the matter. The right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe, then the Minister responsible, wrote to me on 27 June saying that he hoped the sale would be completed before the end of the year. An expected timetable was submitted to all those who expressed an interest in purchasing Girobank which gave the end of September as the deadline for round two bids. The Minister, and a letter I received from the Prime Minister, made it clear that a shortlist would be produced and announced during the recess and that in November the Government hoped to announce the successful bidder.<br/>
Although the unions were opposed to privatisation, they met and decided not to take industrial action but to seek some safeguards from the Government about the procedures involved in the sale. They behaved very responsibly. They produced an eight-point plan. They wanted continued investment commitment to the bank; a commitment to the growth of the bank, especially among corporate customers; protection of the bank as an entity and the protection of Bootle as the major operational centre.<br/>
If privatisation threatens the centre in Bootle, the entire area will be devastated. It is an area of high unemployment where Girobank, the flagship of public enterprise at work, is one of the major employers. The unions also wanted the siting of the contingency centre in close proximity to the Bootle centre. The proposal is that it should go ahead in Wigan. We hope that that will be safeguarded. The unions wanted protection of the commercial relationship between Post Office Counters and the bank; protection of conditions of service such as pension rights and continued trade union recognition. They wanted staff involvement in the development of the bank. Those are all reasonable requests made by the work force and those involved in making Girobank such a success.<br/>
Since the statement in the House and since Girobank was put out to public tender we have heard nothing from the Government except rumour, speculation and leaks from Schroder and the Department of Trade and Industry. Despite the fact that I have asked questions in the House and that my hon. Friends have tabled questions for written answer, the Government have not told us what has happened. We have passed the deadline that the


Government originally laid down for the publication of the shortlist. We were told that it would be published in November and that the unions and the work force would have an opportunity to have discussions with those wishing to purchase. We have heard rumours that Westpac, the Australian company, and the Bank of Scotland have withdrawn their bids and that the bids were well below &#x00A3;200 million. The shortlist that the Government hoped to publish was depleted to such an extent that they could not publish it. There were insufficient bidders for Girobank and the Government faced the dilemma of whether to go ahead with the privatisation.<br/>
That is authoritative speculation that has appeared in the press over the past two weeks and no Minister has denied it. The Department of Trade and Industry suggested that there never was a deadline so one could not be expected. The Government hoped that a deadline would be met and a timetable was sent out by Schroder. The Government's proposals for Girobank have not stayed on course. I hope that the Government will be able to answer my questions because I am concerned about the future of Girobank and its employees. The current uncertainty must be brought to an end.<br/>
The Labour party and the majority of the work force at Girobank are completely opposed to privatisation. The employees are aware that if privatisation goes ahead their future will be at risk, and they are aware of the risks of asset-stripping. Girobank is competitive and successful in the public sector, but my main concern is for Girobank, whether or not it stays in public ownership.<br/>
Why have not Parliament or Girobank's employees been told of the shortlist of bidders? Why have the Government relaxed the conditions governing the sale of Girobank? I hope that the Minister will say that the Government have not relaxed the conditions and that they want to ensure a secure future for the bank. Will the Government still insist on a sale price of about &#x00A3;200 million, or will they sell it at a knock-down price? In that regard, we have had the Royal Ordnance fiasco and the BP sale. In many instances, asset-stripping has resulted as a consequence of privatisation and the taxpayer has suffered.<br/>
It is feared that if someone buys Girobank at a knock-down price the business will be asset-stripped and sold at its true price. If a second sale took place shortly after the first, the conditions and guarantees that the Government have given may be lost. If it is sold at a knock-down price, those concerned about the interests of the taxpayer and those concerned about the future of Girobank will be angry because the centre of Bootle may disappear.<br/>
Is a management or part-management buy-out ruled out by the Government? Will a consortium bid be allowed? The Government implied, if not stated categorically, that that would be ruled out. Are the Government still excluding bids from British clearing banks or the larger building societies? If a bank with a clearing house facility or a large building society buys Girobank it would be more likely to run down the centre of Bootle. It would also be more likely to asset-strip Girobank, because it would have

the same facilities and would be buying it to get its customers, its business and the Post Office outlets or to buy out the competition, about which we are very worried.<br/>
Have the Government abandoned their commitment to more customer choice in the market? They said that that was one of the purposes of privatisation. If a major clearing bank or building society purchases Girobank, that will not happen.<br/>
What has been the response so far by way of Girobank bids? Will the Minister come clean and answer that question? If a satisfactory buyer is not found or if an acceptable bid is not submitted, will the Government withdraw their proposals for privatisation? Any other reasonable vendor&#x2014;a householder putting a house up for sale or somebody selling a business&#x2014;would take the view that if the asking price cannot be realised, the house or business should be withdrawn from the market, rather than leave it there with all the insecurity and uncertainty that must result.<br/>
What is the Government's timetable for the sale of Girobank, if the sale is to go ahead? As I said, I am totally opposed to its privatisation and hope that the Government will not proceed with the sale. But if they are intent on going ahead, I hope that they will guarantee to all concerned that Girobank will be maintained as a viable business with a successful future.</p>

<p>I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Bootle (Mr. Roberts) on raising this important issue. I must record, speaking from the Opposition Front Bench, that this is a most unsatisfactory procedure by which the House may have an opportunity at least to debate this issue&#x2014;in a few minutes&#x2014;on a Thursday at just before midnight. After all, we are discussing the employment prospects of 6,000 people in Bootle and elsewhere and an important banking institution. This is a most unsatisfactory way of dealing with this important subject.<br/>
My hon. Friend raised many issues that are worrying Labour Members and those employed in Girobank, and, I suspect, millions of customers, of whom I am one, of the bank. We want to know what is to happen to the bank with which we have banked since it came into existence. My hon. Friend posed reasonable questions. So far, we have not received satisfactory replies to the letters we have written, to the parliamentary questions we have tabled or to other forms of probing in which we have indulged.<br/>
My hon. Friend pointed out that the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke), the Minister's predecessor, made a statement in the House last June about the Government's intentions towards Girobank. I understood that on that occasion he laid down the parameters governing the way in which the bank would be sold. They were drawn in such a way as to


exclude the major clearing banks from bidding, to avoid any problem with the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, and I could appreciate that.<br/>
Since then, the only information that I and my hon. Friend&#x2014;and he represents the town of Bootle and those who work in Girobank there&#x2014;have received is from the newspapers. We read almost daily that the Government are in real trouble over the sale because nobody wants to buy it.<br/>
My hon. Friend referred to Westpac. It has pulled out, as has the Royal Bank of Scotland. If such organisations are not showing interest in purchasing Girobank, what prospective purchasers are there? Which organisations are bidding? Is the Minister beginning to move the goal posts, as it were, from where his right hon. and learned Friend put them in June of this year? According to <i>The Independent,</i> the Government are considering entertaining a bid from the Co-operative bank and Unity Trust or a management buy-out. If that is the case, the parameters that his right hon. and learned Friend laid down in June certainly have been shifted.<br/>
The Minister is an honourable man and he must come clean on this matter. The House, the people and especially the employees of Girobank have to know whether the ground is changing. We believe that it is, for the simple reason that when the Minister's right hon. and learned Friend came to the House in June we told him that it was a bad idea. We opposed the privatisation of Girobank on ideological grounds. We also said that it was the wrong time to do it. The bank was just about to break into the new era of financial services. I think that we will be proved right. The bidders for Girobank are virtually non-existent.<br/>
It is an insult to the House that it must deal with a matter of such importance at this time of night during an Adjournment debate. My hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) and I met the unions from Girobank earlier this evening. The vast majority of those who work in Girobank are employees of the Post Office, and have been for 20, 25 or even 28 years. Their pension provisions are locked into the Post Office pension arrangements. As I understand it, once the bank is sold those pension arrangements will run for only a further 10 months. They will then, under this new liberated Government scheme, have to find other ways to fund their pension scheme. That is disgraceful. Five thousand people who were employed by the Post Office three or four months ago have now been told, following an arbitrary decision by the Government, that their pensions are in jeopardy. If the Minister thinks that they will accept that with equanimity, he is wrong.<br/>
My hon. Friend and I have posed a number of questions that the Minister must answer.</p>
</speech>
<speech hansard_id="592014" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1988-11-10a.615.0" hansard_membership_id="6849" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/18872" speakername="The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and Minister of Trade and Industry (Mr. Tony Newton)" colnum="615" time="00:02:00">
<p>In the nine minutes remaining to me I shall do my best to respond to the many questions that have been posed. I hope that Opposition Members will understand if the pressure of time makes it difficult to respond as fully as I would have wished.<br/>
I congratulate the hon. Member for Bootle (Mr. Roberts) on obtaining this Adjournment debate, but resist the suggestion that as Cabinet Minister responsible for this matter, coming to the House to answer an Adjournment

debate raised by the Member of Parliament with the most direct interest because his constituents are affected, constitutes an abuse of the House. It constitutes an entirely proper response&#x2014;<i>[Interruption.]</i> I was picking up the comments of the hon. Member for Wigan (Mr. Stott), rather than anything that the hon. Member for Bootle said.<br/>
I thank the hon. Member for Bootle for his courtesy in letting me know in advance the specific questions that he would ask, to which I shall reply. I had intended to say a word about the history of the Girobank and about the Government's general attitude towards privatisation. The House is certainly familiar with the latter, and the history was touched on by the hon. Gentleman.<br/>
It was against the history of Girobank and the privatisation policy that the Government have successfully pursued in many areas of industry and commerce that we considered the position of Girobank. As the hon. Gentleman said&#x2014;there is no dispute between us on this &#x2014;it has been successful in advancing its business. However, the banking market is rapidly changing and is extremely competitive, and we concluded that if Girobank was to achieve its full potential, to sustain its success, and to grow further, it would need to match its competitors in the freedom and flexibility with which it could respond to changing circumstances and new opportunities. It has to be free from the inevitable constraints that go with being a public sector undertaking, for which Ministers are answerable in the ways familiar to the House. Thus, on 7 June the then Chancellor of the Duchy, my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke), informed the House that the Government and the Post Office had agreed to offer Girobank for sale to a financial institution or other suitable company.<br/>
The announcement of the proposed sale generated a wide response, with many inquiries, and on 25 July a confidential information memorandum was sent to those who had registered interest. To protect the future interests of the bank and the taxpayer, the Government and the Post Office Board outlined certain factors of which account was to be taken in evaluating bids. They covered price, acceptability to the Bank of England, the prospect of widening choice for the general public in banking services, the importance of the link between Girobank and Post Office Counters Ltd., capability to develop and expand Girobank's business, and arrangements to enable management and employees to share directly in the future success of the business. Those who expressed an interest in buying the bank were informed that the Government and the Post Office Board would also be concerned&#x2014;I ask the hon. Member for Wigan to take note of this&#x2014;to ensure that proper regard was paid to the interests of the employees.<br/>
When bids were sought, it was indicated that they should be submitted by the end of October. The current position&#x2014;this answers some questions&#x2014;is that the Post Office has informed me that the sale of Girobank by tender has not produced, within the hoped-for time scale, a buyer able to meet the requirements set for the sale. However, it remains the case that the Government and the Post Office Board are committed to transferring Girobank to the private sector through the sale of the bank to a suitable purchaser. Therefore, the Post Office and the financial advisers for the sale are holding further confidential discussions with potential purchasers, taking into account the factors set out by my right hon. and learned Friend the


Member for Rushcliffe in his statement on 7 June. This process is likely to take some time. I will, of course, continue to keep the House informed.<br/>
Before coming to the other questions raised by the hon. Member, it may be helpful if I say something about the factors that we think have contributed to the position I have described.<br/>
Although it provides all the services that a modern bank provides, Girobank has a number of distinctive features. It uses the 20,000 or so outlets of Post Office Counters Ltd. Counters are open six days a week, and over longer hours, compared with high street banks. On the other hand, the staff are not employed by Girobank, as the hon. Gentleman said, and provide services to others in addition to Girobank. Over the past three years&#x2014;another factor to be borne in mind&#x2014;Girobank has further developed a distinctive telephone and mail banking system.<br/>
Having given the matter careful consideration, we now think that for selling a specialised bank like Girobank the time scale indicated in July was too demanding and may not have allowed prospective bidders adequate time for assessing and understanding the special features of Girobank, the potential to which those features give rise, and how that potential might fit their future strategy. For that reason, we considered it right to allow more time.<br/>
Let me now refer&#x2014;I hope fully&#x2014;to the specific questions of the hon. Member for Bootle to which I have not yet responded. He asked why we had not published the names of shortlisted bidders. The simple fact is that several bidders asked that their bids should be regarded as entirely confidential unless they were selected as the purchaser. They are entitled to ask that, and, in my view, entitled to have their wishes respected. In those circumstances, the Post Office Board is not in a position to release any names.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman asked me about what he described

as a "relaxation of the conditions" of the statement of 7 June. My right hon. and learned Friend said those factors would be taken into account in evaluating bids. As I have said, those same factors will continue to be taken into account in the further confidential discussions with potential purchasers.<br/>
I was also asked about the price. That is one of the factors which the Post Office has set which will be taken into account. The sale is by tender, and no fixed price is, or was, set in advance. There has never been any question of insisting on a particular price. The point is that we must be satisfied that it represents an acceptable deal for the taxpayer.<br/>
I have been asked whether a bid from a clearing bank or a large building society would be acceptable. As my right hon. and learned Friend said on 7 June, no one is ruled out from putting in a bid. We would judge a bid from a clearing bank or a large building society in the light of the same factors as a bid from anyone else.<br/>
I have also been asked the same question in respect of a management buy-out. As I have said, no proposal is ruled out, but we doubt whether a management buy-out would be likely to satisfy the factors set out by my right hon. and learned Friend. A bid from a consortium is certainly not ruled out just because it is made by a consortium. It would be judged on its merits.<br/>
The Government remain convinced that the bank would benefit from the freer and more competitive environment of the private sector. Both we and the Post Office Board remain committed to transferring Girobank to the private sector through the sale of the bank to a suitable purchaser. Although the objective has not been secured as quickly as we had earlier hoped, we are continuing to work with the Post Office Board to achieve it, because we believe that it is in the interests of the bank and those who work in it that we should.</p>
