<p>Does the Minister appreciate the great uncertainty that exists in agriculture? Is he aware of the existence of large surpluses and the market decline in land values, which cause farmers great anxiety and feelings of insecurity?

<p>The hon. Gentleman is correct in saying that there is a certain amount of uncertainty throughout agriculture worldwide, where massive surpluses exist and export markets become fewer and fewer. I believe that our work over the past few years in Brussels to return the common agricultural policy to reality and prudence is a move in the right direction. I am surprised by the hon. Gentleman's comments about conservation. He will recall that we have had a warm welcome from both sides of the House and from many other places to our proposals for environmentally sensitive areas. We have specified these areas and we are now negotiating terms with those concerned.</p>

<p>Is my right hon.

<p>I have discussed with the leaders of the various sections of the farmers unions the statutory charges. My hon. Friend will recall that the proposed charge per visit under the milk and dairy regulations will be about &#x00A3;90. That figures will reflect actual costs. It is important to bear in mind that farmers with high standards of hygiene on their farms will be visited only once every three years, or even less frequently. A &#x00A3;90 per visit charge is equivalent to only &#x00A3;30 a year or less for those who have high standards of hygiene on their farms.</p>

<p>Will my right hon.

<p>My hon. Friend will know that the Government took the view that we should make certain charges on certain statutory duties. The National Farmers Union asked us especially whether we could be sure not to make charges for tuberculosis and brucellosis testing. I am aware of the anxieties, but charging is appropriate when the producer derives a benefit. The high quality and reputation of the product helps to maintain consumption, and thus benefits the producer.</p>

<p>Has the Minister had raised with him in his discussions the question of intereference by French farmers in the British lamb trade? What steps, beyond writing to his French opposite number and to the President of the Commission, does he propose to take? Will he make it clear in words that even M.

We were both given assurances that fresh and firm instructions would go out to all police authorities and that compensation would be paid.<br/>

<p>Bearing in mind the Government's oft-stated wish to support farming and the problems caused to the port of Aberdeen as a result of the fall in oil prices, would it not be sensible to insist that all imports of Perrier water should be routed into Britain via Aberdeen, where they would be subjected to chemical analysis?

<p>I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that reply.

Does he agree that that, given the 22&#x2013;25p per litre that farmers can get for selling their quota on the open market, not many will take up the scheme?

<p>I am sure that my hon. Friend made a slip of the tongue. It is 18p a litre. Although it it is true that the Germans are topping up theirs, the French are paying less.

<p>The levy was not in force when plantings for the 1986 harvest were under way, and its effect on future harvests will be difficult to isolate because of numerous other factors at work.

<p>Does my right hon. Friend agree that the co-responsibility levy will not reduce the amount of cereal grown, and that any set-aside programme will not achieve it on its own, because the worst land will be set aside and on the best land productivity will be increased? Will he do something to alleviate the present uncertainty by announcing, or getting his Common Market partners to announce, that any future restriction on production of cereals will be based on the yields of earlier years, or a combination of years, so as to reduce the distortion and the present increase in production of cereals?</p>

<p>I do not think that that would be the best way to deal with the problem, given that yields have increased in this country probably faster than in any other Community country. We would be in danger of shooting ourselves through the foot if we were to do it that way. I have always agreed with my hon. Friend that we need a packet of measures to deal with the cereals problem. I do not like, and the House does not like, the co-responsibility levy, and the House would, I think, like me, prefer a reduction in price. With the package of measures, we must have a stringent price policy and tough rules for grain that is suitable for intervention. At the same time, we have made proposals for a land diversion policy so that those farmers who find it most difficult to continue to produce grain at a profit may be given alternative enterprises to grain production, which is in a huge surplus.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman cannot have been here when I made a statement at the end of the price fixing negotiations this year.

today's edition of <i>The Times,</i> which says that the EEC is so desperate to get rid of its surplus feedwheat that it is continuing to sell substantial quantities of it, with an export subsidy of &#x00A3;82&#x00B7;76, to Syria?</p>

<p>That was rather a pathetic answer.<br/>
To return to the co-responsibility levy, will the Minister accept that it is hitting consumers every bit as much as it is hitting producers, that it is an administrative nightmare fraught with unfair anomalies, that it cannot cover the cost of export subsidies and that it will have no impact on the production of surpluses?

<p>I cannot anticipate next week's business. As for the co-responsibility levy being a tax on consumers, the hon. Gentleman should know that as the levy is charged on sales into intervention it will affect market prices across the board, especially those for feed grains. It should reduce the cost of grain to livestock farmers who mill their food, and it should not increase the cost of grain to compounders. The hon. Gentleman must check on the facts before making such statements.</p>

<p>I am not clear whether the last remark by the Minister is in order, Mr. Speaker, but no doubt if you heard it you will rule on it.<br/>
Does the Minister accept that the new strains of wheat talked about in the <i>Sunday Telegraph</i> promise vastly increased production from diminishing cereal land?

<p>The hon. Gentleman would need carefully to qualify what he means by overall production control. If he means some sort of quota system, I should like him to explain how one could reasonably quota, for example, over I million grain farmers in Italy. That is not a sensible way to operate. The real difficulty about overproduction is that it is not a problem today nor will it be a problem in two to three years. The difficulty is that the problem increases almost exponentially as technology improves the situation. As my right hon. Friend said, we must have a system which meets the problem not in one way, but through a whole package of measures.</p>

<p>Is my right hon. Friend aware that the uncertainty about the nature of the measures to reduce surpluses has been the principal source of anxiety among cereal producers?

<p>I agree with my hon. Friend, and that is why the United Kingdom is taking the lead in seeking a package of measures which will relieve that uncertainty.

<p>My hon. Friend has to accept that Britain is one of the most efficient producers of cereals in the Community and the world. We do not want a system which so restricts cereal production that it causes unfair discrimination against the good producer. That is one of the dangers of having a compulsory system. It is much better to have a voluntary system where those who wish to go out can do so and so enable those who can produce cereals competitively and efficiently &#x2014; as many of the United Kingdom farmers do&#x2014;to continue to do that.</p>

<p>I seem to remember that the other place was sitting at the time of the Reykjavik talks and a statement was made there. So a statement was made by Her Majesty's Government to Parliament on those talks.<br/>
Intermediate nuclear forces were subject to the SDI proposal at Reykjavik and we believe President Reagan was absolutely right in refusing to stop research on SDI. The future of the INF talks also appeared to be made subject to that, so the whole question is in issue again. It will be sorted out at the talks at Geneva. We are in discussion, through the NATO Alliance, with the United States about those talks and the proposals that have been made.<br/>

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. As a matter of order, will you consider consulting Back-Bench Members as well as the usual channels on whether it would be in the interests of the House to return to the practice of Mr. Speaker Hylton-Foster, whereby an hon. Member when called asked only one question of a Minister rather than a series? It would mean that many more hon. Members could ask questions and the House could proceed much more quickly.</p>

<p>As the hon. Gentleman knows, if he is here regularly for Prime Minister's Question Time, that is what I do, but it depends on how the questions fall on the Order Paper.

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. I hope I am wrong, but I thought I saw you reading from a list of names of Conservative Members and calling them to ask supplementary questions of the Prime Minister. Is that because representations are made to you &#x2014; <i>[Interruption.]</i> I am asking for guidance from Mr. Speaker, not from Conservative Members. Is it the case, Mr. Speaker, that Members make representations to you before Question Time to be called to ask supplementary questions, or do you genuinely look around and choose at random?</p>

<p>I am delighted to have the opportunity to clear up the matter. I must say to the hon. Gentleman and to the whole House that if representations are made to me beforehand that an hon. Member wishes to be called during Prime Minister's Question Time, that hon. Member will not be called. I make that absolutely clear.

<p>Thank you, Mr. Speaker. We elder statesmen occasionally get impatient with these younger puppies. While absolutely understanding and accepting your explanation, Mr. Speaker, with the deep and due regard that I hold for you, is it not a disproportionate way

<p>It is very heartening to see this occasional stranger. The point I was trying to make when that rather ludicrous comment was made about those of us who attend this Parliament daily was this. Is it not an incorrect way to assess the eagerness of hon. Members simply to have a list and see that they are all called in due proportion, when some of us are here every Prime Minister's Question Time, rise at every Prime Minister's Question Time, and make a much more frequent and regular effort to be called? Would it not be fairer to count our appearances in attempting to be called than simply to go through a list?</p>

<p>Order. This is a matter for my discretion. I seek to treat the House fairly. I shall consider what the hon.

<p>Further to that point of order, Mr. Speaker. I noticed that a moment ago you said that when an hon. Member has put down a question to the Prime Minister he will get some consideration.

<p>Further to that point of order, Mr. Speaker. By way of a constructive suggestion, may I say that if we had a form of extra time as a consequence of prolonged and pointless interruption during Prime Minister's Question Time it might assist the conduct of the House, because the alternative is to have extra time which takes the form of points of order, and that is as tedious for you, Mr. Speaker, as it is for most hon.

Does the right hon. Gentleman recognise that there is widespread support throughout the House for an office of technology assessment to assist hon. Members on both sides of the House? Will he ensure that the House is given ample time to debate this proposal, which we understand the Prime Minister is resisting in some peculiar luddite form?<br/>

<q>thorough reappraisal of the managerial and editorial standards of the BBC".</q>
[HON. MEMBERS: "Hear, hear."] I hear the cheers from a certain quarter of the House. This is a further attempt by the chairman of the Tory party to undermine the independence of the corporation.

A series of important foreign affairs issues have arisen since the summer recess, including South Africa, the Reykjavik summit, relations with Syria and the need to get

full anti-terrorist co-operation from the other countries of the EEC. Will there be an early chance to debate foreign affairs after the Queen's Speech?<br/>

Is he aware, for example, that the traffic may be the equivalent of a jumbo jet arriving at or leaving from Waterloo every three and a half minutes, and that there may be passenger traffic of 20 million people, yet British Rail is giving estimates of traffic congestion on only 6 million? Will the right hon. Gentleman ensure that the House has the proper means of debating the matter?</p>

<p>Is the Leader of the House aware of the stonewalling replies that I received at the beginning of the week from the Department of Trade and Industry when I sought to question it on the privatisation of Coventry Climax in 1981 from British Leyland and on the fact that for the past five years not one penny of the price supposedly asked by the consortium which took over Coventry Climax has been paid to British Leyland? Is the right hon. Gentleman aware that the receiver who was brought in on the financial collapse of Coventry Climax earlier this month has confirmed that nothing has been paid? Five years have passed and 80 per cent of the original 3,000 jobs have been cut&#x2014;in other


words, the consortium has had a free ride for five years. Surely the least we could expect is a statement from the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry on how the conspicuous failure of privatisation will be remedied. I would argue that that should be done by taking back into public ownership Coventry Climax and restoring the jobs that have been sacrificed.</p>

Does he agree that we should have time to discuss this important matter?</p>

<p>With permission, Mr. Speaker, I wish to make a statement about schoolteachers' pay and conditions of service in England and Wales. For more than two years the local authority employers and the teacher unions have been negotiating about school teachers' pay and conditions. During this time the education of the children in our schools has been repeatedly disrupted. The children have been the victims. The local authorities and teacher unions sought help from the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service because they were unable to reach a settlement within the Burnham committee. Limited progress has been made as a result of ACAS's work. Some "heads of agreement" were negotiated at Coventry in July, but little has been achieved since then. Now, scandalously, further disruption is threatened. A further negotiating meeting is planned for 8 November at Nottingham. I must make the Government's position clear.<br/>
We now also have the Main committee's report about pay and conditions of service for schoolteachers in Scotland. My right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland will shortly make a statement giving the Government's response to that report. The Government regard the recommendations in that report relating to the teachers' pay structure, and to their duties and conditions of service, as well judged. We consider that similar arrangements should be adopted in England and Wales, although existing differences in practice mean that it is not appropriate to seek to apply the Main committee's findings in their entirety to England and Wales. I am therefore writing today to the chairman of the Burnham committee's management panel explaining the additional resources the Government are willing to make available for teachers' pay in England and Wales and spelling out our conditions for releasing those resources. I have placed a copy of that letter in the Vote Office.<br/>
The Government will make additional resources available only when two very important conditions are delivered. First, there must be a pay structure with differentials which reflect the varying responsibilities of teachers and the need to recruit, retain and motivate teachers throughout the school system and at all stages of their careers. The pay structure envisaged at the Coventry meeting in July does not meet this condition. A structure more in line with the recommendations in the Main committee's report is necessary, and I have set out such a structure in the letter which I have put in the Vote Office. All teachers will receive higher pay, more than half of them on promoted posts reflecting varying responsibilities. The crucial importance of head teachers, who carry the biggest responsibilities, will be recognised.<br/>
The second condition is that teachers' professional duties must be more sharply defined and clarified, leaving no room for ambiguity about their duties, and this must be carried through into enforceable contracts of employment. Contracts and conditions of service must be brought into line with the 19 points under discussion at the Coventry meeting. In particular, schoolteachers should be under an express contractual obligation to cover for absent colleagues and to be available to work at the

direction of head teachers for 1,300 hours over 195 days each year. All this is set out in more detail in the letter I have placed in the Vote Office.<br/>
In return for delivery of these conditions, teachers' pay would be increased in two instalments. The first instalment would increase average schoolteachers' pay by 8&#x00B7;2 per cent. from 1 January 1987, and the second instalment would be a further 8&#x00B7;2 per cent. from 1 October 1987. These two instalments would cover the full percentage increase in average schoolteachers' pay implied by the Main committee's recommendations. This would settle teachers' pay for 1986&#x2013;87 and 1987&#x2013;88. The increase of 8&#x00B7;2 per cent. from 1 January means that teachers' pay will have increased by over 16 per cent. since 30 March of this year. Teachers will have had an average 25 per cent. increase over the two years to October 1987. This means that a good honours graduate in his third year would receive after two years of teaching &#x00A3;10,000, an increase of about 20 per cent. The head of the largest comprehensive would get an increase from &#x00A3;26,250 to &#x00A3;30,500. I want to emphasise that these increases are only justified by the fundamental change in the terms, conditions and structure of the service which must accompany them.<br/>
If, and only if, these conditions are met are the Government prepared to add &#x00A3;118 million in 1986&#x2013;87 and &#x00A3;490 million in 1987&#x2013;88 to planned expenditure on education in England and Wales. Education grant-related expenditures would be increased accordingly. Block grants to local education authorities would be increased by &#x00A3;56 million in 1986&#x2013;87 and &#x00A3;200 million in 1987&#x2013;88. The cost of these increases would have to be shared by taxpayers and ratepayers. We estimate that rates would increase by between 2 per cent. and 4 per cent., compared with the decisions that local authorities would otherwise have taken.<br/>
I hope that the meeting at Nottingham will accept the position I have outlined. I look to the employers and unions to act quickly and positively. I must make it clear that the matter must now be resolved on all the terms and conditions I have set out. The Government will not be prepared to amend them further, or to make any additional resources available.<br/>
Now let me turn to the future. Over the last few years it has become widely accepted that the present negotiating machinery should be replaced. The Government therefore intend to repeal the Remuneration of Teachers Act 1965 and to bring forward proposals to this House for new machinery which will involve an interim committee to advise the Secretary of State on conditions of service and the distribution of pay within the resources available at the appropriate time.<br/>
The Government are making these proposals in the interests of the whole country. I believe that they will be seen as fair, and continued disruption will be seen to be unforgivable in these circumstances. My proposals constitute a very special offer for very special people, and when I say "special people" I mean the children of our nation.</p>

<p>Does the Secretary of State accept that parents have a right to know why, if money is now available for teachers' pay, it was not available two years ago? Is it not the case that all the


disruption, turmoil and damage of the prolonged teachers' dispute could have been avoided if the Government had come up with this kind of money in 1984?<br/>
Parents will also want to know how today's statement will help to improve standards. Why is there nothing in today's statement about the need to reduce the size of classes, to give time for preparation of lessons and to provide more opportunities for in-service training? All these issues were constructively and imaginatively dealt with by the employers and the teachers' unions in the Coventry agreement, which the Secretary of State has completely ignored.<br/>
But perhaps the most important question of all is this: will today's announcement improve the chance of a settlement next week at Nottingham, or will it make it harder? Is it not a fact that the Secretary of State is making almost impossible demands on the negotiators by imposing new conditions on the pay structure at this, the eleventh hour? I have to warn the Secretary of State that parents will not forgive him if his intervention today, with its hectoring tone, its last-minute demand for changes in the pay structure and its threat of an imposed solution, undermines next week's negotiations and scuppers the prospects for lasting peace in our schools.</p>

<p>May I begin by congratulating the hon. Member for Durham, North (Mr. Radice) upon his reelection to the shadow Cabinet. I refute completely his suggestion that a settlement could have been reached at any time during the last two years. The plain fact of the matter is that under the existing Burnham machinery there have been constant negotiations which have produced no settlement and that during the course of the last two years there has been disruption in our schools. The children of our country are entitled to uninterrupted education.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman asks how this will improve the standards of teaching and quality in the classroom. He will see from the letter that I have placed in the Vote Office that we are proposing five promotion posts on the basic scale ranging from an extra &#x00A3;900 to an extra &#x00A3;4,800. Those promotion posts recognise the quality of classroom teaching and mean that secondary teachers will go to an upper level, if they are worth it, of &#x00A3;16,500 and &#x00A3;17,500.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman also asked about Coventry. Perhaps I could remind him about what the Main committee said. It said:
<q>We &#x2026; wondered whether a new management structure that further reduced the number of promoted posts at a time of contraction and that offered teachers so little prospect of further improvement in career earnings once they had reached the top of the basic scale would be in the interests either of the service or of individual teachers.</q>
The hon. Gentleman accused me of intervening and of trying to wreck the Nottingham negotiations. I hope that the Nottingham meeting will take place because details about such things as how the first 8&#x00B7;2 per cent. should be distributed have to be settled. I have not derailed Nottingham: I have provided a solid framework for the negotiators.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman also accused me of intervening at the eleventh hour. I remind him that at Question Time on Tuesday he accused me of dithering. Now he accuses me of being provocative. Is it provocative to announce that the Government are prepared to make substantial funds available? Is it provocative to set out a pay structure that

strengthens the career prospects of all teachers? Is it provocative to expect duties and conditions to be clearly set out in contracts so that teachers, head teachers and local education authorities know where they are? That is not being provocative. This dispute has been rumbling on for over two years. I have acted today in the interests of Britain's children.</p>

<p>Can my right hon. Friend tell us how this excellent deal for the average teacher compares with the pay that such a teacher received when the Government came to office in 1979? Can he also tell us how that compares with the pay in 1975 under the last Labour Government? Will he accept that the parents and teachers in Britain expect no less than that the unions and the Labour party and all who, like the Conservative party, have the interests of children at heart will support this award, which will give our children the best education that we possibly can?</p>

<p>I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his support. I will write to him about the exact comparisons between 1975 and 1979 for the average teacher. In broad averages, the pay of a school teacher now is &#x00A3;11,150. By 1 January 1987, the average will be up to &#x00A3;12,060. By 1 October next year, it will be up to almost &#x00A3;13,000. I envisage that the lowest paid qualified classroom teacher will move up from &#x00A3;6,400 to &#x00A3;7,600 while a senior teacher on the maximum of his scale will go up from &#x00A3;15,300 to &#x00A3;17,500. Exact figures for individual teachers will emerge from the negotiations.</p>

<p>Is the Secretary of State aware that most teachers and parents are sick to death of this dispute? If he is able to secure agreement on the general lines of this package he will receive plenty of thanks. However, he will get no thanks if he blows it by leaving no room for discussion with the local authorities or the teachers' unions.<br/>
The Government are now willing to listen to an independent inquiry, even though it was purely for Scotland, and to put more money on the table. Why on earth did they not do that two years ago when we were asking them for an independent inquiry? Will the Secretary of State back what he has said by telling the House that he is prepared to back state schools and that his object is not to pull all the best teachers into his own centrally controlled city schools at the expense of the state schools? Will he look again at his proposals for the future, because from the small print it is clear that he plans to take total control of teachers' pay? It also looks like total control of education from the centre.</p>

<p>I emphasise that the funds being made available for city technology colleges are in addition to the planned expenditure on education. That money is not at the expense of the maintained sector and I would not want to see that. Nothing that I have said in this debate in any way derails the Nottingham meeting. I have provided a solid framework for the negotiators. They can now go to Nottingham knowing that the Government's position is crystal clear on contractual duties, conditions of service, pay structure, the provision that we will make for spending on teachers' pay and on the level of grants that we will make available to local authorities.</p>

I hope that appraisal will be introduced this year. As my hon. Friend may know, there is a proposal for certain pilot projects to be put in hand. That is an important advance and is contained in the Education Bill which recently left the House and is now in another place.<br/>
I thank my hon. Friend for welcoming this offer. Like me, he is anxious to seek to improve the career structure of teachers. That is the best way to improve the profession and its standing.</p>

<p>Is it not most unfortunate that for two years the Government have provoked the longest strike in the history of education and have now produced a statement delivered in the voice of diktat and threat about what will happen if teachers do not toe the line? The Minister is new to the job and has a lot to learn about it. For years teachers on pitiful wages have carried out voluntary duties. The Government now threaten that those duties will be made contractual and that teachers will be forced to carry them out. That will create again exactly the same conditions that gave rise to the trouble over the last two years. It is useless to say to the teachers that they will get no more. The Government have been dragged, kicking and screaming, from position to position, saying that teachers will get no more, but now they are to get more and the Government are boasting about it as if their action were voluntary.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman was once a head teacher. As a result of my proposals, head teachers will get rather more than Members of Parliament. In the hon. Gentleman's case, it may be a question of water finding its own level.<br/>
I refute the point that he made that the Government are in any way responsible for the breakdown of negotiations. I was appointed to this office in May and since that time I have been pressed every week, almost every day, to clarify the Government's position about teachers' pay. I have now done that and provided a framework which should lead to a settlement.</p>

<p>My right hon. Friend's clear and unequivocal statement will be welcomed not only by parents but by the vast majority of teachers.

This is not a case of the Government being dragged, screaming and protesting, up to date.

<p>Will the Secretary of State take us a little further on the matter of the two lots of 8&#x00B7;5 per cent.? Is that the global total or is it the minimum which would apply to any teaching grade? If it is not the global total, what will be the minimum for each grade? Does the right hon. Gentleman agree that imposing the condition of a completely new system of wage bargaining &#x2014; presumably replacing the present pattern &#x2014;will make his problems more difficult and not contribute to the welfare of children in the way that he wishes? He is imposing a third condition and, as far as I can gather, he has not made the terms of that clear. He is asking for a blank cheque.</p>

<p>I am not asking for a blank cheque. I have said that the Government are prepared to write a very substantial cheque provided that the conditions are met. I want to emphasise that point most strongly. This is a substantial increase in teachers' salaries and the equivalent amount of planned expenditure. It is justifiable only as a result of what we want to gain&#x2014;which is a restructuring of the basic pay structure of the profession.<br/>
After looking at the Coventry proposals on pay and the long scale which went up automatically, I became convinced that that was not appropriate for the teaching profession, and many teachers agreed with me. Teachers on scales 3 and 4&#x2014;senior teachers&#x2014;have recognised that that is not the appropriate way to remunerate the profession.</p>

<p>Like my hon.

That is simply not acceptable.

<p>The hon. Gentleman asked about the successful outcome of Nottingham, and I hope that there will be one. However, whether or not Nottingham achieves a negotiated settlement, I must re-emphasise that the Government's conditions will still have to be met if the extra money is to be paid.

<p>In answer to my hon. Friend's last point, the proposals I shall bring before the House, for an interim advisory committee advising me upon pay, conditions and structure, will provide a better guarantee for teachers than the erosion they have suffered as a result of the breakdown of the Burnham machinery. There is wide agreement across the spectrum that the Burnham machinery is no longer useful.<br/>
I fully endorse and agree with my hon. Friend's first point. If, as a result of my statement, the teacher unions decide that they want more, are not prepared to accept the conditions, or they reject the structure and as a result disruption occurs in schools, that action should be universally condemned. The Government are prepared to provide substantial resources provided that we can find a long-term solution to the dispute.</p>

<p>Does the Secretary of State appreciate that many parents will be bewildered and angry that the Government have done today what the right hon.

Does he understand that with the take-it-or-leave-it attitude he has adopted today he has not created the best conditions for genuine negotiation?

<p>In response to the hon. Gentleman's point about the 19 conditions, the Coventry heads of agreement said:
<q>The basic contractual requirements of the jobs of teachers &#x2026; should be defined in accordance with the ACAS report on duties and responsibilities.</q>
I have not plucked the list of 19 duties out of the air. The hon. Gentleman will find the list in the Coventry report. He will also find greater reservations in that report.

I must ask the Secretary of State again, because he did not answer before, why he said nothing about the Coventry proposals on reducing the size of classes, giving time to the preparation of lessons and providing more opportunities for in-service training? The right hon. Gentleman did not answer that question before. Will he answer it now?<br/>
The Secretary of State seemed rather annoyed about my warnings over the nature and tone of his intervention. I asked him to state whether the Government would he prepared to give more money. They have done that, but I do not accept the way that it has been done. At this last moment, is not the Secretary of State asking teachers to keep faith with the contract side of the bargain while at the same time telling employers to tear up the agreement on pay structure that was so carefully negotiated at Coventry and that was specifically designed to reward the classroom teacher?<br/>
Finally, is the Secretary of State aware that we are desperately anxious that Nottingham should succeed? For the past two years we have tried to obtain a settlement of the teachers' dispute, and if the Nottingham negotiations fail, it will be the Government's fault.</p>

<p>I do not think so. In my statement I mentioned 195 working days and set out the figure that was discussed at Coventry. I understand that the 1,300 hours also featured until very late in the marathon negotiating session in Coventry. Those are very important figures because they deal with class time. It works out at an average of 33&#x2153; hours for the 39 teaching weeks of the year.<br/>
Apparently, the hon. Gentleman now wishes to support Coventry, but he knows perfectly well that ever since that agreement was negotiated unions have chipped away at it. There has been considerable disquiet about it, and it was condemned and strongly attacked in the Main committee. It does not provide a proper basis for the structure of the teaching profession. When the hon. Gentleman has read the letter that I have placed in the Vote Office, and has reflected on it, I hope that his support for what I have said today will be unequivocal.</p>

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Speaker.

<p>With permission, Mr. Speaker, I wish to make a statement about school teachers' pay and conditions of service in Scotland.<br/>
On 6 March this year I told the House that I intended to set up a committee of inquiry to examine the pay, conditions of service, and management of school teachers in Scotland. The committee was asked to report by the end of the summer. I received the report towards the end of September and it was published on 2 October. I congratulate Sir Peter Main and his colleagues on the speed and thoroughness with which they have discharged a very difficult and important task.<br/>
At the core of the committee's report is a set of recommendations which the committee has suggested should be judged as an indivisible package. These relate to pay level and structure, the duties and conditions of service of teachers, staffing standards and negotiating machinery. I am pleased to be able to tell the House that, in general, the Government accept the asterisked recommendations as a package. I shall make the necessary resource provision, backed by additional rate support grant, to allow local authorities to implement in full the salary scales proposed in the report so as to settle teachers' pay for 1986&#x2013;87 and 1987&#x2013;88. This will he done on the following time scale&#x2014;half the further increases recommended by Main will be paid from 1 January 1987, making an average increase of 8&#x00B7;2 per cent. from that date on top of the 5&#x00B7;5 per cent. interim increase paid from 1 April 1986, and the remaining half will be paid from 1 October 1987. Both stages would depend on the Scottish Joint Negotiating Committee reaching agreement on a settlement which provides for the full implementation of the asterisked recommendations on pay structure, duties and conditions of service. I must emphasise that my offer is entirely dependent on reaching such agreement, in that it cannot be increased and there can be no question of any part of these resources being made available other than on this basis. The size of the award and the burden that it imposes on the ratepayer and the taxpayer make it sensible to stage implementation, as has been done in the past with other awards of this kind.<br/>
My proposals would involve adding &#x00A3;14 million in 1986&#x2013;87 and &#x00A3;60 million in 1987&#x2013;88 to planned expenditure on education; this reflects the cost over and above the figures that I have already announced as the basis for rate support grant in 1987&#x2013;88. Grant will be increased in those two periods by &#x00A3;8 million and &#x00A3;30 million respectively. That would represent a big pay increase for Scottish teachers; it is justified only by the benefits which the package as a whole will bring&#x2014;the right kind of pay structure for Scottish schools, the necessary clarification of teachers' duties, which parents will find particularly helpful, and a more practical and realistic approach to teachers' conditions of service. In accepting these recommendations, the Government are making clear the importance that they attach to securing the future development of the education service and recognising the contribution that teachers make to our society.<br/>
There is one asterisked recommendation on which I will for the time being reserve the Government's position&#x2014;the recommendation that an independent review body be

established to settle the pay and conditions of school teachers. That recommendation has major implications for the future and I wish to give it further thought before reaching a final conclusion on it.<br/>
I have concentrated in this statement on the asterisked recommendations which lie at the core of the Main committee's report. There are, of course, many other valuable recommendations &#x2014;on the role and functions of head teachers, on the professional development of teachers, on the role of parents and on the more effective and economical use of resources within the school system. I intend to pursue all these matters vigorously in consultation with the education authorities and the other interests concerned.<br/>
Since August 1984 Scottish schools have suffered disruption as a result of the present teachers' dispute. The Main committee's report offers us an excellent basis not only to end that dispute but to offer our schools and teachers a positive way forward. This is a once and for all opportunity which must be seized with both hands. The Government are prepared to do their part even though the cost to the ratepayer and taxpayer is high; now it is up to the teachers and the employers to do theirs. Meanwhile, I call upon the teachers' unions to call off their continuing boycotts of certain duties and to allow schools to function normally; the immediate resumption of normal working must, of course, be a feature of the agreement that I am asking the SJNC to reach. I am sure that the whole House will join with me in urging teachers and employers to reach speedy and full agreement along the lines I have indicated.</p>

<p>By any standards, this is a serious statement which is central to the possibility of settling a long-running, unhappy dispute, and we should be dismayed indeed if the Government were to put at risk, or worse still beyond reach, a just and honourable settlement.<br/>
The Minister says that the Government have accepted Main "in general". He will accept that that is an important qualification. He must agree that the report is pre tinted as an indivisible package, an approach which the Government have urged upon teachers. Does the right hon. and learned Gentleman accept that he is taking a considerable risk in departing from the report's central recommendations on pay? Does he accept that, over this financial year and the next, his re-jigging of the financial timetable proposed in Main will have a significant impact on individual teachers and what they can expect? Does he accept my calculation that the new phasing would cost a teacher about 10 per cent. of his present salary during that period?<br/>
The newly proposed settlement involves the loss of 16&#x00B7;4 per cent. for three months from 1 October 1986 to 1 January 1987 with a further 8&#x00B7;2 per cent. in the nine months from 1 January 1987 to 1 October 1987.<br/>
I have not had a great deal of time to calculate the figures, but will the Secretary of State confirm that a teacher on a present salary of &#x00A3;8,000 can expect over the period from October 1986 to October 1987 to get about &#x00A3;800 less than he would have got if the Government had held to the Main timetable? The right hon. and learned Gentleman will recall that the Main committee put the cost of its recommendations on pay for the year 1987&#x2013;88 at &#x00A3;144 million. What will the figure be for the revised package now before the House? I accept that the


Government have found a considerable sum, but is it right or prudent to depart from Main in this way? It is certainly a risk.<br/>
I ask the right hon. and learned Gentleman to consider whether it would be wise to discuss phasing with the local authorities&#x2014;the employers who, after all, have to bear a large proportion of the burden of any settlement. Will he confirm that the whole cost of any settlement will be eligible for rate support grant funding and that no authority will suffer penalties because it has spent above the guidelines simply as a result of any settlement that might be reached? In other words, will the guidelines be adopted to take full account of any increase in expenditure following from the teachers' pay settlement?<br/>
The Secretary of State will recall the important recommendation in Main, marked with an asterisk, calling for a radical review of overall staffing levels. Is he willing to tackle this matter positively? Teachers will want to know his attitude before they reach their decision.<br/>
Can the Secretary of State confirm that these revised proposals will be subject to the agreement of the SJNC &#x2014;the agreement of the employers and employees? Will he assure the House that if, unfortunately, agreement is not reached on an acceptable package, there is no possibility of legislation to impose the conditions? Will he kill that fear stone dead? Will he make it clear that Main's rejection of that option is a rejection that he unreservedly supports? The Secretary of State's reservations are more than minor presentational changes. It would do no one any favours if those changes were hidden. The Secretary of State's reservations must be assessed by all interested parties. Our fervent hope is that this departure from Main will not fatally undermine the chances for a settlement. The Government have shown a measure of flexibility, to put it kindly, by departing from the central recommendations on pay in the Main report. I trust that they will not now take an unyielding, inflexible stand in the continuing search for a solution.</p>

<p>I thank the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) for recognising that the teachers will be expected to make grave decisions in the weeks to come. It is important that they respond to the present situation in a measured way. The Scottish public&#x2014; parents, and children &#x2014; will expect the teachers to respond in a way which will allow our schools to function properly.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman asked a number of detailed points to which I shall respond. First, he asked me to give an assurance that local authorities would not suffer penalties as a consequence of any increased expenditure arising out of this settlement. I can confirm that that is so. Local authority funding provision will be increased to ensure that authorities will not suffer penalties.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman suggested that phasing should be subject to discussion as it is a new measure which I have announced today. The hon. Gentleman is quite right that this proposal has expenditure implications for local authorities. He will be the first to appreciate that local authorities will be saving resources as a result of phasing, so there will not be any marked additional expense.<br/>
The central question which the hon. Gentleman raised is whether it is reasonable that a major increase of 16&#x00B7;4 per cent. should be phased. The hon. Gentleman and the

House will be aware that, over the last few years, there have been numerous precedents with regard to phasing settlements in the public sector. The examples range from nurses, doctors, the police, the armed forces and dentists. Such groups have accepted phasing, especially when a settlement has been above the rate of inflation. It is right to make a reasonable recognition of the importance of ensuring reasonable levels of pay settlement in the country and in the public sector. I believe that reasonable people, including teachers, will accept that the proposed phasing is responsible and sensible.<br/>
I must point out to the hon. Gentleman that the phasing we are proposing will mean that half of the amount recommended will be paid from 1 January and the other half nine months later. That means that teachers will, during the course of 1986&#x2013;87, have an increase in their pay, including the interim award agreed some months ago of almost 14 per cent., of a further 8&#x00B7;2 per cent., which will be given in the second stage. By any standards this is a generous proposal to the Scottish teaching profession.</p>

<p>I congratulate my right hon. and learned Friend on his response to the Main report. Does he accept that the provision of a 16&#x00B7;4 per cent. increase over a year and a 36 per cent. increase over three years is a triumph for the Government? Everyone in Scotland will expect the teachers to welcome this response with enthusiasm and to return to work as soon as possible and without any further argument. Does my right hon. and learned Friend agree that this decision proves that Tories care about education and are prepared to back that commitment with money?</p>

<p>I thank my hon. Friend for the welcome that he has given to this proposal. The emphasis of the Main recommendations and the Government's response is concerned not simply with pay but with the duties and responsibilities of teachers. I strongly believe &#x2014; I trust that the public share my belief&#x2014;that it is in the interests of the teaching profession that these matters should be considered as a single package, and that is what we have done.</p>

<p>Does the Secretary of State accept that it must now be recognised that it was a fundamental mistake by the Government to wait for 19 wasting and damaging months before establishing an independent pay review? I associate myself with the congratulations given to Sir Peter Main.<br/>
Is the right hon and learned Gentleman aware that the alliance regret the fact that the Secretary of State has been unable to reach a conclusion about an ongoing pay review as recommended in paragraph 58 of the Main report? It is not a new idea and I am surprised that the Secretary of State should suggest that it is. My hon. Friend the Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce) and I argued it many times with the previous Secretary of State. Is the right hon. and learned Gentleman aware that we are angry and unhappy at the way in which he has departed from Main on pay? It is still not clear, from his answer to the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar), precisely what is the financial loss which emerges from this. However, it is incontestable that there is a loss. Surely it is unreasonable for the right hon. and learned Gentleman to depart from the indivisible package of the Main report and simultaneously require the full implementation from the


profession. Surely the right hon. and learned Gentleman would agree that that is a dangerous strategy and could well carry the serious risk of teacher rejection.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman will be aware that the unions and local authorities have differing views on the question of an independent pay review. I believe that the announcement I have made today, that we wish to give further thought to the matter, will be widely welcomed. I listened to the hon. Gentleman's remarks on phasing with some interest because I did not hear his hon. Friend the Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) raise any objection to phasing of the award proposed by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Education and Science. If the Liberal party believes that it is reasonable and in the public interest for a major increase of 16&#x00B7;4 per cent. to be phased in the way proposed in England and Wales, I await with some curiosity to hear why it should be considered irresponsible north of the border.</p>

<p>Is my right hon. and learned Friend aware that his statement will be warmly welcomed by parents throughout Scotland and by all reasonable teachers?

<p>My hon. Friend is right. On the basis of what I have announced today, more than 66 per cent. of teachers in Scotland, over two thirds, will be earning over &#x00A3;12,000 a year and nearly one third of teachers in secondary education will be earning more than &#x00A3;15,000 a year. [HON. MEMBERS: "When?"] By 1 October 1987. That is less than a year from now. That is in the context of an increase of 16&#x00B7;4 per cent. on top of the 5&#x00B7;5 per cent. they have already been awarded this year, which was on top of the 9 per cent. awarded last year. That will mean that over two to three years teachers in Scotland will be seeing an increase in their salary of almost 30 per cent. My hon. Friend is right in saying that parents and the public in Scotland would be astonished if there was any suggestion of disruption in the schools as a consequence of an offer of that kind.</p>

<p>Is the Secretary of State aware that many of us felt that the Main report provided an excellent basis for a settlement for teachers' salaries and conditions in Scotland, preventing further disruption in schools? However, it is extremely misleading for the Secretary of State to say that he has accepted the asterisked recommendations as a package when the salary increase date of 1 October 1986 was a key recommendation in the report.<br/>
Is it not a fact that the phasing, far from being minor, will save about 10 per cent. of the annual salary bill over the next 18 months and therefore reduce teachers' expectations, as compared with Main, by about 10 per cent. of their annual salary? Is it also not a fact that if further disruption does unfortunately occur in Scottish education the Secretary of State will bear a major share of the responsibility for that, just as it was the Government's earlier intransigent attitude over the setting up of the independent pay review that caused so much hardship to Scottish education?</p>

<p>I will do the right hon. Gentleman the credit of saying that I do not think he believes in what he

is saying. I genuinely express the view that the right hon. Gentleman knows perfectly well that an award of 16&#x00B7;4 per cent. to teachers, with a nine-month gap between the two phases, is an extremely generous offer to teachers. He knows that the public, including his constituents, would be delighted if they were to receive such an increase. He also knows that there is ample precedent throughout the public sector for phasing of the kind I have proposed. If nurses, doctors, the armed forces and the police are able to accept phasing of that kind, I do not think that the right hon.

<p>I add my congratulations to the Secretary of State for the speedy response he has made to the Main report, which has obviously had far-reaching implications over the Scottish border.

Those members will now be able to decide on the facts without being in the political vacuum that would have existed had the statement not been made.<br/>
If the Secretary of State is prepared to negotiate on the anomalies in the salary scales proposed by Main in the salaries committee, is he also prepared to negotiate on conditions of service within the conditions of service committee, which is unique to Scotland and has no counterpart in England or Wales, in order to allow the Scottish teachers to look at the conditions of service, or have the teachers to accept or reject the statement today as a package?</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman raises two points. First, his timescale about elections is somewhat misplaced. The Government's response arises from the Main inquiry, which was announced nine months ago. We could not respond to the Main inquiry until it had reported, which it did at the beginning of October. Therefore, by all normal criteria, we responded pretty quickly. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will respond to that in his usual generous way.<br/>
On the question of science teachers and others of that kind, one of the crucial ingredients of the package proposed by Main and accepted by the Government is that, for the first time for several years, teachers who acquire real responsibility in their schools are being offered substantial salaries. For example, a headmaster in one of Scotland's largest secondary schools will be able to expect to receive a salary of about &#x00A3;28,000 per year. At lower levels, salaries are substantially greater than teachers have been able to expect in recent years. If we are anxious to attract people of real ability to the teaching profession, we now have a far better means of doing so than we have  had for some time.</p>

<p>Bearing in mind that it was my right hon. and learned Friend who set up the Main committee to try to find a solution to this long-running and unhappy dispute, and mindful of the maxim that he who wills the end must will the means, does my right hon. and learned Friend agree that nothing could be worse than a grudging response from the Government at this stage? Therefore, will he assure the House that, irrespective of the forthcoming autumn statement and other matters of concern to the Treasury, the money is firmly up front and remains on the table, subject only to the teachers having the good sense to accept this package and return to normal working in the classroom?</p>

<p>I can confirm that. However, if the proposals were to be rejected, there is no way that one penny of additional resources would be made available. That is clearly the view, not just of the Government but of local authorities. The Convention of Scottish Local Authorities has said that it is not interested in a pay settlement which deals with pay alone. The Government and Scottish local authorities speak with a single voice on this.</p>

How can they possibly go back to their constituencies and expect to be treated as though they have been behaving responsibly if their only response to this settlement is to carp and to whine as they have done today?</p>

<p>My hon. Friend is right. It is an extremely generous settlement. The estimated average salary of a teacher in primary education will be &#x00A3;12,300 and it will be &#x00A3;13,745 for a secondary school teacher. If one compares that to the salary levels of two years ago, there will be few people among the general public who will see this as anything other than an extremely generous proposal.</p>

<p>Many of us recognise that it could not have been easy for the Secretary of State for Scotland and his right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Education and Science to screw this settlement out of the Treasury. Nevertheless, I remind the right hon. and learned Gentleman that the whole ethos of the Main report gave full recognition to all the problems which have been confronted by Scottish teachers over the past two years and, while not justifying the disruption, could understand it. I appeal to the Secretary of State to take a less aggressive approach, and not to threaten the teachers that if they do not accept this in total there will be no money at all on the table.</p>

<p>It is a curious threat to offer a 16&#x00B7;4 per cent. pay increase. As the hon. Gentleman's introductory comments recognised, the offer involves a substantial increase in demand on public resources. He is correct to say that phasing was not recommended by the Main report, but he will be one of the first to appreciate that the Government have a responsibility not only for the teaching profession, but to try to ensure that public sector pay negotiations generally, as well as other matters which affect the wider economy, are taken into account.<br/>
It is not unreasonable to say that a massive increase such as this should be phased over a short period, just as it would be for others in the public sector. The Government propose 8&#x00B7;2 per cent. from 1 January and the other 8&#x00B7;2 per cent. nine months later. That is not an absurd degree of phasing extending over two, three or four years.


It will ensure that the full award recommended by the Main report will be available to all Scottish teachers within a short period. The vast majority of teachers will accept that that is not unreasonable given the situation affecting the wider community.</p>

<p>I associate myself with the initial comments of the hon.

Does my right hon. and learned Friend agree that it is deplorable that some members of the EIS, and other unions in Scotland, have decided to condemn the Main report before Mr. Pollock and his executive have had a chance to consider it in a responsible manner as they have done since the Main report was published?</p>

<p>It is regrettable that some individuals believe that they should receive massive pay increases and not accept their responsibility to respond to the other matters recommended by the Main report. I am sure that that is not the view of the vast majority of Scottish teachers, who know that most of the non-pay recommendations with regard to a new contract represent what they currently do in normal circumstances &#x2014; for example, curriculum development, the presentation of pupils for examinations, and the various other duties suggested by the Main report. None of those will impose a new burden on the teaching profession. I was interested to learn that some leading members of the EIS had been seeking to explain that to their fellow members during the last few days. I hope that they are successful in their effort.</p>

<p>The Government are providing not a gun but money, which ultimately must be paid by the taxpayer, and, through the local authorities, by the ratepayer. The EIS and others have been anxious to hear the Government's view.

<p>I have not commented on my hon. Friend's final point, but I am able to confirm that there will be a disregard with regard to the consequences of the 5&#x00B7;5 per cent. interim award announced earlier this year. Therefore, no local authority will attract penalties as a consequence of that earlier award.<br/>
Parents and the public would find any further disruptions in the schools incomprehensible. I think that it would be fair to say that the House would also find it incomprehensible.

<p>Will the Secretary of State bow a little to the reality of what is happening in the schools? When the Main report was issued its starred recommendations were treated as an indivisible package and the Main proposals on salaries were immediately circulated in the schools.

We are all concerned about the atmosphere in the schools and, by moving away from Main in his statement today, no matter how little, the right hon. and learned Gentleman is conditioning an atmosphere against the Main proposals. <i>[Interruption.]</i> The hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Malone) sits muttering on the Front Bench, but he knows nothing about it. I speak as the husband of a teacher and the father of a teacher.<br/>

<p>Yes, we accept the recommendations for head teachers, which seem to be sensible. If the hon. Gentleman is the husband of a teacher who is likely to receive a 16&#x00B7;4 per cent. increase over the next few months, he should have responded in slightly more cheerful tones than he seems to feel capable of. If the hon. Gentleman asks his constituents whether it is reasonable or unreasonable to phase a 16&#x00B7;4 per cent. pay increase over a period of months, I think that he will find that few of them would not like to be in the position of being offered such a pay increase.

I genuinely believe that the vast majority of people in Scotland will see the Government's response as an extremely generous one, guaranteeing, as it will, the implementation of a major pay increase, and, indeed, expecting from teachers no more that what the vast majority of good teachers already do in normal circumstances.

In addition to that, there is the 3&#x00B7;75 per cent. increase in the budget which the Government allowed for in determining the rate support grant for next year which reduces the cost of &#x00A3;144 million to &#x00A3;87 million.

<p>There is no specific proposal within the package, but the Main report said that it had come to the conclusion that the present complicated procedures that are required to be fulfilled before a bad teacher can be dismissed need to be modernised so that the rules governing teachers should be closer to those governing all other employees.

As I mentioned earlier, the cost that Main announced of &#x00A3;144 million comes down to &#x00A3;113 million because of the interim award and down to &#x00A3;87 million because of the provision that we have already made in the rate support grant. I shall have to check, but it would appear that, given the &#x00A3;60 million that I have announced today for 1987&#x2013;88, there will be a difference of &#x00A3;27 million for 1987&#x2013;88.</p>

The hon. Member for Monklands, West (Mr. Clarke) questioned why the first phase of the pay increase will be paid on 1 January. The Government and the Main report make it clear that such a high pay increase can be justified only by a return to normality within schools. It is equally true that, at this time, there is no normality in schools. There is no curriculum development or parental liaison and in many areas of school life teachers have declined to behave normally. Even if the result of the ballot is what we hope&#x2014;in favour of the resolution of this issue&#x2014;it is unlikely that the Scottish Joint Negotiating Committee will ratify this agreement much before the middle of December.

First, the difference between the Secretary of State's proposals and the Main proposals is approximately &#x00A3;27 million. He is sacrificing the indivisible Main package for &#x00A3;27 million. Secondly, can he confirm that his statement will mean that, during the next 12 months, Scottish teachers will suffer a 10 per cent. loss compared with what they would have received had Main's proposals been implemented?</p>

<p>No, it is not irrelevant. It would be gravely irresponsible, at a time when inflation is as low as it is, for any Government to implement a pay increase of 16&#x00B7;4 per cent. The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) must realise, as some other hon.

Members certainly do, that since in earlier pay settlements phasing has been a natural part of the process, the modest phasing that is proposed here is acceptable. It is not just a matter of &#x00A3;27 million, although the hon. Gentleman is correct to say that that is the sum involved over the year in question. It is also important to ensure that teachers are not considered as living on the moon, separate from other people engaged in wage negotiations.<br/>
The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire can have no interest in an escalation of wage claims. That is why, in many previous cases in the public sector and elsewhere, when a major pay increase has been considered reasonable and responsible, most responsible people have accepted that a phasing of the increase is not unreasonable.</p>

<p>On a point order, Mr. Speaker. This is further to the point of order that I raised previously. I believe that it is a substantial point of order.<br/>
We had a statement on education in England, which lasted for about 46 minutes. Various English Members of Parliament were not called. I make no complaint about that because I got my question in anyhow on the Scottish statement. We had questions on the Scottish statement for 49 minutes. If we take a minute out of that for myself, that leaves 48 minutes. That is two thirds of a minute for every Scottish Member and less than a tenth of a minute for every English Member. It seems that the Scottish Members get a better crack of the whip than the English Members.<br/>
Speaking as an English Member, and knowing that you are an Englishman, Mr. Speaker, I wonder whether in future weeks and months some consideration could be given to the matter so that some of my English colleagues &#x2014;not myself, because I know the problem that faces you &#x2014; do not consider themselves as second-class Members.</p>

<p>As this is the first group of amendments to be discussed, and especially as it is the first group of several which deal with the scope of the Bill, it might be appropriate if I made some general comments before coming to the substance of the amendments under consideration.<br/>
Many amendments have been made to the Bill. I wish that it had been possible to keep the number rather smaller, although I must immediately add that many of the amendments are technical. However, the number and variety of amendments fulfil a promise we have made throughout the proceedings on the Bill that we would listen carefully and with an open mind to representations put to us and would not hesitate to introduce amendments where a case was made out.<br/>
The Bill is highly technical and it ventures into previously uncharted legislative territory. We would have been severely criticised, and justly so, if in those circumstances we had not listened to representations.<br/>
I would not wish my introduction to suggest that the Bill is, or is intended to become, fundamentally different from the Bill that was introduced 10 months ago. The basic regulatory structure remains unchanged because we believe that it is the right structure. But the Bill has benefited from extensive consultation on detailed structure and on technical points.<br/>
We have received several representations about the scope of clause 1. The anxiety that has been expressed about the definition in clause 1 was that a person engaging in some business wholly unconnected with investments might be regarded as carrying on investment business, and

hence be required to be authorised, by virtue of entering into a single investment transaction. That would clearly be absurd. As it happens, it would not be the result of the clause as originally drafted. But on such a matter, it is clearly important that there should be as little room for doubt as possible.<br/>
Amendment No. 1, therefore, makes it clear that a person who engages in investment activities from a permanent place of business in the United Kingdom will be regarded as carrying on investment business in the United Kingdom only if his investment activities taken on their own, in isolation from any other activities and from any activities excluded by virtue of part III of schedule 1, could be regarded as amounting to carrying on business.<br/>
Amendment No. 3 makes it clear that a person who does not carry on investment activities from a permanent place of business in the United Kingdom will be regarded as carrying on investment business here only if he engages in the United Kingdom in one or more investment activities which are not excluded by parts III or IV of schedule 1 and, in so doing, may be regarded as carrying on a business in the United Kingdom. These amendments will, I believe, remove any remaining doubts about the effect of the clause.<br/>
Amendments Nos. 2 and 32 make it clear that the references to a "permanent place of business" in clause 1(3)<i>(a)</i> and clause 30(2) refer to a permanent place of business maintained by the person in question. Without this clarification it might be argued that an overseas person who engaged an agent established in the United Kingdom to enter into investment transactions for him could be regarded as entering into those transactions from a permanent place of business in the United Kingdom. This would mean that the exclusions in part IV of schedule 1 would not apply, although the arrangement I have described is one which they were designed to cover. Once again, it seems preferable to put the matter beyond doubt by the amendments.</p>

<p>I am grateful to the Parliamentary Under-Secretary for his general comments. As this is the first group of amendments, I shall follow suit. We are confronted with a most unusual position. We have before us a list covering 581 Lords amendments, comprising 136 printed pages. It is fair to say, as the Minister has, that many of the amendments are of a technical and consequential nature and that others arise because of commitments given in earlier proceedings. However, the fact remains that we have great difficulty, not only because of the sheer volume of the amendments, but because of the timing.<br/>
The Lords completed their procedures only earlier this week. The simple exigencies of printing, and so on, have meant that we have seen the amendments in their marshalled form for only 24 hours at the maximum. Although the Minister is well able to handle the volume of material, since, one assumes, he has had a hand in preparing it, a great burden is placed on other hon. Members. I immediately pay tribute to the efforts that the Minister and his private office have made over the past months to try to keep the Opposition Front Bench in touch with what has been going on. That has been helpful.<br/>
However, I think of other Government and Opposition hon. Members who will find it an almost superhuman task to try to winnow out from this immense volume of material what is important and what is not. It is all very


well for the Minister to say that the amendments are merely technical, but if the Opposition &#x2014;I include all Opposition parties&#x2014;are to do their job properly, they cannot take that on trust. We must look at the amendments to ensure that they are technical and consequential and that there are not points of political significance buried in them. It must be said that the Government have confronted the House with an extremely difficult proceeding.<br/>
In my view, the Government are not entirely to blame, although, as the prime mover in such matters and responsible for the consultations and preparations for the Bill, they must take the ultimate responsibility. However, I think that the Minister has been unfortunate&#x2014;if I may offer him a word of comfort&#x2014;in that he has been the victim of some remarkably late lobbying on the part of City interests and institutions which have belatedly woken up to the fact that some of the Bill's provisions will cut across some of their well-established interests. No doubt the Minister has found that some people have been banging hard on his door over recent weeks, and perhaps that is part of the reason we are confronted with so many late amendments. We cannot let the point pass without registering that protest &#x2014; that we are confronted with that difficulty and, as a consequence, we are unable to give the Bill the detailed scrutiny that it should have. It is an important measure, and I fear that we must take a great deal on trust.<br/>
I was interested to hear the Minister's comments on the substance of the amendments. I shall ask him a straightforward question. Many of the amendments to the definition clauses of the Bill have arisen because of representations made by bodies such as the Association of Corporate Treasurers and the Confederation of British Industry. They became alarmed that the Bill as originally drafted would drag into its net a range of activities that were not intended to be covered. Opposition Members are familiar with some of those arguments.<br/>
From time to time, the Minister and his governmental colleagues have said that great reliance can be placed on the word "engaged", and that the phrase "engaging in business" implies a connotation of continuity; in other words, it does not apply to a one-off transaction and, therefore, many of the problems that were feared might arise are thereby dealt with. Sometimes, it was argued that the word "engaged" implied the doing of business for remuneration. I ask the Minister whether he is satisfied that such reliance can be placed on the term. Can he give us a general assurance that the proper concerns raised by the corporate treasurers and others have been largely met? I am not aware that there is any residual difficulty about the matter, but I think that it is worth placing on the record the fact &#x2014;if indeed it is a fact&#x2014;that the basic objections and difficulties have been met.</p>

<p>I apologise, Mr. Deputy Speaker.<br/>
The amendment illustrates the dilemma in which my hon. and learned Friend the Minister found himself. He said that when he received representations on the matter he was not satisfied that there was any need to amend the Bill. He felt that clause 1 made it clear that what was intended was reference to sombody who was running an investment business on a regular basis. He thought that it was quite clear that it was not referring to a one-off investment transaction. However, he wanted to put the matter beyond doubt and to satisfy those who were concerned.<br/>
I think that many of the amendments are to do with the periphery, the boundaries of the Bill, the definition of "investment business", and whether certain people are or are not caught by the Bill. Amendment No. 1 illustrates the difficulty in which my hon. and learned Friend found himself. That is true of many of the amendments. He has said that, although the Government have put down amendments and they have been accepted in another place, amendment No. 1 is not strictly necessary.</p>

<p>I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) for his remarks. I associate myself with the congratulations he offered to the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) on his election yesterday to the shadow Cabinet. I am also happy to associate myself with the remarks made by my hon. Friend about the part played by the hon.

I acknowledge the protests that he registered and the way in which he did so. I hope that we can make progress this evening, and if necessary tomorrow, to deal with the issues involved.<br/>
The answer to the specific question that the hon. Gentleman raised was largely provided by my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield. We took the view that the word "engaged" had the connotation suggested by the hon. Member for Dagenham. For that reason, the meaning which was attributed to clause 1 by those who were concerned about its application was not justified, and they were being unduly apprehensive. On the other hand, it seemed that one had a duty to respond to those concerns, to place the matter beyond doubt and to deal with it in the way in which we have sought to do by bringing the amendment before the House. I am happy to tell the House that we have met the concerns that were expressed rather late in the day by the CBI and the Association of Corporate Treasurers. There is no lingering unhappiness on their part, at least so far as I am aware, about the concerns they expressed to us at the end of July.</p>

<p>The most important change made by amendment No. 4 relates to the scope of the powers in clause 2. The need for an amendment springs from an amendment which introduces into schedule 1 a procedure for the Secretary of State to grant permissions which will have the effect of excluding from the definition of investment business certain activities carried on by the holder. The existing power in clause 2 to amend the definition of investment or investment business would not have been sufficient to amend the powers of the Secretary of State to grant permissions under the new provisions or to confer further powers on him. Therefore, it would not have been possible to extend the powers to cover activities other than those specified in the amendment, or to amend the criteria against which applications are to be judged. The amendment gives the clause 2 powers this desirable flexibility. Amendment No. 5 and the first part of the amendment No. 4 are consequential on amendments to the definitions in clause 1 made on Report.</p>

<speech hansard_id="438532" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1986-10-30a.493.8" hansard_membership_id="4900" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/11446" speakername="Mr. Gould" colnum="493" time="17:45:00">
<p>I understand from what the Minister has said that the general effect of amendment No. 4 is to give the Secretary of State greater flexibility to adjust the definition of what carrying on investment business might or might not mean. One could add to the definition or subtract from it. That is a welcome flexibility, and I accept the purpose of the amendment. I take this opportunity to examine the direction in which the Secretary of State might intend to use his powers. An obvious and important way in which he might use these powers is by incorporating as part of the investment business, which ought to be dealt with under the Bill, the advising and managing of takeover bids. Most people understand that this is an important aspect of City operations and of investment business generally.<br/>
Given the unfortunate fact that the City very often finds itself in the headlines these days as a consequence of public concern at the way in which takeover bids are managed, it seems perverse that so far the Government have not taken the opportunity of specifically including the rules of the takeover code and the role of the takeover panel within these definitions. The fortunate aspect of this amendment is that it at least keeps open the possibility that the Secretary of State will choose to use his powers to do what

the Opposition believe he should do, and ought to have done from the outset.<br/>
The sheer volume of takeover activity has caused a great deal of concern, but there is even more concern about the obvious evidence that corners are being cut and rules are being bent simply because of the immensely valuable business available to merchant bankers and others in this lucrative market. Increasingly, one finds &#x2014; there is evidence virtually every day of the week&#x2014;that the City and the takeover panel are concerned at the way in which the rules are ignored. It is perverse that the Government do not take the opportunity to remedy that obvious difficulty. A current example with which we are all familiar involves the problems arising from the Turner and Newall bid for AE. It could be argued that the takeover panel acted very fairly and responded with the appropriate range of sanctions and penalties. I shall try to argue in a moment that that is not necessarily the best way of dealing with that situation.<br/>
The difficulty, of course, is that the panel as presently constituted and operating, and operating outside the Bill and outside any possible statutory framework, remains a voluntary body. As a consequence, its rules have no legal force, it has no sanctions, and at the end of the day it has no teeth. In the intensely competitive new City, the major new players, as we all know, are intent on playing to the rules&#x2014;to the whistle&#x2014;and will demand something more than the relative lack of certainty offered by a voluntary code. Already there is evidence that in major takeover bids of this sort people are increasingly tempted to go to court, and on occasions do so, to get a legally binding ruling as to what is permissible and what is not. The danger is that if things are left as they are, quite apart from any other problems, the takeover panel may find itself bypassed in many of these important matters.<br/>
The case for the takeover panel in the present situation is that it provides a system of flexibility and of speedy response. I do not dispute that. My criticism is not of the fulfilment of the takeover panel's role within the constraints placed upon it. It has done an excellent job. If these matters are to be regulated effectively and if public and City concern is to be damped down, it is important that, in addition to speed and flexibility, and perhaps in contradistinction to those qualities, the takeover code should offer certainty.

<p>In the Turner and Newall case, the panel said that anybody in doubt about the meaning of the code, instead of consulting his lawyers &#x2014; we all know that one's lawyer will often give the advice one is looking for&#x2014;should consult the panel and get a legal ruling.</p>

<p>I am not sure whether the Parliamentary Under-Secretary's reply meets my point. I do not dispute for a moment the willingness of the panel to answer such questions. The problem is that the answers that the panel gives are no more legally binding than anything else it does. It is increasingly clear that some parties to bids are likely to want a legally binding decision from the courts.<br/>
The Turner and Newall case &#x2014; the AE case &#x2014;illustrates the difficult point that concern about the role of the takeover panel and the case for bringing it within the framework of the Bill rests on two attitudes which, in some


senses at any rate, run in contrary directions. There is the problem that, without sanctions, the takeover panel is increasingly in danger of being ignored. It will be ignored, if we are not careful, by those whose reputations are of no great value to them. The sanction at the disposal of the takeover panel is that of public reprimand. The panel could use the sanction of public reprimand to hurt people who transgress the rules. Damage is caused to the reputation of the bank or house involved. If, however&#x2014;this is not by any means beyond the bounds of possibility &#x2014;we are dealing with people who, in a sense, have no reputation to protect and are content to take the money and run, the sanction is of much less significance.<br/>
Without some statutory back-up to the code&#x2014;some legal force to the sanctions which it can apply&#x2014;I fear that, in the intensely competitive climate in the City, it will become simply part of the acceptable wounds of battle, or some of the occupational hazards which merchant banks and others are content to accept as the price for carrying out this business and for obtaining future business. There is evidence in recent cases that even reputable merchant banks and reputable brokers are willing to take that public reprimand &#x2014; that slap across the wrist. As a consequence, they can show their present and future clients that they are in to play rough for the best possible result for their clients.<br/>
The danger is that over a period the sanctions, such as they are, which the takeover panel might be able to exert will simply lose their force. We saw in the case of Lloyd's what happens when a regulatory system becomes inured to unacceptable behaviour. I fear that the same may happen with the takeover code and the activities of the panel. That is the primary case for the Minister using the power that the amendment gives him to extend the ambit of the Bill to the takeover panel.<br/>
In relation to the AE case, let me explain the other set of concerns. I think that this is the point that was made by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith). Even where the panel appears to take tough action, and appears to apply the rules in a penal way, there is still a substantial ground for concern at the fact that the panel has no statutory powers. The difficulty arises because if the panel gets tough, it does so on the basis of no legally established powers of any sort. It is not a tribunal, and it is not a court of law. It does not and cannot therefore provide the legal safeguards. It provides little by way of proper appeals, and so on. If major decisions are to be taken, affecting hundreds if not thousands of millions of pounds, they should be taken by a body that is set up by law and therefore provides all the ordinary safeguards that should be provided.<br/>
The difficulty with the AE case is that the takeover panel in many ways fell short of some of the procedural safeguards. It left some of the parties dissatisfied. In the end the sanctions that it applied were applied to the company rather than to the advisers. It was the shareholders of the victim company, as it were, who, in the end, had to carry the burden of the bad practices of their merchant banks and stockbrokers. In other words, even where the takeover panel has done what it can to punish transgressors, it has ended up punishing the wrong people. Even in areas where it tries to improve the operation of the code&#x2014;for example, in the restrictions on advertising&#x2014;it is in danger of misunderstanding what is needed in the interests of investor protection. For many shareholders, the full-page advertisement in one of the quality dailies is

a useful and almost unique source of information about the nature of various bids. Even in its constitution, the takeover panel is hardly representative of the investing public, but it is certainly representative of many of those who manage investments and deal with takeover bids. It is unfortunate that in its attempts to regulate the area, it has acted against the interests of small investors.</p>

<p>I fear that if I were to add my congratulations to the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) on his election to the shadow Cabinet I might do his chances next year some damage, as so much admiration has already been expressed by Conservative Members.<br/>
I rise merely to comment on the burden of the hon. Gentleman's speech. He said that he found the amendment sensible and one that he could normally support but was probing the Minister as to what was in his mind. From the hon. Gentleman's speech, I got the impression that if the Minister could not assure him about the takeover panel and its ultimate inclusion in the Bill, the hon. Gentleman might push the matter to a Division. I have to say with no enthusiasm, and perhaps, to put it bluntly, with a little embarrassment, that if he were to do that my party and I could not go into the Division Lobby with him. I say that with a little embarrassment because we joined him in the Division Lobby last time he raised the matter. Therefore, I ask him and others to recognise that, on maturer consideration of those matters and, in particular &#x2014; <i>[Interruption.]</i> Labour Members have good reason to laugh, but Conservative Members have not. They will recall that the Government introduced some 700 amendments, 20 new clauses and four new schedules and the Minister has had to refer time and again to "mature consideration". I recall that when we discussed the immunity of self-regulating organisations he argued for half a morning that there should be no immunity for SROs but subsequently gave in&#x2014;not to the blandishments of good sense, but to the pressure put upon him by City organisations and others.<br/>
6.15 pm<br/>
If the Minister can make such claims, so can I. I shall try to explain why we have reached that view. I refer first to a point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Stockton, South (Mr. Wrigglesworth) &#x2014; that the takeover panel is currently working well. One does not need to take his view or, indeed, my view on that. The most cursory study of the speech by the hon. Member for Dagenham when he raised the matter on Report will


reveal, at column 539, a tribute to the working of the panel. The debate in the other place was redolent with statements by the Labour spokesman there about how the takeover panel was working effectively. I direct the attention of the House to column 518 of the <i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> of 27 October, in which the official spokesman for the Labour party said that he believed that the panel was working well and that the code in operation was good. I do not quote him precisely, but any cursory study of the debate gives that sense. The Labour spokesman did not criticise the working of the panel in any way or suggest that it was inimical to the shareholders.<br/>
There was a good deal of contradiction between the speech of the hon. Member for Dagenham about the working of the takeover panel and the statements by his party's representative in the other place, where the Labour spokesman went so far as to say specifically that he believed that the takeover panel in its operation and under the present rules looked after the interests of the small shareholder. That is precisely the point on which the hon. Member for Dagenham has taken a different view, so perhaps there are differences in other areas as well. In short, there was no suggestion in any of the those speeches that the takeover panel was not operating successfully and looking after the needs of small shareholders &#x2014; for instance, in a way that ensures that they receive offers in the same way as larger shareholders. Indeed, one criticism of the takeover panel has been that in some quarters it makes it too easy for small shareholders to receive such bids. I am assured, however, that the hon. Member for Dagenham would not wish to alter that provision&#x2014;and nor would I.</p>

<p>I was moving to that point. It seems that the Labour Front Bench in the other place, and, by inference, here as well, agrees that the takeover panel is operating well at present. The view is shared by them and us that the current operation of the takeover panel is adequate. The hon. Member for Dagenham has not criticised that.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman has made the statement so frequently that even I, with my great patience, am forced to rise to contradict him. I have just spent eight or 10 minutes explaining carefully, as I thought, precisely why Labour Members&#x2014;I am glad to associate my hon. Friends in the other place with the sentiments that I have expressed &#x2014; believe that the takeover panel, although an admirable body within the constraints that apply to it, is not doing an adequate job in the interests of investor protection.

<p>I take the flavour of that, but it seems that there is a contradiction to be drawn between what has been said this evening and what was said on Report. The hon. Member for Dagenham said:
<q>It is appropriate to pay tribute to the work of the takeover code and of the panel that administers it."&#x2014;[<i>Official Report,</i> 12 June 1986; Vol. 99, c.539.]</q>

He then said that the serious question was whether that arrangement would suffice following the big bang.</p>

<p>If the hon. Gentleman believes that there will be different problems after the big bang, is he saying that he agrees with my hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould), or is he trying to explain why there are apparently no Liberal Members present to support him this evening?</p>

<speech hansard_id="438543" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1986-10-30a.498.1" hansard_membership_id="423" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2344" speakername="Mr. Ashdown" colnum="498" time="17:45:00">
<p>If this issue is pressed to a Division, the hon. Gentleman will find that members of my party will be present to support me. There is no difference between the hon. Member for Dagenham and myself about the takeover panel perhaps being in need of some amendment in future. The question is whether the best way of doing that is to bring it within the Securities and Investments Board.<br/>
I am left in some slight confusion. When this matter was debated in another place an Opposition Front Bench spokesman made it clear that, although it was suggested that the panel should be subject to statutory rules, that did not include an intention to bring it under the SIB. That is contrary to what the hon. Member for Dagenham has said.<br/>
We accept that the takeover panel is working adequately, leaving aside whether that will continue to be the position after the big bang, so is it appropriate to bring the panel under the SIB now in readiness for changes that might have to be made in the future? The SIB is clearly overloaded and it is doubtful whether, with its current resources and with the challenges that it is now facing, it is capable of taking on even more responsibility as suggested by the hon. Member for Dagenham and whether it could carry out the job in an appropriate manner is even more doubtful. There are some defects in the statutory approach that has been suggested, and the hon. Member for Dagenham fairly and honestly named some of them. Would a statutory code governing the panel slow down the essential speed of operation that is so important and to which the hon. Gentleman alluded? Would a statutory code be too inflexible to meet the panel's needs in a way that hon. Members on both sides of the House would like to see? The present arrangement gives some flexibility in operating the rules for the panel, which can be beneficial. There is no reliance on statute and the courts.<br/>
I support the view that was advanced cogently in a previous debate by the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central (Mr. Fletcher). He made some trenchant criticisms of the panel but said that he felt that the SIB had enough on its plate already. If that was true on 12 June, it must be immeasurably more true now with the pressures that have since been placed on the SIB. The hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central was right to call for an independent reexamination of the panel. The Minister did not concede that there was a need for that to be done, but I hope that he will give the suggestion further thought. I believe that it would be a useful way forward.<br/>
If we place the panel within the SIB, whose job it is to direct itself purely to City matters, will we limit the ambit of a panel which from time to time may have to address broader considerations affecting the public interest which may not be exclusive to the City? We know that the SIB is interested particularly in investor protection and those who invest in the City, and is there not some evidence to show that the panel's considerations will extend beyond


investor protection to the broader public interest? I accept that the panel may well have to be examined in future, but it is operating very well now and it is not necessary to change it now. Indeed, it is necessary not to change it until it becomes necessary to do so.</p>

<p>It is typical that Liberals are prepared to consider these issues in the light of the circumstances that prevail at the time and to make a judgment of what is appropiate. I share with the hon. Member for Dagenham some doubts about whether the panel, as constructed, will meet the needs of the City and will be able to carry out the job that it is called upon to perform in the new context in which it will find itself, but I do not think it necessary to solve the problem by immediately placing the panel on a statutory basis or placing it within the SIB. It is probably better to lake a longer view of the problem and to arrange for an independent re-examination to take place.<br/>
When that process has been completed, we can take the most sensible course that will meet the needs of the City. We shall be able to take a much more measured and sensible approach as a result of taking a longer view of the problem. That would be infinitely preferable to placing the panel within the SIB now.</p>

<p>I hope that the House will forgive me if I resist the temptation to enter into a fascinating analysis of whether, and if so to what extent, the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) was criticising the takeover panel and, if so, whether he was being consistent or inconsistent with what he said previously, or with what was said from the Opposition Front Bench in another place, and to what extent that view accorded or did not accord with the views expressed by the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown). Even more tempting is the philosophy behind the question posed by the hon. Member for Yeovil in his closing remarks. I think that he was saying, "To change or not to change, that is the question"&#x2014;subject on which he and his party are unrivalled in their expertise.<br/>
The peg on which the hon. Member for Dagenham sought to hang his intervention, with characteristic ingenuity, was the extent to which the activities of advising and managing bids and takeovers come or would come within the scope of the amendments. It is that point, which is cardinal and perhaps the only point relevant to the debate, that I propose to address, but I fear that I am unable to offer the hon. Gentleman much comfort.<br/>
A professional adviser who advises a person on the acquisition of shares is already covered by the definition of "investment business". So, too, is a merchant bank which makes arrangements for the acquisition. I think that that much will have been appreciated by the hon. Gentleman, and I have no doubt that it is common ground between us. Clause 2 could not be used to bring the panel's rules, which apply to acquirers as well as to advisers, into the scope of the Bill. It is concerned with the activities and people caught by the Bill, not with the Secretary of State's rule-making vires. Even if I were persuaded by the hon. Gentleman's blandishments that the powers which are the basis of the amendment could be used to cover the activities to which he has referred, the scope to do so does not exist within the terms of the amendments, so it would not be possible to do what has been suggested.<br/>
Tributes have been paid by hon. Members on both sides of the House&#x2014; I do not wish to re-enter the argument

about the precise tone of the speech of the hon. Member for Dagenham &#x2014; to the panel's activities. I wish to associate myself with the tributes and compliments that have been paid because I believe that the panel is working well. I see no ground for criticising its rulings in the case of Turner and Newall and AE.<br/>
Without wishing in any sense to be provocative, it seemed that at one stage the hon. Member for Dagenham was seeking to criticise the panel for not being able sufficiently to enforce its rulings. At another stage, he seemed to be suggesting that it was enforcing its rulings too stringently and too effectively. I detected a certain inconsistency there. I suggest that the panel is working well, that there are no grounds for interfering with its workings, that there would be no advantage in bringing its activities within the scope of the Bill and that, in any event, it would not be possible to do so within the scope of the amendments.</p>

<p>With the leave of the House, I should like to reply to the debate.<br/>
I listened with great interest to the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown), who made a valiant effort to hide his embarrassment at the fact that he and his party have from one stage of the Bill to another almost totally reversed their stance. He tried to cover that up by paying great textual attention to what my noble Friends said. All I can offer the House is the thought that, on that subject at least, I can act as a more authoritative interpreter of their remarks than the hon. Member for Yeovil.<br/>
There is no difference between my noble Friends and me on this. We believe that the takeover panel has done a good job within the constraints put on it in its role as a voluntary body. We also believe that, in the light of the immense changes that are taking place in the City, that ought to change. We are asking not, as the hon. Member for Yeovil would have it, for the takeover panel to be brought immediately within the aegis of the SIB&#x2014;although that might have been a desirable possibility at an earlier stage of the Bill&#x2014;but that the Secretary of State should exercise some form of reserve power.</p>

We might well have settled this issue in another place if alliance peers had joined the otherwise cross-bench alliance in support of my present argument.<br/>
What the Minister said came as no surprise to me. I understand the technical point that he made but, to reach a speedy conclusion to the debate, I shall content myself with saying that his speech was imbued with a complacency that is not shared by a wide range of opinion outside the House, not least in the City. A good deal of press comment and City opinion is now convinced that we can no longer live with the present arrangements. The Opposition want to register that point strongly. I have no real quarrel with that amendment, but to register our view on the Government's refusal to take the takeover point seriously we shall be compelled to divide the House.</p>

<p>These amendments reflect debates, both here and in another place. They concern what happens where an unenforceable investment agreement is entered into. An investor who enters into such an agreement shall be entitled, not simply to interest on money handed over but to such compensation as a court may determine or the parties agree. So, if an investor who hands over shares under such an agreement loses out on a rights or bonus issue, this can be taken into account in determining the level of compensation
These amendments also enable a court to allow an otherwise unenforceable investment agreement to be enforced, if it considers this to be just and equitable in the circumstances of the case. The court will have to be satisfied that a person who entered into the agreement in the course of carrying on investment business in


contravention of clause 3 reasonably believed that his entering into the agreement did not breach the requirements of clause 3. If the agreement was with an authorised person but in consequence of the involvement of an unauthorised person, then the court will have to be satisfied that the authorised person did not know of the unauthorised person's involvement.<br/>
These amendments will substantially reduce the risk of a person, in a sector other than investment business, inadvertently crossing the boundary line and finding his contracts to be held unenforceable. The criminal and negligent will continue to have this sanction applied.</p>

<p>Although a detailed explanation of the effects of this large group of amendments would take rather more time than is available, it may be helpful if I give some of the background to their overall purpose.<br/>
The Government recognise that a large number of professional people&#x2014;solicitors, accountants, surveyors, and so on&#x2014;engage in investment business incidentally to the practice of their profession. Indeed, in some cases the investment business which they carry on has come to be regarded as an ancillary service that someone practicing


the profession in question is widely expected to provide. Clearly, there has to be a system of regulation for investment business carried on in this way, but it did not seem to us necessary that many thousands of professionals should be effectively forced into joining recognised self-regulating organisations if other arrangements could be equally effective. In particular, it seemed sensible to build on the professional monitoring and disciplinary arrangements which the main professional bodies already have if this could provide adequate investor protection. That principle underlay our original proposals and has not changed.<br/>
The clauses as originally drafted provided for the authorisation of individual members of recognised professional bodies who were practising their profession on their own account or in partnership. This was because at present membership of such bodies is generally confined to individuals and the bodies' disciplinary sanctions are generally available only against individual members. However, it has been suggested that it would be desirable to allow in the Bill for the authorisation of other forms of practice, particularly corporate practices. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors already allows its members to practise in corporate form, and there are similar developments under way in other professional bodies. The Government accept that it would not be desirable to stand in the way of such developments, and the first new clause therefore allows authorisation to be conferred on corporate practices as well as partnerships and individuals practising on their own account. This apparently simple change necessitates a large number of amendments to take account of the fact that the firm certified by a recognised professional body may not itself he a member of the body, although it must be subject to the body's rules.<br/>
The second purpose of the amendments is to clarify and extend the requirements for recognition. Some critics have suggested that the special regime for professional bodies will be a "soft option". We have always made it clear that that was not our intention. The House will recognise that the new schedule includes many requirements which are derived from the corresponding provisions of schedule 2 for recognised self-regulating organisations. I would particularly like to draw the attention of the House to paragraph 3, which makes it clear that the investment business rules of the body must satisfy the same equivalence test as the rules of recognised self-regulating organisations, and to paragraph 4, which sets out the requirement for compliance with the rules to be effectively maintained and enforced.<br/>
The third main change is introduced by the third new clause, which gives the Secretary of State or designated agency an intermediate sanction, short of derecognition, against a recognised body which fails to comply with a requirement for recognition or with any obligation, such as an obligation to provide information, to which it is subject by virtue of the Bill. The sanction is a powerful one because if a recognised body were to disregard an order of the court it would be in contempt and liable to punishment accordingly.<br/>
This rather complicated group of amendments makes important changes to the provisions of the Bill relating to recognised professional bodies. The amendments represent the outcome of detailed consultation with the

professional bodies most likely to apply for recognition and I believe that they are in general now satisfied with them. The amendments will enable a greater range of businesses to be authorised by this route while providing for fully adequate protection to investors.</p>

<p>I am grateful to the Minister for his explanation of this quite substantial group of new provisions. The Opposition do not quarrel with the purpose of the amendments. Happily, we can endorse most of what the Minister said about their intention. However, I should like to put to him one question. It arises from the notes on clauses that have been so helpfully provided by the Department, and it may help if I express myself more or less in the language that the Department used to explain the effect of the clause.<br/>
It points out that a recognised professional body will be able to issue certificates to different groups of people &#x2014; bodies corporate, partnerships, unincorporated bodies. Then it makes the point that paragraph 2 of schedule 2&#x2014;one of the provisions that accompanies the new clauses &#x2014; requires a professional body to have arrangements and rules specifying the classes of persons who are entitled to be certified so as to ensure that only members of those classes are certified. If, however, by any chance a recognised professional body were to make a mistake and issued a certificate contrary to its own rules to a person who was not a member of the specified class, that person would nevertheless be authorised as the possessor of the appropriate certificate.<br/>
I understand why that is so, but I think that the Minister will agree that, if left open-ended in that way, it is a rather dangerous provision. Is he able to help the House by illustrating how the situation might arise and what measures would be taken by the Department to ensure that it was not repeated? It would be most unfortunate if a recognised professional body were consistently to issue certificates, contrary to its own rules, to people who in the ordinary course of events ought not to be authorised but who, by virtue of this delegation of powers to professional bodies, are permitted to carry on investment business as though authorised to do so.</p>

<p>When my hon. Friend replies to the debate on these amendments, will he look at amendment No. 21, which has caused a certain amount of concern? It relates to professional bodies. I am a member of a professional body, and anything that is connected with accountancy means that I am subject to disciplinary action if anything goes wrong.<br/>
Many people are worried about the definition of "acceptable limits." Who is to determine what are acceptable limits for investment business? A large firm of accountants may have a turnover of &#x00A3;10 million or &#x00A3;20 million. If 5 per cent. of that business is investment business, a huge amount of money is involved. However, if a person is employed full-time in the life assurance business&#x2014;I have to declare an interest as I advise the Life Insurance Association&#x2014;his or her total income will be very small compared with the 5 per cent. or the 2&#x00B7;5 per cent. investment business of a large firm of accountants or solicitors. The investment side of an accountant's or a


lawyer's receipts will be a small part of his total income, whereas that represents the total income of a full-time intermediary.<br/>
The LIA and other professional bodies are worried about the fact that there could be unfair competition. Lawyers and accountants belong to recognised professional bodies and are provided with a blanket certificate, if I may put it that way. However, a part-time intermediary has to join a self-regulating organisation, and SRO rules and regulations are probably far more stringent than those of the disciplinary committee of a professional body.<br/>
It would be ridiculous to expect legitimate professional bodies to have to register with an SRO, and I should like my hon. Friend to reassure me on that point. Under no circumstances should one create in this Bill unfair competition between those who work part-time and those who work full-time in the financial services industry.</p>

<p>I very much welcome the changes that have been made as a result of the amendments. My hon. and learned Friend the Minister mentioned three. I should like to mention another helpful amendment. Originally, the Bill was drafted in terms of whether the investment business of a professional person was or was not incidental. Now it has been turned around. The Bill says that a professional person's main business must be the practising of a profession and not the running of an investment business. There was great doubt about what "incidental" meant, but that concept has now been removed from the Bill.<br/>
I share the concern of my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South (Sir W. Clark) about the meaning of "acceptable limits". It would be helpful if my hon. Friend the Minister could clarify what it means. Amendment No. 21 refers to
<q>acceptable limits on the kinds of investment business.</q>
I assume that what it means is that when the Securities and Investments Board discusses with a body, with a view to its recognition, the terms upon which it might be recognised, it will look at the kinds of investment business that will or will not be authorised.<br/>
Part II of schedule I contains a list of different kinds of investment business. I assume that the intention is to ensure that there will be acceptable limits upon which categories of investment business are to be part of the recognition deal. It seems to me that there will be a tradeoff as to what kinds of investment business the recognised professional body will be able to authorise and, as a quid pro quo, what rules and regulations it will need to deal with authorisation. Obviously, for investment advice a much less rigorous regime is needed than for investment management, where one is managing clients' funds. It would he helpful if my right hon. and learned Friend could clarify that point.<br/>
I shall now speak briefly about my modest amendment which is to subparagraph (6) of paragraph 4 to the new schedule on page 97. This is a new provision about monitoring and says that monitoring can be undertaken by somebody other than the body itself. Subparagraph 4 has a similar provision about enforcement but there it says that the whole or part of the enforcement function can be delegated, and it does not make the same provision for monitoring. It might be administratively convenient for part of the monitoring to be delegated and for part of it to be kept back.</p>

<p>One matter arises from the meaning of "acceptable limits". Will the Minister address his mind to what happens in a firm of solicitors where a partner is a trustee of a large and substantial trust with considerable investments? In the City of London and throughout Britain, there are a considerable number of solicitor trustees who manage between them, not millions but often billions of pounds' worth of investment. What does "acceptable limits" mean in such cases? Can the Minister advise us on that?</p>

<p>I endorse the points that have been made by my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South (Sir W. Clark). I shall restrict my remarks to Lords amendment No. 21. It says that the recognised professional body
<q>must have rules which impose acceptable limits on the kind of investment business which may be carried on".</q>
I think that I echo a point made on both sides of the House when I ask "acceptable to whom?" Let us suppose for a moment that a recognised body such as the Law Society decided that it was perfectly acceptable for a high percentage of a solicitor's activities to relate to investment. I do not suggest that the Law Society is likely to do that. There are those of us who believe that in some way that would confer a lesser measure of investor protection than would be extended by an independent investment intermediary operating under the other provisions of the Bill which require him to register with his self-regulatory organisation.<br/>
Throughout the approach by my hon. and learned Friend the Minister is the aim to create a system in which fair competition prevails, irrespective of the vehicle through which one seeks to obtain investment advice. I should like to see a closer examination of the words "acceptable limits" because the clause, as amended by their Lordships, remains rather ill-defined. It might be thought to provide a soft option for those who, to a large extent, will still engage in advising people on investment. It would be helpful if the Minister could clarify exactly what is intended by the words "acceptable limits". More important, perhaps he would underline that in dealing with an investment adviser who is authorised by a registered professional body, the investor will receive no less protection than he could expect to receive if seeking his investment advice through an independent investment intermediary registered by a self-regulatory organisation or the Securities and Investments Board.</p>

<p>I should like to draw attention to a point about which I have had extensive discussions on a number of occasions with the Minister during the passage of this Bill. We have also exchanged correspondence about the Society of Company and Commercial Accountants. That is a professional body with about 8,000 members and it has a well-deserved reputation for advising small businesses. In amendment No. 20, a professional body is defined as
<q>a body which regulates the practice of a profession".</q>
Amendment No. 433 sets out the requirements for the recognition of a professional body. It says:
<q>The body must:&#x2014;</q>
<q><i>(a)</i> regulate the practice of a profession in the exercise of statutory powers;".</q>
The Society of Company and Commercial Accountants would to all intents and purposes be excluded as a recognised professional body. One could write a treatise


on the reasons why that society should be accepted, but I have no intention of going through them. The society regards the provisions as unfair discrimination against it. No specific reason has been given about why it should not get this status. The Minister was good enough to send me a letter, which arrived today, in which he said that Parliament has had a number of opportunities to amend the Bill during its passage but has not done so. The inference there is that Parliament does not look upon the society as important enough to merit the status of a recognised professional body.<br/>
I am the vice-chairman of the Conservative Small Business Bureau and secretary of the Back-Bench Committee on Small Businessses, and I am aware of the importance in the high street of relatively small accountancy bodies that are able to provide high quality service to small businesses. The proposals discriminate against the Society of Company and Commercial Accountants and that is unreasonable. I sincerely hope that the inference in the letter that I received from the Minister, that to some extent the door remains open, is something upon which we can build in the future. Many of the society's members hold important positions in industry and commerce and should receive the kind of recognition that they deserve.</p>

<p>I am a little anxious about what my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford (Mr. Cash) said because if we go down the road that he suggests we could say that all sorts of bodies ought to be included. Those bodies might be unsuitable and might not have members who are sufficiently well qualified. Does my hon. Friend think that the approval given to the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors should be extended to include the National Association of Estate Agents? There are worthy people in that association, but I am not sure that they are qualified to give investment advice. As far as I am aware, the accountancy body about which my hon. Friend speaks is not recognised under the Companies Acts and might therefore be considered unsuitable.<br/>
I should now like to pose a question to the Minister. My institution now allows corporate bodies to practise. I am a little worried that we may reach the stage where some institutional bodies may acquire shares in a partnership and use them as a means to gain recognition because they might not otherwise be able to gain recognition. That may be prevented by these proposals, but they are rather complex. Perhaps my hon. and learned Friend could enlighten me.</p>

<p>I shall begin by responding to the point raised by the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould). He asked what the situation would be in the event of a mistake being made in the granting of a certificate by a recognised professional body, thereby enabling the holder of that certificate to carry out investment business. He also asked what action could be taken if mistakes like that were made repeatedly. In an isolated incident the certificate could be withdrawn as soon as the mistake was discovered. If a recognised professional body were consistently to issue certificates to people who were not in the specified classes that the hon. Gentleman spoke about, or if it failed to withdraw such certificates when the facts came to its

attention, there would be grounds for the exercise of the powers contained in clause 19, which deals with the revocation of recognition of a professional body.<br/>
New clause 3, which we shall be debating later, provides for the obtaining of a compliance order to deal with the recognised professional body. Those safeguards are built into the Bill and they would deal with the matters to which the hon. Gentleman drew attention.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South (Sir W. Clark) and my other hon. Friends raised the matter of acceptable limits for the purpose of the clause, as did the hon. Member for St. Helens, South (Mr. Bermingham). It would be for the Secretary of State or the designated agency to determine whether the rules of a particular professional body imposed acceptable limits for the purposes of the clause.<br/>
New subsection (2A) of amendment No. 21 states:
<q>The body must have rules which impose acceptable limits on the kinds of investment business which may be carried on by persons certified by it and the circumstances in which they may carry on such business&#x2026;</q>
The rules must preclude a person certified by the body from carrying on investment business outside those limits unless he is authorised otherwise than by virtue of that certification or exempt in respect of that business under any of the provisions of chapter 4. This requirement for a scope rule is analogous to the corresponding requirements for self-regulating organisations, but the reference to circumstances reflects the intention that investment business carried on under the supervision of a recognised professional body will be limited to that carried on incidentally to the practise of the profession.<br/>
There is no requirement in the Bill for a percentage limit or any other form of limit. What is appropriate will depend upon the circumstances. What is acceptable will depend especially on the type of business which a recognised professional body regulates and its capability for enforcing its rules effectively. The rules will have to be equivalent to those of the designated agency. That test of equivalence is common to the professional bodies and to the self-regulating organisations. There can therefore be no question of recognised professional bodies being a soft option in comparison with self-regulating organisations.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Stafford (Mr. Cash) dealt with a different point, which he said that I had answered in a letter which he received today. As that letter was sent in reply to a letter which I received from my hon. Friend yesterday, that is not altogether bad going. Some of the difficulties which arise in the context of his point were answered by my hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, West (Mr. Butterfill). I suspect that this might be what is sometimes termed "an ongoing issue" between my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford and I. I cannot give him any further comfort this evening than I gave in the letter that he received earlier today.<br/>
In relation to the final point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, West, the new schedule provides that a recognised professional body may issue a certificate only to a person managed and controlled by individuals who are members of the recognised professional body. My hon. Friend will see that the authority for that lies in paragraph 2(2)<i>(b)</i> of the new schedule proposed in amendment No. 433.<br/>
I can tell my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith), in answer to his second point, that it is already possible in the terms of the Bill at present for the monitoring authority to be delegated in part.</p>

<p>These amendments will facilitate the proposed trading links between exchanges in clearing houses in the United Kingdom and those overseas. This is especially desirable in view of the increasingly

international nature of the financial services industry. A number of links are being planned between exchanges and clearing houses here and overseas which will enable investors in the United Kingdom to benefit from the increasingly diverse variety of investment services available throughout the world and will help to promote to foreign investors the services provided by investment businesses in the United Kingdom.<br/>
The amendments reflect the fact that some overseas investment exchanges and clearing houses may not, because of a special feature in the regulatory regime in their home state, be able to meet all the requirements for recognition in the Bill. Nevertheless, if one takes account of the exchange or clearing house rule as to the supervision to which it is subject and its ability and willingness to cooperate with the relevant authorities here, the interests of investors using its facilities are as well protected as the interests of an investor using the facilities in a domestic exchange or clearing house recognised under the Bill.<br/>
The amendments therefore provide that if the Secretary of State is satisfied that the conditions are met, and if there are adequate arrangements for mutual co-operation in the sharing of information between the regulatory authorities in the country concerned and the authorities here, he may recognise an overseas exchange or clearing house even though it does not meet the strict letter of the requirements imposed on domestic exchanges or clearing houses. This is not a soft option. It is a sensible and pragmatic approach to recognising and building on the regulatory regimes in other countries. This should be a mutual process. The clause provides that in deciding whether to recognise an overseas exchange or clearing house the Secretary of State may have regard to the extent to which persons in the United Kingdom have access to the financial markets in the country concerned.<br/>
The amendments respond to the need for the Bill to reflect the increasingly international nature of financial services. They make the appropriate provisions for overseas investment exchanges and overseas clearing houses and I commend them to the House.</p>

<p>I hope that the Minister can put my mind at rest about these amendments. The original idea was that we should recognise only those exchanges which had rules and controls comparable with the proposed rules and controls in our markets. There appears to have been a little wavering at the edges in the interests of promoting international trade, to use the Minister's words. It would appear that if some rules and controls are a little below our standards we may still recognise those exchanges and clearing houses, especially if people of our country are dealing in or involved with those exchanges. That is a recipe for trouble. We have only to look back over the past few years to see the flow of funds around the world dodging in and out of various tax havens such as the Cayman Islands and falling ultimately into the hands of British citizens who then rather rapidly depart for foreign parts. We never seem to extradite them from abroad.<br/>
I am very worried about how investors and investments can be moved around the world and about the idea of recognising international exchanges if they do not have the same controls and regulations as ours. At the end of the day, we must be looking after one person. As the Bill has trundled its weary way through the various Committees and passages in another place, and as it has grown in size,


the importance of that one person has diminished. That person is the investor. There are so many complications and we now appear to be easing off the little international agreements which we were to have so that the controls and regulations of those we recognise should at least be as good as the controls and regulations which we ourselves may establish. I hope that the Minister will comment on that point.</p>

<p>The Minister rightly referred to the reciprocal aspect of the amendments and drew attention to something which I warmly endorse&#x2014;the importance of obtaining international agreements on common standards. I have supported from afar his efforts with the American authorities. This is an opportunity for him to explain to the House what progress has been made in that direction since we last discussed the matter.</p>

<p>Since these matters were last debated a memorandum of understanding has been agreed between the United States and Britain which provides in detail for the circumstances in which information is to be exchanged between regulators in the two countries. It is a far-reaching agreement of considerable significance. I hope that it will provide the basis for a treaty between both countries in the near future.<br/>
We are hoping to build upon that precedent and we are discussing with the Japanese on the basis that it might be possible to come to an agreement with them. We hope that in due course it will be possible to come to agreements with yet other countries.<br/>
We are aware of the importance of co-operation between international regulators. I believe that the key to that operation is the mutual exchange of information, because that information is the key to discovering who is responsible for misbehaviour. We have made a good deal of progress and we shall continue to pursue the matter.<br/>
The hon. Member for St. Helens, South (Mr. Bermingham) will forgive me if I say that I have already dealt with his questions. I said that it was essential that such investors' interests should be as well protected as the interests of an investor using the facilities of a domestic exchange or clearing house recognised under the Bill. This provision does not detract from that important requirement for the provision of proper protection for investors. However, circumstances, perhaps arising out of the law of the country concerned, for other reasons might prevent the clearing house or investment exchange overseas from complying with all the provisions which would apply to clearing houses and investment exchanges in Britain.<br/>
It is not necessary to insist on compliance with each of those requirements, as long as the essential safeguard of adequate investor protection, commensurate with that provided by the arrangements in Britain, is available. Only if that protection is available do these provisions come into operation.</p>

<p>I agree with the Minister, but perhaps he has misunderstood my point. Some countries might not meet every criterion of our regulations, but the Minister said that when the regulations were as good as ours they would still he considered. Who will judge how well an investor is protected under regulations which are not equivalent to ours and which are operated in a country whose laws are different from ours?</p>

<p>Perhaps we should keep a close watch on the extent to which, when other countries are acquiring interests in investment exchanges, the equivalent rules or the way in which misbehaviour can occur is related to the activities of countries which do not have the same attitudes as we have.

<p>These amendments reflect the decision announced by my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary, in May, that the Bank of England should regulate the wholesale money, bullion and foreign currency markets. The behaviour of these markets is closely connected with the money supply and the Bank of England, as part of its economic responsibilities, has by tradition been closely involved with them and has generally supervised them. Under the Bill as originally drafted, some of the activities in these markets were covered by the Bill, and others were not. This was not an altogether satisfactory position and on reflection it was decided that the bank should be made responsible for these markets. The Government will be publishing a consultative document about their future regulation later this year.<br/>
As a consequence of this decision and in order to reduce supervisory overlap, the Economic Secretary announced that the Bill would be amended so as to remove from regulation under it certain transactions in the wholesale markets undertaken or arranged by institutions subject to supervision by the bank under the new arrangements. These amendments implement that undertaking. They have been the subject of widespread consultation with interested parties. The general approach has been widely welcomed and we have been able to meet the detailed difficulties which have been drawn to our attention. I commend the amendments to the House.</p>

<p>The Minister will accept that this is an important innovation and that the House should pause to register what is happening.<br/>
The amendments deal with the problem that has bedevilled the Bill in different areas. I refer to drawing a distinction between those areas of investment business which affect the small, unprofessional investor and those which are in the hands of professionals. The wholesale money markets fall within that latter category.<br/>
I can accept the broad argument for treating the two categories in slightly different ways, or in a substantially different way, by removing one category from the supervisory framework in the Bill. I am less convinced by the argument about a supervisory overlap. That has never been regarded as a reason for exempting other forms of investment activity from the Bill's provisions. Almost every form of business covered by the Bill is supervised in one form or another by a supervisory authority. It is, therefore, hard to see why the argument should carry any weight. I am not persuaded by that argument.<br/>
Even if one accepted the argument, there is one peculiarity about the way in which the new provision is drafted. The list of exempted money market institutions is entirely within the discretion of the Bank of England, subject to the Treasury's approval. That is a peculiar feature in a Bill sponsored by the Department of Trade and Industry. A major hole, or vacuum, has suddenly appeared in the Bill, the dimensions of which are in the hands of the Bank of England and the Treasury.<br/>
On many occasions the Minister has argued effectively that his objective is to remove such regulations from the dead hand of the Treasury. That was the argument before making the Securities and Investments Board a private body. The suggestion that it should he a public body brought forth the argument that&#x2014;horror of horrors&#x2014;its budget and resources would be under the control of the Treasury. I am not particularly persuaded by that argument, but it seems to be the only argument that the Government can advance on that point. If the Treasury's role is so inimical to what the Department of Trade and Industry wants to achieve, how can the Minister, apparently without demur, stand at that Dispatch Box and say that, with Treasury approval, the Bank of England can remove wholesale a vast chunk of investment activity from the Bill's purview? Do we not have yet another example &#x2014; and there may be others&#x2014;of the Treasury having muscled in and outgunned the Department of Trade and Industry? Is the Minister happy with that?</p>

<p>The transactions that will be subject to these arrangements appear to be listed in the new schedule to come after schedule 3. I am not sure whether that schedule can be altered by the Bank of England without further authority. Was the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) saying that the schedule could be changed on the say-so of the Bank of England? If so, I share his concern.<br/>
Moreover, the distinction between debt and equity is not as clear as it was. It is now possible to issue an instrument that begins as straightforward debt but which, because it has conversion rights, can end up being straightforward equity. I am not sure how these arrangements deal with that. An instrument that started off as a money market instrument would end up as a security which should be regulated by the Bill.</p>

<p>I support what the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) has said. There are so many converted and new types of stock coming on to the market which change their shape and format over a period of time that one wonders what is being covered by what.<br/>
Who in the Treasury will authorise the Bankof England altering the list rather than schedule 3 itself? It seems to be rather like one's left hand shaking one's right hand to congratulate it on what one has done. If there is no regulation, one begins to wonder what is going on. Is there an ongoing battle with the dead hand of the Treasury crawling once more from its grave to throttle our institutions?<br/>
I thought that we had been promised that all that would go with this new, wonderful set of securities regulations. But perhaps I am once again being a little cynical in thinking that the words that first accompanied this Bill at the Dispatch Box will not be those that will be uttered at the end of its passage.<br/>
I am making a serious point. Who at the Treasury will control? How will there be any accountability when the Treasury authorises the bank? Who controls the bank? The answer is the Treasury.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) uncharacteristically misconstrued the arguments that I have been advancing on another issue. I am certain that I never used the phrase "the dead hand of the Treasury", although I drew the attention of the House, in another context, to the importance of ensuring that the regulatory structure set up by the Bill is free from the public sector financial constraints that would have been a feature of the statutory system that is so beloved by the hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends.<br/>
I do not accept that there is a hole in the regulation or a vacuum. Indeed, the hon. Gentleman recognised the good sense of taking these wholesale instruments out of the regulatory regime of the legislation. These amendments seek to move the dividing line between the areas regulated by the Bank of England and those regulated by the Bill. The principle behind the move is widely supported. The dividing line is somewhat pragmatic, and no doubt people will have their views about the details, and things will change. That is why amendment No. 57 adds a new provision to those listed in clause 43 in order to ensure that amendments can be made by order if they prove necessary.<br/>
But those amendments to the list of instruments now found in the new schedule are to be made by the Secretary of State and not by the Bank of England or the Treasury. The Treasury's role is in approving criteria for admission to, and removal from, the bank's list of institutions&#x2014;not of instruments. It is important that the Treasury should have that role, because it ensures proper accountability to the Government and Parliament in that regard. Therefore, we are talking about a sensible distinction in recognising the reality of the distinctions to be made between the wholesale money markets and those areas that more properly come within the ambit of the Bill. The changes reflect that distinction.</p>

<p>Perhaps my hon. and learned Friend the Minister can explain the effect of the rather complicated set of amendments to clause 41.

<p>These amendments are largely technical and correct some defects in the regime of the Bill for appointed representatives. Perhaps the two most important effects of the amendments are to extend the definition of the business that an appointed representative may carry on and&#x2014;I come to the point that may have given rise to my hon. Friend's concern&#x2014;to ensure that an appointed representative is allowed to have a number of principals.<br/>
The reason behind the provision permitting an appointed representative to have more than one principal relates to the problems created for insurance companies by the fact that section 16 of the Insurance Companies Act 1982 prohibits them from carrying on any activity otherwise than in connection with, or for the purposes of, their insurance business.<br/>
It follows that an insurance company could not lawfully accept responsibility for an appointed representative when he was selling non-insurance products, such as unit trusts offered by a unit trust company in the same group. It is undesirable that an insurance company's appointed representative should not be able to sell other products offered by companies in the same group if the contract between the company and the representative permits it. The amendments therefore make it possible for a principal

to be able to accept responsibility for part of his representative's activities. But this should not prevent polarisation being instituted by a designated agency.<br/>
Rules can be made under clause 45(2) <i>(f)</i> restricting the sort of principals a particular appointed representative may have. Indeed, the change would facilitate what the SIB has proposed in this area. As my hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, West (Mr. Butterfill) will know, it has always envisaged that an appointed representative should be restricted to selling not just the products of a single company but the products of a single company or group. The amendments do nothing to make it more difficult for rules to that effect to be promulgated. Indeed, they facilitate that.</p>

<p>The House will be grateful to my hon. and learned Friend the Minister for his elucidation of the purpose behind the amendments. But the amendments are a little more than technical, and raise an issue which was the subject of an important debate both in Committee and on Report. Many hon. Members have taken an interest in this subject. We are enlarging, in a desirable way, the range of investment insurance products that an authorised representative can offer to members of the investing public.<br/>
Therefore, in yet another material way we are perhaps granting a facility, privilege, freedom or authorised right to that group of people who are competing against independent intermediaries in the offering of a variety of different products. It may be that in the former case we are talking about a variety of insurance or investment products within a group of companies, offered through a range of subsidiaries. That is wholly desirable. I am sure that this does not in any way undermine the principle of polarisation.<br/>
What progress has been made to ensure that the provision of these services will he free and fair and that many of the uncertainties which independent intermediaries fear would arise as a result of this proposal of polarisation will not occur? I am referring, in particular, to a commission agreement. Although that is not directly relevant to the technical import of these amendments, it is relevant because the question of polarisation and what authorised representatives, as well as independent intermediaries, are allowed to do must be considered together.<br/>
Before we seek to ratify what their Lordships did in the other place, I wish to know what progress has been made with regard to the commission agreement. May we reassure the many enterprising companies and individuals who are involved as independent intermediaries and who provide these investment services? We hear varying tales of the extent to which these parties will be subject to the commission agreement and will be protected by the arrangements envisaged. I should be grateful for the Minister's comments on this.</p>

<p>I support the general remarks made by the hon. Members for Chichester (Mr. Nelson) and for Bournemouth, West (Mr. Butterfill).<br/>
Is it possible for the Minister to tell us what is likely to emerge in terms of commission agreements, disclosure of charges and so on about which there has been a great deal of speculation and press comment? That is one important issue. An equally important, related issue is the alarm which many of us felt at the strong indications front the


other place that a great deal of pressure was being put on the Government to unravel&#x2014;that is how I see it&#x2014;the whole structure which the Standing Committee had worked hard to establish.<br/>
An important plank of that work was the principle of polarisation. If, at any time, the Government were tempted to accede to pressure put upon them, presumably by the clearing banks, and were in some way to weaken or modify the principle of polarisation, the whole structure of the regulation of the sale of life insurance would come to pieces. I was encouraged by what happened in the other place and I congratulate the Government on standing firm on this point.<br/>
The Minister is obliged to answer for the Securities and Investments Board. The draft rules and activities of the SIB are not easily accessible from debates and I wonder whether the Minister can give us a further assurance, if that is possible, that the SIB is intent upon adhering, in its rules, to the principle of polarisation. I seek an assurance that, even at this late stage, the principle of polarisation will not be lost sight of in the SIB's rules.</p>

<p>The House will be aware, as the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) said, that the Government have not acceded to any suggestion for any changes in legislation which would eat away at the principle of polarisation. During the course of many debates in Committee I have made my views clear on the desirability of the general terms of polarisation.<br/>
The SIB, in the course of its preparation for application for designation, must draw up its own rules governing this topic. It is for the SIB to consider whether there is any scope for considering how those rules can apply to particular institutions. That is a matter for the designated agency and it is one which the Secretary of State will wish to take into account when he decides whether those rules are appropriate and sufficient to enable him to designate the agency.</p>

<p>I am especially glad to have heard the Minister's last few sentence because this was a matter that the Government were pressed upon, not least by my colleagues in another place, who take a different view on polarisation.<br/>
I expressed that view in relation to insurance agents and tied and independent intermediaries. At the end of that debate&#x2014;I recall that the amendment was withdrawn&#x2014;the Government conceded that there was a considerable amount of discussion yet to take place in relation to the clearing banks. On the basis of that assurance, my colleagues and indeed Conservative Members of the other place who had raised objections withdrew their amendments. Will the Minister confirm that the matter is still open for discussion?</p>

<p>This is not a discussion in which the Government are taking part. It is a discussion between the SIB and those institutions which are affected. Clearly the SIB is having a number of discussions with interested parties and it is right that it should do so.<br/>
It is the responsibility of the SIB to draw up its rules and it is right and proper that, in the course of that task, it should engage in discussions. The Government's role begins when the SIB makes its application for designation.

It would be wrong and quite inappropriate for me to be drawn into detailed questions, which inevitably would form the basis of detailed rules drawn up by the SIB.</p>

<p>Are we right in concluding from the Minister's earlier remarks that the shape and direction of the rules in relation to polarisation is something in which the Secretary of State, and indeed the Under-Secretary of State, will take a close interest?<br/>
I think it is well accepted that the Minister and the SIB talk from time to time and that they will indeed discuss polarisation.

<p>I understand that and, of course, it would be quite wrong of me to press my hon. Friend on detailed points.<br/>
When the Secretary of State comes to consider designated agencies, will he be satisfied with a set of rules, contemplated by the agency, by which a conglomerate financial institution would hold itself out as offering objective investment advice to the small investor and yet at the same time be marketing to that small investor its in-house products?</p>

<p>I understand my hon. Friend's concern. When the time for designation arrives the Secretary of State will certainly pay close attention to such rules.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Chichester (Mr. Nelson) asked about the likelihood of a commission agreement. He will appreciate that it is not within my power to guarantee that there will be such an agreement, although the signs suggest this. Ever since the publication, in January 1985, of the White Paper on financial services in the United Kingdom the Government have made their position clear. The Government believe that commissions received by independent intermediaries from insurance companies should be disclosed&#x2014;either by disclosure of the commission received or in accordance with the proposition that the remuneration is within the terms of a voluntary, industry-wide agreement. Such an agreement would need to be examined in relation to its impact on competition. Arrangements would have to be made to provide investors with ready access to details of the agreement. The Government envisage that there might be such an agreement.<br/>
The Life Assurance and Unit Trust Regulatory Organisation, which is seeking to become the recognised self-regulating organisation for life offices and unit trusts, is strongly committed to the idea of a commissions agreement. It is already working on the form of such an agreement involving consumer and intermediary interests in the work and I think that those indications provide a strong answer to the question posed by my hon. Friend as to the likelihood of such an agreement.</p>

<p>This group of amendments concerns the position of authorised businesses which become insolvent. The first amendment, to clause 42, concerns a bankruptcy order or winding-up order relating to an authorised person who operates as a sole trader or partnership. In these circumstances, the authorisation to carry on investment business under which that firm has operated will not be transferable with the business to the trustee in bankruptcy or liquidator appointed by the court. As the trustee will already have satisfied the "fit and proper" test imposed by the Insolvency Act 1986 to qualify as an insolvency practitioner, an exemption from any authorisation requirement in these limited circumstances is reasonable.<br/>
Amendments in this group also enable the Secretary of State or agency to petition the court for the winding-up of an authorised person which is a company or partnership, if it cannot pay its debts or if the court considers that it is just and equitable to do so.<br/>
Provision is also made to enable any regulator to petition the court for appointment of an administrator

under the Insolvency Act 1986 to take over the affairs of an authorised business which is a company. The court will have to be satisfied that the criteria set out in the Insolvency Act 1986 for the appointment of an administrator are fulfilled before it grants such an application.<br/>
The new clause after clause 165 contains technical amendments to allow information obtained under powers given in this Bill to be used in the exercise of powers conferred by the Companies Act.</p>

<p>These amendments are the result of extensive discussions with a number of interested parties, including the International Securities Regulatory Organisation. It was argued in those discussions that the original exemption from the market manipulation offence for stabilisation, which was confined to action intended to stabilise the market price of international bonds in the period before or during an issue of such bonds, was too narrowly drawn. It was put to us that there is an increasing market in international equities and if stabilisation techniques accepted elsewhere in respect of such issues were not permitted in the United Kingdom, we would be put at a considerable competitive disadvantage.<br/>
At a late stage, a further argument was advanced in another place that stabilisation should be permitted in circumstances unconnected with new issues, for instance, the sale or dispersal of a large, existing shareholding. The Government have accepted the case for extending to the stabilisation of equities the exemption from the market manipulation offence currently shown in clause 45(7) provided it is in conformity with rules made under that clause. I stress that last qualification. As elsewhere in the Bill, it is the rules themselves which will set out the detailed requirements for protecting investors. In extending the provisions to equities, it has been necessary to look again at the protections available to ordinary investors. Given the increasingly international nature of the securities market, it does not seem practicable, once we include equities, to identify those securities which are distinctively international or likely to be traded on a "professional only" basis. Instead, we specifically provide that the rules to be made under clause 45 should provide that there is adequate disclosure to investors of the fact that the price of investments in which they may be dealing may be affected by stabilisation. Amendment No. 440 introduces a new principle into schedule 6 to make this point clear.<br/>
I turn now to the argument that stabilisation should be permitted in circumstances quite unrelated to the issue of investments. This argument was advanced at a very late stage. I have no wish to close the door on such arguments if they prove to be well-founded, but equally I believe we should be very careful before we rush to legislative conclusions in what has proved a very complex and technical area. I have thought it right, therefore, that we should meet this point by introducing the possibility of changing both the range of investments which may be

stabilised without falling foul of clause 44(2) and the circumstances in which such stabilisation may take place provided that it is in conformity with the rules. This is the effect of subsections (6B) and (6C) of amendment No. 64. The order-making power will be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure and will not be delegatable to a designated agency.<br/>
The remaining amendments are consequential. Amendment No. 312 to clause 145 reflects the fact that we have always intended that where stabilisation is permitted for the purpose of clause 44(2) it should also be exempt from the relevant provisions of the insider dealing legislation. Amendments Nos. 475 to 478 to schedule 9 stem from the fact that the defence against being found to have contravened clause 44(2) is available to anyone who acts in conformity with the rules made under clause 45 governing matters within the scope of the exemption in the new subsection 45(6A). The defence is not confined to authorised persons who are subject to clause 45 rules. This would include registered friendly societies. Separate provision in schedule 9 is therefore unnecessary and the amendments to that schedule reflect that.</p>

<p>The Minister will have some sympathy with me when I say that this is one of the most difficult areas in the Bill. It is made more difficult by the fact, as he conceded, that some of the pressure for change has come late in the day, certainly long since we last had the opportunity to consider this matter.<br/>
The problem as I see it &#x2014; I speak as a layman as these matters are esoteric by most people's standards&#x2014;is that the thrust and object of the Bill is to provide a substantial level of investor protection. One of the most important provisions to that effect is that which makes a criminal offence of market manipulation. It is one of the cardinal principles and planks of the Bill that there is a clearly defined criminal offence so that the ordinary person operating in the ordinary market who attempts to mislead other operators as to the true market price of an investment will commit an offence.<br/>
There are also, however, apparently powerful arguments in exactly the opposite direction. They state that in the Eurobond market &#x2014; although we now see the argument being extended to international securities of all sorts, including equities, and from new issues to dealings in a secondary market of such equities&#x2014;far from being a criminal offence, manipulation is to be authorised and welcomed as an essential feature of the proper operation of those markets. The fact that it is called market stabilisation in that context is mere labelling. It is most unsatisfactory that what is a criminal offence in one market should be authorised and welcomed in another. I am sure that the Minister must have wrestled long and hard with some of those problems over the past few weeks and months.<br/>
I had the benefit of a brief from ISRO on this matter and I understand that the case made is a very familiar one in so many regulatory matters. If the regulations are thought to be excessively rigid or inappropriate, then the threat is that the business being done will go elsewhere. We are essentially describing an offshore market in many respects. There is no particular reason, although I sometimes think that the reasons are stronger than people believe why the business should be done in London. Therefore, the argument is that if what is universally regarded in those markets as acceptable practice is


outlawed by the British regulatory regime, business will simply go elsewhere. That would be a pity. We derive benefit from having that market located in London. If the business is to be done, let it be done in London. If it is not done here we lose foreign exchange earnings, a certain amount of employment, and so on.<br/>
I understand the Minister's dilemma. However, the problem is that we are confronted with permissive provisions which cast the ultimate responsibility for resolving the dilemma upon the body which makes the rules. We have the benefit of having seen some draft rules on the question, and the Securities and Investments Board has done an admirable job in trying to establish what safeguards and criteria ought to apply in this difficult area.<br/>
8 pm<br/>
Nevertheless, it is still of considerable concern that the boundaries of the exemption are pretty unclear. We know that the distinction between an international market and a domestic market is not likely to remain fixed or concrete; it will change over time. The whole thrust of what is happening in the City of London right now is to break down that distinction substantially. For example, the merger between the SROs and the stock exchange shows that the old distinctions which used to be drawn between the domestic market and the international market in securities and equities is simply no longer likely to be either permanent or meaningful.<br/>
The question facing the Minister is that, given that he accepts the case for stabilisation in one area while still regarding market manipulation in another area as a criminal offence, how will he prevent the one area leaking into the other? Where is his sticking point? He has apparently already gone a long way towards conceding that stabilisation should be permitted in the secondary market in international securities. If that is the case, we are perilously close&#x2014;</p>

<p>The hon. and learned Gentleman says no, but there is provision in the Bill which makes it possible for rules to provide for that. Where are we to stop? The ordinary investor will want to participate in such a secondary market in international equities and that is largely the purpose of providing such a market. The notion that one can always rely on the concept of the experienced or business investor being exclusively engaged in this market is misleading.<br/>
There are further, more technical problems which are equally difficult to resolve. For example, if the international syndicates which have underwritten a new issue, or even a secondary issue &#x2014; a large volume of shares are dealt in the secondary market&#x2014;stabilise the market in accordance with the rules but do so a little more enthusiastically than should really be permitted by the rules, in other words, if in addition to the permitted stabilisation there is in the same transaction or series of transactions, in the same mopping up by the underwriters of spare shares, a further element of what might in other terms be regarded as market manipulation, how will that distinction be made? Where will the limit be applied as to the degree of stabilisation permitted? How will it be identified in the course of the one series of transactions in respect of the same issue of securities?<br/>
These are immensely difficult problems. I confess that I do not have a solution to them, but then I am not the Minister. The Minister is obliged to offer some guidance to the House as to how these matters are to be resolved. At present, one of the most important principles underlying the Bill is in danger of substantial erosion. I want to be clear as to where the limits of that erosion will be.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) has raised legitimate issues of concern. The line between what would be legitimate stabilisation and what would be misleading the market is an extremely fine and difficult one to draw. I can well understand why my hon. and learned Friend the Under-Secretary of State has, I believe, only reluctantly been persuaded to accept that stabilisation should be legitimised in the way that he contemplates.<br/>
His opening remarks helped me to clarify what was in his mind. I had been a little concerned that the provision for extending the categories of transactions in which stabilisation would be legitimate by means of affirmative resolution of both Houses was an extraordinarily cumbersome one if it was to be applied in active market conditions. It clearly would not work. If I have interpreted him correctly, he is merely giving the Government time to consider further what categories of transactions should be so legitimised.<br/>
It will be impossible to avoid extending the categories to include secondary offerings. A signal case which is likely to arise before long will be the Government's offer of a further tranche of its holding of British Petroleum shares. As I understand it, under the Bill as amended stabilisation would not be permitted in the instance of such an offer. Yet I would have thought that that was typical of the sort of case of secondary offering where stabilisation would clearly be necessary to ensure orderly market conditions. We should not restrict ourselves to contemplating that only offerings of Government shareholdings would create such a situation. One can also imagine, perfectly respectably and properly, that a large private shareholding might be brought on to the market and that it would be in the interests of investor protection to have some stabilisation. Therefore, the class of categories covered will have to be extended.<br/>
This is quintessentially the sort of matter that ought to be determined by the Securities and Investments Board. I fully concur with the hon. Member for Dagenham in recognising how extremely difficult and technical it will be to make the judgments, and that it will be a problem to provide regulatory provisions to meet specific circumstances. However, it cannot be avoided, and surely the Bill's strategy is to ensure a flexible and highly competent regulatory authority which can adapt to altering market circumstances of the kind that my hon. and learned Friend the Under-Secretary of State has recognised.</p>

<p>In this series of amendments we have reached the heart of what is going on in the Bill. Whereas we had been going to pay lip service to investor protection, in fact we shall no longer do anything of the sort. When one starts to ask oneself certain questions about the proposals contained in these clauses, one begins to get a series of answers which are not very nice.<br/>
For example, who will decide what is or is not a domestic or international share, bond or security? When


does the one change to the other? Who will make the decisions? Will there be someone standing at arm's length and looking in, or will it pass to the same old body which deals in those matters? Of course, as the Bill stands it will be done by people within the industry.<br/>
Who will decide what is manipulation and what is merely stabilisation? The hon. Member for Stratford-on-Avon (Mr. Howarth) made a good point with regard to the placing of a large shareholding, perhaps in a fairly small company, which is in the hands of a single person and if put in its entirety on the market at any given moment will automatically depress the price. That follows as night follows day. Who will decide such cases? Will it be someone at arm's length, or someone who is actually involved in making the markets? Again, the answer falls in the latter category, self-regulation becomes self-evaluation and protection is denied.<br/>
The Bill then begins to show many areas for grave worry. Even after all these amendments, the Government have not thought things through. For months, if not years, there has been pressure and comment from people within the City and elsewhere that there was much to learn from the Securities Exchange Commission across the Atlantic. But the Government would have none of that. They wanted self-regulation and they placed their offering upon the altar of that god.<br/>
The small investor will ultimately pay because many of these deals will take place in in-house arrangements, where both buyer and seller, or trader on behalf of buyer and seller, are within the same building and the same company. We talk as though investors will somehow be protected by the mythical Chinese walls, but we have had enough experience of what can go wrong in the City in the past few years. For instance, we all know that insider dealing goes on. It is disapproved of, rarely if ever investigated, and even less frequently prosecuted. Yet it it criminal and investors suffer&#x2014;and it is never the big boys, always the little people.<br/>
What does the Minister intend to do about that? He has done nothing in the past. At least under the American system investigations are going on and lawyers and other persons involved are being prosecuted and the money recovered. What is happening in the City of London? The Minister knows as well as I do that the answer is nothing. No one is prosecuted and investors suffer. How great a charter is there for the crooks and the charlatans whom no one wants in the City because they are poison to the whole system'? The amendments do naught to tackle the cancer there.<br/>
I ask the Minister one last time: Will the Government ever listen to anyone? Will they not listen to the experts in America and elsewhere? Will they not look again at that aspect? At the end of the day it will be the small investor who pays the price for paper-thin walls that do not hold secrets, for manipulation that is classically called stabilisation, and for the creation of international markets when they are really domestic markets. It will be the small shareholder, the small investor, who will ultimately lose because the protection is not there.</p>

<p>The amendments are a good example of where the Government have listened to people and where they have shown great ability to come to terms with an exceedingly complex problem. The amendments are welcome. They respond in exactly the right way and strike exactly the right balance between the need to protect

investors and the need to allow important business to be retained in the City of London and our economy. I pay tribute to my hon. and learned Friend the Minister and those others who have been involved in drafting the legislation.<br/>
We should emphasise the importance of this market to our economy and to financial services in particular. Whether hon. Members like it or not, the reality is that such is the nature of the international securities business that operators and market makers within that area will go elsewhere if they find the rules here inhibiting. The business will be done on behalf of investors in Britain and elsewhere outside Britain if rules and regulations impinge improperly and in a prejudicial way on the market.<br/>
Although it is difficult to define them, there are material differences between what might loosely be called the domestic and international securities markets which justify the differential treatment which the amendments seek to achieve. First, the lines of stock involved in the international securities market are considerably larger than those involved in the domestic market. Secondly, the number of market makers and dealers within that market is much smaller than is the case with the domestic securities market. There are far fewer participants even if the eventual beneficial ownership of lines of stock ends up in a multiciplicity of hands or, indeed, in institutional or mutual funds, unit trusts or whatever.<br/>
The nature of the market, in terms of financial size, large lines of stock and small numbers of dealers, undoubtedly means that some of the procedures, whether they are called, somewhat euphemistically, stabilisation procedures, or whether they are called, somewhat ingloriously, market manipulation, arguably act in the interests of investor protection. It is through stability in the market that one can, in certain instances, in international securities dealings, shift large lines of stock and acquire them. It is a mutual technique used by the participants in those markets which we should not seek to outlaw. It would be against the interests of both our economy and investors to do so.<br/>
The hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) asked who will scrutinise and monitor the situation. My understanding&#x2014;I am open to correction&#x2014;is that that will be the responsibility of the SROs and the SIB. We look to them, in their daily scrutiny of the markets and the operation of the stabilisation techniques, to ensure that the parameters of the legislation are not exceeded and that many of the detailed requirements of the amendments are complied with.<br/>
8.15 pm<br/>
For example, amendment No. 440 ensures that where action is to be taken in conformity with the rules adequate arrangements exist for making it known that the price of investments may be affected by that action and the period during which it may be affected. That is a material and proper piece of information made available which is a real attempt to overcome the difficulties which undoubtedly exist in defining the dichotomy between the domestic and international securities market. Communication, the provision of information and the clear setting out that there is less than a perfect market, and, necessarily, a situation where the client's interest will be dealt with at best is an important safeguard.</p>

<p>I fully understand the importance of the safeguard provided by the disclosure provisions, but why


should not a similar safeguard provide a similar regime in any securities market? Why should there still be such a substantial difference between the domestic market and the international market when, as I think he concedes, that distinction will be increasingly difficult to draw?</p>

<p>It is common ground that we should seek to achieve as perfect, as efficient and as accurate a market as possible &#x2014; a market where deals are done at best, where the market price is established by the forces of demand and supply in the simplest terms and where the provision and disclosure of information in conducting those deals and in striking the prices is done on an honourable and fair basis, not on a basis which seeks to mislead people about the market price or what might be the direction of the market in a particular stock, be it up or down. It is undisputed that that is the objective and that is in the interests of investors. That is what rules elsewhere in the legislation have sought to enhance.<br/>
In this specific instance I have argued that the matter is different because of the size of the lines of stock, which are of such magnitude and dealt with in isolation by a small number of dealers, say in London, which form a significant part of the international securities markets operations. But the technical market operations are materially different and if one is seeking to protect, say, the interests of a client of a major investment bank who wishes to sell or to buy into a large line of stock, such mechanisms are an essential means of ensuring that he is able either to sell all that line of stock without driving down the price substantially, or acquire it without, conversely, driving it up.<br/>
It can be argued in purely theoretical terms that that can be against the interests of the other side to the bargain, but such has been the experience over a period that the movement of stock generally tends to reflect fundamentally in those international markets rather more than does the short-term effect of large amounts of demand or supply that take place in a domestic market. In simple terms, a large line of stock in a domestic market, being sold or acquired, can materially affect the price in the short term, whereas in the international market it need not necessarily do so. One reason for that is the stabilisation processes that have been established by dealers.<br/>
I readily accept that this matter is difficult to explain other than in the most technical way, but the House should recognise that it happens because dealers on all sides of the bargains in the international securities market want it to happen and perceive it to be in their interests in dealing on behalf of others in enabling them to acquire large amounts of stock or to dispose of them.<br/>
I welcome these amendments. My hon. and learned Friend and the Department have tried hard to respond to the legitimate anxieties of those concerned. The House would be well advised to accept the Minister's advice.</p>

<p>I shall speak briefly and with special reference to the remarks of the hon. Member for St. Helens, South (Mr. Bermingham). The international securities market will be traded in. We must be involved in that and ensure that it is done effectively. But is there sufficient control over how that will be carried out? That

takes one back immediately to the matter of the self-regulating organisations and how the market will be regulated through the control it exercises over those persons who are members of the SROs.<br/>

<p>The programme was extremely interesting, despite the remark made by the hon. Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell), in that it illustrated the expectation of predatory activities by some foreign-owned companies, especially Japanese companies. It seems clear that the sheer volume of money accumulated in their savings in Japan, if transferred to Britain, would, in the medium to long term, have a significant effect upon activities in the City of London. That is before we consider the activities of America and other overseas companies.<br/>
Referring to the remarks of the hon. Member for St. Helens, South, the real issue is whether the SROs will be able to control the activities of those companies which are operating from abroad as we would wish them to be controlled. The object of the Bill is to achieve sensible control over their activities. I have had, and continue to have, grave reservations about the conferring of legal immunity on the SROs, because, as I said on Report, there is no reason why it should be conferred. The right people must be appointed to the SROs.<br/>
In Committee I discussed this matter several times with the Minister. We have discussed the fit and proper person test many times and we have decided that it is possible to appoint the right people. I strongly request the Minister and the Securities and Investments Board to exert all the influence that they can to ensure that the right people are appointed to the SROs. That is the acid test.<br/>
I was delighted to hear&#x2014;I should like the Minister to confirm this point &#x2014; that, following an amendment which I tabled in Committee and further discussions on the matter, a significant number of independent persons will be appointed to the SROs. Ultimately, to avoid any suggestion of cosy clubs, it is essential that the people appointed to the SROs should be able to question the behaviour of their colleagues.</p>

<p>I agree with many of the points made by the hon. Gentleman. Looking back over the history of Lloyd's underwriting, the self-regulation at Lloyd's and the messes that have occurred involving Ian Posgate, Peter Cameron-Webb and others, does the hon. Gentleman agree that that should be an object lesson to us in the sort of person whom we appoint to the SROs? Unless we have the strength and independence of character to do that, people can look within from without and the securities industry may be in the position that Lloyd's was in some years ago.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman seizes upon a point with which I am familiar, in that some years ago I was asked to advise Lloyd's on self-regulation after Mr. Davison took over. In my memorandum, I drew attention to several matters which caused me some anxiety. However, the point to which I wish to draw attention is that Lloyd's has gone through the exercise required to sort


out its affairs. That exercise will have been noted by the people who will run the SROs and I am optimistic that they will be run properly.<br/>
If a large proportion of the members who effectively represent foreign-owned companies are in the business of monitoring and running the SROs, it is essential that we ensure that those people are themselves monitored by independent persons and that they work effectively. If one were to sum up the Bill in one sentence, it would be, "Will the SROs work effectively or not?"</p>

<p>I thank my hon. Friends the Members for Chichester (Mr. Nelson) and for Stafford (Mr. Cash) for their support for these amendments, and express my appreciation of the sympathetic observations made by my hon. Friend the Member for Stratford-on-Avon (Mr. Howarth) and the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) about the difficult decisions which had to be made on this matter. I agreed with much of what they said. The decisions were difficult and there was a dilemma. The issues are not clear-cut. It is of notable interest that there was considerable pressure in another place from hon. Members of all parties for the Government to make the changes which form the basis of these amendments. It is lair to say that the Opposition Front Bench in another place was in the van of those requests.<br/>
It is no secret that I pondered long and hard on the issue before acceding to the representations. One circumstance which weighed with me in eventually reaching the conclusion that there was a case for an extension was the need not to preclude or inhibit the ability of industry to raise finance. Stabilisation is an accepted and widely-used technique in the new issues of securities, and such issues would be substantially inhibited if that technique were not available. That is why the extension in these amendments is limited, broadly speaking, in that direction.<br/>
The securities to which these exemptions will apply are strictly defined in the legislation. Although we recognise the case for an extension for new issues of securities and we do not wish to close the door now against the possibility of there being other categories of securities to which the exemption should apply, and to which these techniques should be applied, we are not at the moment persuaded that that is so. That is why the order-making procedure is set out in the legislation.<br/>
That is the balanced way in which we sought to approach the matter. The categories of securities are identified in the legislation. The rules which will govern the application of the technique are provided by the Securities and Investments Board. The House will not have failed to observe the striking discrepancy in the tone in which these matters were observed by the hon. Member for Dagenham, leading for the Opposition in this matter, and the wildly inaccurate statements made by the hon. Member for St. Helens, South (Mr. Bermingham), which bore absolutely no relation to the text of the legislation. The inaccuracy of the hon. Gentleman's remarks is matched only by the lack of interest in this legislation which he displayed before this evening. I invite the House to treat his remarks with the utter contempt which they merit.</p>

<p>This new clause provides an explicit power to make financial resources or capital adequacy rules. Requirements as to capital adequacy are recognised as an important safeguard for investors, both directly in helping to head off financial problems in the firms they are dealing with and more generally in helping to avoid knock-on problems in the market as a whole. They are a feature of the banking and insurance regimes and of existing self-regulation, for instance, in the stock exchange.<br/>
It has always been the Government's intention that regulators should be able to set capital adequacy requirements. Doubts were expressed in Standing Committee by the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) about whether the "fit and proper" test for authorisation and the general power to make conduct of business rules were a sufficient basis. We have now concluded that it is desirable to put the matter beyond doubt by introducing an explicit power. That is the effect of the amendments.</p>

<p>In view of the Minister's concluding remarks, the House will not be surprised to hear that I welcome the new clause. Before I extend that welcome and ask a brief question, I shall defend my hon. Friend the Member for St. Helens, South (Mr. Bermingham). According to my recollection&#x2014;he will correct me if I am wrong&#x2014;he spoke at both the Second and Third Reading stages. I assure the House that he would have dearly wished to be on the Committee but for the fact that his services were so much in demand and he was on the Finance Bill Committee. His credentials are beyond attack.<br/>
I welcome the new clause. I am delighted that the Minister has recognised&#x2014;it was a view shared by all members of the Committee, not simply a view expressed by Labour Members &#x2014; the importance of making a specific reference to an important requirement.<br/>
I am intrigued about one aspect. Perhaps there is an obvious answer that I do not immediately see. The provision applies to those who secure authorisation by direct application under clause 24 and to those who secure authorisation under clause 30 by virtue of being authorised in another member state. That opens up the possibility that a person who is authorised under clause 30 and authorised, therefore, in his own native country might well be subject&#x2014;if I read the clause correctly&#x2014;to a set of different requirements which may have no equivalent in his home country but which lay down minimum capital adequacy rules. What would be the position if a person otherwise qualified for authorisation under clause 30 but failed to meet the rules which would prevail? Perhaps there is an obvious answer, but I do not see it. I am sure that there must be a straightforward answer.</p>

<p>These amendments follow a reappraisal of the way the compensation provisions in the Bill are constructed. There are two main issues. The first concerns the machinery which the Bill provides. Existing clause 49 is based on the concept of compulsory indemnity along the lines of the Solicitors Act. This certainly provides a means


by which investors can benefit from payments. However, on further reflection, the Government have concluded that additional powers, involving the ability to set up a compensation scheme, such as those established under the Banking and Building Societies Acts, should be taken if the objective of the January 1985 White Paper is to be realised. This envisaged arrangements to compensate investors directly when an investment business could not do so. The new clause which we have tabled therefore follows the provisions of the Banking and Building Societies Acts.<br/>
The second issue was whether businesses authorised through membership of recognised self-regulating organisations should, in some circumstances, be obliged to participate in a central scheme established under the Bill. This issue was raised during consideration of the Bill at an earlier stage, and since then the SIB has argued persuasively that a scheme which is restricted to a possibly small and variegated range of directly authorised businesses may not be able to provide the level of protection for investors which we would wish to see as the basic standard in the industry.<br/>
The SIB has argued that the larger the coverage of a central fund, the easier it will be to obtain adequate finance and thus the better will be the compensation which investors can expect and the less will be the cost of making compensation available. I have considered these arguments carefully. I acknowledge the excellent record, for instance, of the existing stock exchange compensation scheme. However, I believe that the fundamental objective is that investors generally should be protected by compensation arrangements which are the best which can be reasonably made. Our approach to this question has been based on the policy set out in the January 1985 White Paper, which stated:
<q>Compensation should be available for investors in the event of loss arising from investment businesses' fraud, negligence, or failure to comply with requirements for the protection of clients' assets &#x2014; The aim should be for the private investors to receive full compensation.</q>
Hon. Members will be aware that the SIB put forward last year the idea of a scheme offering compensation of up to &#x00A3;30,000 to private clients of businesses in default. In a recent speech, the chairman of the SIB, welcoming the Government's proposal as one which was
<q>essential in order to provide the level of protection which small investors have every right to expect",</q>
said that it might be possible to raise that top limit in a broadly based scheme. I am sure this will be contrasted with the higher notional limits available under, say, the existing stock exchange scheme. On that I would make three observations. First, not even the stock exchange scheme covers the range of liabilities mentioned in the White Paper. It would not, for instance, cover liabilities arising from an award of damages for negligence. Secondly, there is nothing to stop an SRO establishing a more generous scheme. The SIB proposals for a "federal" structure are designed to assist this. Thirdly, a high limit on a compensation fund operating in one area is no comfort to the investor who has lost perhaps his entire life savings in another area.<br/>
Having considered the various factors, I concluded that it would be right to provide for the rules to allow, subject to certain conditions being met, the establishment of a central compensation scheme. This will allow the creation

of an effective and well-funded scheme. It will not be a feather-bedding scheme &#x2014; the value of investments can go down as well as up and there is no intention of relieving the investor of the responsibility to exercise judgment and care in deciding how to invest his money. Where an investment fails for straightforward commercial reasons he cannot look to any regulator to make good his losses. However, the scheme should protect the interests of small investors who lose their money through an investment business's fraud, negligence or failure to comply with the rules.<br/>
I have at the same time recognised the concern that some SROs feel at the possibility of their members paying for claims on other businesses and the loss of independence in running their own schemes. Therefore, the new clause incorporates special safeguards in respect of cross-subsidisation and requires there to be adequate representation on the body administering a central scheme of the interests of members of participating SROs. As I have already pointed out, there is nothing to prevent an SRO from making arrangements for extra compensation to be available.<br/>
I recognise that this approach has not been universally welcomed by all the self-regulating organisations. However, the issue turns on one question alone: are we to have an efficient and well-funded scheme for protecting investors generally, or are we to settle for a compensation scheme which for many investors may frankly prove to be second best and lead to a level of protection overall lower than we could otherwise achieve? My view on this is that second best is not good enough. We must provide the machinery to allow investors to enjoy, in the words used in schedule 6,
<q>the best provision which can reasonably by made".</q>
I have been persuaded that our approach provides this and that the alternatives do not.<br/>
The other amendments in this group are consequential to the policy that I have outlined. Hon. Members will note that the existing clause 49 has been retained, since I believe there may still be scope for compulsory insurance arrangements to play a part in this area. However, the clause has been amended to deal with the point on precipitate withdrawal of SROs or RPBs raised by the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) in Standing Committee. We have also altered the way the clause is applied to persons authorised under clause 30 in order that we may have more flexibility on how we meet our Community obligations.</p>

<p>I find myself in the somewhat unusual position of enthusiastically endorsing almost every word that the Parliamentary Under-Secretary uttered on this group of amendments. He will recognise that his persuasive and forceful argument is a skilled elaboration of a case that I attempted to make in the Standing Committee. If I recall correctly, there was support for that case elsewhere. I particularly endorse the Parliamentary Under-Secretary's remarks&#x2014;despite the reservations of the stock exchange, which I fully understand&#x2014;about the importance of there being a comprehensive and guaranteed scheme so that the investor does not find different standards applying according to whichever part of the investment industry he happens to be dealing with.<br/>
A recent example which shows exactly why these provisions are necessary involves the collapse of a firm called McDonald Wheeler. The firm was a member of


FIMBRA, formerly NASDIM. It would thus have been authorised under this legislation. The investor will have adequate protection under the new regime. Unfortunately, McDonald Wheeler collapsed. It seems inevitable, I am sorry to say, that a number of investors will lose a good deal of money&#x2014;certainly a good deal to them, at any rate. It also emerges that Mr. Wheeler, the man concerned in setting up the firm, had, to say the least, somewhat doubtful antecedents. FIMBRA, formerly NASDIM, was unable, for reasons one can understand, to check him out in an adequate fashion.<br/>
This gives rise to a range of other concerns about the readiness of SROs to take on what will clearly be an onerous responsibility. IfFIMBRA, for which I have good regard &#x2014; I certainly do not intend to attack it &#x2014; has difficulties in fulfilling its potential responsibilities when the Bill becomes an Act, one can imagine that other SROs with even shorter histories than FIMBRA's will have equal or greater difficulties.<br/>
The point of recounting that story is to emphasise, as I am sure the Parliamentary Under-Secretary immediately recognises, that if such a situation were to arise under the legislation, the investors concerned would rightly expect, given these circumstances, to be compensated for at least part of their loss. They would turn to an adequate compensation fund which properly protected them. I pay tribute to the Government. Their proposals ought to put such a mechanism in place. I also pay tribute to the SIB which has campaigned long and hard for this outcome.<br/>
8.45 pm<br/>
I was interested to hear the comments of the Parliamentary Under-Secretary on the maximum limit of any individual payment. I take the view&#x2014;I am sure that my hon. Friends will share it &#x2014; that any maximum payment of &#x00A3;30,000 or &#x00A3;35,000 would be far too low. In regard to the instance that I described&#x2014;McDonald Wheeler &#x2014; I am already in touch with investors who have lost substantially in excess of that sum. In today's values, particularly in terms of redundancy payments and the prices that can be obtained for residential property, &#x00A3;30,000 is pitifully small. An amount of &#x00A3;100,000 is more appropriate. The Parliamentary Under-Secretary, if not directly involved in setting the limit, might at least use all his influence to ensure that a more sensible limit eventually finds its way into the scheme.<br/>
I welcome the provision as a very important step towards the objective of proper investment protection.</p>

<p>I welcome the amendments, with the reservation that the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) mentioned about the limit that should be set. The losses that can be incurred as a result of fraud and the uncertainty and devastating impact on individual lives should not be ignored in the consideration of a Bill whose principal objective is investor protection. We should, above all, be concerned to ensure that ordinary, legitimate members of the public who engage not in bad investment judgment but in reasonable judgment about with whom they place their moneys in certain markets are protected and compensated if, for a variety of reasons, whether due to fraud or whatever, a firm subsequently collapses.<br/>
We should bring these matters to a personal level and demonstrate their importance. I should like to read to the House an extract from a letter from one of my constituents, which clearly shows the need for a central

compensation fund and adequate compensation for people who lose out in situations of this kind. My constituent, whose name I shall not mention, wrote:
<q>I am writing to you in sheer despair concerning funds which myself, my wife and my daughter have invested in the above firm"&#x2014;</q>
McDonald Wheeler Fund Management. He continued:
<q>Over the last two years myself and members of my family have invested over &#x00A3;25,000 with McDonald Wheeler, at the end of July 1986, the Department of Trade stepped in, Wheelers went into liquidation, with the firm of Grant Thornton under Mr. Nick Lyle, being appointed by the Receiver to investigate.</q>
<q>We the clients were informed that it would take a fortnight to sort matters out, then later we were told it would take a while longer. Three months have now passed and what few reports we have received leave us in despair and feeling helpless and hopeless. The only information that can be collected, or heard, is from the newspapers, financial reports and T.V. and Radio Money Programmes, all of which continuously harp on about &#x2014; McDONALD WHEELER THE CRASHED INVESTMENT FIRM &#x2014; CLIENTS HAVE LOST ALL OF THEIR MONEY.</q>
<q>In view of our despair, I have tried in all directions to obtain correct information, but no one will help. FIMBRA utterly refused to step in and assist on behalf of clients, they in fact don't wish to know, in spite of McDonald Wheeler being a member and fully vouched and investigated by them.</q>
<q>Grant Thornton tell me they are completely unable to help, or offer information as they forward facts on]) to the Official Receiver, he in turn says he can do nothing, as he is required to supply all findings to the Courts. We the clients and investors, the real people who matter are simply left high and dry.</q>
<q>I feel so sick about this matter, particularly so as the bulk of our investments are owned by my wife and were providing her with a necessary monthly income, from which she has been completely cut off and lived in a most restricted situation, all through no fault of her own making and sheer default on Wheeler's part.</q>
<q>Unfortunately, we in common with all Wheeler's clients and incidentally as thousands of other investors also feel, invest funds in an investment firm that is a member of FIMBRA. How wrong we all were and are!!! FIMBRA is utterly useless, it is thoroughly unable to do anything, the same organisation investigated McDonald Wheeler when he first applied for membership in the early 1980s, they did not discover that Wheeler had twice previously been bankrupt &#x2026; a compensation fund must be set up to protect investors, it will take a year to come into force.&#x2014;So much for that&#x2014;Now, twelve years later 1986, they are saying the same old thing over again, namely a compensation fund will start next year. I can foresee any such compensation remaining well clear of the McDonald Wheeler case, involving sonic &#x00A3;15,000,000 of clients' investments.</q>
<q>I consider it a disgrace on the part of Parliament, after all this time&#x2014;12 years and still having done nothing to protect investors and people such as my wife, whose particular funds were hard saved life earnings on her own efforts, also including her only legacy, from her father, who served for 30 years in the British Army through two wars as an RSM, Military Medal and Bar &#x2026; We do so desperately wish to know if our money will he recovered and when, the facts must be known somewhere.</q>
<q>In a situation such as this, surely the government cart take some action to assist us, the investors who placed funds in an accepted responsible organisation, namely FIMBRA.</q>
I apologise to the House for the length of my quotation from that letter, but I hope that all hon. Members will understand that when it comes down to an individual level it is a real tragedy and disaster for those concerned. We have a responsibility to protect those people. Another thing that comes out of that letter is the desperate lack of information for people in such a situation, with the worry and loneliness that they experience. Any funds or regulatory systems that we set up should provide not only funds to compensate but much more and immediate


information to those who lose out. As for the amount of compensation that should be provided, I feel that it is not adequate to replace an open-ended limitless compensation figure before with a &#x00A3;30,000 figure now. At the very least, it should be a six-figure sum.<br/>
It is very important to recognise that the obligation of members of self regulation organisations to contribute toward a compensation fund, either within the SRO or centrally, imposes a discipline on those members to report suspect cases in the market in which they are operating. If members have to contribute to a central fund or an SRO fund, they will be watching much more carefully the activities, risk and vulnerability of other firms operating in the same market, and will have the incentive and initiative to report to the SRO that a firm in their market place is suspect because they know that if that firm goes to the wall, they may be on line to pay compensation funds. I therefore take with a pinch of salt some of the whinnying and carping of individual firms about the contribution that they will have to pay because it will be a good discipline for them to report to the SRO situations in which a risk is involved. It will also enhance the authority and right of the SRO to intervene and check out at an early stage cases that are suspect and thus to act in the interests of the protection of investors and of the market as a whole.<br/>
I do not believe that the debate can be seen in isolation from the subject of separation of clients' money. I think that it is fair to say that if the rest of the provisions are complied with and adequately enforced, particularly with regard to the separation of clients' funds, there will be less need for the compensation funds to be claimed upon by individuals who have lost out. All the provisions must therefore hang together.<br/>
I hope that my hon. and learned Friend the Minister, in replying to the debate, will go further than he went earlier. It is not enough to hope that an adequate limit will be agreed at some stage in future. Under these provisions, the Secretary of State may make rules, so he can establish within the scheme a limit considerably higher than &#x00A3;30,000 or ensure that in the administration of the scheme by the SIB there is a limit substantially higher than &#x00A3;30,000. It is not an adequate answer to say, "Before we delegate the running of the compensation fund to the SIB, we would have to be assured that it would be adequate and that the limit set for compensation was sufficiently high". My hon. and learned Friend can ensure that now. He can provide a much more generous and appropriate limit before he hands down the administration of the compensation fund to the SIB. We look to him to do that. The public and investors such as my constituents look to him. I hope that in winding up the debate he will be able to provide some much-needed assurance to past and potential investors.</p>

<p>I associate myself strongly with what the hon. Member for Chichester (Mr. Nelson) has said, particularly his last words.<br/>
I welcome the Minister's change of mind on this occasion. I ask him, gently, to contrast that welcome with his sharp, caustic, uncalled-for and unpleasant comments when I sought to exercise the same judgment earlier in the debate. A change of view caused him to say that my party was an expert on changing its mind. That comes strangely from the mouth of a Minister who has brought before the

House a Bill that is widely regarded as disorganised and a dog's breakfast, as well as having close to 1,000 amendments, 20 new clauses and four new schedules. In its present form the Bill commands the confidence of only some 20 per cent. of the City, so it is said. It is regarded by myself and many others&#x2014;I suspect on Conservative Benches, too&#x2014;as a Bill that will have to return for amendment within the next few years, probably two or three, which is the figure that I have heard. If the Minister had any self-respect he would not mention other people's change of mind, bearing in mind that the Bill stands as an appalling indictment, if not on his judgment, on the judgment of the Government. I shall come to happier matters &#x2014; that is, the amendment before us. If the Minister had been wiser, kept his mouth shut and had more self-restraint, those matters might not have been thrown at him in that fashion, for that has not been the tone of the debate that we have been conducting.<br/>
The comments which have been made about limitation are important and the Minister has it in his power to make it clear that the limit of &#x00A3;30,000 is inadequate. If he cannot set a precise sum, let him make it clear that he regards the limit of &#x00A3;30,000 as inadequate. He need not necessarily set a figure if he finds that too difficult a task. This matter was raised in another place and in discussing a probing amendment Lord Ezra said that perhaps there was not a case for an industry-wide compensation fund. I believe that such a fund is extremely important, and I subscribe to what has been said by the Minister, the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) and others. There is a case for an industry-wide compensation fund and that case becomes stronger when surveillance and monitoring services are federated. That means a unified compensation fund along with surveillance and monitoring services operating between SROs and the SIB.<br/>
9 pm<br/>
That argument has been advanced in a number of letters whcih the Minister has recieved and which I have seen, and I am sorry that he has set his face against a federated structure for surveillance and monitoring. I think that such a system would have offered an advantage. We have an industry-like unified compensation fund, which is a good thing, but a fragmented surveillance service.<br/>
One of the bases upon which the Bill is founded is the need for effective rules, effective surveillance and effective compensation. When these three elements are together in the same body, they provide what might be described as an incentive. It is one which works in a virtuous circle. Effective rules and effective surveillance will mean that it is likely at the end of the day that less will be paid out in compensation, but if responsibility for compensation lies with someone else, there will be no incentive. In some circumstances &#x2014; this is not inevitable &#x2014; the incentive could operate the other way round. If those who have lower costs because of less adequate surveillance and easier rules receive an advantage if the cost of compensation is shared equally with those who have fewer claims because of more stringent rules and better surveillance, that could lead to a vicious circle instead of a virtuous one. In other words, the rain raineth on the just and the unjust, but chiefly on the just because the unjust have stolen the umbrellas. In this instance the unjust will have to pay less for umbrellas.<br/>
The Minister has said that there are provisions in the Bill which prevent this cross-subsidisation. I presume that he is referring to subsection (3)<i>(b)</i> of the new clause, which states:
<q>for securing that the amounts which they are liable to contribute reflect, so far as practicable, the amount of claims made, or likely to be made, in respect of those persons.</q>
I would welcome an arrangement where the premiums to the compensation fund were related directly to the sums paid out in respect of each SRO. That would be possible within the terms of the Bill, and certainly the concept of variable premiums for different SROs is possible. Why should that correlation between premiums and the compensation that is paid out not be precise mathematically and why should the arrangement not be conducted in that fashion? Why do we have to use the term "so far as practicable"? I shall be grateful if the Minister explains to us precisely how the brake on cross-subsidisation will be put into effect so as not to build in the vicious circle that will tend to drag standards down.</p>

<p>I wish to ask my hon. and learned Friend the Minister two questions. Under the scheme of compensation which he and the SIB envisage, will it be necessary for fraud or negligence to be proved before compensation is activated? If that is necessary, it could be some years before the defrauded investor received compensation. Secondly, if an investment business were to lose authorisation &#x2014; for example, as a result of being expelled from an SRO &#x2014; would compensation be available subsequently to an investor who, it later transpired, had lost money because of the practices of the firm before it lost membership?</p>

<p>The next time the Minister cares to attack me personally&#x2014;I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) for coming to my defence &#x2014; I ask him to check his facts. As a good, cautious and learned lawyer of the past, he should know that the first thing to do before launching out is to check one's facts. Long before the Minister was appointed, when he was a Back Bencher, he will recall that the House debated the Gower report and stock exchange arrangements with a view to a cessation of the various actions which were then current in the courts. If the Minister reads the record of our proceedings, he will find that on each and every occasion I took part in those debates. I invite him at an appropriate stage to withdraw his remark about my interests in this subject.<br/>
I may, for once, get an apology, if the Minister's shoulders are broad enough, when he discovers that I agree with him about the compensation provisions, save for the reservation that the hon. Member for Chichester (Mr. Nelson) entered with regard to the &#x00A3;30,000. I do so on the basis of my experience as a former member of the Law Society. The Law Society has a limitless compensation scheme, and rightly so. It is not the client's fault that the broker or dealer is crooked or that the solicitor is crooked. There is no way in which to foresee that a solicitor will, in middle life, run off with the funds. One can sometimes get a warning sign.</p>

<p>We will ignore my hon. Friend's ignorant comment.<br/>
There are warning signs which can be seen in the everyday way in which they deal with their practice. Warning signs could be seen in the City with certain types of transaction occurring or shares being unloaded.<br/>
If every member in an SRO knows that, if somebody were to make off with the funds, they would have to contribute towards the compensation fund, they would be put on guard. I am sure that hon. Members who are members of the Law Society will confirm that that society's experience is that one of the best forms of watchdog is fellow members who see things happening. They are put on notice because they have a personal interest in the integrity, honour and good practice of their fellow members.<br/>
If the City believes that it consists of people of the highest calibre and personal integrity, what does it have o fear from a compensation fund that is 100 per cent. safe for its investors? If they cry, "The sums are so great, we cannot meet them" they are saying that there are people in the City who will make away with millions of pounds which the City cannot afford to meet. If we maintain that our City is equal in integrity to anything in the world, what better way is there to demonstrate that fact than to have a compensation fund which meets every claim in full? That has the advantage of policing and of demonstrating belief in the City's integrity.<br/>
The Bill would empower the Minister to intervene and make the necessary regulations. If he believes that the investor has rights and ought to be protected, what better way is there to fulfil that belief than to ensure that when an investor is faced with fraud or negligence he is protected 100 per cent? It is not too much to leave as the hallmark of the Bill a compensation scheme which embraces full protection. That is within the Minister's power. I challenge him to cover the client in full, bearing in mind the fact that the law and accountancy, for example, have such indemnity schemes.<br/>
If the Minister believes that the Bill exists to protect the City because it is a City of integrity, he will act and the compensation level will be 100 per cent.</p>

<p>I warmly welcome this group of amendments on the compensation fund. Like my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester (Mr. Nelson) and the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould), I should like to refer to the case of McDonald Wheeler as it highlights the need for a compensation fund.<br/>
If there had been positive vetting of Mr. Wheeler's application, it would have been discovered that he had previously made an arrangement with his creditors, but it is estimated that it would cost between &#x00A3;1,000 and &#x00A3;1,500 to vet each application. As a result, the process is a negative one&#x2014;the applicant fills in the form and, if he tells lies, that is merely the beginning of the fraud. There are also demands for references, and Mr. Wheeler would' have supplied those.</p>

<p>I apologise for interrupting my hon. Friend at this stage. Will he confirm that, if the legislation goes through, such a situation should not and would not recur, because to carry on business as an authorised person one would expect a self-regulating organisation to make reasonable inquiries? I do not know whether the cost is &#x00A3;1,000. There must be some criterion attached to authorisation and the sort of questions supplied by my hon. Friend should be basic to such a process.</p>

<p>That is obviously a matter for the SIB. In practice, the SRO would have to monitor every court and every judgment made and keep a list of all those people who had made an arrangement with their creditors. That would be a substantial operation, so it is likely that checking would be carried out on the basis of negative vetting. Therefore, fraudsters will still get through the net. Mr. Wheeler is obviously a crook. At the end of the day, it does not matter what rules and regulations there are about the prevention of fraud, we cannot prevent everybody from committing fraud. There will always be fraudsters and people who tell lies. The case highlights the need for a compensation scheme.</p>

<p>Although we were colleagues in the Committee, I find my hon. Friend's comments startling. The whole basis of a "fit and proper person" test is that persons who become members of SROs are fit and proper. There never is, nor has been, any intention that this should be conducted on the basis of a negative clearance.</p>

<p>I am surprised at that, because it seems to me that there will always be people who are able to persuade the body in question that they are fit and proper people when they are not. There will always be crooks and there will always be people who are prepared to deceive the body in question. To pretend that we are setting up a system that will prevent all fraud is absurd. That is why it is essential to have a compensation fund.<br/>
The McDonald Wheeler case has a lot in common with the Norton-Warburg case, and is a useful reminder of why we had this legislation. It is to protect small investors. I am clear about McDonald Wheeler. The man is a crook. He told lies to the Financial Intermediaries, Managers and Brokers Regulatory Association. It has been said that FIMBRA should have conducted an earlier spot check, but it conducts spot checks on one in five members a year. Again, it is a question of resources and how much money and manpower that will be put into this. It was a spot check by FIMBRA that revealed what was going on at McDonald Wheeler. Presumably that was in response to complaints, but it is at least possible that if the spot check had not been made McDonald Wheeler would still be trading.<br/>
It is important to appreciate that FIMBRA does not have the powers it will have once the Bill becomes law. For example, it was not able simply to suspend its member from trading but had to go to the Department of Trade and Industry and get it to take the necessary action. My hon. Friend said that investors were being kept in the dark, but the official receiver appointed on 6 August wrote a three-page letter setting out the circumstances and describing the situation, and sent it on 19 September to all investors. He has done what he can to keep people informed.</p>

<p>Does my hon. Friend agree that some of the criticism directed at FIMBRA in relation to the McDonald Wheeler case is unfair in that it changed its name from NASDIM, which was a different operation from the future SRO that is likely to operate under the name FIMBRA? Would it not be as well to underline the fact that FIMBRA, as now constituted, is a different body to the FIMBRA, assuming that it keeps that name, that becomes an official SRO as designated under the Bill?</p>

<p>My hon. Friend is right. It is perhaps inevitable that when legislation such as this is going

through Parliament, some people think that, because we have discussed this in large measure, it is in operation. Unfortunately for investors in McDonald Wheeler, that is not the case. We are talking about a compensation scheme which we hope will deal with such cases in the future. That is why it is so very important. My modest amendment addresses itself to the point to which reference has already been made: the degree to which contributions relate to subsequent claims. That should not be the only consideration to be taken into account when contributions are calculated.</p>

<p>I hesitate to intervene in this bitter internecine war. Indeed, I hesitate to speak at all, given the Minister's unkind and hostile response to my hon. Friend the Member for St. Helens, South (Mr. Bermingham). I do not want to bring similar retribution down on my head. I understand why the Minister is somewhat ratty, given this dog's breakfast of a Bill that he has to see through the House in the dying stages of the Session. However, it was unkind to speak thus to my hon. Friend.<br/>
The compensation fund casts a curious light on the Minister's approach to the Bill. I did not attend all of the Standing Committee sittings because I broke my arm, but I recollect that in Standing Committee the Opposition supported the establishment of a compensation fund. Indeed, they urged it on the Minister. However, he was full of all kinds of negative arguments about the difficulties, and why it was not possible to establish such a fund. He would not accept the idea. Now he has accepted it. He has told us what a good idea it is and why it is so marvellous.<br/>
If the Minister has had this volte face on the compensation fund, I wonder how many other amendments he should have accepted in Committee. Should he not have accepted a statutory basis for the whole system? It ought to have been accepted, and it would be accepted now, if there were time. Instead there is an impetuous rush to get the Bill on to the statute book. We ought to start all over again. The Bill will have to come back to the House, not for a respray but for complete reconstruction &#x2014;and fairly soon, too. Its prospects for success look about the same as the prospects for success of the stock exchange computer. If the compensation fund is such a good idea now, why was the Minister so cool and hostile about it in Standing Committee? It is deeply worrying.<br/>
It is right that a compensation fund should be established. The only argument is over its size. It is a shame that the Minister is being cautious about its size. The Opposition's view is that the bigger it is the better. It would give confidence to the industry. A sizeable compensation fund would give psychological confidence to the industry. Our first requirement is to provide protection to the investor, in particular to the small investor. He will be under more pressure because of the attempt to regulate.<br/>
Yesterday a number of hon. Members went to a lunch that was given by the home service insurance industry, which has always enjoyed a good relationship with its customers. Because it must have a long and continuous relationship with its customers, it visits them month in, month out. Therefore, the industry does not indulge in sharp practice and put pressure on its customers. Now it is being forced, because of the sins of others, to operate within a legislative framework that will impose costs on the industry, which will result in pressure to oversell. It is


right that the investor should be protected, but in some respects the close relationship between the investor and that section of the industry will be weakened by the Bill. It is imperative that we provide effective protection if we propose to interfere in the relationship.<br/>
The Opposition support the principle of the fund because the danger of the intense competition that will be liberated is that people will cut corners and go in for undesirable and unacceptable practices. There are also the dangers that fraud, negligence and failure to comply with the rules, those things that the Minister gave as the basic causes for compensation, will become more common. That will be as a result of the extremely intense competition that will occur.<br/>
There will not only he a threat from foreign instititions and firms coming to Britain; there will be a threat from the natives as well. They will face intense competition that will expose all investors, but especially the small investor, to fraud. It is right to highlight the case of McDonald Wheeler once again because of the points that were tellingly made about one small investor but which, of course, affect a large number of such investors.<br/>
I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) on his election to the shadow Cabinet and therefore to the next Government. He defended FIMBRA, but there has been a steady stream of criticism of FIMBRA because of its role in the McDonald Wheeler affair. The "Post", which is the United Kingdom insurance journal, says that the whole affair "makes sad and disturbing reading." It says:
<q>John Wheeler had been a director of two companies put into liquidation.</q>
But he was still accepted by FIMBRA nee NASDIM for membership. Not only that, but the warning signals about which my hon. Friend the Member for St. Helens, South spoke had been transmitted to FIMBRA because several worried investors had contacted it in the months leading up to all this. However, FIMBRA said:
<q>it is not possible to send an inspector into a company as soon as a complaint is made. `SROs cannot be seen to be acting capriciously.'</q>
What is "acting capriciously" in the face of representation on this scale?</p>

<p>The trigger point must be the complaint from the worried investors and it came quite early on. I agree that a complaint from an employee could be made from malicious motives and for that reason the FIMBRA rebuttal was perhaps accurate in that instance. It also had several subsequent complaints from investors and those should have triggered the action. For FIMBRA to say:
<q>We must be sure of our facts before we send in the heavy mob</q>
casts a curious light on its own procedures, given the casual nature with which it seems to have accepted the firm for membership.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend is right. What worries me is the casual nature of FIMBRA. It says that it vets "all potential members", but the vetting procedure is carried out on a negative basis. It says:
<q>We ask all potential members a whole range of questions, including whether they have ever been bankrupt.</q>
As the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) said, it is possible for people to lie and deceive. The SROs have to provide for that and must have more stringent checks rather than just accept a casual declaration in answer to a casual question. This firm used the NASDIM logo on its advertising material and presumably that gave it some credibility. If people believed&#x2014;and this belief appears to be widespread &#x2014; that these organisations will provide effective protection for the investor, to allow a doubtful firm to use the logo on its advertising is wrong and must require more stringent checks than those which have previously been made.<br/>
That is an example in which no one appears in a good light. However, it should prove a ghastly warning for us. It shows the need for the compensation fund. Even the Minister &#x2014; recalcitrant learner though he is in these instances&#x2014;with the blandishments and in the face of the brilliant adult education course given to him on these matters by my hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham over the months, has, thanks to the class, been slowly brought up to scratch. However, it has not brought him far enough up to scratch. We want the Minister to pass his 0-levels in this subject. That means accepting the principle of a larger fund. When it comes to the principle of extra compensation funds for the SROs, he should give these a somewhat more enthusiastic endorsement. The Minister said, in relation to the extra compensation funds, that "there is nothing to prevent them". That is a ringing invocation to get out there and establish the fund. That was a classic reply, written by a civil servant on whose doormat it must say "Not unwelcome". There is nothing to prevent the setting up of extra compensation funds.<br/>
I believe that it is essential that these supplementary funds be created. However, I end by welcoming the Minister's belated conversion to the principles that have been urged on him so strenuously by the Opposition. I hope that he goes further in his educational process.</p>

<p>These amendments make a worthwhile contribution to the improvement of the Bill. I understand and sympathise with the concerns of the stock exchange and the clearing banks and others who for a long time have been maintaining well-regulated markets, and providing more than adequate compensation for investors. They might be called upon to contribute in a scheme in which some of the participants were not as well regulated and did not cover their members adequately for the losses which might be sustained. That is a legitimate concern which is met in part by the proposal.<br/>
We must have more stringent policing. The examples that have been quoted about McDonald Wheeler and the present requirements of FIMBRA illustrate that all too clearly. It would not be unreasonable for FIMBRA to be expected to have details of county court records&#x2014; for example, of bankruptcies. Such details are already available to all credit organisations, banks and hire: purchase companies which subscribe to a service which exists at relatively modest cost to provide that information. All SROs should also subscribe to that service and ensure that they know more about the people whom they accept for membership.<br/>
Those of us who are members of professional bodies will know that we already accept an enormous cost by way of insurance for the right to be able to practise. Those members or putative members of SROs who are squealing about the cost of being permitted to trade in future do not have a case. We are talking about protecting investors and they must be prepared to pay an adequate price if they want to be in business.<br/>
I have a suggestion for those SROs. By way of compensation fund, they should require individual members to insure themselves as the price of membership. If they are dodgy enough, they will not get insurance, and if they are relatively dodgy they will have to pay a large premium. That should be the basis on which the compensation fund is assessed.</p>

<p>We in the Conservative party put an enormous premium on the small investor. The flotation of British Gas and TSB and other activities fall into the general context of the private investment activity in which members of the SROs engage. It is of vital concern to us, therefore, that the small investor has adequate protection. I welcome the provision for compensation. Because the SROs provide an imprimatur to the investor, he knows that when he deals with a member of one of those organisations he will receive the advice that he requires and that the organisation is fit and proper and&#x2014;as I argued in the Committee&#x2014;competent. The compensation question is extremely important to the proper running of the City in the future. The example given relates to the situation before the rules are brought into effect and shows the extreme difficulty and danger which apply without proper rules and compensation.<br/>
The clause provides that the Secretary of State may, among other things, specify the terms and conditions and the extent to which compensation is payable, and the circumstances in which the right to compensation is excluded or modified. If the Minister cannot do so, I hope that the SIB will indicate where the right to compensation might be excluded or modified under the rules. Reference has already been made to the comparable professional bodies engaged in investment activity and advice. They have limitless compensation provision. There is no reason why there should not be extemely effective compensation provision. A limit of &#x00A3;30,000 for any one claim is derisory. I recommed a revision of the thoughts expressed by the SIB on that matter. I understand that it might increase the limit.<br/>
I have expressed my concern about the "cosy club." I am worried that people can be blackballed out of some organsiations without due cause. I deplore the notion that people should be accepted, or not accepted, on the basis of negative clearance. That is the nearest thing to total nonsense that I have heard tonight. I hope that in applying the fit and proper person test in conjunction with compensation we shall ensure that the small investor is properly protected. I am confident that the Minister will monitor the provision and that it will work effectively.</p>

<speech hansard_id="438771" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1986-10-30a.565.1" hansard_membership_id="105" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2845" speakername="Mr. Howard" colnum="565" time="21:15:00">
<p>I am grateful for the general welcome for the provisions. It is impossible not to have sympathy with the constituent mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester (Mr. Nelson). One of my constituents came to my surgery on Saturday with a similar tale. It is impossible not to feel sympathy for those who have

suffered losses in similar circumstances. Clearly, the legislation must prevent such losses occurring in the future without the benefit of compensation. Our objective is to provide for the best protection reasonable. That is a requirement of schedule 6. The Bill does not set a maximum limit on the payments that can be made to an individual investor. That is provided for in the rules contained in the new clauses.<br/>
The SIB has indicated its policy and is considering a limit higher than that found in other financial sectors. For example, for banking the limit is 75 per cent. of up to &#x00A3;10,000 and for building societies the limit is 90 per cent. of up to &#x00A3;30,000. The Law Society compensation fund is not as extensive or generous as was suggested by the hon. Member for St. Helens, South (Mr. Bermingham). There is a discretionary compensation fund covering fraud only. Indeed, I believe that it is popularly referred to as the swindle fund. That body's scheme has limits, but other professional bodies have no compensation scheme at all, so one should not lightly assume that it is easy to make very generous arrangements. Any compensation provvision can be made only by levying investment firms. It is the investor who ultimately pays, and it is not to the benefit of investors if an extremely high notional limit is achieved by levies which drive many firms out of business or result in very high charges to investors. Nevertheless, I am sure that the SIB, in arriving at what it will regard as the best provision that can reasonably be made, will have regard to the observations made in the debate by hon. Members on both sides of the House, and will pay serious attention to them.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Stratford-upon-Avon (Mr. Howarth) raised two points. The first related to whether it was necessary for fraud or negligence to be proved. That is a matter for the rules of the SIB and of the SROs in relation to their schemes, which will define the cases in which money can be paid. They would also be able to provide for provisional payments to be made in advance. To some extent, that will meet the concern that my hon. Friend expressed about the difficulties that would arise if formal proof had to be provided. My hon. Friend also raised a point about the circumstances that could arise if a firm left an SRO. A firm that has once been authorised will be subject to the compensation rules. Those rules will determine exactly how investors will be compensated, and the clause provides expressly for the situation described by my hon. Friend.<br/>
If I understood the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown) correctly, he wanted to know why subsidisation could not be prevented altogether. All compensation arrangements involve an element of cross-subsidy, and the safeguards in the clause mean that in normal circumstances members of an SRO participating in the scheme will meet the cost of the claims on their fellow members. Thus cross-subsidisation will arise only in extremis, when an SRO demonstrates that a major default or series of defaults means that its members cannot bear the full cost of the compensation required, even over an extended period of years. If the body running the scheme is convinced of that, however, the affected SRO can receive a grant from the fund, which might well be repayable and which can be raised by levying the members of all the other SROs and any businesses directly authorised by the SIB. On top of that, participating SROs and RPBs would be represented on the body making that decision. With those safeguards, I do not think that it is unreasonable for other


businesses to contribute. The alternative is that investors might not be compensated. The view expressed in all quarters of the House is that that should not happen.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Stafford (Mr. Cash) asked about the circumstances in which exclusion from the right to recover compensation might be made. One such example might be where the person suffering the loss was involved in a conspiracy with the investment business concerned. It would not be unreasonable in those circumstances to provide for an exclusion.<br/>
I am sure that the Bill's compensation provisions represent a substantial improvement for the protection of investors, and I am grateful to hon. Members on both sides of the House for the welcome that the provisions have received.</p>

One of the problems of major projects of urban renewal is that when they are carried out by the private sector, such projects are extremely expensive and complex and also risky with the result that very few individual firms have been prepared to carry them out. Under the concept of unitisation such large and relatively risky projects can be split up among a large number of investors and will therefore become more feasible propositions. The other attraction of the proposal is that it will make liquidity within the market very much better and generally facilitate the ownership of property by a much wider group of individuals. For all those reasons, I warmly congratulate my hon. and learned Friend the Minister on the proposals contained in the amendment.</p>

<p>This group of amendments deals with the provision for auditors now in the Bill. I welcome the provisions which I think strengthen and reinforce the Bill. I have only one concern, which is that amendment No. 178, which introduces the new clause about auditors, is limited to the appointment of auditors by the designated agency to investment businesses which are not otherwise audited, that is, unincorporated, businesses.<br/>
One aspect of the McDonald Wheeler case which has been given insufficient attention is the position of the auditors to that company. They published a clean audit report for the 1984 accounts and shared the building in Canterbury with McDonald Wheeler. That gives some idea of their relationship with the company. No doubt they are being investigated along with the company, but it may be sensible to extend the clause so that the Securities and Investments Board could take a more general interest in who was appointed auditors.<br/>
We might reach the point where, rather as in the case of Lloyd's, it would be appropriate to have a panel of auditors who were approved as having the necessary experience and qualifications to audit authorised investment businesses particularly as it would be something of an extended audit, not a Companies Act audit. They will have to report as accountants on whether the business has complied with the conduct of business rules, or at least some of them. That will require some special expertise and experience. Therefore, it might be sensible to extend the clause in the way that my amendment proposes and I hope that my hon. and learned Friend will consider doing that.</p>

<p>I am slightly worried about the provisions of subsection (5) of the new clause introduced by Lords amendment No. 180, which appears to say that auditors would effectively have the right to determine who is or is not
<q>a fit and proper person</q>
in many circumstances. It is somewhat incongruous&#x2014;to complete a point I made in Committee&#x2014;that qualified auditors should have that kind of control over the members of SROs. The competence of an auditor, as defined for statutory purposes, is related to his qualifications under the Companies Act 1985, and that does not necessarily give him any right to determine a person's competence to give investment advice. My hon. and learned Friend the Minister is aware of my reservations, and I should be glad to hear his comments on that.</p>

<speech hansard_id="438803" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1986-10-30a.570.5" hansard_membership_id="105" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2845" speakername="Mr. Howard" colnum="570" time="21:45:00">
<p>The broad content of these provisions has already been given to the House in a written answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, South (Mr. Yeo) on 9 June. They are intended to provide a framework within which a constructive relationship between auditors and supervisors can develop, without undermining the auditor's relationship with his client or transferring


responsibility for regulation from the supervisor to the auditor. But the supervisor can do his job more effectively if communications with the auditor are facilitated so that the supervisor can benefit from the knowledge of an investment business which the auditor, in the course of his work, will develop.<br/>
Lords amendment No. 178 provides that rules may be made requiring those businesses authorised directly by the Secretary of State or under the clause 30 arrangement in the Bill to appoint an auditor. The intention is to ensure that all such investment businesses, however they are constituted, can be required to appoint an auditor who will be able to enter into that constructive relationship with a supervisor to which I have referred. Those rules will not apply to those investment businesses already required to appoint auditors under other statutes, such as the Companies Act. So this provision will apply to investment businesses which are not companies.<br/>
The new clause also sets out what the rules concerning the appointment of such auditors may contain. Their scope parallels those provisions concerning the appointment of auditors in the Companies Act. It is not intended that an entirely new set of provisions concerning the appointment and role of auditors should be created. There are some adaptations to those requirements for overseas businesses which are contained in the fourth new clause.<br/>
The power contained in the second new clause enables the Secretary of State to require a second examination of information supplied by a business on which an auditor has reported; it is intended to enable work of an apparently sub-standard nature to be checked by another person. That goes a long way towards meeting the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith). This is not intended to reflect on the high standard of professionalism set by the major accountancy bodies in the United Kingdom. But the Bill does not enable the Secretary of State or agency to dictate who shall be an auditor of an investment business and there should be some route open to the regulator to take a second opinion if he has any suspicion about the data given to him.<br/>
The clause introduced by Lords amendment No. 180 concerns communication made by the auditor to the Secretary of State or, if appropriate, to an SRO or RPB. Information may be given at the request of the appropriate supervisor, in response to a question put by him or, occasionally, at the auditor's initiative. Usually such reports will be made with the knowledge of the business concerned&#x2014;but on rare occasions it may be appropriate for the business not to be informed, for example, if senior management fraud is suspected.<br/>
The clause provides that the auditor in making such a report in good faith will not contravene any duty to which he may be subject. So the auditor will not be liable for any loss suffered as a result of his report. This provision is intended to remove any inhibition which an auditor might otherwise consider kept him from discussing matters with a supervisor.<br/>
It is intended that the circumstances in which an auditor should be expected to give information to a supervisor &#x2014; especially on his own initiative &#x2014; will be defined carefully. This will ensure that the individual auditor knows where he stands and will not feel obliged to volunteer much irrelevant information to the supervisor to safeguard his position. It is expected that these circumstances will be set out in professional guidance

agreed between the supervisor and the professional bodies. I know that both sides are approaching the task of agreeing this guidance positively. Contravention of the terms of such guidance would be subject to whatever disciplinary proceedings the relevant professional body decided to impose.<br/>
In the event that some professional bodies do not want to or cannot agree on the terms of guidance, it will be possible for the Secretary of State to make rules, subject to affirmative resolution, specifying the circumstances in which auditors should communicate with a supervisor. If an auditor fails to make reports in accordance with these rules, he may be disqualified from auditing authorised businesses as laid down in the new clause introduced by Lords amendment No. 182. But I emphasise that this sanction applies when the auditor is subject to rules made by the Secretary of State and not when satisfactory guidance is given.<br/>
The Bill also makes provision for the auditors of insurance companies to report to the Secretary of State matters relevant to his function under the Insurance Companies Act 1981, in a manner parallel to that being introduced for matters covered by this Bill. The Government intend that there should be a broadly similar approach to the role of auditors across the financial sector.<br/>
The provisions which I have outlined will create the right relationship between auditor and supervisor and will contribute to the effectiveness of the regulatory system.<br/>
On the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford (Mr. Cash), the auditor can give information to a supervisor if it is relevant to whether a person subject to supervision by that supervisor is fit and proper, but it will be for the supervisor to decide whether the person is fit and proper on the basis, among other factors, of the information supplied by the auditor.</p>

<p>I welcome what the Government have achieved with these new provisions. In broad terms, they have struck a sensible balance and have gone a long way towards resolving what has clearly been a difficult problem, not least for the professional bodies and for the accountants and auditors involved.<br/>
The first thing which the new clause embodied in amendment No. 180 does is to remove or set aside the duty of confidentiality. Clearly that is the first step that is required to remove what would otherwise be an obstacle to the auditor making any report to the supervisor if he considered that something was wrong.<br/>
I hope that the Minister can answer a question on subsection (2). That subsection, having removed the duty of confidentiality, goes some way towards putting in place a duty to report, but it does so by virtue of two separate provisions covering two separate circumstances: one where the recognised professional body lays down the rules and gives guidance to its members, and the other where the professional body does not do so and the Secretary of State has a reserve power.<br/>
What bothers me is that, in the first part of that subsection, the language is not that of duty. Where the rules are laid down, they are described as rules of guidance which specify circumstances in which matters are to be communicated. Later in the subsection, where the rules are imposed by the Secretary of State, the language of duty is used. That is a crucial question. Perhaps the Minister can assure me that the two parts are equivalent in this respect, but, if not, there is a problem. It is always a problem for


auditors, unless they are told that they must&#x2014;in every circumstance&#x2014;choose between the duty which they owe to their client and the duty which they owe to the supervisory authority. Unless that is made clear, not just in the rather exceptional circumstances where the Secretary of State imposes the rules, but in the more usual circumstances where the guidance is provided by the professional body, we may run into problems.<br/>
Will the Minister comment on that, or at least assure me that it is intended, and that the language secures the intention, that a duty should be imposed by those guidance rules issued by the professional bodies?</p>

<p>The answer to the point raised by the hon.

<p>The Secretary of State, in considering whether to exercise that reserve power, may have regard to the precise terms in which the rules made or guidance issued by a professional body are framed.

The Secretary of State must decide, in coming to a conclusion on whether he should exercise the reserve power that is provided, whether the rules or guidance are satisfactory from the point of view of the effect and purpose of the provision. If they are not, the Secretary of State has available the option of using his reserve powers which, as the hon. Gentleman concedes, give rise to an expressly provided duty.

<p>Hon. Members may recall that in Committee I was concerned that we might be failing to establish a regime fully adequate to supervise the investment management of long-term funds of life assurance companies. I contended that that was not a negligible consideration, given that they manage the premiums of a large number of small savers and the premiums total, in aggregate, some &#x00A3;125 billion. It is of major importance that we should be satisfied as to the regime of investment supervision. The objective had to be to achieve&#x2014;this is Professor Gower's phrase&#x2014;the level playing field, the principle of equivalence of treatment which the Bill articulates.<br/>
I am grateful for the consideration that the Government gave to the amendments that I put forward. I accept that insurance policies are a distinct class of investment and that insurance is covered by a distinct body of law. I have noted the extensive analysis given by Lord Lucas of Chilworth in another place. I appreciate that amendment No. 211 provides that companies must have arrangements to ensure that they do not act unfairly as between different funds. That is an important point. I am grateful to the Government for introducing the amendment.<br/>
I note that the reports that companies are asked to make will be subject to audit. That is an additional valuable safeguard. It is fair to acknowledge, of course, that under the Insurance Companies Act and various EEC directives the solvency of insurance companies is regulated.<br/>
I come to a lingering anxiety. The monitoring of solvency is not the same as supervision to ensure that there is the best investment performance in the interests of investors. The United Kingdom Provident Institution


debacle demonstrates that even the monitoring of solvency can be somewhat laggardly, although it is fair to acknowledge that the Department spotted that problem.<br/>
Will the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State assure us that the Department of Trade and Industry will be empowered and directed to ensure that the investment policy of insurance companies aims consistently to achieve the best return for policy holders? Will the Department of Trade and Industry operate a regime of supervision of investment managers of the funds of long-term insurance policies that is truly comparable to the regime operated by the SIB and SROs in respect of investor protection elsewhere?<br/>
The principles of best execution, prohibition on dealing with connected persons and the maintenance of proper records should be common to investment managers wherever they operate. Will the regime that the Department of Trade and Industry will apply in the case of insurance companies be at least as rigorous as the regime that the SIB and SROs will operate elsewhere?</p>

<p>The amendment was a response to concerns put to us in Committee which arose from comments by the city capital markets committee. Unlike other forms of pre-packaged investments, such as unit trusts, policy holders of long-term insurance policies do not own the underlying assets. Instead, insurance companies own assets and manage the investments. Since they manage their own investments, it is not an investment business and is not covered by the Bill.<br/>
It was put to us that the economic realities of insurance companies, in managing their long-term funds, are managing the assets of their policy holders. If we broadly accept the justice of this argument, the purpose of the new clause is to cover the principal abuse that can arise when a fund manager has a number of investment clients. The clause provides that where an insurance company has identified funds in different parts of its long-term business, it must have arrangements to ensure that it does not act unfairly as between those funds. That will be a new provision in the Insurance Companies Act. It goes a long way towards meeting the concern expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Stratford-on-Avon (Mr. Howarth).</p>

<p>I hope that it will not come as too great a disappointment to those who have been waiting in anticipation for amendment No. 340, which I have been asked to open fully, if I begin by saying that the amendment and the others grouped with it are all relatively minor.<br/>
Amendment No. 443 to schedule 8 arises from the fact that a recognised SRO with potential or actual insurance company members has an additional requirement to take account in its rules of the regulation of insurance companies under part II of the Insurance Companies Act or the corresponding provisions in the law of another EC member state. That requirement might prevent an SRO from taking action against an insurance company because that action was reserved to the Secretary of State. Clearly it would be wrong if in those circumstances the SRO were liable for its inaction, and the amendment would grant it immunity from actions for damages in the discharge of those functions as for its other functions.<br/>
The other amendments are consequential on the new procedure for winding-up investment businesses introduced in Committee in another place or are consequential on an amendment made on Report in this House which moved the provision conferring immunity on the designated agency from schedule 7 to clause 156. Amendment No. 346 reflects the fact that arrangements made by a recognised clearing house for the monitoring function to be carried out by another person or body are entirely analogous to similar arrangements made under the relevant provisions relating to recognised self-regulating organisations, recognised professional bodies, registered investment exchanges and the designated agency.</p>

<p>I beg to move, as an amendment to the Lords amendment, in line 3, after "Act", insert
<q>or of any application for such certificate".</q>
The amendment deals with immunity from action for damages of recognised professional bodies. We have been over that ground on several occasions before, so I shall not go over the history of the argument. At present under the Bill the SIB itself has an exemption from liability for damages, and so will self-regulating organisations in relation to suits or damages that might come from their own members or any member of the public.<br/>
It has always seemed to me that the logical provision for recognised professional bodies would have been to give


them exactly the same treatment as the self-regulating organisations, but we have been over that ground, as I said. I do not want to open up the argument again, except to say that I have never found the ministerial answers on that point at all persuasive. But we are now in a different situation because an amendment was moved in the other place earlier this week to provide at least immunity from suits, from actions by members of recognised professional bodies. The Government were not willing to accept even that, but there have been discussions with some of the professional bodies concerned, including the Institute of Chartered Accountants, and the Government have come up with an amendment of their own, No. 347. As I understand it, Ministers have been saying that it is not necessary to have anything of the sort in the Bill and that the certification procedure of recognised professional bodies is sufficient. As a non-lawyer, may I say that that seems a rather dangerous course. It means that professional bodies would be doing by their own rules what the Government and the House had specifically prevented them from doing, something which would have been subject to legal challenge. The professional bodies rightly said, "If it is to be done through the certification procedure, at least a procedure should be written in the Bill", and that is what we have in amendment No. 347. That is a summary of the history.<br/>
10.15 pm<br/>
The difficulty with the certification procedure is that it bites only when a certificate has been issued, and there may be a dispute between a recognised professional body and one of its members over whether a certificate should have been issued in the first place. In other words, the member may object that he has been refused a certificate. There is nothing in the new provision which would prevent him suing the professional body on that ground. As I have said, the provision will not bite in those circumstances. No certificate will have been issued and, therefore, the conditions will not be applicable.<br/>
I do not understand why the Government have been so stubborn over this matter and why they should not have had a provision for recognised professional bodies, even if it were limited only to immunity from suit from their own members and expressed in exactly the same terms the provisions that apply to SROs. The provision would be limited to the professional bodies' own members. That is what was attempted in another place at a late stage and the Government have not, for reasons which I find odd, been willing to go along that route. Instead, they have produced their own provision, which, unfortunately, I believe is defective.<br/>
The purpose of the amendment is to fill the gap that will be left if amendment No. 347 is accepted as it stands. I do not know whether the Minister believes that a recognised professional body should automatically give a certificate of authorisation to any of its members who apply for one, and who are only engaging in investment business within the scope of the authorisation of the recognised professional body, but I think that that would be too automatic a procedure. There are certain conditions which have to be met before a certificate can be issued, and that must be right. It must be right in terms of the Government's approach to these matters. If there are certain conditions to be met, there are bound to be

circumstances in which a certificate will be refused to a member. A member may feel aggrieved in those circumstances and may wish to take legal action against the professional body. If we are not to give immunity from legal action generally, it should cover these circumstances, and that is the purpose of this minor and technical amendment to amendment No. 347.</p>

<p>I regard this provision as yet another sign of the slightly subordinate position, in a sense, which recognised professional bodies, including many distinguished chartered bodies, will face. I notice that my hon. and learned Friend the Minister is shaking his head, but there are distinctions in legal immunity which have to be considered. I can see some difficulties arising in the context of which the right hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Millan) spoke. I ask for my hon. and learned Friend's assurance that this matter has been given the most careful consideration and that there will not be any problems arising in future.</p>

<p>After long debates on this subject, I thought that my hon. and learned Friend the Minister might be interested to hear the legal opinion which my institute, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, has received. It deals with both members of the public claiming in respect of investments and practitioners. It reads:
<q>Our advice is that in the second category"&#x2014;</q>
practitioners&#x2014;
<q>the Institute's exposure is very limited and can probably be eliminated by appropriate changes to its bye-laws. In the first category"&#x2014;</q>
investors&#x2014;
<q>the legislation does somewhat increase the scope for actions against the Institute, particularly in relation to acts carried out in the course of investigating complaints. There are, however, few cases in which such actions seem likely to be successful.</q>
I suspect that, after all the debates on this subject, the practical problems that will be created by the fact that my hon. and learned Friend has not been prepared to concede immunity to the recognised professional bodies, mainly because he was not happy about conceding it to the self-regulating organisations in the first place, will not be a great difficulty.</p>

<p>I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) for drawing that distinguished legal opinion to my attention. I was previously unaware of it, and I hope that it will go a long way toallaying some of the fears that have been expressed.<br/>
In regard to what my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford (Mr. Cash) said, it is not envisaged that professional bodies should in any way be subordinated to self-regulating organisations&#x2014;they are simply different. If they were not different, the need for a separate regime would not have arisen. The differences are effected in several different ways in the Bill. They are not, for example, subject to the direct rule changing power of the SIB.<br/>
We have not imposed a similar condition on applicants for certification as the right hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Milian) requests because we do not believe that that is necessary. A recognised professional body would not be required to subject applicants for certification to a fit and proper test&#x2014;certification by a recognised professional body will be a much more straightforward matter than joining a self-regulating


organisation. The tests that the professional body would have to apply relate to easily established matters of fact such as whether the people managing and controlling the applicant are members of a professional body. In those circumstances, the risk of a certificate being refused on contentious grounds is very small, and there is no reason, therefore. to provide for immunity in such a case.</p>

<p>I hope that I shall not weary the House unduly if I remind hon. Members that the Opposition have been entirely consistent on this matter. It is the Government who have done a minuet around us and changed their stance almost entirely.<br/>
We have always argued that for self-regulating organisations, as for recognised professional bodies, some immunity is required, especially against their members, if they are not to be frustrated whenever they try to enforce the rules or conduct inquiries and investigations. We argued strenuously for that in Committee, and the proposition was equally strenuously resisted by the Government. We then discovered to our astonishment on Report that the Government had entirely shifted their stance. They had accepted our case for immunity against members and provided a blanket immunity for self-regulating organisations against everyone.<br/>
The change substantially alters the nature of self-regulation. Self-regulation was a means which, one assumes, was requested by many City institutions and interests, and by which the investor was to be protected. Self-regulation was touted as the best possible means by which investor protection could be secured, but we now find a regime in which the aggrieved investor, far from being protected, is denied a remedy against the regulatory bodies. That means that the self-regulation that the Opposition were prepared to accept as a desirable element in the regulatory structure has suddenly become an end in itself rather than a means to secure investor protection, and a fundamental objective of the Bill has somehow been lost from sight.<br/>
I shall take the example of the McDonald Wheeler and FIM BRA affair. It is clear that if the Bill were in force there would be aggrieved people who would have lost as a result of the McDonald Wheeler failure and who would perhaps riot unnaturally &#x2014; they would have every justification for it &#x2014; seek a remedy against the self-regulatory organisation involved. As the Bill stands, they would he denied that remedy. I do not believe that that can be justified. For that reason, I am bound to make it clear, if I have not done so already, that this is one of those issues to which a future Labour Government will wish to return when they legislate anew on these matters.<br/>
I am aware that the amendment concerns recognised professional bodies I entirely agree with my right hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Milian) that at the very least it is important that, for reasons of consistency&#x2014;I hope that I have established that we are consistent&#x2014;we wish to argue, just as we did for the self-regulatory organisations, that recognised professional bodies should he protected for the same reasons against suit by their members.<br/>
I fully understand the Government's position, and the Minister was kind enough to talk to me and others about these matters within the last week or so. I know that what he is proposing, and will achieve by virtue of this amendment, is not a statutory immunity. He has removed any possible obstacles to achieving immunity by contract

between recognised professional bodies and their members. The Minister feels that it is difficult to draw a line between investment business, which may be relatively marginal business, and the other professional activities of members of the bodies. I accept that the line is difficult to draw, but &#x2014; I have made this point to the Minister before&#x2014;that problem is not avoided by relegating the matter from statute to contract. The rules still have to do that job. Somehow or other, that line has to be drawn if an immunity is to be secured, so I am not particularly persuaded by that element in the argument.<br/>
I would go a little further. By relying on contract&#x2014;in effect, by inviting the professional bodies to secure the position that they want to achieve through the contract &#x2014; the Minister is giving insufficient weight to the different roles and interests of the recognised professional body as being the body exercising quasi-statutory if not entirely statutory powers of supervision and regulation, and its members. If the interests of the members at the point of joining and the interests of the professional body with the statutory duties laid upon it were identical, there would be no reason why the members should not readily accede to whatever contractual terms were required of them by the recognised professional body, but that is not necessarily the case. There may be a conflict between what the recognised professional body wishes to do in the interests of the profession as a whole and to secure for itself the role that it could conceivably fulfil under the legislation and the interests of the members who say to themselves, "Why are we signing away perfectly good legal rights simply as a condition of joining the body?" The Minister has left a problem for recognised professional bodies which might, in certain circumstances, be extremely difficult to resolve.<br/>
If this matter is to be satisfactorily resolved and the recognised professional bodies are to be given immunity, which I believe the Minister concedes that they will need if they are to do this job&#x2014;one for which they have volunteered, but which is described and identified in statutory terms&#x2014;they will need more than the ability to try to secure that objective through contract. They should he given clear statutory immunity. No other solution will achieve what is required.<br/>
I was persuaded by the speech of my right hon. Friend the Member for Govan that he had hit upon a weakness, even within the limits of the Government's proposal, in the amendment. The Government will be prudent, and I am sure that the advice of the recognised professional bodies would be to accept my right hon. Friend's amendment for the sake of preventing avoidable difficulties.</p>

<p>I support the point made by the lion. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) about the requirement to place this immunity on a statutory basis. Although I regret that I did not hear the latter part of his speech, I had seen the amendment and I support the line taken by the right hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Millan).<br/>
My view in Standing Committee&#x2014;and it remains my view today &#x2014; that to extend immunity from suit to members of the public and investors in the case of self-regulating organisations is going far too far. We were in favour of immunity from suit for members. The Minister will remember that we had long discussions about it. I was as astonished as the hon. Member for Dagenham when, following a long and strenous discussion one morning, this


point was given away. I still harbour the strong suspicion that, whatever the Minister may say to the contrary, it was given away more as a result of the pressure that was applied outside this Chamber than as a result of the arguments that he heard inside it.<br/>
10.30 pm<br/>
I recall that the Minister advanced a most remarkable new doctrine, especially for a lawyer. He said that since he had travelled in the direction that the hon. Member for Dagenham and I and others had recommended to him but had passed by our point and gone further, we should not complain; we should be doubly happy. I recall wondering at that time what the Minister's reaction might be if his wife came in with a broken car and said, "You told me to park the car in the garage, but you should be doubly happy because I went right through it and out the other side."<br/>
The Minister has gone far too far in providing immunity from suit in respect of members of the public. It amounts to a significant destruction of some of the advantages and rights that members of the public should have under the Bill. I do not go as far as the hon. Member for Dagenham. I do not say that automatically this means that we must move to a statutory system. However, it is a very bad move and it should be removed as soon as possible.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) raised four points, the last of which was endorsed by the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown). He rightly attributed to me the identification of the difficulties of definition of the boundary line between investment business that members of professional bodies might carry out, and their other professional activities, as one of the reasons why I was reluctant to provide statutory immunity from suit for professional bodies.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman is right that that difficult question of definition remains and that it is not avoided if statutory immunity is not provided, but he failed to recollect the point that I made when we met to discuss this matter: that it is a particularly difficult question of definition and that therefore it is more appropriate to leave it for resolution by the professional bodies and their members, because of the scope that they will have to adjust a definition in the light of experience than to enshrine such a definition in statute law. One factor is that it might be appropriate to draw a definition in a different place for different professional bodies. Therefore, the route that the amendment provides offers considerable advantages in relation to that point.</p>

<p>I have absolutely no basis for asking this question other than curiosity, but will my hon. and learned Friend tell us whether the professional bodies concerned have agreed to this provision? It is important to know whether the professional bodies agiee with it.</p>

<speech hansard_id="438840" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1986-10-30a.581.2" hansard_membership_id="105" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2845" speakername="Mr. Howard" colnum="581" time="21:45:00">
<p>I dare say they might have been happier with a different provision, but I understand that they regard this provision as acceptable and workable.<br/>
The hon. Member for Dagenham sought to widen the discussion somewhat by suggesting that the effect of this provision was, in some very serious way, to deny remedy to investors. It is important to understand that investors will not be deprived of remedy. They will still be able to sue an authorised person if he breaches the rules that apply

to him, and they will have access to the compensation arrangements, where appropriate. Those compensation arrangements are specifically designed to favour small, private investors. Therefore, I do not believe that the interest of such investors will be seriously affected by the immunity granted under this clause, or under other clauses.<br/>
The hon. Members for Dagenham and for Yeovil have always failed to take properly into account the extent to which regulatory action by self-regulating organisations might be inhibited if they were liable to suit by investors. Investors do not simply and exclusively consist of Aunt Agatha, an investor who became fondly known to us during our discussions in Standing Committee. Investors will include large and powerful concerns which might well be prepared to use the threat of legal action to inhibit effective regulatory action by self-regulating organisations. That justified the extension of the immunity for those organisations.<br/>
The hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) descended into the detail of the likely reaction of members of professional bodies. I do not share his analysis, because one can possibly divide those members into two categories. There will be those anxious to take advantage of the ability to carry out investment business by being authorised through membership of a professional body. They will have every incentive to enter into an agreement of that kind with the professional body in order to encourage the professional body to become recognised. The other category of members may have no interest in carrying out investment business. Equally, it will be in their interests to confer this power on their professional body because it will mean that they will be much less likely to be held liable at the end of the day to contribute to any liability incurred by that professional body.</p>

<p>There is at least the possibility of a third category, professional men carrying out investment business. They may be unwilling to accept, if one tries to impose it on them, a contractual term which denies them remedies against a recognised professional body. Therefore, they would prefer to go for direct authorisation. Would the Government be neutral on that?</p>

<p>I do not entirely follow that argument, since direct authorisation would be a matter for the Securities and Investments Board or designated agency and they would have immunity. The people about whom the hon. Gentleman spoke would be no better off by taking that route. There is no way in which there would be an advantage in terms of securing less immunity by following any of the other routes. The third category of member of a professional body identified by the hon. Gentleman will not exist. For all those reasons, Lords amendment No. 347 provides a satisfactory balance and I commend it to the House.</p>

It is with some diffidence that I raise this matter in the House. It involves some detail and trying to achieve a balance of advantage between certain areas in Fife and other areas outside Fife. It concerns the inter-relationship of the Scottish Home and Health Department with a health board and the health board's area of responsibility. As a Member of Parliament, I have some diffidence about intervening in these activities. I hope, therefore, that I will not bore the House by going over some of the background as I try to set the scene as to what is agreed and where the areas of disagreement may be between the Scottish Home and Health Department and the health board in Fife.<br/>
I do not think that there would be any disagreement about the shortage of acute beds in Fife. My information is that&#x2014;and I accept that these are broad brush figures &#x2014; between 5,000 and 10,000 patients a year have to travel out of Fife for hospital attention. My argument is based on statistics furnished by the health board. There is a requirement, in terms of acute bed provision in Fife, for 938 beds. That is the total requirement for Fife.<br/>
I am not trying to play my area off against any other area, but in Dunfermline we have certain additional disadvantages in relation to the shortages of acute beds. The problems lie in the fact that there are three different hospitals which cater for specific services: Milesmark, Dunfermline and west Fife hospital and the Dunfermline maternity hospital. That leads to an unsatisfactory situation as there is a duplication of services and unsatisfactory and old facilities.<br/>
The health board naturally desired to rationalise the position and to concentrate activities on one hospital in Dunfermline. In 1983, the health board tried to resolve the position by making an earnest attempt to examine the overall position and, coincidentally, to determine the content and progress of the acute bed facilities in Dunfermline under the phase II development in the new west Fife district general hospital. I make no criticism of the Government's overall strategy. They have tried to reallocate the resources within hospital expenditure in Scotland and, instead of being one of the disadvantaged areas, Fife has begun&#x2014;and I say that diffidently&#x2014; to receive fairer treatment.<br/>
I have referred to 1983. After many years of unproductive discussion about the new acute hospital for

Dunfermline, it became apparent to the board in 1983 that the effort should be made to reach a decision which would lead to approval being given by the Scottish Home and Health Department to the building of a new acute hospital in Dunfermline. That building project was of such a magnitude that it would have to be funded centrally by the Treasury. To obtain approval in principle from the SHHD, the board was obliged to carry out two procedures. As far as I understand it, that was unique. The board was the first to carry out these procedures, what is called an option appraisal exercise and the preparation of an approval in principle submission. These are technical terms and I do not understand the details except to say that the option appraisal exercise consumed a great deal of valuable time&#x2014;about 18 months &#x2014; of highly paid officials within the board and elsewhere.<br/>
Arising from the option appraisal scheme there were five options available to the board. One was to cater for the facilities outside the Fife area and another was to do so within the Fife area. Both options were dismissed for obvious reasons. The options were narrowed to two. Option C was based on an equal distribution of facilities and option D on the balance of population.<br/>
On 26 June 1984 the board decided to proceed with option C on the basis of advice from the building division that developing the Victoria hospital site was not feasible. I do not want to interfere with any of my hon. Friend's constituency, but that was the advice from the building division. Option D involved a third set of theatre suites. On balance it was decided to proceed with option C in Dunfermline.<br/>
One would have thought that everything was set and that the Fife board could proceed with option C, subject to other approvals being granted. However, in late autumn 1985 the board received a development plan for the Victoria hospital from the building division which had stated earlier that it would be inappropriate to develop the Victoria site further. The building division suggested that a fairly large new building might be built. Further investigations suggested that it might be possible to provide a larger development, contrary to what had been stated previously by the building division.<br/>
I do not know about the Minister, but I have seen a sketch plan which reveals a weird and wonderful development and which opened up further study. Advances in engineering and technology could make what was not possible in 1983&#x2013;84 possible in 1985. Anyway, the hospital board found that it was impelled, if not compelled, to go through the exercise of evaluating whether it was technically possible to expand the Kirkcaldy site.<br/>
Initially the Scottish Home and Health Department raised a number of queries about the phase II development of the west Fife district general hospital, to which answers were given. Information was given to the SHHD about the feasibility of a larger development on the Victoria site at Kirkcaldy. In April 1986 the Department wrote to the board stating that as there had been recent indications from the building division that further development at Victoria hospital might be feasible, a more detailed study of the apparently abandoned option D&#x2014; or something like it &#x2014; was required and it requested a study to be carried out, having regard to capital cost and revenue consequences. This study has been embarked upon.<br/>
I may not have entirely accurate information&#x2014;I do not wish to mislead the House&#x2014;and 1 apologise to the


Minister but I am told that, in broad ball park figures and capital costs, there is little to choose between option C and option D. We are talking about figures of between &#x00A3;28 million and &#x00A3;30 million either way. Although full studies have not been completed, there is little to choose, in revenue terms, between the options.<br/>
My information is that, on Friday 24 October, the Fife health board's senior officers met with officers of the building division of the Common Services Agency to discuss the studies in relation to the design and capital costs involved in option C at the Victoria site and the option D implications of the west Fife district general hospital site. This meeting was reported to the Fife health board on 28 October and there will be a further meeting to discuss the matter.<br/>
I apologise to the House for the time I have spent in setting out the background. What is at stake is the delay and the disadvantage to constituents &#x2014; not only mine but constituents throughout Fife.<br/>
If Treasury money is involved or Treasury sanction is required, it is right that we should go through an evaluation exercise. I do not question that&#x2014;indeed that would defeat my purpose. The evaluation exercise has been carried out but it has been reopened on the basis of what I consider to be a very flimsy overture by the building division and its architects.<br/>
No conclusion has been obtained on the basis of a capital evaluation and no conclusion has been obtained on the basis of a revenue evaluation. To put it crudely, we are back to political pressures and a balanced judgment of what could be done on a green field site in Dunfermline and what Can be done on a rather congested site in Kirkcaldy. These are value judgments. I believe that the best organisation to assess these judgments would be the Fife health board. I appeal to the Minister to make it clear that, at the end of the day, which I hope will be soon, we will not have any pressures exerted by the Scottish Home and Health Department on the health board, through various political channels, to accept something which the health board does not want.<br/>
The health board is strictly adhering to option C, which it initially embarked upon. Other factors interpose themselves. Due to the shortage of acute beds in Fife, many people in my constituency and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Dunfermline, East and other hon. Members have to travel either to Tayside or to the Lothians. We await an evaluation of the cost of option C from the Scottish Home and Health Department.<br/>
Recently we met Lord Glenarthur and he said that he hoped that this "delayed" survey on the cross-boundary flows would be done quickly. In a letter to my hon. Friend the Member for Dunfermline, East and myself on 22 October he said:
<q>On the matter of cross-boundary flow, I must emphasise that Fife Health Board's proposals for West Fife District General Hospital Phase II, together with the option appraisal were only submitted to the Scolttish Home and Health Department in January of this year.</q>
We do not necessarily accept that stricture.<br/>
The assumption on the part of the Fife health board was that, having assessed option C, the exercise of cross-boundary flow was one that it should not concern itself with. However, the letter went on:
<q>The work on cross-boundary flow could not, therefore, have commenced prior to that time, as it was not known what the Board's proposals were.</q>
We dispute that. The letter also states:

<q>Assuming the Health Board are able to resubmit their proposal to me before the end of this year, I would still hope to be in a position to make a decision early in 1987.</q>
We welcome that. However, I must emphasise that the major concern is delay.<br/>
I hope that the Minister will accept that what I have said is said with sincerity. Our concern is about the injection, late in the day, of another survey. The File health board was the first to go through an option appraisal scheme. I submit that to open the argument again, however persuasively it may have been put&#x2014;initially I was not persuaded on the basis of an architect's flimsy drawing&#x2014;involves delay. That has a cost that no one has been asked to evaluate. Delay involves suffering to people in Fife, especially people in my constituency, who expect to have their needs in terms of acute beds satisfied.<br/>
We are talking about getting something done that should have taken anything up to nine years. My estimation is that, because oi' the delay, it will be the year 2000 before the problem is resolved. I know that the Minister has difficulties and I understand the problems of intervening. However, I am asking for an assurance that he will give resources to the Fife health board to expedite this and that the board will be left to make the judgment at the end of the day as to what is best for the people of Fife and what the distribution of hospital services should be between one part of the board's area and another. I earnestly look forward to the Minister's reply.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Dunfermline, West (Mr. Douglas) has illustrated his concern about the delays in building a new acute hospital in Dunfermline. I can understand that. As he mentioned in his speech, he and his hon. Friend the Member for Dunfermline, East (Mr. Brown), who I see is in the Chamber, came to see me while I was the Minister responsible for health and we discussed this matter. I know that they have been to see my noble Friend the Minister of State who has taken over those responsibilities at the Scottish Office and have expressed to him their concern about the delays.<br/>
I am afraid that, as I and my noble Friend have said, we cannot agree that the board ignored the new evidence which came to it affecting the choice of the site that it would develop when considering a new hospital investment in Fife amounting to many millions of pounds. I do not think that the board or the Scottish Home and Health Department could have ignored what they heard from the building division. They had to look at the implications of that advice and at the implications for the adjoining health boards of any proposals to build a new hospital in Fife.<br/>
I shall describe the acute hospital provision in Fife at present and why the Fife health board wishes to provide replacement and additional accommodation. I shall simply be underlining something that the hon. Gentleman and I agree upon, which is that new hospital accommodation is needed in Fife.<br/>
At present there are some 793 acute beds in Fife, the main concentration being at the Victoria hospital, Kirkcaldy, with 365 beds, and a scattering of eight small and medium-sized hospitals, some in less than ideal condition, making up the balance. The total number of 793


compares with anticipated needs in 1991 of 918 acute beds. The number of acute hospital beds in Fife is therefore significantly short of the number required. At present, the shortfall is in large measure compensated by treatment provided for Fife patients in Edinburgh by the Lothian health board.<br/>
Fife health board wishes substantially to reduce the cross-boundary flow. The board is also concerned that the proliferation of small units of existing accommodation in Dunfermline and the Kirkcaldy area needs to be rationalised. In 1983 the board embarked on an option appraisal. The hon. Gentleman used the word "unique". It was not unique&#x2014;it was the first detailed option appraisal on that scale. Now it is a routine procedure. Option appraisal is an important procedure to determine where we should put major capital investments and how best we can make those investments for the benefit of the service into the future.<br/>
I do not want to repeat what the hon. Gentleman said because I want to try to put the main points in my speech. However, he mentioned the options. Option A involved closing a number of acute beds at Dunfermline and substantially increasing the number of patients treated in Lothian. That, for obvious reasons, was rejected.<br/>
Option B was essentially a "no change" option. Facilities at Dunfermline would be upgraded and the cross-boundary flow to Lothian slightly increased. Fife health board rightly decided to reject that option.<br/>
Option C involved a large new hospital at Dunfermline, with the existing acute hospitals there closing down, and a smaller extension to Victoria hospital, Kirkcaldy, replacing the beds at Cameron, Hunter and Randolph Wemyss. It was thought that that option would substantially reduce cross-boundary flow to Lothian.<br/>
Option D would provide rather less development at Dunfermline but correspondingly more at Kirkcaldy. The fifth option, option E, envisaged substantial development at Kirkcaldy and very little at Dunfermline, with cross-boundary flow to Lothian increasing slightly.<br/>
Options E and D were quickly ruled out because of what were thought at the time &#x2014; April 1983 &#x2014; to be insuperable difficulties on the Kirkcaldy site. In April 1984 option A was also dropped because it would have caused revenue problems for Fife and also, of course, because of the inconvenience to patients and relatives travelling to Edinburgh. Furthermore, it was thought that Lothian health board would have considerable difficulty in absorbing a large increase in acute patients. Option B was rejected as failing to meet the problem, leaving option C as the board's preferred solution.<br/>
In December 1985 the board presented a submission to the Department for approval in principle to build a second phase of west Fife district general hospital, providing 432 beds. That was followed in January 1986 by the board's option appraisal document. However, at that time it became apparent that further development at Victoria, Kirkcaldy, in addition to the 102 beds proposed by option C, might in fact be possible. That followed on advice provided by the building division of the Scottish Health Service Common Services Agency. It was clear that the board would have to look again at what facilities might be provided at Kirkcaldy, and that option D need not have been deleted purely on the ground that it was not feasible to build additional accommodation at Kirkcaldy.</p>

<p>I want to comment on the precise point which has led to the further consideration of option D. It seems that it was pointed out that it might have been technically feasible to build on the site. Is the Minister aware that the board rejected option D not only because it doubted the technical feasibility but because it regarded the proposal, which would involve three theatre sites, as &#x2014; to use the board's words &#x2014; "totally impractical"? Therefore, whether or not the site was technically feasible for building was not the major or only issue in the board's decision when it rejected option D. Why, then, is the board being forced to go through a technical submission on option D when it is clear that it rejected that option as being totally impractical even if technically feasible?</p>
</speech>
<speech hansard_id="438856" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1986-10-30a.590.3" hansard_membership_id="8431" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/32853" speakername="Mr. MacKay" colnum="590" time="22:57:00">
<p>I was not present to hear the board's deliberations. It may not have been the only reason for rejecting option D, but if one is told that there are insuperable building difficulties, that must be a principal reason. One may not like what flows from that, but one does not pass that hurdle if advised that there are insuperable difficulties.<br/>
Both hon. Members told me that they would have preferred it if those insuperable difficulties and that position had remained. I understand that point, but we have reached the stage where it appears, from advice from the building division, that it would be possible to provide such facilities at Kirkcaldy. Both hon. Members have asked me why the new advice meant that the board's appraisal of the options had to be reconsidered. It is now clear that further development is feasible at that site, and the board and the department thought that it should be explored. The building division has produced a design solution for the Victoria site which is being considered by the board.<br/>
I have already stressed the importance of a proper appraisal of options when dealing with capital expenditure. If Fife health board had ignored the new evidence about building possibilities at Kirkcaldy, the basis of the decision-making process leading to the approval in principle submission for phase 2 of the west Fife district general hospital would have been substantially undermined and there could have been no confidence in the board's conclusion. The board was well aware of that. Hon. Members have not sought to introduce into the debate the conflicts between different areas in Fife, but that problem also existed and those who were keen on the Kirkcaldy solution became aware of the possibility of option D, which the board agreed to reconsider. It was not just a matter of the Scottish Home and Health Department delaying matters by telling the board that option D would require further investigation. The board itself first brought the revised development potential of the Victoria site to the attention of the Department.<br/>
The building division has produced a design solution for the site and comparative figures for the costs of the two options. I can confirm that the latest advice from the building division is that option D is unlikely to cost more in capital terms than option C. That is also contrary to what was originally believed. Indeed, when hon. Members


visited me they put that view to me. At the time, I thought that that might be the likely outcome, but that has not been the case. Indeed, option D may be cheaper.<br/>
Similarly, preliminary information from the health board is that the revenue costs of one option are unlikely to differ significantly from those for the other option. The service implications of option D as opposed to option C are less easy to assess, and I understand that the board is working on them at the moment. Therefore, it does not expect to make a fresh submission to the Department on phase 2 of the hospital before December this year. Of course, there is no longer a possibility that the board can apply to the Department requesting that option D should

be dropped on cost grounds. I informed the hon. Gentlemen of that possibility when I met them, but we know that it is no longer a possibility. That means that the board will have to make decisions about the merits of both schemes, if the financial aspects are equal.<br/>
I do not have time to deal with the cross-boundary flow. It is a factor, but it will not cause any delay &#x2014;<br/>
