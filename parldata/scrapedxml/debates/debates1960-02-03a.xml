<p>I have received a report from the Departmental Committee on Road Safety on the results of the experiment with a 40 miles-per-hour speed limit which has been in progress in the London Traffic Area since March, 1958. I am satisfied that the experiment has been a success and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland agrees with me that the powers to impose 40 miles-per-hour speed limits should now become available throughout the country. I propose, therefore, to make the report available to both Houses of Parliament and in the near future to make a commencement order which will be subject to affirmative Resolution and which will bring into force the relevant parts of Section 4 of the Road Traffic Act, 1956.</p>

<p>Has the right hon. Gentleman not had an opportunity since then of examining this point?

<p>I thank my hon. Friend for his reply; but, in view of the considerable waiting period at this centre at the moment, will he take urgent steps to bring the new centre into being?

<p>My visit to the Continent was primarily to see for myself the methods being adopted in Europe to utilise the latest techniques of bridge design and construction. The visit satisfied me that British design and construction match work being done elsewhere. It may not therefore be necessary to make radical changes in present arrangements but, to ensure that full advantage is taken of the latest ideas and techniques, I am continuing to study whether it is desirable to try out new arrangements experimentally. I intend in any case that the partnership between my Ministry, bridge designers and bridge builders should be made as close as possible.<br/>
In the United States I examined in several cities the methods being adopted to improve traffic flow and road safety. I received many new ideas which are now being examined.</p>

<p>On the first part of the hon. Member's supplementary question, it is difficult to compare costs in foreign countries with those in this country, because of the many variables, such as the rate of exchange, but we may be able to make slight economies. More than anything else, we might be able to add to the amenities. As for the second part of the supplementary question, toll roads in America are now being abandoned. They were successful largely because they were long roads in congested areas, with limited points of


access. Since this country is so much smaller there are more points of access. At places like bridges and tunnels tolls seem to be suitable all the world over, but opinion in America is against the provision of further main toll roads.</p>

<p>Lane discipline in America is better than it is here, but that is largely because American roads are marked accordingly. In the early days of the M.1 it was an appalling spectacle to see drivers going all over the road, but the latest reports show that lane discipline is being gradually assimilated by the drivers, and that they are beginning to observe the lane rules.</p>

<p>In view of the Minister's experience of American trunk roads, can he assure the House that there will be no question of building toll roads in this country, and no further consideration of the question of the imposition of tolls even at tunnels?

<p>Would not the Minister agree that if he is ultimately to solve this problem, he will have to consider very seriously a national plan for the coordination of transport; that, as a first step towards relieving the accident problem, he might very well consider the origination of heavy loads in the great conurbations and try to avoid some congestion; and that, if he showed more determination, he might eliminate some of the accidents?</p>

<p>This is a phenomenon which is happening all over the world.

May I ask why, in the first place, a deputation of responsible people was encouraged by him to travel 1,200 miles to meet him in the House of Commons to discuss the closure of branch railway lines in Scotland, after which the Minister proceeded to drive out two Members of the House who were accredited members of the deputation, furthermore to insult the deputation by saying that, whatever they said, it was useless to come here and say it and that he had nothing to do with it, and finally&#x2014;to quote words attributed to him by the members of that deputation&#x2014;to threaten that he would "never again receive a deputation of bloody Scots"?</p>

<p>If I may answer the final part of the supplementary question first, I did not use that phrase and I am sure that some hon. Members have evidence that I did not. In any case, I would not dare do it, because I have to attend an annual reunion of the London Scots in my kilt. They tend to be very boisterous, although rather agreeable, affairs and if reprisals were to set in I might lose my dignity.<br/>
In reply to the first part of the supplementary question, these people came at their own request. I tried to discourage them for this reason: they wanted to discuss the actual merits of closing down a branch line, but the legislation passed by Parliament gives me no power to do anything in the matter. Therefore, whatever they said to me I could not do anything but listen. I could not make a decision because it was not within my power so to do. But if by any chance they feel aggrieved, all I can say is that I am sorry about it.</p>

<p>On behalf of my right hon.

<p>I am prepared to consider the use of Bailey bridges wherever they prove suitable. In London such matters are the responsibility in the first place of the London County Council and the metropolitan borough concerned.<br/>

<p>No, Sir. Proposals to close lines are widely publicised and the Consultative Committee procedure permits full account to be taken of the value of a line to trade and industry. Any potential defence interest in a particular railway line affected is, of course, taken into account by the Government Departments concerned.</p>

<p>Where a railway is being closed, would not it be convenient to consider the significance of the Board of Trade trying at a later date to come to the help of a particular area, and trying to improve the economic amenities, when the Commission, having closed the railway, has done exactly the opposite to what the Board of Trade would be trying to do? May I give as an example the possibility of this happening to the Barnard Castle&#x2014;Penrith line?</p>

<p>Is the right hon. Gentleman aware that that is rather disappointing, because I had hoped for a further statement?

<p>With your permission, Mr. Speaker, and that of the House, I should like to make a statement concerning the Youth Service.<br/>
In November, 1958, my predecessor appointed a Committee uder the chairmanship of Lady Albemarle to review the contribution which the Youth Service of England and Wales can make in assisting young people to play their part in the life of the community, in the light of changing social and industrial conditions and of current trends in other branches of the education service. The Committee's Report has been published as a Command Paper today, and was available to hon. Members in the Vote Office this morning. It makes valuable and timely proposals for dealing with the changing needs of young people about which Parliament has shown that it is greatly concerned. On behalf of the Government, I should like to thank Lady Albemarle and her colleagues for the speed and excellence of the work they have done.<br/>
We accept in principle all the main recommendations for Government action.<br/>
The Youth Service today is an alliance, without adequate resources, between the Ministry of Education, the local education authorities and the voluntary youth organisations. We have, therefore, much to discuss with our partners before deciding precisely how to act on the Albemarle recommendations. The necessary discussions will take place urgently.<br/>
The Youth Service requires more voluntary and paid workers, more buildings and facilities for sport, more money and more enthusiasm. The Government have decided that these deficiencies must be made good, though everything cannot be done at once, and the will to succeed must come from the local areas at least as much as from the centre.<br/>
The following are the important steps that we shall take.<br/>
The Committee recommended that the present strength of 700 full-time youth leaders should be increased to 1,300 by 1966. The Government will finance most of this expansion in training facilities by Exchequer grant, and I hope that an emergency training college will be open by 1st January, 1961.<br/>
The recruitment of leaders will turn on the salaries offered and the opportunities for transfer to other careers after a period in the Service. I shall ask the interested parties to examine with me how we can carry out the Committee's recommendation on this matter.<br/>
The need for new buildings is urgent and in the next two years "starts" will be authorised for building by the local authorities and voluntary organisations up to &#x00A3;3 million. Grants to voluntary projects will be increased. Much of the accommodation used by the Youth Service today is shared with other forms of educational activity; given proper design and planning this can be a considerable advantage and will be encouraged.<br/>
Turning to current finance, grants will be increased for the headquarters' expenditure of the voluntary organisations and also for approved experiments in attracting young people now not using the Youth Service. Some organisations will get larger grants, others will receive grants for the first time.<br/>
The Committee recommended that a Youth Service Development Council should be appointed of about twelve persons chosen for their special qualities and experience. A Council of this nature will have to work very closely with the Minister, if only because the job to be done is urgent and largely experimental. To begin with, the work will be most easily planned and executed if I take the chair of this Council myself.<br/>
The Government believe that as these proposals are translated into action enthusiasm for the Service will grow. We look forward to full co-operation with the local education authorities and believe that volunteers and voluntary funds will increase on a scale that will &#x00E9;nsure the success of the drive for expansion.</p>

<p>I should like to join with the Minister in thanking Lady Albemarle and her colleagues for providing us with a most valuable document. May I add the regret which we on this side of the House feel that Mr. Denis Howell, who served on that Committee, is no longer a Member of the House.<br/>
The Report is welcome because it bears a marked resemblance to the proposals made in our own policy statements. I am glad that the Minister has accepted in principle the main recommendations. But does he seriously believe that we shall get the full effect of this Report if the Government persist in a high-interest-rate policy and with the block grant, or does he also accept the recommendation in paragraph 317 of the Albemarle Committee's Report that additional general grants or separate percentage grants should be made available to local education authorities?<br/>
When may we expect a detailed statement about the salaries and conditions of youth leaders, when is the Development Council to start work and what steps is the Minister taking to persuade local education authorities to review urgently their further education schemes? Will he consider the possibility of allotting a day, or perhaps two days, for a debate in which we could discuss this Report and the Crowther Report together?</p>

<p>The block grant is about to be considered for the next period, and what the local authorities are ready to spend for the Youth Service will be counted in the calculation. It is because I do not know precisely what local authorities will be ready to do that I cannot today give the House an estimate of the costs. We will get on with the question of salaries as quickly as we can, but we have to have a body with which to negotiate. I hope that it will not be long before such a body comes forward.<br/>
I have not yet been able to consult the local education authorities, because the Report was published only this morning, but I assure the hon. Member that we shall lose no time in talking to them about the expansion which they are willing to undertake.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman asked whether we could have a debate on this and the Crowther Report together. I should

like to consider that request. I will discuss it with the Leader of the House.</p>

<p>Does the Minister's statement apply only to England and Wales, or does it apply only to the United Kingdom?

<p>The right hon. Gentleman is casting himself in the r&#x00F4;le of a youth leader. In view of comments in the Report on the acute depression in the Youth Service and the need for an urgent blood transfusion, will the Minister say what he and his predecessors have been doing for the last eight-and-a-half years? Does he accept the recommendation that the age range for the Youth Service should be 14 to 20 which, with other factors, will increase the number of young people to be taken into the service by no less than 46 per cent. in the next few years? Does he propose to raise the limits on capital expenditure, which, at present, are imposed by regulations under the Acts of 1937 and 1939?</p>

<p>We propose to accept the recommendation that the age range should be 14 to 20. The question of the capital limit is one of the things which


we shall look at sympathetically directly we get the Council going. I can assure the hon. Lady that we intend to do better in the future than we have ever done before.</p>

<p>We all welcome the Report, but does the Minister think that &#x00A3;3 million will be sufficient for the building programme, especially as many areas have done very little for the new service? Cannot places for the training of youth leaders be provided more quickly so that recruitment can take place much faster than is at present proposed?<br/>
There is also the relationship of building for the Youth Service and local authority building. As the right hon. Gentleman knows, in my own area we have added wings to many of our modern secondary schools, but if the school building programme is cut back it will also affect the youth programme. Can the Minister say to what extent he will give local authorities more power to add these buildings to their larger secondary moderns, and thereby speed up the programme?</p>

<p>The &#x00A3;3 million "starts" in the next two years is, of course, an estimate. It will not be very easy to get many of the projects started in, say, the next six months. It takes time to plan. We will just have to see how we go along. I agree with the hon. Lady for Stoke-on-Trent, North (Mrs. Slater) that playing fields, for instance, attached to a secondary school can be a great help. As to the training of leaders, I think that we have already found a suitable place where a new college can start, but, of course, there will be more places in our ordinary teacher-training colleges for those taking these courses.</p>

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. I beg to give notice that in view of the unsatisfactory Answer given by the Minister, in which he was unable to say in what way similar proposals will apply to Scotland, I shall raise the question of a Scottish statement on the Adjournment at the earliest possible moment.</p>

<p>In the opinion of many of us, a great factor in the improvement of the Youth Service is leaders of the right quality, and that it is much more a matter of quality than of quantity. Is the right hon. Gentleman aware that the best way to get leaders of the right quality is to Make their salaries equate more closely to the Burnham scale for teachers? Is he further aware that, if these were financed by way of general grant, the Youth Service in congested urban industrial areas will be penalised as against the service in more prosperous areas? Would he look again at the question of a percentage grant?</p>

<p>I feel confident that when the Committee considers salaries it will take into account the Burnham scale, but as we have not yet got a negotiating body we shall have to wait to see what is done. I am confident that the general grant system, provided that the local authorities are enthusiastic for the Youth Service, as I really believe they are, will prove quite all right.</p>

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. At the beginning of the consideration stage of the Bill, I should like to raise a point of order of which I have given you notice by letter. It refers to the Amendment to Clause 1, in page 2, line 37, to leave out:
<q>or, if so authorised, compulsorily;</q>
standing in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Sunderland, South (Mr. P. Williams) and in my name.<br/>
According to Erskine May, there are various points during the consideration of a Bill and, after that, before Third Reading, when your predecessors have ruled that the House may again be put into Committee to deal with specific Amendments. In page 575 of Erskine May we read:
<q>A motion by an unofficial Member to recommit a government bill in respect of certain amendments at the beginning of the consideration stage has been accepted in respect of one amendment only by the Speaker&#x2026;</q>
To that passage there is a footnote (<i>t</i>), which refers one to Volume 503 of the OFFICIAL REPORT. The OFFICIAL REPORT records that on 15th July, 1952, the right hon. Member for Colne Valley (Mr. Glenvil Hall), after the reading of the Order for consideration of the amended Pensions (Increase) Bill, was permitted by Mr. Speaker to put the House back into Committee for the consideration of a specific Amendment. May I ask you, Mr. Speaker, whether you will carry out that precedent on this occasion in respect of the Amendment to which I refer?</p>
</speech>

<p>I am much obliged to the noble Lord the Member for Dorset, South (Viscount Hinchingbrooke) for giving me notice of this point. For various reasons, I have sympathy with his complaint, and I should like to allow him to do this if I thought that I properly could. The difficulty is that I have to look at the precedent to which he referred me. That was a case in which the right hon. Gentleman the Member

for Colne Valley (Mr. Glenvil Hall) had given notice of his recommittal Motion, and did it on the first opportunity for recommitting the Bill.<br/>
It does not help me very much in these circumstances because, of course, the noble Lord, in common with other hon. Members, had the opportunity, of which other hon. Members did avail themselves, to put down Amendments which were to be involved in the recommittal Motion of yesterday. It is clearly in the interest of the House that as regards unofficial Members' Motions there should be some finality in these matters.<br/>
There is another difficulty. The noble Lord will appreciate that, although he very courteously gave me notice, that did not involve notice to the House. What he is asking me to do is now to recommit the Bill in respect of his Amendment without notice to the House having been given at all. In those circumstances. I cannot feel it right to accede to his request.</p>

<p>I am much obliged to you, Mr. Speaker, for your view on the matter. To save, perhaps, an unnecessary further exercise, could I ask you whether, in respect of another occasion when another such Motion in respect of a Clause was made at the conclusion of the consideration stage by an unofficial Member, when Mr. Speaker refused it, you would feel bound to accept your predecessor's Ruling on that, and rule me out of order if, at the conclusion of the consideration stage, I sought&#x2014;with proper notice on the Order Paper this time&#x2014;to raise it?</p>

<p>I should, obviously, in principle, although I must confess that from the particular precedent to which the noble Lord now refers I do not derive much guidance, because HANSARD does not say what the proposed Amendment was in respect of which recommittal was asked.

<p>I beg to move, in page 1, line 9, to leave out from "exercisable" to end of line 12 and to insert:
<q>with due regard to the proper diversification of industry, for the purpose of providing for the benefit of any development district employment appropriate (having regard to the circumstances of the district generally and of any particular description of persons therein) to the needs of the district.</q>
<q>(2) In this Act 'development district' means".</q>
The purpose of the Amendment is to meet three separate points made by the

Opposition in Committee. I think that I should apologise to the House for the fact that the Amendment is starred, but we had to change it at the last moment. The Amendment as it originally stood on the Notice Paper referred to providing employment in any development district. We have changed that to the words:
<q>providing for the benefit of any development district.</q>
A factory might be provided outside a district, but yet give employment within the district. I am sure that the House will approve of the change.<br/>
The three points we are trying to meet in the Amendment are these. The first is the question of diversification. Many hon. Members spoke about that in Committee and argued that there will be required within development districts not merely the provision of employment, but the provision of what is likely to be lasting employment. They argued that it was, therefore, a mistake to provide in an area highly dependent on one industry further employment in that industry. I accept that as a valid argument. The Amendment places on the Board of Trade a duty, while providing employment in these areas, to have regard to the fact that the employment provided should, so far as possible, contribute to the diversification of industry and, therefore, contribute to the likely lasting quality of the employment provided.<br/>
The second point we are meeting is contained in the words in brackets:
<q>having regard to the circumstances of the district generally and of any particular description of persons therein".</q>
In Committee, there was much reference to the position of particular categories of people, for example the disabled. It was argued that we should make special provision in the Bill so that the Board of Trade had a clear duty to take account not merely of the number of people unemployed in any given district, but also whether that number contained for example a high percentage of disabled. We certainly accept that obligation, which we thought was inherent in the original wording. However, I accept that there is a need to make it more clear.<br/>
At the same time, I argued, and will continue to argue, that it would be a mistake to enumerate particular categories.


Most of the discussion at an earlier stage was about the disabled. In recent weeks I have received deputations, particularly from some of the districts in Scotland, who stressed the special difficulty of school leavers, for example. We should have them much in mind. It would be a pity to select one or two categories. If such a selection is made in a Statute, it inevitably implies the exclusion of other categories which may be in practice equally deserving. Therefore, we have hit on this form of words:
<q>any particular description of persons therein.</q>
In ordinary, non-statutory English that means that when looking at the situation in any area or district we must look not only at the number of people unemployed, but also whether for example there is a high percentage of disabled; whether there is a high percentage of school leavers; and&#x2014;which is another important point which has cropped up in one or two examples I have seen recently&#x2014; whether there are more men than women unemployed. All those factors are most important. The words we now propose lay a clear duty upon us to have regard in every case not merely to the number of people unemployed, either present or prospective, but also to the nature or type of people who will be unemployed. I hope that that meets, as I believe it must, the point of view expressed from the other side at an early stage.<br/>
Finally, there is the question of the name to be given to these areas or districts. In the original Bill we talked about "unemployment localities". It was argued very forcibly from the other side that that was a bad phrase, and I accept the argument. The reason why it is bad is the reason advanced by the right hon. Member for Battersea, North (Mr. Jay), that it is a negative concept. The right hon. Gentleman argued that we should have a positive concept and should, therefore, retain the word "development" which was in the original legislation. I accept that we should think of these areas not in terms of unemployment, but in terms of development. We have done so. But I do not think that it would be right to go back to the original words "development area", for two reasons.<br/>
First, in the Bill we are endeavouring to change the concept upon which this

legislation is based. We are moving away from the original idea of certain areas specified by Parliament where there are special problems to the concept of a general duty on the Government to aid any locality where certain conditions obtain. Therefore, I think that there is an advantage in marking the break with the old system by getting away from the old phrase "development area".<br/>
The second reason why I do not think we should return to the words "development area" is a strong one. "Area" implies on the whole rather a large area. I agree that there is a particular exception to which the right hon. Gentleman can refer; but while we argue, as we have done throughout the Bill, that our powers should cover both small places and large areas, "district" is more appropriate. It can be applied to areas as big as an existing Development Area and to places as small as a single town on the existing D.A.T.A.C. list.<br/>
That, not any particular wish on my part to be obstinate, is the reason why I cannot accept "development area", but why after a good deal of thought about it I have put forward the words "development district", which, I think, are consistent with the purposes of the Bill and also the major point of the party opposite, namely, that we should think in terms of development and not in terms of unemployment.<br/>
The Amendment meets the three points made by the Opposition, first, the question of diversification within the areas concerned; secondly, the point of having regard not merely to the number of unemployed, but also to the type of people who are unemployed; and, thirdly, the psychological point about the description of the places concerned. I hope that as we are trying to meet the points made by the Opposition the Amendment will commend itself to the House.</p>

<p>I intended to make a brief comment on what the right hon. Gentleman said, Mr. Speaker.


As the right hon. Gentleman observed, he has attempted to meet us on three separate points and he has gone a long way to do so. I thank him for the effort he has made. He has introduced into the Bill the concept of the proper diversification of industry for the purpose of defining areas within which help is to be given. I will not say anything about that now, because we have an Amendment to the new form of words and it will be more logical to discuss that point on that Amendment.<br/>
Secondly, the right hon. Gentleman has introduced the words:
<q>having regard to the circumstances of the district generally and of any particular description of persons therein</q>
which appear in brackets in the Amendment, to meet the point that there are classes of workers, such as disabled persons, whom it is highly desirable to help in certain of these parts of the country. So far as I am able to judge, this form of words will enable the right hon. Gentleman to pay attention to disabled workers and to the possible problem of women workers and to other circumstances of that kind which may arise, and we hope that he will do so.<br/>
Thirdly, he has attempted to meet us by introducing the words "development district". I think that he has not been so successful in this case. I agree that the phrase is a great improvement on "unemployment localities", which appeared to be likely to be the name of these parts of the country. However, it is a great pity that, having gone so far, he has not gone the whole way and adopted the recognised term, "development area".<br/>
I agree that this is not a major argument. It is an argument about words, but there is some small substance in it. I think that the right hon. Gentleman will agree that it was one of the improvements of the 1945 legislation that we got away from the old terms, "depressed areas" and "distressed areas", which were discouraging to industry. Even though it was only a matter of words, there was undoubtedly something in it To continue the idea of Development Areas helped.<br/>
It now seems to us to be a pity to fall back in this way. He has met us to the extent of introducing the word

"development". It is a great pity that he should not go the whole way and adopt the now long-accepted phrase, "Development Area", which is familiar in these parts of the country and which, incidentally, is more easily pronounceable and, therefore, more likely to be used than is the phrase, "unemployment areas", which we did not want to have.<br/>
The Minister's reasons for not adopting the word "area" were unconvincing. He said that the Bill had a concept different from that of the 1945 Act, but he said that only because he seemed to have the wrong idea of what the 1945 concept was. It was never intended that these should be fixed, permanent areas. Machinery was provided for altering them. I know that the present Government did not do so, which we regret, but it would have been possible to have frequently alterable areas under the 1945 legislation.<br/>
Nor is there any substance in the argument that the word "district" applies to a smaller locality&#x2014;or whatever word is used&#x2014;or to a smaller part of the country than the word "area". I should have thought that either word could have been as easily applied to Pembroke, which was a Development Area, or to any other area which the right hon. Gentleman might have had in mind. We do not place great emphasis on this matter, but I think that the right hon. Gentleman is rather spoiling the ship for a ha'porth of tar. If he had stuck to "Development Areas", he would have made a cleaner job and I hope that in the remainnig stages of the Bill he will give this matter further thought.</p>

<p>I am grateful for the Minister's response to points which we put forward in Committee. He has seen his way to meeting us on a number of issues, especially about groups of persons covered by the words which appear in brackets.<br/>
Having made provision to meet the needs of those areas where there is a high percentage of disabled persons, for example, will the right hon. Gentleman say how he proposes to implement his Amendent? Does he intend to rely on a fresh application of the Grenfell

principles of renting factories, or on an expansion of the work of Remploy? It is very important that we should know that. Remploy has failed to satisfy the requirements of those areas and its expansion has been limited to 6,000 instead of 12,000 personnel, as was the original intention.<br/>
In Wales, there is only one Grenfell factory now operating on Grenfell terms and it is very important to know the Minister's intentions about implementing his Amendment.</p>

<p>As it stands, the wording of the Amendment includes
<q>circumstances of the district generally and of any particular description of persons therein.</q>
Would that wording enable the Board of Trade to take cognisance of the circumstances in some ports?<br/>
For example, in my constituency and in Cardiff there may from time to time be many dock workers who are unemployed, but who, for one reason or another, will not technically be included in the general register of unemployed. There may be men who, for one reason or another, are not working at the home port but are working, let us say, at docks elsewhere to which they are conveyed under arrangements which have applied for some time.<br/>
Will this wording enable the Board of Trade to take into account circumstances like that, which are of importance, I imagine, in many ports in the country?</p>

<p>There is room for confusion in the minds of many people if we call a particular area, designated at this stage under the Bill a "district", because there are the already well-known district council areas. A district designated according to these provisions might pass right through the middle of a district council's area. Members of the district council and the community generally there might be under the impression that the whole of their area was designated under the Bill. I think that such confusion could be dangerous, and that it would really be better to go back to the former description.</p>

<p>This seems to be the opportunity for saying a little more about what we have in


mind. I hope that we shall learn from our experience since 1945 in dealing with the vexed problem of providing for the disabled.<br/>
In areas such as that with which I am concerned, and many others, where heavy industry is the principal source of employment, there are people who have been disabled in industry, but there are, also, those who have been disabled in war service, people registered with the Ministry of Labour on the disabled persons list. They really need special treatment and, for that purpose, Parliament has developed the scheme which we all know as the Remploy factory scheme.<br/>
Some years ago, the Government stopped building any new Remploy factories. I think that there has not been one built for many years. Will the President of the Board of Trade now consider, with the Ministry of Labour and other appropriate Departments, including the Treasury, whether it is now time to remove that ban? They said at the time that the ban had been imposed because money was scarce, and so forth. In these days, it seems that money is, perhaps, not quite so tight.<br/>
We are here concerned with very many men who have been disabled in industry or in the Services and who are capable of work, but their work must be special work. Quite frankly, it is work which we cannot provide as a commercial venture. We must admit that. It is a public service of immense importance. Very often, such men are in their middle years, 40 or 45 years of age, and we ought not to let them eat out their hearts in idleness when they are still capable of rendering great service although that service is not something which can be treated simply on a commercial basis.<br/>
Beyond that, there is the vexed problem of pneumoconiosis, silicosis and other lung diseases. It was my privilege to be Minister of National Insurance and introduce certain changes in the scheme, but the fact is that now, by our present methods, we are seeking to identify pneumoconiosis before it reaches the very disabling stage and bring the men out. That is by far the best way.<br/>
The problem is not quite the same now as it was ten years ago when we adopted what was known as the Grenfell factory scheme. As the House knows,

Sir Stafford Cripps set up a Committee to examine what could be done to make special provision for persons disabled by this dreadful disease. The Committee was presided over by our friend David Grenfell and became known as the Grenfell Committee. It recommended that several factories&#x2014;I think the number was 10&#x2014;should be established in various parts of the country to make special provision in this respect quite apart from factories which were to be built to deal with the general problem of unemployment in the Development Areas. The purpose was to provide suitable employment for men disabled by pneumoconiosis. As I remember it, the Grenfell factories were to be run under the general condition that at least 50 per cent. of those employed in them should be persons disabled by pneumoconiosis.<br/>
I hope that the President of the Board of Trade will look at the matter again and consult with the Minister of Power and the National Coal Board to see what should be done now. It is becoming recognised in the coalfields generally that we are entering an age when smaller pits are going out and bigger pits are coming in. As an ex-miner with practical experience of how these things work, I can see what is happening. It will become more difficult to employ as many disabled men in the fewer large pits than it was in the many small pits. The mining industry has a tradition in this matter. Even many of the coal owners themselves behaved in exemplary fashion in providing special treatment for the disabled. Indeed, customs grew up whereby certain jobs were always absolutely reserved, by tradition, for these men.<br/>
There will be a new problem now in coal mining and in industry generally. When a pit or a works closes, the disabled men have no chance of going elsewhere and they lose their jobs. Secondly, though I do not want to mention them as a special category, there are the men of about 50 years of age who lose their jobs. All these things call for a fresh approach.<br/>
4.15 p.m.<br/>
I am sure that the remedy is to secure adequate diversification. This is all part of the trouble created by so many areas being dependent upon one industry, very often a heavy industry. For my part, I


do not want to see too great an expansion of special factories for special categories. Such a scheme has advantages, but it has great disadvantages, too. Disabled people should not all be congregated in the same place. It is better for them psychologically to have work in factories or workshops where they are thought of, and where they think of themselves, as normal people.<br/>
We tried the experiment. It was worth trying, and the arrangements still continue. I should not want to dismiss them as something which we ought not to do. There are, of course, the severely disabled for whom we must provide Remploy factories and, inevitably, they will be people seriously disabled. Beyond that, however, we should try to provide work for the disabled where they can think of themselves as fellow-workers and not a special class.<br/>
I am glad that the President of the Board of Trade has added these words. They are rather legalistic words, but the message we must send by them is that we regard people who have been disabled in the service of the country, in industry or in war, as people towards whom we have a special obligation. It should be our desire to see that they are provided for in such a way that they can take their place in industry and society as fellow-workers and citizens with everyone else, not recipients of charity. They should be given a full opportunity to serve their country even though they are disabled.</p>

<p>Although the President of the Board of Trade seems to have gone some way to meet many of the arguments advanced in Committee, he has not really gone very far. He would have gone much further if he had put the words not at line 9, but at the point where they would have become the purposes for which the powers could be used. All this means at the moment, of course, is that, in dealing with severe unemployment, consideration must be had to these facts. That is quite desirable, but I should have thought that the Board of Trade would do that in any case.<br/>
In previous debates, a great deal of the argument was directed to whether the powers contained in Clause 1 of the Bill should he used for purposes concerning districts which were not covered by the

words "high rate of unemployment". This is particularly relevant in the matter being debated here, namely, the position of disabled men. It is quite possible not to have a high rate of unemployment but to have a hard core of unemployed consisting mainly of disabled men.<br/>
I know of mining villages around Edinburgh where, when I was on the local employment committee, there was always a number of disabled men unemployed. The overall rate of unemployment was not high. In those circumstances, nothing could he done about that under the Amendment. That is why I cannot help feeling that the right hon. Gentleman would have done something much more effective by inserting these words later in the Bill.<br/>
I should like to say something about the use of the word "district". I think that the point was made that the use of the word "district" in Scotland in connection with district councils might lead to some confusion. I imagine that the only real reason why the right hon. Gentleman does not want to use the word "area" is that he wants a change from the previous Acts so that his great fraud which is being put over in the country, that the Government are doing something entirely new, can be carried through and that, therefore, to enable them to carry it through, he wants different terminology. I cannot see any other reason for the use of the word "district". I listened to the right hon. Gentleman, but I am bound to say that his reasons why the word "district" should be used instead of "area" were rather thin.</p>

<p>By leave of the House, I should like to reply to the points which have been raised on this Amendment. Hon. Members opposite have referred to the position of the disabled. I hope that I shall not appear to be unduly narrow in my outlook if I say that we must confine ourselves to what the Bill does. I will certainly undertake to keep in very close touch with my right hon. Friend the Minister of Labour on the question of the employment of disabled people.<br/>
My right hon. Friend has the main responsibility for the provision of employment of a special kind for the disabled. In the Bill, we are dealing with a very specific point, namely, the powers of the Board of Trade under Part I of


the Bill, and the Amendment makes it clear that, in exercising those powers, we must bear in mind the possibility of a large proportion of disabled or people suffering from pneumoconiosis in a particular area. We could not go further. We cannot go beyond the purposes of the Bill in any Amendment.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Barry (Mr. Gower) made a point about employment in the ports. I can only say that the basis on which we must work is the registered number of unemployed in any employment exchange area. I do not think that there is any other basis on which we can work, but in looking at the number of people registered as unemployed we shall have regard to all the circumstances of the district&#x2014;seasonality of unemployment and whether there is a large proportion of women and disabled people, and so on.<br/>
Finally, another point which was made concerned the word "district". I see the point that there might be confusion about the word "district", but I still think that it is the best word. "District" connotes something smaller than an area. One can think of urban districts or rural districts which are fairly small places, whereas the area of an electricity board may be large. This is the best solution which I can find. I am sorry that the hon. Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis) does not think that I have given sufficiently good reasons for the use of the word, but I have told the House in my own words why I suggested it, and I cannot add to what I have said.</p>

<p>I want to add a few words to this very important discussion. In mining areas. which will be particularly affected by the powers under the Bill, there is a large proportion of disabled men who have found employment on the surface. I fully appreciate, as my right hon. Friend said just now, that the Bill deals with the powers of the Board of Trade, but that is the difficulty. Whenever we discuss these problems we are always given some reason why the people about whom we are speaking should not be adequately protected.<br/>
I know that I cannot deal with the problem of small fixed income groups, but, of course, disabled people come

within that category. The argument which is always used is that it is so difficult to find ways and means of helping them, and that I understand. As I have said before, this problem vitally affects mining areas, perhaps more than any other industrial centres. There is a vast number of them, and they have always been a very great problem.<br/>
I was grateful for the sympathetic words of my right hon. Friend. However, sympathy is not all that we want. I hope that this very genuine point will be watched. When, as I hope, I catch your eye, Mr. Speaker, on Third Reading I shall be able to discuss the powers of the Treasury, because I see that that Department is mentioned in the Bill, and I shall want to know which Minister we shall be able to question, and so on.<br/>
Many people who do not come from mining areas have no idea of the problem of disabled people in those areas. It is only people who know about these problems who can talk with authority. I can talk with very little authority, but I belong to my area and I know the problems which we have had in trying to find employment for men who have been disabled in the course of their duties, perhaps, underground.<br/>
I am grateful for my right hon. Friend's sympathetic words, but to my mind they are not quite enough, and I shall look forward to something more.

<p>I beg to move, as an Amendment to the proposed Amendment, after "proper", to insert "distribution and".<br/>
The purpose of this Amendment to the Minister's proposed Amendment is to insert the words "distribution and" in addition to the words "diversification of industry" in the definition of the areas which are to be assisted. It may appear to be a very small verbal point and that as the word "diversification" has been included there is nothing further to be added by inserting the words "distribution and". I do not think, however, that this is so.<br/>
The 1945 Act included the words "proper distribution of industry" for the purpose of selecting areas for positive assistance, and it does not seem to


us that, with the words "diversification of industry", this Clause will be wide enough, although no doubt it would be wider if the words "distribution of industry" were included. We are grateful to the Minister for the word "diversification", which is a great improvement.<br/>
As the Bill was originally introduced, we had the anomolous position that, under Clause 18, the balanced distribution of industry for the purpose of granting or not granting an industrial development certificate in areas which it was considered should be restrained from developing was taken into account, but the balanced distribution or diversification of industry in areas which one wanted to help could not be taken into account.<br/>
All that could be taken into account was the actual existence of unemployment or the imminence of unemployment. We have certainly moved much further than that, in that an area which might be threatened with unemployment but had not yet experienced it could be considered because it was a one-industry area or, indeed, a one-firm town.<br/>
There are two reasons why I should like to ask the right hon. Gentleman to consider introducing the words "distribution and". In the first place, he himself said during the Committee stage, when he agreed to consider a concession in this matter, that
<q>&#x2026; we must have regard to the distribution and diversification of industry."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 1st December, 1959; Vol. 614. c. 1131.]</q>
The words which we propose to insert are precisely the words which he used during the debate in Committee.<br/>
4.30 p.m.<br/>
If the right hon. Gentleman asks, as reasonably he might, in what possible sense the addition of "distribution" could add anything to diversification, I would give two answers. Under the 1945 Act conception&#x2014;it was inserted, incidentally, in the Financial and Explanatory Memorandum at the beginning and I have quoted the words before&#x2014;in both parts of the operation, the restraint, on the one hand, and the stimulation, on the other hand, one took into account the whole distribution of industry over an area and over the country as a whole. That would enable one to consider

strategic questions as well as pure questions of employment and diversification.<br/>
Quite apart from economic grounds, it might well be argued on strategic grounds that it was undesirable to have a high proportion of the production of a key product like, for example, ball bearings too concentrated in one area. I am not saying that this is any more or less important today, but there is no doubt that with the adoption of the word "distribution", that could be taken into account for the purpose of exercising these powers, whereas that could not be done by relying solely on the diversification provision.<br/>
There is, however, a second reason which at present, perhaps, is even more powerful. We are all considering the future of the motor industry and the location of its expansion plan. It could reasonably be argued that if the motor industry is to be one of our great exporting industries over the next five years, not merely is it undesirable to have it all concentrated in Dagenham, Luton or Birmingham, but it is positively desirable that there should be motor car production in Scotland, in the North East Coast, indeed, and in Merseyside, and so on. I know that the hon. Lady the Member the Tynemouth (Dame Irene Ward) would put an eloquent case for part of the motor car industry to go to the North East Coast whether or not she was in order in proposing it.<br/>
Suppose that we have simply the word "diversification" and that it was proposed to put motor car production at Tynemouth. The President of the Board of Trade would have to show that in Tynemouth, or, at least, on North Tyneside, there was such an undue concentration of shipbuilding employment that there had to be diversification. He could not argue that it was desirable that the motor car industry should be not merely in Wales, Scotland and Merseyside, but should also be in the North East Coast. This could be a relevant consideration.<br/>
I am not saying to the right hon. Gentleman that he should do this, that or the other with the motor car industry, but simply that if he adds these words there is no doubt that the powers would be wider and the wider considerations could be taken into account. That is what we have in mind and I hope that he will not turn down the Amendment out of hand.</p>

<p>The wording of the Amendment relates to a fundamental difference of opinion between the two sides of the House. Whether, in practice, that difference of principle would produce very different results in individual cases of development, I am not convinced. Certainly, there is a great difference of outlook between the two sides on this matter.<br/>
The right hon. Member for Battersea. North (Mr. Jay) was speaking of what could be called a proper development of, for example, the motor industry, which we should try to seek both by negative and by positive powers to impose upon that industry. I simply do not accept that. I do not believe that such a thing could be devised. I do not know what the proper development of the motor industry is. I think that the best development <i>a priori</i> is the most economic development in the place in which manufacturers can make their cars more cheaply and sell them competitively.<br/>
As the Bill is designed, we must make some qualifications. These are twofold. First, we must prevent a growing concentration of industry in certain areas. That is the purpose of the later Clauses concerning I.D.C.s, in which distribution is referred to. I agree that I.D.C.s are, rightly, used to prevent the competitive planning of industry leading to a maldistribution of the kind which one has in mind.<br/>
Secondly, one has a duty to provide inducements to get an expanding industry, such as the motor industry, to go into special areas where there is a social problem because of a high rate of unemployment. To tell that industry to go to an area which is contrary to its own interests is, however, fundamentally wrong. I could not accept the Amendment, because it is not something at which we should try to aim.</p>

<p>Surely, in the right hon. Gentleman's Amendment, which we now seek to amend, we are dealing not with the purpose of the Bill or with the first six Clauses, but with the matters to which the right hon. Gentleman will have regard in giving effect to the purposes of the Bill. Does he now say that he does not think it right and proper that he, as President of the Board of Trade, should

have regard to the proper distribution of industry?</p>

<p>I was saying that "proper distribution of industry" may well be a meaningless phrase unless we analyse what is meant. The purpose of the Bill is to interfere quite deliberately with the workings of private enterprise. It is the purpose of the Bill to compel highly competitive enterprises, which often are big contributors to our export trade, to set up in areas where their costs of production are higher than in the place to which they would wish to go. That can be the only purpose of the Bill. If such enterprises would go to the North East Coast, to Merseyside, and so on, without inducements and compulsion, we should not need the Bill. The only reason why manufacturers want to go to Birmingham and the South is because it is economically more suitable to them.<br/>
We understand the purpose of the Bill to be twofold: first, to continue and strengthen the powers, to which the party opposite attaches much importance, to prevent a further expansion of industry in the areas where there is already great congestion. That is the purpose of the I.D.C.s, which we are using with a certain amount of effect.<br/>
The second purpose of the Bill is to provide at the expense of the Treasury inducements to those companies which cannot expand in the areas of their choice, to go to particular selected parts of the rest of the country. The question is: on what criterion shall we select those other parts of the country to which inducements should apply? My argument is that that criterion should be the social needs of unemployment areas and not the vague concept of a proper distribution of industry.<br/>
We are arguing about doctrine rather than about practical effects. As I have said time and time again, let us judge the Bill by its effects. As the motor industry has been mentioned, perhaps we will judge the effects of Government policy over the next few weeks by the number of new jobs created in the unemployment areas, which is what we are aiming at. I cannot accept the Amendment, because, although I do not think it would have practical effect, it would be quite contrary to the principle which we are trying to operate.</p>

<p>I do not wish to get involved in doctrine, but does the right hon. Gentleman not realise the fallacy in his argument? There might well be an instance&#x2014;probably there is one now&#x2014; when, as between two areas in, say, Wales and Scotland, to which he might wish expansion of the motor industry to go, there might be no difference whatever in costs. Between many areas there is often no difference in costs.<br/>
There might be some other quite different reasons why it might be undesirable that all the expansion should be concentrated in, for example, Wales. If that were so, undoubtedly it would be reasonable to say that "proper distribution" would cover such a case. If the right hon. Gentleman realised that the effects are as I have suggested, he would recognise that this is a practical point.</p>

<p>The first duty is to stop people setting up in crowded areas. The second point is how we should spend Government money to induce people to go to certain areas, and to which areas they should go. We say that they should be induced to go to areas where there is severe unemployment, not where severe unemployment does not exist and where there may be some theoretical basis of need for what is called distribution of industry.</p>

<p>I am not sure that I find very much to quarrel with in what the right hon. Gentleman has said, but I do not understand why what he said caused him to reject the Amendment. It seems to me that from time to time he forgets that this is an enabling Bill. Everything under it, generally speaking, is left to the Board of Trade. Much may be done or little may be done. All that we are seeking to do is to add something which the right hon. Gentleman should take into account when he is making decisions about these "development districts". This phrase, of course, came up when this matter was discussed in Committee.<br/>
It was in the course of those discussions that the right hon. Gentleman used the words to which my right hon. Friend the Member for Battersea, North (Mr. Jay) referred just now. I do not think that my right hon. Friend quoted the right hon. Gentleman in full, and I propose to do so, because it seems to me&#x2014;and I trust that the right hon. Gentleman will agree&#x2014;that Government pledges given in this way should be carried out fully. The right holt. Gentleman said:
<q>&#x2026; but I would be prepared to consider inserting an Amendment at a later stage in Clause 1, that would make it quite clear that, in carrying out the duties of the Board of Trade under the Bill in areas to which the Bill refers, we must have regard to the distribution and diversification of industry."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 1st December, 1959; Vol. 614, c. 1131.]</q>

<p>If the right hon. Gentleman would let me finish what I have to say, I will give way to him in a minute.<br/>
This, presumably, is the Amendment. If it is not the Amendment, that is a different state of affairs altogether. Then, perhaps, the right hon. Gentleman will tell us why he has changed his mind. I want to know from him why is it, when diversification and distribution had been under discussion for some considerable time, and he deliberately chose those two words himself, one of them but not the other appears in his Amendment.</p>

<p>I think that the hon. and learned Gentleman has not read carefully enough the words from me which he quoted. I was talking about what happens in a district and the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Battersea, North (Mr. Jay) was speaking of distribution between districts If the purpose of the Amendment is to have distribution in a district, I do not know what is the difference between that and diversification. The whole burden of the right hon. Gentleman's argument was the need to distribute industry between different districts of unemployment. That is what I resist.<br/>
Because the Amendment appears to mean that&#x2014;and was taken by the right hon. Gentleman himself to mean that&#x2014;I


cannot accept it. Distribution in a district, if it means anything at all, appears to me to mean the same as diversification. Distribution between districts is the thing that I cannot accept. What I have been saying this afternoon, the hon. and learned Gentleman will find, is completely consistent with what I said in Committee.</p>

<p>I beg to differ from the right hon. Gentleman. He is now saying that it is impossible to relate the words "distribution of industry" to something within the areas. The only defence that he can put forward comes to this, that when he was speaking in Committee the words used were quite meaningless. He said:
<q>&#x2026; in areas to which the Bill refers, we must have regard to the distribution and diversification of industry.</q>
I do not find that a difficult phrase to understand. It seems to me to be quite capable of meaning and I accepted at the time what the right hon. Gentleman said, but when the Amendment appeared on the Notice Paper I asked myself, "Why has he left out the proper distribution of industry?"<br/>
I turn from what the right hon. Gentleman said then, and what is offered now, to one observation on the merits of the matter. My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Central (Mr. McInnes) has already pointed it out and in so doing he was following some remarks of the Minister of Labour at the end of the discussion in Committee. Let me remind the right hon. Gentleman of what he himself said. He said that the key point in the action that the Government proposed was the refusal or the granting of industrial development certificates. He took that, quite rightly in my opinion, as one side of the medal of which the inducements to go to an area is the other. If that is the position, then I fail to see how he can introduce into the granting or refusal of industrial development certificates an element which he refuses to consider when we come to the question of inducements.<br/>
Let me put it to the right hon. Gentleman in this way. I am sure that he will listen to what is said to him before making up his mind that there is no inconsistency. There is, I believe, an

inconsistency. Suppose, for the purpose of an industrial development certificate on consideration of the proper distribution of industry, an area is considered suitable or unsuitable, as the case may be, then it is possible for that not to be considered when we come to the inducements and that an inducement will be refused in a case where the opposite action would have been taken in relation to an industrial development certificate.<br/>
There must be the same standard for the two things, otherwise we shall find that an industrial development certificate ought to be refused in an area where, none the less, an inducement ought to be offered to some manufacturer to go there. I do not say that the number of such cases will be large. If this were a Bill which laid down precisely and to what extent the right hon. Gentleman should exercise his powers, that would be a different matter, but in an enabling Bill we must, I suggest, have consistency between the negative side of the Bill represented by industrial development certificates and the positive side of the Bill represented by these inducements.<br/>
If we deliberately refuse to take into account the primary thing that matters for the purpose of industrial development certificates, then we may get into a position of the most absurd contradiction between the two sides of the medal. The history of the matter is very short. In what is called, later in the Bill, the principal enactment, this phrase occurred and it is repeated in Clause 18 of the Bill, as the Minister of Labour pointed out, because it was in the principal enactment, that is, the Town and Country Planning Act, 1947, but no attempt whatever is made to suggest that when we are considering the question of industrial development certificates anything but a proper distribution of industry ought to be considered as the primary factor.<br/>
Yet, leaving that on one side, the right hon. Gentleman deliberately refuses to be allowed to have regard to the proper distribution of industry when he is considering the question of inducements. The right hon. Gentleman has been persistently shaking his head. It seems to me that Governmental obstinacy can go a long way. He has, no doubt, decided to his own complete satisfaction


that there is no contradiction whatever and no difficulty. I ask him to give himself the opportunity of thinking, even later if not now, whether it is not possible that there is some contradiction and that he is wrong to refuse to himself the duty to look at this matter when considering inducements.</p>

<p>I am grateful for the word "diversification." Looking back over a very long period, during which both parties in the House have formed the Government at some time. one can see what a very long way we have been able to go in getting diversification. It is a very important aspect of the whole of our employment policy, and I am not against it. I think it is all right, but what I want to know is how the Board of Trade will interpret "diversification" and how far back in time it is prepared to go to see how diversification has so far taken place and in thinking out how it should proceed.<br/>
I have been dealing with this problem of unemployment, and trying to attract industry to various parts of the country where it is necessary, for a very long time, and I am sometimes aware that distinguished Ministers&#x2014;and ex-Ministers on the other side of the House &#x2014;are really far too young to remember a11 the difficulties which were encountered when we originally tried to embark on diversification. My right hon. Friend has talked about congestion of the motor car industry in Birmingham, but, so far as I have listened to the debate, nobody has put forward, although it is important, one of the reasons why that congestion has arisen.<br/>
My mind goes back to the war, when we were establishing our industries for the purpose of winning the war, whether it was aircraft production or the expansion of production of motor vehicles needed in the desert and other parts of the world, and when strategic necessities, referred to by one right hon. Member opposite, at that time demanded, because not only the North East Coast bat the whole of the East Coast of England were considered most vulnerable to bombing, that they should not get any of the benefit of employment in the new and expanding industries which were being concentrated in the centre of the country. Those industries continued to expand after the war, and that

helped to bring about this tremendous congestion.<br/>
Consequently, the East Coast of England &#x2014;and I am not talking about the North East Coast only but the industrial part of the East Coast&#x2014;fell behind in the race for getting proper, balanced diversification of industry, or getting balanced industry. It was because in the war we understood, although actually it proved wrong, that we on the East Coast were to be bombed out of existence. Therefore, we were not able to have new industries established in our part of the country, even though we may have had a pool of labour available to put into those factories.<br/>
What I am anxious to know is whether the Board of Trade, and all the pundits there now advising the Department, when making an assessment of diversification and the need for industrial expansion, will take into consideration that, quite apart from all the other difficulties of winning the war, the East Coast of England had to make those very great sacrifices, and that consequently, when the war ended, we were not in a position to take advantage of aircraft production expansion, the motor car industry's expansion, and the like. What I want to know about the interpretation of "diversification" is how far we are to be able to argue that we fell behind in the race for getting a proper distribution of industry.<br/>
We all talked, and rightly so, about having all our eggs in one basket. The radio industry developed in the centre of England because, as I say, we understood that the bombing would be along the East Coast and not in the centre of the country. Of course, as I say, that proved an incorrect prediction. However, it left the East Coast of England, and, no doubt, the East Coast of Scotland, too, at a disadvantage compared with other parts of the country. That ought to be remembered.<br/>
It is no use the generation of my right hon. Friend and the Parliamentary Secretary just talking about diversification now. Neither my right hon. Friend nor the Parliamentary Secretary was in the House of Commons at the time we were starting trying to have diversification of industry so as not to have all our eggs in one industrial basket. What I want to know is whether


all that aspect of the matter will be taken into consideration.<br/>
I am sorry that my right hon. Friend sprang up so quickly, to answer the case put for the Amendment from the other side of the House, that he gave me no opportunity to ask him for an answer on this very important point.</p>

<p>Hon. Members who were present when Mr. Speaker made the suggestion which he did, and which I readily accepted, will remember exactly what took place. Since then we have had hon. Members coming in making their contributions to the debate and then disappearing. We have learned to take that kind of thing philosophically, but it does take some accepting.<br/>
On this issue, approaching our problems within these limits, I find myself approaching them in the same way the Minister did earlier, but from a slightly different angle. It would be wrong of me not to speak on this matter, because, as the Parliamentary Secretary can testify if necessary, no area in the country suffers more than mine does from the issues raised by the proposed Government Amendment and our Amendment to the proposed Amendment. I hope that the President of the Board of Trade will listen to our reasoning, by which we try to provide him with evidence to show why he should accept our Amendment to his Amendment, or, if he cannot accept it, why he should give an undertaking that the provisions of his own Amendment will be administered in the way we ask.<br/>
When I read the right hon. Gentleman's Amendment, when it first appeared on the Notice Paper, I thought it a tribute to the work of the Committee on the Bill. I remember the days when Ministers, whether of that party or this, used to listen to debates and the reasoning put forward, and when, if there was any weight in the reasoning, they adapted themselves and their Measures to it, according to the evidence produced in debate. I have seen a great change in the ways of Ministers. This is not a party point, but for many years Ministers have tended to stand tightly to their briefs. They have been unprepared to deviate one-sixteenth of an inch from their briefs. I have often thought that fundamentally wrong, especially in Committees on Bills.<br/>
I welcome the present Minister's listening to reasoning, and adapting Bills to conform to reasoned argument in debate in Committee. So I thought, when I first read his Amendment, that it was a big step in the right direction. I join with the hon. Lady the Member for Tynemouth (Dame Irene Ward), who protested against the Minister's getting up so quickly. There is a certain amount of that done far too often. There is an inclination among some people to think that they know it all.</p>

<p>I accept that explanation right away, but the right hon. Gentleman ought to remember that Mr. Speaker had given me an undertaking, which I readily accepted, provided I could retain and safeguard my Parliamentary rights. Does the right hon. Gentleman accept that? I thank him. I thought he would. That is the reason why I thought that the Minister was too ready to get up. I shall not carry that too far, but it is a point worth noting.<br/>
5.0 p.m.<br/>
I feel very strongly on this subject, because no area has suffered more than the one I represent in this respect. I have had recent correspondence with the President of the Board of Trade, which I much appreciate, in which he has reminded me that at present we have not a very large proportion of unemployed. I accept that and I pay tribute to those who are contributing towards maintaining that position. But there are special circumstances in the area and it is for that reason that I feel strongly about both these Amendments.<br/>
The circumstances are that in the main the area has only two industries, pottery-making and mining, and that if anything serious took place in either of those industries we should be in a terrible position. It is true that, fortunately, as a


result of the National Coal Board's present policy of large-scale expenditure to increase Output from the most modern mines in the country we are benefiting for the time being. But as a result of having only those two industries, there are more people in the area suffering from silicosis or pneumoconiosis than in any other part of the country.<br/>
When it was first my privilege to represent the area one would see a procession of men and women on the streets on the way to the employment exchange. Their faces were white or cream-coloured as a result of the effects of silicosis and they were unable to find work. It is true that since then there have been great improvements in industrial conditions which are reflected in the improved health of the workpeople but we have still a relatively large number suffering from pneumoconiosis because so many are employed in these two industries. It is for that reason, among others, that I ask that there should be greater diversification of industry. I would urge also that the King's Roll should be used more extensively in order to find employment for these people.<br/>
I was once employed in an establishment where there were 25,000 workpeople, and because they were mainly engaged in carrying out Government contracts the King's Roll was administered to 100 per cent. A fair proportion of those who, through no fault of their own, were suffering as a result of war injury or industrial disease found employment. I admit that it is not the responsibility of the President of the Board of Trade to see that greater use is made of the King's Roll, but he has already said that he will consult the Minister of Labour and that the Government will do all they can in this area where there is a special claim for consideration in any discussion of the substance of these Amendments.<br/>
It was my privilege to be as friendly as a man could become with Colonel Josiah Wedgewood. He was a big man who approached things in a big way, as all who remember him would testify. He had his idiosyncracies and eccentricities but he was a big man and when I was a young man lacking experience he took me time after time to every Government Department with which he was in touch and every Department admitted that the

area which I now represent had a great claim for diversification of industry. That was how it came about that we had the two Royal Ordnance factories, one at Radway Green, employing 25,000 people, and one at Swinnerton which during the war employed 50,000. The factory at Swinnerton is now completely closed down. This is another reason why I hope that the House will approve our Amendment.<br/>
I pay tribute to the influence which the Minister has exercised over the British Motor Corporation. He and his officials must have had great influence over the Corporation in bringing about the result of which we all know. Now, in addition to his present authority and in the light of the country's economic needs, the Minister will be armed with the powers which it is proposed to give him under the present Bill.<br/>
I readily give credit for the fact that we are now to have a new establishment employing at least 1,000 men at Swinnerton, but we need a great deal more. This is only the beginning and I ask the President of the Board of Trade to give an undertaking that he will approach Associated Electrical Industries, English Electric and General Electric in the same way. These concerns are among the most important and efficient in the world. They have great influence in the world and, provided that we avoid world slumps, there is a great future for them. Acceptance of our Amendment will provide an opportunity to do with those great industrial establishments what the right hon. Gentleman has already done with the British Motor Corporation.<br/>
The area which I represent is a geographical and economic unit which is largely cut off from the rest of the country. About half a million people live in the area, 270,000 of them in the City of Stoke-on-Trent. Birmingham and Manchester are both about 40 miles away. In this isolated unit 500,000 men and women are mainly dependent on two industries. The right hon. Gentleman, therefore, will readily see why I am speaking with great concern and trying to exact from him the maximum undertaking that even if he cannot accept the Opposition Amendment he will take every step to ensure that the Bill will be administered in accordance with the intentions of the House.


I have already paid tribute to the right hon. Gentleman for his readiness to accept reasoned argument. This is democracy at work. If the House will function more in this way, instead of our having the personal quibbling and striving and straining of which we see so much, it will help to establish the House in the eyes of the people. It will let the people see that we really mean business and that we are trying to reflect their needs in our day-to-day proceedings. That should go a long way not only towards establishing the House in the eyes of the people but towards giving greater confidence to the industrial areas where people are watching debates on a Bill of this kind.</p>

<p>With the sole exception of the mining point, I do not think the Opposition has a case at all on the Amendment, the mining point being simply that if unemployment occurs the diversification of industry must be automatic. One cannot put more mines down to cater for unemployment that may be arising. This is where the Opposition is hard up against the general or special theory of industrial planning which is so dear to the hearts of hon. and right hon. Members opposite.<br/>
One of the most fascinating things is the bobbishness of the Socialist Party. After three successive defeats, one might have thought they could induce themselves to believe that a conservatively-controlled State would not in any circumstances accept <i>a priori</i> theories of industrial planning. Yet we have the hon. and learned Gentleman for Kettering (Mr. Mitchison) complaining that my right hon. Friend cannot accept his ideas.<br/>
There is a mystique about planning in the Socialist Party, just as there is a mystique arising out of Gaullism in France at present. People do not understand it. It is impossible to tell from the speech of the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Battersea, North (Mr. Jay) what he means when he says that it is necessary to have a proper distribution of industry. We have never heard what is the plan. There may be some highminded economist, like Dr. Kaldor, who has a perfect gem picture in his mind of how the motor car factories of Great Britain should be located, but it is not produced in concrete form, and no

reasons are adduced as to why it is necessary to have the various industries of the country segregated and de-centralised.<br/>
Not even the strategic argument was brought into the debate today. If any hon. Gentleman opposite had said, "The fear of mass bombing is now so great that we must remove most of the motor cars from Coventry and put them elsewhere", one could have understood that argument. But there is no attempt to justify this high concept of redistribution planning which is so dear to the hearts of hon. Gentlemen opposite. Indeed, I am not at all sure that one of the reasons why they have lost out&#x2014;I hope I am not being presumptuous and patronising in saying this&#x2014;in the last fifteen years or so is because they are not putting across to the electorate fundamental and sane and comprehensive reasons as to why they want this aspect of their Socialist philosophy.<br/>
I can see no reason, strategic questions apart, why most of the motor car industry should not be in Coventry, why most of the wool industry should not be in Bradford, why most of the cotton industry should not be in Oldham, and so on. My right hon. Friend the President of the Board of Trade gave two justifications for refusing this Amendment, and they are absolutely tenable and understandable. They represent our economic philosophy that, on the whole, industry thrives best when it can go where it likes.<br/>
According to my right hon. Friend, there are only two exceptions to that. One is that industry shall not move into enormous conurbations and thus lead to all kinds of other social disadvantages, which were so well put by the hon. Gentleman the Member for Paddington, North (Mr. Parkin) earlier in these debates. However, that can be catered for by the I.D.C. procedure, which, incidentally, is not a new one under this Bill. It was caught up from the Town and Country Planning Act, 1947, and has been in operation for some time. So it has been drawn from the past and is perpetuated by this Bill. I believe that all sections of the country are prepared to see this aspect of negative planning of industrial aggregations of industry.<br/>
The other point made by my right hon. Friend is fundamental to the Bill,


namely, that it is right to use State inducements for private enterprise to go into specific areas in order to take up unemployment. That I wholly object to but, and these are my final words, that is a matter for the Third Reading debate.</p>

<p>I was rather surprised at the noble Lord the Member for Dorset, South (Viscount Hinchingbrooke) leering at the Socialist concept of industrial planning. If he will read the history of railway development in the nineteenth century, he will gather that then the great industrialists who were laying railroads across this country were frustrated, not by the central Government, but by noble gentlemen throughout the land who often made them put their tracks over considerable detours, cuttings and tunnels so that the railways should not go anywhere near their valuable estates&#x2014;</p>

<p>I am sorry, Sir Gordon. Having spent a great part of my life in industry, knowing some of the frustrations imposed on us by many owners of land during our industrial development, I could not help being taken along the trail taken by the noble Lord.<br/>
The purpose of this Bill is to bring into the distribution and location of industry some planning on the basis of what is best socially and economically for the country. It is no use any diehard Tory getting the idea that the Tory Party now rejects planning. Members of the party opposite do not accept it, but they have proved by this Measure that they do not completely reject it. [HON. MEMBERS: "Nationalisation."] Nationalisation in many cases has been a great success. I am sure that if in the 19th century a high cost of capital had not been forced upon the railways&#x2014;I am sorry, Sir Gordon, but hon. Gentlemen opposite are leading me off the Amendment again&#x2014;which was in large measure due to the refusal of certain landowners to let the railway developers put the railways where they wished, we would not

find that burden reflected today in the cost of our railways.<br/>
I want to plead for distribution as well as diversification. Diversification takes place within British industry itself on a large scale. For instance, many people do not realise that the British Motor Corporation produces many things in addition to motor cars and other internal combustion engines. In fact, the Bendix washing machine is produced by the Corporation and also the Empire typewriter, as well as the moulds of the Marley tiles made in Scotland. So diversification in that sense takes place within engineering plants. The purpose of this Bill is not merely to encourage that type of diversification within one industry. Its real purpose is to bring about a redistribution of economic activity. If it does not mean that, it means nothing.</p>

<p>There is heavy unemployment in certain areas of the country because there is a lack of economic activity. There is over-full employment in some areas because there is too much economic activity. So the purpose of the Bill is to shift some of the economic activity from areas of over-full employment into areas of under-employment. Is not the purpose of the Bill to redistribute economic activity from those areas where there is too much to those areas where there is too little?<br/>
I take the view that the population from the Midlands down is too high and that the population from the Scottish border upwards is too low. Scotland could carry a higher population if it had a higher industrial activity.<br/>
May I comment on the word "diversification"? In my constituency we produce ships of all kinds but we also produce domestic and commercial sewing machines, rotary water and oil pumps and electrical switchgear. There is a great diversification of industrial activity in my constituency. The trouble is that there is not enough industry. Diversification alone is not sufficient.<br/>
I notice that the B.M.C.'s proposal in respect of its works at Kingsbury Road, Birmingham, where I have worked, is to move the Bendix washing machine works


to Kirkby in Lancashire. The Corporation does not intend to take the motor car manufacturing works there but the manufacturing section dealing with domestic appliances. I wish that such an enterprise would move to Scotland. I would rather the manufacture of consumer durables were moved to Scotland, because we could stimulate capital production in Scotland in this way, and by that stimulation we could develop further pressure in the South on consumer durables. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Trade has heard me stress this point before. It is a well-known point made by economists for a number of years in dealing with regional unemployment.<br/>
By all means let us encourage diversification. Beardmore's Porthead Forge, in Glasgow, in the past has manufactured almost nothing but heavy steel castings for the shipbuilding industry, and we should help it to diversify its industrial activity. With the arrival of the B.M.C. a wonderful chance is offered for this firm to augment and diversify its own activity by producing propeller shafts and crankshafts for heavy commercial vehicles. Such diversification is good. If the Government can take action to encourage the diversification of economic activity within industrial plants, so much the better. I prefer to work for a company which has diversified its products. That is why it is a good thing to work for the B.M.C. which does not depend entirely on motor-car production. It is a good thing for any engineer or for any toolmaker, as I was, to work in an industry making diverse products.<br/>
But that is not the main purpose of the Bill, which is to redistribute industry. We do not use the word "redistribute", but that is what it means; the purpose is not to create new industries in Scotland but to redistribute some industrial activity from the over-congested areas into the underdeveloped areas of the country.</p>

<p>If that were the purpose of the Bill there would be a lot to be said for it, but as far as I can see the purpose is to pack in more industrialism where industrialism now exists.</p>

<p>The noble Lord suggests that the purpose is to pack in more industrialism where there is already an excess of it. I cannot see that. If industrial development certificates are refused in an over-congested area and if assistance is given to firms prepared to go to areas with heavy unemployment, surely that is a sound policy. There may have been heavy industrialism in such areas in the past, but because of the changing pattern of industry and because of new techniques and technologies and the nature of world trade, those areas have become under-industrialised.<br/>
For instance, I suggest that hon. Members should visit Staffordshire and the Black Country around Ironbridge. My hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South knows that area as well as I do. This is a town which is overgrown with weeds. Up to the end of the eighteenth century it was a great iron centre, and the first iron bridge ever built stands there as a monument. Today it is derelict. Would the noble Lord call that an industrial area? It was 200 years ago, but it is not today. In the same way, everyone speaks of the "Black Country". Indeed, eighty years ago it was the "Black Country", but today it is a green country. In Lanarkshire and parts of my constituency there were great industrial areas in the past, but if no attempt is made to bring about a redistribution and relocation of industry in the country, those areas will become derelict.<br/>
My right hon. Friend's Amendment is justified as an attempt to keep this purpose in the Bill. We must bring about a redistribution and relocation of economic activity in the country. With the new technologies and new techniques which are arising, I believe that in the future most large engineering plants will increasingly create a diversification of products within their own organisation. The British Motor Corporation, one of the most successful motor enterprises in this country, founded by Austin and Sir William Morris, both able and competent men under whom I have worked, found this advisable. Hon. Members may not know that until a few years ago, Lord Nuffield had a lathe in his bedroom and used to do a bit of turning with it for amusement, because he so loved the technique of the engineering processes.</p>

<p>That was a case of the redistribution of economic activity.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South knows that for a hundred years the wives in the Midlands have been used to such engineering processes in their houses. My hon. Friend knows of little hand presses being set up in the bay window of a house. I have seen them, and so has he, and I have taken raw materials to those houses. That is how industry was distributed there forty years ago.<br/>
I ask the right hon. Gentleman to consider the position again and to include the word "redistribution" in the Bill. It has a psychological meaning and it is more conclusive of the Government's intention to go further than they seem to intend to go under the Bill. The Bill may not prove sufficiently effective. In three or four years we may have to go a stage further, as a Parliament, to deal with this problem. We have a responsibility on both sides of the House.<br/>
We shall have to do more planning in this generation; and I mean "planning", because that will inevitably come. Hon. Members opposite may fight their rearguard actions until the cows come home, but there must be some State intervention to plan and locate the industrial activity of our country in the interests of efficiency, housing, good living, good culture and good society.<br/>
We cannot afford to have half of the country overcrowded, with the people there rushed, crushed and pushed, while the other half is under-employed and in many cases almost destitute and without hope. We cannot have two nations living geographically apart. We have learned over the years that we cannot have the old concept of two nations; we have almost eliminated Lord Beaconsfield's two nations of poverty and wealth. By unplanned location of industry, however, we have again created two nations, this time geographically. We have the high-prosperity nation, south of Gloucester, and the low-prosperity nation, north and west, including the north of England, Scotland and Wales. This concept of two nations must be changed by the redistribution of industrial activity in the country.</p>

<p>I spent too many years with the British Motor Corporation to make that suggestion.

<p>I was observing that there was the implication that the people who are running industry have not the least idea how to do it and that there was some other body or some politicians who would know far more about it. I do not think that that is a view which is generally held; it is certainly not the view of my right hon. Friend. The implementation of the powers in the Bill would in many cases not be of benefit to an industry; in many cases it would be a handicap. We must recognise that fact and ensure that the handicap under which any industry shall labour shall be as small as possible and not as great as possible.<br/>
I believe that my right hon. Friend, in that setting, has gone a very long way indeed to meet the wishes expressed when the matter was discussed in Committee. On the one hand, he has ensured that when the Board of Trade considers to what areas industries shall be dissuaded from going there shall be reference to the question of redistribution. On the other hand, when the Board of Trade considers to what areas industries shall go, its attention will be directed not to the question of distribution but to the much more relevant question of higher than average unemployment and, to some degree, to the question of diversification within those areas. I think that those are much more appropriate matters.<br/>
The hon. and learned Member for Kettering (Mr. Mitchison) seemed to find


it difficult to understand why in the case of the industrial development certificate it might be appropriate to consider distribution and why, on the other hand, my right hon. Friend was not prepared to have that consideration included in the Clause. I should have thought that there was a distinction to be drawn between the two cases. When we are considering why an industrial development certificate should be withheld in the case of London or Birmingham, surely maldistribution must be one of the main considerations. But when we are considering to what area an industry should go the main consideration should be the evil of high unemployment and not of maldistribution of industry in the area. On the other hand, one of the faults in such an area may well be the failure to have diversification.</p>

<p>I am submitting that under my right hon. Friend's proposals there is power to deal with an area in which there is higher than average unemployment. My right hon. Friend's Department has already shown by its withholding of industrial development certificates, in the case of the motor industry, its ability to influence the movement to Wales and to the right hon.

<p>Surely the point which the right hon. Gentleman is making is covered by the lack of diversification. That is the answer to the right hon. Gentleman.

Friend is quite correct in saying that when the Bill becomes an Act and is in operation the Board of Trade should concentrate on the areas of higher than average unemployment. Indeed, I imagine that people living in the right hon. Gentleman's constituency, near Llanelly, or in the high unemployment areas in Scotland would resent it if the Board of Trade did not place industries in those areas but put them elsewhere because there was lack of diversification.</p>

<p>With great respect, Mr. Deputy-Speaker, this Amendment deals with the lack of diversification&#x2014; it deals entirely with that point.

<p>The debate so far on this Amendment has been contributed to in the main by hon.

Very few of the speakers so far have personal experience of unemployment. I speak as one who has experienced the loss of dignity which unemployment causes to the man or woman who is thrown out of work. I have always maintained that there is dignity in labour and degradation in being out of work and inforced idleness.

<p>Right, Mr. Deputy-Speaker. The question of the distribution of industry has been discussed many times, and we must put forward arguments to show why we support an Amendment of this character.<br/>
I was glad to hear my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South (Mr. Ellis Smith) state that there are only two industries in that area, namely, mining and pottery. In the district which I have the honour to represent we also have only two main industries. They are mining and cotton. Hon. and right hon. Members know what is happening in coal and what is happening in cotton. Both industries are contracting very rapidly. The coal industry is contracting far more rapidly than we anticipated. That is why I am anxious, as one who comes from a mining area, that the word "distribution" should be incorporated in the Minister's Amendment.<br/>
In many parts of the country the coal industry is contracting with great rapidity. Twenty-five years ago, in Lancashire and a small portion of Cheshire, 80,000 men were employed in the pits. The figure today is 38,000. It may occur to some right hon. and hon. Members to ask where the men have gone. They have gone to other industries in distant parts of the county and the country, and even overseas. We as a nation failed to provide alternative employment for these men when they were thrown out of work.<br/>
I was very glad to hear my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South pay a tribute to the President of the Board of Trade. I reinforce what my hon. Friend said. It has been my experience when serving on Committees for which the right hon. Gentleman was responsible that he was amenable to reason. I hope he will be amenable to the reasoning that we are putting forward to prove the importance of the Amendment, and that he will accept the word "distribution". That word is very important if we are to maintain a high standard of living for all our people and protect them from unemployment.<br/>
I said a moment ago that at one time 80,000 men were employed in the mining industry in Lancashire and that only

38,000 men were employed there today. Where have those men gone? They have not left the district entirely, but they now have to travel long distances to work rather than occupy the ranks of the unemployed.<br/>
I should like to give a picture of what is happening where mines have closed down. A man who used to work for eight hours a day in a mine is now away from home for more than twelve hours a day, because there is no alternative employment in the area in which he lives. That shows neglect in the past by the Government of the day to distribute industry to places where it was required.<br/>
In Ashton-in-Makerfield in my constituency six or seven pits are to be closed in the next two years. The mining industry has contracted steadily over the last few years but we have not been offered an alternative industry. I plead with hon. Members to listen to the reasons why we consider the Amendment so important. We must have a real distribution of industry to areas where it is required, and that as quickly as possible.<br/>
My hon. Friend referred briefly but sincerely to the number of men suffering from pneumoconiosis and silicosis. Let us consider the position of these men. When the pits were in full commission and a man was unfit for work through injury he was found light employment within the industry. There is now no light industry in which he can be found work. To keep down the percentage of unemployment in localities where there are only two industries we must redistribute other industries to those areas to provide work for those men.<br/>
I support the Amendment because it will help considerably, if it is put into operation. It will help those districts like Ashton-in-Makerfield, Ince-in-Makerfield, and Abram where pits are being closed and the men are being displaced. I know that the closing of a pit is sometimes unavoidable. I am not blaming the Government for that&#x2014;not at this stage. I have enough common sense to know that when pits have been in commission for 300 or 400 years the coal stocks run out. There is, however, no reason why the men displaced should not be found alternative work by the distribution of such industries as are available for distribution to those districts.


I am not saying that the President of the Board of Trade can manufacture an industry. I am saying that by proper control and proper diversification and distribution the Minister would be able to direct into those areas those industrialists who want to help the bad areas. He could say to the industrialists, "Here is a site. Here is labour and material. Instead of sending your industry to the south of England build your factory in this area." I know there has been a battle between the North and the South, and we have lost the battle so far, but let us now try at least to effect a draw. The Minister should direct those industries which are available for direction into the districts which have unfortunately suffered a contraction of the industries that once helped to provide employment for the people living there.<br/>
5.45 p.m.<br/>
It may be that even if two new light industries are directed into a mining area, we shall once again face the problem of finding employment for the men displaced from the mines which are contracting with ever-increasing rapidity, but there is no reason why the President of the Board of Trade, with his tolerance and his amenability to reason, should not accept the Amendment.<br/>
As one who has suffered in the ranks of the unemployed and has tramped the country and been unable to find work, I plead with the Minister to accept the Amendment. If any words of mine can prevent any individual, be he in Lancashire or in any other county, from experiencing unemployment, it is my duty to say them. I hope that the Minister will agree to our Amendment and include the word "distribution" either after or before the word "diversification," because the two things must go together. By doing that he will help the districts which in the past have experienced, and are now experiencing, the difficulty of having many unemployed men and women.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1960-02-03a.1047.0" hansard_membership_id="9029" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/18046" speakername="Mr. Maudling" colnum="1047" time="">
<p>We have had a very interesting debate, but it has been a little diffuse. I think that at one and the same time I can agree with a great deal of what has been said by many speakers, including the hon. Member for Ince (Mr. T. Brown), without accepting the

Amendment, because, on the whole, speeches have been directed to supporting not so much the Amendment to the Amendment as the arguments which I put forward against it in the initial stage.<br/>
Much has been said about the need for diversification. It is true that there is a need but, as my hon. Friend the Member for Barry (Mr. Gower) pointed out, it is already covered by the Government Amendment. We recognise that in providing for the needs of an area where there is a substantial amount of unemployment we must try to make available the sort of employment which will be permanent. If a district is substantially dependent on one industry, or one branch of an industry, it is wiser to try to persuade industry of a different kind to go there, so that all the industries in the area will not be engulfed at the same time if difficulties should subsequently arise.<br/>
In Committee the argument was put forward very powerfully that in operating our policy we should have regard to the need for the diversification of industry&#x2014;meaning the diversification of industry in the areas in which we are trying to create new enterprises. That is the purpose of the Government Amendment, which describes the circumstances in which the Board of Trade can use the powers under Part I, but even in respect of the Government Amendment, to which we are now discussing an Amendment, the powers are to be used only within development districts. That was the point I made earlier, and it was also made by my hon. Friend the Member for Dorset, South (Viscount Hinchingbrooke) and my hon. Friend the Member for Barry. In so far as we are inducing people to go to certain areas at all we must try to get them to go to places where there is a high level of unemployment.<br/>
We say that the criterion we must have is that the areas concerned are areas with a high level of unemployment, and in inducing industries to go to those areas we must take account of the situation already existing in them. We must take note of the fact that there is a concentration of heavy industry, or a large number of school leavers or disabled people, and so on. But in every case the area or district to which we are trying to persuade industry to go must be an area where a social need


exists because of a substantial amount of unemployment.<br/>
The Amendment to the Amendment could mean one of two things. It could mean that we should have regard to the distribution of industry, first, within development districts and, secondly, in the country as a whole. I do not think that the first alternative is relevant. If a firm is going to Merseyside, as I hope some firms will, it does not very much matter to the Board of Trade which part of the area it goes to; that is a matter for the local planning authority. Our job is to get firms to go somewhere where unemployed people are waiting.<br/>
Therefore, if the Amendment to the Amendment has any significance we must treat it as dealing with the distribution of industry between different districts. I can only explain the point of view of the Government once again. The attitude that we adopt is somewhat different from that of the party opposite. We do not start from the proposition that there is something called a "proper distribution of industry throughout the country", which can be defined and set down in terms of a blueprint. We say that, as far as possible, industry should be allowed to develop in accordance with competitive conditions, under free enterprise.<br/>
We recognise that there are limitations to that view, and I accept that we must employ negative controls, which prevent industries going to crowded districts. There is nothing illogical about that, as the hon. and learned Member for Kettering (Mr. Mitchison) suggested. He tried to argue that if we say "No" to a person in respect of one area we must say "Yes" to a person in respect of another area. Even the party opposite would not do that. They have said that they would shrink from directing people and that they would use the negative but not the positive power. We can say, "This place is too crowded, so no one else can come in", but we do not have to tell people who want to come in where they must go.<br/>
It might be that everybody on a railway platform tried to get into the same coach. It would soon become overcrowded, and further people would have to be prevented from getting in, but that would not mean that we should tell them exactly how many of them were to go

into each of the remaining coaches on the train. That is a logical analogy, which can be sustained. We do not accept that it is the function of the Government to tell industry where to go. We want to see it go where it thinks it can be most efficient, and where its costs can be kept low, but this wish must be conditioned by two things. First, we must exercise strenuously these negative powers, preventing industry from going into areas which are already overcrowded where, on economic, strategic&#x2014; as the right hon. Gentleman said&#x2014;and social grounds there is a strong case for preventing further expansion, even at the cost of some loss of economic efficiency. We are doing that.<br/>
Beyond that, we say that in respect of districts where there is a special danger of unemployment we should, at the expense of the Government, offer inducements to firms to go into those areas. We should not direct them; no one is proposing that. If there were no areas of special unemployment I see no reason why the Government should have anything to say upon the question where firms should go, beyond preventing them from going into crowded areas. It is only because of the existence of a special unemployment problem that the inducements in Part I are being provided.<br/>
As clearly as I can explain it, that is our reason for saying that the introduction of a concept of distribution at this stage would run counter to all our ideas.</p>

<p>Is not the right hon. Gentleman's argument inconsistent with the wording of Clause 18, which says:
<q>In considering whether any development for which a certificate under the principal enactment (hereinafter referred to as an "industrial development certificate") is applied for can be carried out consistently with the proper distribution of industry, the Board shall have particular regard to the need for providing appropriate employment in the localities mentioned in subsection (2) of section one of this Act.</q>
Surely the President of the Board of Trade would agree that that must mean that the Board of Trade takes account of the proper distribution of industry over both types of area, which is all that our Amendment to the Government Amendment is asking for.</p>

<p>I should have thought that those words expressed, as succinctly as possible, what I have been saying.


We have only two purposes. The first is to stop people from going into crowded areas, which would clearly cause maldistribution of industry, and must be stopped, and the second is to induce people to go into areas of special difficulty, because a social problem exists there which must be solved.<br/>
We will not go further and say that we should use Government influence and money to induce industry to fall into a pattern which accords not with the principle on which one would like industry to work but with a theoretical principle</p>

<p>which the Government are trying to impose. There is a fairly clear division between the two sides of the House on this matter. I have done my best to explain our point of view and I am sorry if I cannot persuade the party opposite to accept it. I cannot assist the House any further, beyond saying that these are the clear purposes of the Bill and that we cannot accept the Amendment.</p>

<p>May I now assume that you are Mr. Speaker, and therefore put my point to you? I hope you will listen to what I have to say, and I wish to say only one thing. When we pass this Bill, we shall repeal entirely the whole of the Distribution of Industry Act, 1945. That Act contained a Schedule which delimited and defined the areas which it covered. The whole of that Schedule goes, and there is to be no Schedule to replace it. That is why we think it is important to discuss this matter and make it an obligation upon the Minister, within a definite time after this Bill becoming an Act of Parliament, to declare and announce the areas to which the new Act will apply. We thought that, because the Bill makes this important

change in national policy, because it completely repeals the whole of the 1945 Act, which included the areas that were scheduled, or, to use the old term, the Development Areas&#x2014;which this Bill does not&#x2014;there was a very sound reason for allowing us to move this Amendment.</p>

<p>Yes, the two Amendments hang together.<br/>
It will be appreciated that subsection (3) permits the President of the Board of Trade to attach conditions to building grants which may be given to undertakers under the provisions in this Clause. We think that Parliament might wish to make it obligatory on the Minister to attach conditions to ensure that the purposes for which the buildings were provided and the grants made are fulfilled. Were the Clause amended as we propose, we think that we should be putting a reasonable obligation on the Minister and at the same time we should not make the thing so rigid as to be unworkable. Were the Amendments made, the subsection would read:
<q>The Board in making a grant under this section shall impose such conditions as they think fit for securing that the building or extension will continue to serve the purposes of this Part of this Act, which may include conditions for repayment of grant in specified circumstances.</q>
6.15 p.m.<br/>
I think that all hon. Members would regard it as a misuse of a grant were it made for the building, for example, of a factory and then, shortly after being built, the factory was used as a store or for some other purpose. Yesterday, when we discussed offices in quite a different context, the President of the Board of Trade made it clear that he could give grants for the building of offices and the like. It would be a pity were a grant given for the building of offices or for an hotel, because it was believed that this work would lead to the solution of an unemployment problem in a particular area, and then the building ceased to be used for the purpose for which it was intended and for which a grant was provided&#x2014;perhaps to find employment for 100 or 200 workpeople &#x2014;and was used as a store. Such premises might be taken over by one of the new companies getting contracts from the Independent Television Authority

and employment provided for perhaps only six or twelve people.<br/>
It would appear reasonable that in making these grants the Board of Trade should attach conditions to them all the time, not unreasonable conditions but conditions which would vary according to the circumstances of each case. It seems to us that the varying of the conditions would not necessarily lead to it being desirable that there should be a repayment of the grant, but in some circumstances the need to do that would exist. We propose, therefore, that the word "shall" should appear in the first line of the subsection to make mandatory the imposition of such conditions as the Board of Trade thought fit, and leave permissive the provision regarding the repayment of grants.<br/>
I hope the Government will consider that these Amendments represent a sensible and realistic proposition. We do not think that there will be a tremendous contribution to the solution of our unemployment problems by way of building grants. But this is a new thing, and we have to realise that when factories are built or owned by the Board of Trade, or owned and managed by the managements corporations, and if the properties are not being used properly the corporations or the Board of Trade should be free at any time to change the use of the building or, if the tenant is not making a proper use of the property, to terminate his tenancy.<br/>
If we are to spend the taxpayers' money in order to solve the unemployment problem in a particular area, by giving capital grants to an industrialist, we ought to be as sure as we can be that public money spent for this purpose will be used to provide a property which may not be disposed of for quite another purpose which might well be more rumunerative than the original purpose for which the building was erected. I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will realise that these Amendments are reasonable and that he will be able to accept them.</p>

<p>I beg to second the Amendment.<br/>
I think it appropriate that another hon. Member representing a Scottish constituency should second this Amendment,


because it is part of the Scottish ritual in the discussion of Bills that we should debate whether the word in the Bill shall be "may" or "shall". On this occasion, however, it is a little more than a piece of ritual because undoubtedly there is force in the Amendment.<br/>
I do not wish to repeat the arguments advanced by my hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton (Mr. T. Fraser). We desire to ensure that public money shall be spent properly and that the Board of Trade shall see that that is done. What would happen if a factory were built with the aid of a grant&#x2014;say, 85 per cent. of the cost of the factory&#x2014;from the Board of Trade and if within a year or two the factory were put to some other use? What would be the position if the Board of Trade had laid down no conditions, as might well be the case, under this subsection? We ought to have an answer to this question, because if there is not a satisfactory answer it seems to me that the Amendment ought to be accepted.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1960-02-03a.1059.0" hansard_membership_id="11557" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/20176" speakername="The Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Trade (Mr. John Rodgers)" colnum="1059" time="">
<p>I think it would be convenient if I gave the Government's views on this point right away. As the hon. Member for Hamilton (Mr. T. Fraser) said, the effect of the Amendment is to make it obligatory instead of permissive for the Board of Trade, in making a building grant, to impose such conditions as are thought fit for securing that the building will continue to serve the purpose stipulated in the Bill. We propose in any event to do this, and I think that answers the question put to me by the hon. Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis).<br/>
I agree with both hon. Members that it would be intolerable that someone who had obtained a grant of public money to enable him to erect premises to provide employment should be able to dispose of the premises so that they were put to a use which would not provide employment within the area.<br/>
Therefore, in so far as the use of "shall" emphasises the Board's intention that the money shall be paid out for the purposes stipulated in the Bill, we accept the Amendments.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 3, line 42, to leave out "or grants".<br/>
I had hoped to deal with the elimination of grants and the substitution of loans throughout the main spending Clauses of the Bill, namely Clauses 3 and 4, but for technical reasons the Amendments were out of order on Clause 3, and I am confined to this Amendment and the next Amendment in page 4, line 5, leave out "or grant", which is consequential. These are second-line Amendments. They are not attempts to wreck the Bill but they are attempts to hamstring its activities somewhat.<br/>
For the benefit of hon. Members who do not know the nature of my opposition to the Bill, and without going out of order, I think I should say quite briefly that while not being opposed to State action in some form, either general or particular, to alleviate unemployment in certain localities&#x2014;and I am thinking particularly through the Ministry of Housing and Local Government by way of clearing and altering the character of the locality and employing labour, improving amenities and activities of that kind&#x2014;I am totally opposed, as are some of my hon. Friends, to the giving of State assistance to private business to open up in places where there is alleged to be a sufficient qualifying degree of unemployment. I am opposed to that, first because it discriminates between the new private entrant to the locality as against the existing business man in the locality who, as I pointed out to my hon. Friend the Member for Tynemouth (Dame Irene Ward) the other day, has been "sweating it out" there for a generation or more, and also because it discriminates as between the lucky firm which gets this Government assistance and the competitor in the same trade who does not get it or does not elect to seek it.<br/>
I deplore the fact that the present Conservative Government, in so many


fields which I cannot cover in this Amendment, are today subsidising private industry either to go to places and do things or to amalgamate&#x2014;</p>

<p>I entirely agree with the right hon. Gentleman. I think that some of the subsidies to agriculture are in need of surveillance and in some cases severe curtailment. I say that in spite of the fact that my constituency, while not being purely agricultural, is largely an agricultural constituency. However, this being a second-line Amendment, I cannot develop the point.<br/>
It seems to me to be a mistake to use the taxpayers' money to aid and abet the arrival of industry in areas which are already heavily industrialised by definition, because otherwise unemployment in those areas would not arise. The concept that I have is one of decentralisation on the lines of some of the things that are now being done abroad, notably the tremendous Renault factory in the heart of rural France, and in my own constituency where Winfrith Atomic Energy Station is not surrounded by a large industrial conurbation but employs large numbers of persons. That is the type of concept that I have, and, for the reasons that I have given, I deplore the use of taxpayers' money to pay grants or loans to private enterprise in order to aid and abet the process of massive industrialisation in areas where these "dark satanic mills" have existed for too long.<br/>
The basic question here is how to save something of the taxpayers' money without destroying the concept of the Clause infernally. I am therefore moving to leave out these words "or grants." The purpose is quite simple. The State might consider making a loan to private enterprise, as it has done in the past to various iron and steel firms&#x2014;notably Tube Investments which firm is now in Corby, and the Cunard Shipping Company for the building of the "Queen Elizabeth" and the "Queen Mary". This has been done by means of loans which are repayable I hope that there will not he a grant for the new "Queens". If any assistance is given, it should be done by means of a loan and not by a grant.<br/>
Here we have a proposal to make available very large sums to private industry to move to areas of unemployment, and if these sums are to be available they should be made available in the form of loans repayable over a period rather than by means of grants. If a grant is made of, say, &#x00A3;100,000 for a large industry to move to an area of relatively high unemployment, that comes above the line on the Estimates. It is paid for out of current taxation. If it is a loan it may qualify to go below the line. It is repayable and the sole feature of it which reflects against the taxpayer is the annual interest.<br/>
6.30 p.m.<br/>
Many concerns can go to their banks and, by paying 4 per cent., 5 per cent. or 6 per cent., can get a sizeable industrial loan. By coming to the State they get it at whatever the lending rates are at the time, 4&#x00BD; per cent. or 5 per cent., and there is a minute difference between the two. We should not quibble about the difference in what private enterprise can get from private sources and from the State. My main point is to try to reduce the large sums, directly payable by the taxpayer to industry.<br/>
The Government may come forward with two counter-arguments. They may say the alternative to making a grant is for an industry to request that a Board of Trade factory should be erected for it. That in part begs the question, because I cannot see any responsible Government acceding to the request to build a very expensive factory for a firm if a grant was not there. Secondly, they may say this is a once-for-all payment for a firm to uproot itself, travel, get settled, re-tool and get going again, and after that it is off on its own. That is only a "little baby" argument, because no other private firm that has moved to a centre which has had unemployment in the past, until the 1945 Act came into existence, has had Government assistance for this purpose. Hitherto industrialists have been required to raise capital for their initial establishment expenses. Many firms are doing that at present. If the Government argue that this is a once-for-all payment, I do not think that mitigates the enormity of their offence under this Bill sufficiently to allow it to pass.


Where are we going with these grants and loans to private industry? I hope very much for the assistance of some hon. Members opposite in attacking this problem fundamentally as we proceed to our financial debates throughout the year. It is interesting that some of the great men of commerce are beginning to have feelings of very sincere regret about this. I know that the hon. Member for Ashton-under-Lyne (Mr. Rhodes) is deeply interested in the processes now at work in the cotton industry. Perhaps he will be interested in what Mr. Anthony Tuke said on 18th October last to the Annual Conference of the Cotton Board:
<q>At the moment you have your special problem of redundant capacity, which is so serious that the Government have been prepared to take special measures to alleviate it. I need hardly tell you that this action has not met with universal acclaim. I only say one thing about it, which is that Government financial aid, whether by grant or by loan, can act as a boomerang. In particular its acceptance, especially I think if it takes the form of a loan, provides an argument, perhaps the only plausible argument, in favour of nationalisation, which is that industry is now so big that when it needs finance only the Government is big enough to find the money; and that what the Government finances it is entitled to control. I make this as a general point, and not as having any special reference to the cotton industry.</q></p>

<p>Hon. Members opposite need not cheer so loudly. I made exactly the same point myself in my peroration when opposing the Second Reading of this Bill. I ask the Government again to recognise the danger of this process of chasing industries, in a certain stage of temporary decline it may be, with subsidies and grants. It may please hon. Members opposite. This may be a form of Conservative philosophy which is feeding their ultimate purpose. I do not know. Goodness knows what the Minister of Aviation is doing to the aircraft industry. We might very well soon get to the stage where it will be natural for people to demand that it is the duty of the State to invest in, take over and manage industries which have been the subject of so much Government help.<br/>
I hope the Government will take a warning from the fears that some of us are expressing about current legislation at the present time. It is extraordinary

that, while the Russians now seem to be developing various arts of private enterprise and private commerce, even in a rudimentary way, we in Britain remorselessly, for some extraordinary reason, since the war have been moving towards collectivism. No doubt one day we shall salute each other as we pass, both of us at sea.</p>

<p>I beg to second the Amendment.<br/>
In the course of his remarks, my noble Friend showed that the payment of grants by the Government is undesirable. I hope in one or two sentences to show that it is equally unnecessary.<br/>
The one purpose of the Bill, I understand, is to induce industry to move to areas where there is a high and persistent rate of unemployment, hoping that by moving fresh employment opportunities will be created in those areas. The accent so far in our discussions, both in Committtee and today, has been on the word "induce". This is one of the methods by which it is hoped to induce industry to go to those areas. This form of inducement, the payment of a grant, is, in effect, designed to amount to compensation for the expense of moving. If it is to compensate an industry for moving from one area where it now exists to an area where the Board of Trade wishes it to go, this is not going to be the only consideration which the owners or managers of that industry are going to have before them when deciding whether or not to accept the invitation to move to that area.<br/>
I imagine that, on the whole, it will be one of the smallest of the considerations they will bear in mind. Their main consideration, surely, will be whether or not, after having settled in that new locality, they are going to be able to trade successfully, to produce their particular articles economically and to market them efficiently. One of the smallest factors in their minds when weighing up the various arguments in favour of moving or staying will be this question of compensation for the cost of actually moving and setting up in the new locality. It is not going to be the one big point which will persuade people to move who otherwise might not be prepared to do so.<br/>
In any event, I think it will be unnecessary because in trying to consider


which industries are likely to move I think they are more likely to be the larger concerns. I cannot foresee many small industrial companies, or even groups, running the risk which undoubtedly a move of this kind would involve. It is much more likely to be those which we regard as the leaders in British industry, which hitherto have taken a lead in doing this sort of thing, big firms which have gone to these areas and saved the situation by creating fresh employment opportunities there. They have been followed by the smaller firms, like smaller fish following big fish. It is the risk, which the big fish can well afford to take, which is the first and foremost one. Therefore, it seems to me to be unnecessary to exercise this power of administering grants.<br/>
In fact, my right hon. Friend has said so in the Bill. In Clause 4 he makes it clear that there must be some test before a grant or loan is given, and the test is to be whether or not it is assumed by those administering the money that the industrial concern will be a success. Clause 4 (1, <i>b</i>) says that there must be good prospects of the undertaking ultimately being able to carry on successfully without further assistance under that provision. If there are good prospects for the concern to carry on successfully, it seems unnecessary for it to be in receipt of any form of grant. If it can carry on successfully, then it can be expected to be successful enough to repay the loan. Consequently, it is essential that we should remove from the Bill this imposition on the taxpayer.<br/>
I think it will help to some extent&#x2014;a little, not much&#x2014;to encourage a certain amount of movement in the labour force. I have very much sympathy with and understanding of the arguments put forward at earlier stages of the Bill about the preservation of the life of the community, but I think it is true to say that there is not today as much mobility of the labour force as there was. I believe that the labour force has been rendered immobile by the settlement of wages on a national basis. Therefore, I would hope that such money as can be spent under the Bill will be directed towards encouraging individual potential employees to move from one area to another rather than towards grants to individual industries.</p>

<p>Since the noble Lord the Member for Dorset, South (Viscount Hinchingbrooke) mentioned me, I should like to tell him that I support a good deal of what he said. We now have the example before us of the mess that the Government have made of the grants to the cotton industry. When one looks at these things it depends, of course, how they affect one. If one is at the receiving end it is not so bad. I was hoping that the Government would, perhaps just before the next General Election, apply to the wool industry a scheme similar to that which they have put into operation for the cotton industry, because it is very nice occasionally for those engaged in industry to get something for nothing.<br/>
I would urge the Minister to consider the question of grants and also what the noble Lord has said. Just before the General Election the Government brought in their scheme for the cotton industry, and as a result vast sums of money have been paid, estimates varying between &#x00A3;30 million and &#x00A3;60 million. As the area concerned is a D.A.T.A.C. area, it is still possible for a firm to apply to the Treasury for permission to set up again in the same business. Hon. Members must consider the matter not just in terms of political expediency at a time when a General Election may be pending so that the Government of the day may be helped to keep seats which they would otherwise be likely to lose; they must look at it in terms of how it will build itself into the fabric of the economy as a whole. There is something in what the noble Lord has said, and it ought to be very seriously considered. I look forward to co-operating with him at a later date on the same sort of issue.</p>

<p>I support the Amendment. I am not sure whether it is a concomitant of democracy that one must do the wrong things for the wrong reasons practically all the time, but on the question of these grants it seems to me that it is easy enough to get a grant out of the Treasury for something which is generally politically acceptable to the voters. In other words, if there is a cry for pouring out some money that moves a Government strongly enough from the voting point


of view they will pour it out, but they very often think twice about granting money for what may be more important purposes.</p>

<p>It is perfectly true of any Government&#x2014;it has been true of all Governments since the war&#x2014;that they will pour out money for things which they think of political advantage, but they are loth to pour out money for other matters which may be of very great importance. Perhaps I may explain what I mean. This afternoon my hon. Friend the Member for Tynemouth (Dame Irene Ward) spoke about the East Coast. There are many ports, including one in my constituency, which were very much harmed during the war. Industry was practically driven away and the ports became more or less armed camps. Also, great damage was done to the towns. However, do hon. Members think that one could get a sizeable grant out of the Admiralty or the Government in order to repair the damage? Not at all. Yet had that been done in the case of my area&#x2014; which may well come within the provisions of the Bill&#x2014;it would probably have had the effect of making much of the provision of the Bill unnecessary in my constituency because it would have improved the town, made the port facilities better and brought revenue into my constituency.<br/>
I agree with my noble Friend the Member for Dorset, South (Viscount Hinchingbrooke), when he says that he is frightened of unfair competition; in

other words, the subsidising of private concerns in areas where others may be manufacturing the same sort of goods. There is that sort of subsidising of the one industry. There is also, the fact that this is gradually leading to a position in which there will be large holdings in many interests all over the country, which will simply make it easy for Socialism to nationalise those industries. It is one of the great dangers that may result from the Government granting money in this way to industries&#x2014;for the best of reasons, but, I think, wrongly. It is opening the way to those industries becoming flabby so that, at a later stage, the Government will have to take control of them.<br/>
Nor does it help that, because of this Bill, a spirit is getting abroad amongst people who may recently have fallen out of work of, "Why should I bother? Let the Government bring work to me." I have already come across this among one or two people in my constituency, and I am sure that other hon. Members, if they were frank, would say the same. That is a serious trend, because if people are not prepared to search for work it is extremely doubtful whether our economy will be very sound in the future.<br/>
I hope that the Government will take some warning from the attacks promised on parts of their financial policy by my noble Friend. I assure the Government that there are quite a few of us on this side who are worried about the apparent trend&#x2014;of course, we may be quite wrong &#x2014;towards Socialist policies in our finance.</p>

<p>During this discussion, I have gained the impression that some hon. Members have been seeking to convince the House that the present issue is whether or not the Government should give grants generally to private industries. That is not the case at all We are considering whether, in this Bill, the purpose of which&#x2014;supported, I think, by Members in all parts of the House&#x2014;is to deal with those areas where there is a lot of unemployment and real social distress, we should give authority to the Government to take certain action to protect the interests of communities which, generally speaking, have contributed largely to our economic wellbeing in the past.


As I understand it, by writing into Clause 4 this provision about grants the Government are following the precedent of the 1945 Act, Section 4 of which contained provisions for grants and loans to industrialists in certain circumstances. The Parliamentary Secretary will correct me if I am wrong, but my recollection is that not many grants were given under Section 4, and I do not think that envisages many grants being made under this Clause 4.<br/>
Let us consider, for a moment, whether there are not circumstances in which it would be very highly desirable that the President of the Board of Trade should have power to make a grant. I think all Members will support the later provisions about industrial development certificates. There are some congested areas, and some congested cities in particular, in relation to which we would all applaud the President of the Board of Trade if he were to refuse an application for an I.D.C.<br/>
In some cases, and it is not difficult to imagine this, the employer in a congested area who is refused an I.D.C. is invited to carry on his new development or his extension in, say, an area of high unemployment. He might be in quite a small way. He could say, as very large employers like the British Motor Corporation have been saying in recent weeks, "It would be hopelessly uneconomic for me to divide my factory." The smaller employer could argue with very great conviction that it would not be economic for him&#x2014;employing, perhaps, only 100, 200 or 300 workers&#x2014;to carry on his activities in two different parts of the country, perhaps 200 or 300 miles apart.<br/>
He might very well say to the right hon. Gentleman, "I cannot divide my industry. If you do not let me have an industrial development certificate in this congested city, you are really telling me that I cannot extend my business at all." The President of the Board of Trade might ask, "Could you not take the whole of your industry into this other area?" The industrialist might well answer that he could, if he got some assistance.<br/>
Would not all hon. Members think it right that the right hon. Gentleman should give that industrialist the assistance he needs to take his industry from the congested area to the area of high

unemployment, where he would carry through his expansion and employ, perhaps, another 100, 200 or 300 workers&#x2014;</p>

<p>I am sorry to interrupt my hon. Friend, but I disagree entirely. What small employer, and I am one, will think of spending his life training his employees in a very specialist trade only to see them dispersed like that? It is ridiculous to say that, in his lifetime, he could build up the same kind of specialist labour. The analogy is not good enough. If an employer has been building up a specialist business during his lifetime, I think that he is entitled to an I.D.C., and entitled to develop in the area in which he has spent his life.</p>

<p>I have not said that every employer in a specialised line of business who has a few specially-trained workers should always be refused an I.D.C., told to uproot himself and go elsewhere. Of course I have not. I have given an instance of what has occurred in the past. Employers have uprooted themselves, and they have taken their specially-trained workers to other parts of the country where houses and other accommodation have been specially provided for them.<br/>
If one wants to do anything at all to ease the great pressure of population on this great Metropolis, I should have thought that when we are spending millions of the taxpayers' money in building new towns and so on, we would not be averse to paying the removal costs of an industrialist going from here to unemployment areas in Wales, to the Merseyside, to north-east England, or to Scotland or elsewhere. It is the sensible thing to do. It is because I believe that it would be a great pity to deny the President of the Board of Trade the opportunity of doing this sort of thing that I hope that the noble Lord and his hon. Friends will not press the Amendment to a Division. In any case, I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will not feel able to accept it.<br/>
We on this side are not asking that wholesale grants of public money should be made available to industrialists to go into those difficult areas. We accept at


once that in the vast majority of cases no grants at all will be made but that, at the most, if they need capital, the industrialists will get a loan which they will repay over a period. That will be the general position. There is, however, the exceptional case, in which I think that all hon. Members would agree that a grant should be paid. It is, I hope, to cover the exceptional case that the Government have used these words and given the President of the Board of Trade this power. In those circumstances, we support this provision, and hope very much that the noble Lord's Amendment will not be widely supported.</p>

<p>From one point of view, I am very happy about the stand taken by the noble Lord the Member for Dorset, South (Viscount Hinchingbrooke). It is about time that someone gave publicity to the extent to which private enterprise is no longer quite so enterprising. To that extent we should be very grateful to him; but when we look at what he is trying to do we must bear in mind the purpose of the Bill. It is to bring employment to hard hit areas. I wish that the noble Lord or one of his hon. Friends had produced figures.<br/>
I have in my hand one or two figures given in an Answer on 17th December in relation to grants in Scotland, as compared with loans, under the financial aid provisions of the 1958 Act. Up to 16th December, which was well over a year after the passing of the Act, grants in Scotland amounted to only &#x00A3;8,250. Every one of them was to the counties of the Highlands and Islands&#x2014;just the very places where it is most difficult to get industry going. If the money had not been available, it would probably have meant only 300 or 400 jobs, but they would have been very important jobs when compared with the prospects of obtaining employment in those areas.<br/>
I ask the noble Lord to think again about this and to appreciate that he is deliberately seeking to take from the President of the Board of Trade a weapon which can be useful in certain circumstances. As far as I understand the Clause, the grants are not to be handed over freely. Conditions may well be laid down for repayment. I hope that

the Parliamentary Secretary will give us the figures for grants over the whole country so that the noble Lord may appreciate just how they have been given. I deplore very much indeed that in order to further a financial theory of his own the noble Lord is prepared to deprive such areas of much needed help.</p>

<p>The effect of the Amendment moved by my noble Friend the Member for Dorset, South (Viscount Hinchingbrooke) and seconded by my hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, West (Mr. Eden) would be to prevent the Board of Trade making grants under Clause 4 for undertakings in listed localities and confine the assistance we can offer firms to persuade them to move to such areas to loans. The corresponding section of the 1945 Act gave power to make annual grants as well as loans. Therefore, the present Bill does not create any new power in this respect, save that single once and for all grants can now be made. Moreover, I ask my hon. Friends to remember that the 1950 Act contained in Section 3 (1) a power, not repeated in the present Bill, to make grants in certain circumstances towards the cost of transferring an undertaking to a development area.<br/>
It is expected that the new committee which will advise the Board of Trade in most cases will recommend loans rather than grants. The hon. Members for Hamilton (Mr. T. Fraser) and Kilmarnock (Mr. Ross) were right in saying that very few grants indeed have been made under the 1958 Act. The reason for that is that we want to steer to the new localities only firms which have a good chance of being viable and becoming going concerns when they are no longer in receipt of Government assistance. It seems to us appropriate in some cases to make a grant to a firm to cover its once and for all expenses of setting up in places of high unemployment. We believe that the opportunity of obtaining grants for that purpose will be a useful incentive in persuading firms to go to such areas.<br/>
To lose this power, as suggested by my hon. Friends, would substantially impair the usefulness of the Bill. The supporters of the Amendment have urged, as did my hon. Friend the Member for Yarmouth (Mr. Fell), that in addition to involving the irrecoverable


outlay of public money grants given in these circumstances will give firms an unfair advantage over their competitors. If the grant is used as it is intended that it shall be&#x2014;primarily to cover once and for all expenses incurred in moving from the area in which the firm is at present doing business to the new area&#x2014;this will not be so. Its effect is only to offset the disadvantages from which the firm would otherwise suffer in moving. That is the purpose of Clause 4. I therefore recommend the House to reject the Amendment, unless my noble Friend can be persuaded to withdraw it.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1960-02-03a.1073.0" hansard_membership_id="7707" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/29425" speakername="Mr. Frederick Lee" colnum="1073" time="">
<p>My hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton (Mr. T. Fraser) accurately put the case for the Opposition. On the other hand, this is a delightful Amendment. The noble Lord mentioned the same point on Second Reading. When I wound up for the Opposition I ventured to say that I agreed with many of the points he made. I still do.<br/>
We are now reaching the point where so many of the larger undertakings which are still in private hands are able to maintain themselves in that position only if they receive a State subsidy of some kind. This naturally, from his own philosophical point of view, places the noble Lord in a position in which he foresees the danger of nationalisation being the only alternative to State grants. There is no answer to it. The noble Lord's dilemma is one which neither he nor any other Tory can answer.<br/>
My hon. Friend was right in pointing out that, in the main, the firms to which grants are given are not in the category of the great private monopolies which the noble Lord mentioned, as I did recently, that the Minister of Aviation is now busy creating. The right hon. Gentleman is going round the country smashing down the competition of private enterprise and replacing it by private monopoly. Although the terms and conditions are not known, we all know that that is being done by Government patronage, by the promise of contracts, perhaps by direct grants of public money; or, conversely, to those which will not enter into such an agreement, by the threat of the withholding of contracts, and so on. The noble Lord is

utterly right in saying that this is incompatible with Tory philosophy. I was pleased that on this issue he came back to what I am sure for him is a philosophical monstrosity, in that a Tory Government are conniving at that kind of thing.<br/>
I draw a distinction in this matter. The Bill envisages small firms still working under strictly private ownership, plying for profit. Yet we are asking them to uproot themselves and go to areas where there is the need for the provision of employment for unemployed people. I do not believe that the basis of the noble Lord's philosophical argument there applies. I am fortified in that by my feeling about the great motor firms which are going into certain Development Areas. I am very glad that they are. Some are going to Merseyside, and I am very glad of that. One has the feeling that the motor car manufacturers have sufficient financial strength not to have to depend on the Government to provide them with the finance to go to those areas.<br/>
This is a very great dilemma and I am sure that the noble Lord is utterly right on this point. If it were merely a question of that type of firm going into Development Areas I would support the Amendment, but, as my hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton pointed out, there are also the smaller firms which are financially incapable of making such a move without assistance. Where the once-and-for-all grant makes a difference to a firm's decision to move or stay where it is, I come down on the side of making the grant.<br/>
The hon. Member for Caithness and Sutherland (Sir D. Robertson) has a vast constituency. I cannot imagine many small firms being able to move from the Metropolis, or some other congested area, to the hon. Member's constituency to provide employment for people there unless they are given initial grants. It is precisely those isolated areas which are mostly in need of the assistance which the Bill will provide.<br/>
The noble Lord has raised an issue of which the House will hear a great deal for many years. We are now in a state of flux with this kind of matter. It is wrong and immoral that vast sums of public money should be allocated to private enterprise merely so that private


enterprise can maintain private monopolies. We feel that once an industry has reached that position there is no alternative to public monopoly. I do not expect hon. Members opposite to agree with me about that, but that is the historical process which we are now seeing. I am very glad that the noble Lord has raised the subject, because I am very sure that the House will hear much more of the argument in the years to come.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Newton (Mr. Lee), the hon. Member for Hamilton (Mr. T. Fraser) and the hon. Member for Kilmarnock) (Mr. Ross) all clearly indicated that these grants were mostly likely to go to places like the Highlands. I think that they are absolutely right. I have been working on the problem of trying to persuade successive Governments to attract light industry to the old Highland towns and large villages, because unless industry goes to those areas their populations will continue to go away. It begins with unemployment, goes on to depopulation, and ends in decay.<br/>
In the nine years since 1951, the Government have failed to attract industry. I sometimes think that they lack the will, and I have said so in the House before. We have the experience of the extraordinary development which has occurred in the Six Counties of Northern Ireland where, through wise legislation in the Northern Ireland Parliament, and supported by finance from our Exchequer and great assistance from the Board of Trade and other Departments, 70,000 new jobs have been created in rural areas.<br/>
My noble Friend the Member for Dorset, South (Viscount Hinchingbrooke) mentioned the Renault factory out in the fields in France. Henry Ford started the original Ford factory in the fields outside Detroit, because he believed that the finest labour would be the labour of agricultural workers.</p>

<p>I am sorry if I have embroidered my case too much. It seems to me that this important matter

was fairly stated by hon. Members opposite and particularly by the hon. Member for Kilmarnock who named the figure of about &#x00A3;8,000&#x2014;under D.A.T.A.C., I presume&#x2014;which had been given so far and which had all gone to the Highlands and Islands of Scotland. Undoubtedly, without that assistance there would have been very few means of attracting new industry. I quoted the Northern Ireland example because that has been a matter for admiration by all and the improvement in those rural counties has come about with the aid of grants similar to these.<br/>
I do not agree with what the hon. Member for Newton said about aviation. I remember the motor industry when there were several hundred motor manufacturers. In those days, we could export very little and the cost of motor vehicles was high and the most successful succeeded and the weaker went to the wall. Today, we have large groups of private enterprise firms which have not had a penny of subsidy from anybody, but which have been able to produce cheaply and to attract a great export market. We have every reason to be proud of our motor industry when we think of the cost of vehicles today.<br/>
It seems that such firms are going to Scotland, where they are so much needed and where new employment is needed, without grants. I believe that the bulk of industries will go to Lancashire and the populated areas&#x2014;I do not think that my noble Friend need have any anxiety about that. However, to get firms into places where there is a serious maldistribution of population, I am convinced that the Bill is perfectly right in offering grants.</p>

<p>In Committee, the party opposite moved an Amendment whose object was to specify in virtually the same terms as appear in Section 3 (2) of the 1945 Act the basic services for which grants or loans may be made. We believe that the creation since 1945 of the nationalised corporations responsible for transport, electricity, gas and so on, makes the listing of the services less appropriate now than it was then in 1945. For that reason, the general definition contained in the draft Bill&#x2014;
<q>any service or facility on which the development of the locality in question &#x2026; depends"&#x2014;</q>
is preferred by us. But there is no objection to meeting the wish of hon. Gentlemen opposite that these services should be specified.<br/>
The Amendment meets in essential the wishes of right hon. and hon. Gentlemen opposite and differs in only two respects from the Amendment which they themselves proposed in Committee. One is that water, sewerage and sewage disposal are specified and they were not mentioned in the 1945 Act, but are in fact the services for which grants have been made under that Act and are most likely to be made in future.<br/>
The other is that housing and health, which were mentioned in 1945, are omitted. As my right hon. Friend pointed out in the debate in Committee, we think that it would be wrong to include housing, since the Ministers concerned already have power under existing legislation to assist the provision of houses to meet the urgent needs

of industry. Most of the public provision of health services is now financed through the National Health Service and such part of the service as is run by local authorities is included in the General Grant. On that ground, therefore, both housing and health are already covered under existing legislation.<br/>
The Amendment does not speak of services in or affecting the locality, as was proposed by hon. Gentlemen opposite. The reason is, I am advised, that those words add nothing. The question is whether the services would assist the development of a listed place and, as my right hon. Friend made clear, it is only local and not national facilities which will be assisted under this Clause.</p>

<p>The Parliamentary Secretary has very largely met the point we put forward and has now included a list of facilities. The only anxiety we have is whether, by including these individual items, he may, on a legal interpretation, be excluding some item not specifically named. We had it in mind, therefore, to suggest that the word "whatsoever"- should be inserted which, so I understand from those more learned than I in these matters, would ensure that nothing was unintentionally omitted.<br/>
Is the hon. Gentleman satisfied that he is achieving by the form of his Amendment what I think we all want to achieve, or would the insertion of the word "whatsoever" help?</p>

<p>I am very much concerned about housing. Housing is not covered in the Bill, but the Parliamentary Secretary says it is covered by our housing and health legislation. I implore him to be perfectly sure about that.<br/>
North of the Border, we have experienced great difficulty, when endeavouring to induce industrialists to come to the areas hardest hit by unemployment, in persuading the Scottish Department of Health to allow the local authority to provide houses for this very purpose. I readily agree that, in respect of other services, our distribution of industry legislation does work. I recall one of the largest water reservoirs in Scotland being grant-aided under the old Distribution of Industry Act.<br/>
Unfortunately, I can see nothing in writing which would in any way govern housing. This is a very serious problem, particularly in my part of the country. We have there what is estimated to be one of the largest industrial estates in Scotland, known as Newhouse&#x2014;the Joint Under-Secretary of State for Scotland knows the area very well&#x2014;but there has not been a single house built for any part of that estate. It took a long time to induce the Department in Edinburgh to allow us to build houses for some of the other parts of the county of which I have the honour to be one of its representatives.<br/>
Will the Parliamentary Secretary assure us that he is absolutely convinced, without any reservations whatever, that housing for this purpose will be covered by our ordinary housing legislation? I ask him to say that in order to clear the air and convince everyone that the Scottish Department of Health has ample powers to provide for this need or agree to such provision on representations made by the appropriate local authorities.<br/>
We have experienced tremendous difficulties. It took us years to persuade the Department to allow us to provide some houses which were urgently required. We even asked our own particular Scottish institution, the Scottish Special Housing Association, whether it could provide houses. The Department refused. These houses were required principally for industrial workers, not for the general needs of the community, yet the Department still refused to allow our own Association to provide them.<br/>
It is plain that this matter must be clarified before the Bill passes to its next stage. I hope the hon. Gentleman will assure the House that there will be no deterrence from the housing administration if we are, indeed, to fulfil the objects of this part of the Bill by allocating appropriate housing accommodation to meet the requirements of industry.</p>

<p>There are certain dangers in specification. I should be grateful to my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary if he would give an assurance to the House about roads. One of the most important matters in operations to be carried out under the Bill after it becomes an Act will be the provision of roads to sites and road facilities on sites. Can my hon. Friend assure us that this form of words will, in practice, cover the provision of a new road to a site and will include the improvement of an existing road? These are some of the practical questions which will agitate county borough authorities in particular when dealing with operations under the Bill.</p>

<p>I support the plea made by my hon. Friends. We must have a statement from the Parliamentary Secretary which will satisfy the House and also an undertaking from him about how the matter will be approached.<br/>
It is well known that one of the most serious problems with which Britain is now faced is the imbalance between North and South. In the South, generally speaking, there exists a great shortage of manpower. There is enormous industrial capacity, and this capacity is, in the main, being used to the maximum extent possible at the moment. But, if it were run really as it should be in order to achieve the best results, the maximum number of people should be employed


on either two or three shifts. This, however, cannot, in many instances, be done because of the shortage of manpower in the South.<br/>
In the North, there is a relatively large number of unemployed and people on short time. Therefore, one of the most urgent needs in the country today is to introduce a greater mobility of labour. When I was younger I was prepared to travel anywhere and prepared to move Provided that suitable housing was available. In the main, there was. In these days, as is well known, no matter how magnanimous employers may be in incentives to their workpeople to move, there is the fundamental stumbling block of a shortage of houses.<br/>
In the administration of the Bill, as I say, one of the basic needs will be to introduce in some way&#x2014;I am glad to see that the Minister of Labour is here&#x2014;greater mobility of labour. We cannot, however, expect people to move unless, within reason, they are provided with incentives. Most British people are reasonable people, and, provided they are treated fairly and given a square deal, they will respond to the needs of the situation. But we cannot expect young people, in particular, to move to places where there is not housing accommodation.<br/>
7.30 p.m.<br/>
My area has relatively the finest housing record in the country. It is true that we are now building very few houses, but this is because we are subject to the most reactionary Minister of Housing that I have known since the end of the war. Housing policy is now more reactionary than the policy of any other Minister in this or any other Government. How the Minister of Housing and Local Government can answer the Questions which he does&#x2014;</p>

<p>I respect the Chair, Mr. Speaker, but I have the Clause and Amendments before me. The Amendments deal with the provision of lighting, heating, disposal of facilities and the

<p>In so far as the question of housing can be said to arise, I think that the real issue appears to be whether or not there is need to make express provision in the Amendment relating to housing with the Minister saying that there are other powers so that, therefore, the provision need not be there.</p>

<p>I am grateful for your guidance, Mr. Speaker. It was on those lines that I proposed to proceed. Maybe I had slightly irritated you, Mr. Speaker, by speaking of the Minister in the way that I did, but I make no apology for that because it is what I really believe. It is not my intention to go out of order in any way, and therefore I shall not pursue the matter any further provided everyone remembers what I said about that Minister.<br/>
We have a large amount of derelict land in our area. No one knows that better than the Minister of State, whom I am glad to see in his place. He will remember, in the days when he travelled North, the terrible eyesores of derelict land. I should like him to remember the scenes which he passed when travelling in the train between Kidsgrove and Stoke-on-Trent. There is derelict land which has been there for over fifty years. Nothing at all has been done about it. We want houses built in this area and we want to attract more industry.<br/>

<p>I wish to comment on the Amendment in page 5, line 30. In my constituency, we are faced with a very large unemployment problem in the shipyards. Part of it is due to the fact that builders are unable to quote for large ships and have to depend on the building of small ships. If the waterways could be widened&#x2014;and it is quite on the cards that that could be done easily&#x2014;shipyards would be able to quote for much larger ships.<br/>
I hope that, as a result of the Amendment, special provision will be made in respect of aid to carry out such basic work as the widening of waterways. If that were done it would make a very considerable difference to the unemployment position in my own home port of Lowestoft. I hope that my hon. Friend will pay attention to this point and that, when we make our application after the passing of the Bill, he will receive it favourably.</p>

<p>By leave of the House, I will answer the points put to me by various hon Members.<br/>
I do not think that there is any need to specify housing in the Amendment because, as I said in moving it, the Ministers concerned have appropriate powers under existing legislation. There is nothing to prevent a housing authority providing houses for existing as well as prospective tenants. I am confident that at present there is no need to include such a provision in the Bill.<br/>
In answer to the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Sutton (Mr. I. Fraser), private approach roads would be covered in the Bill but not the main road system.<br/>
We have power under the Bill to deal with derelict land if it would add to the amenities of the area and make it more attractive to industrialists to locate their industries in it.<br/>
The question of my hon. Friend the Member for Lowestoft (Mr. Prior) is one which I cannot answer immediately. The prime test whether those projects of which he spoke would qualify for assistance under the Bill is, of course, whether they would provide employment or would relieve the unemployment problem in the area and whether the money so expended would be commensurate with the amount of employment provided. I shall be willing to look into any individual cases which my hon. Friend may send me.</p>

My right hon. Friend the President of the Board of Trade undertook to consider all these Amendments, but made it clear, I think, at that stage that the Amendment which impressed him most was the provision for the inclusion of a trade union representative.<br/>
With regard to the increase in number from five to seven, my right hon. Friend said&#x2014;and I must say that I have great sympathy with him, as I am sure many hon. Members on both sides of the House have&#x2014;that he would like to keep the number at five&#x2014;a chairman and four members. It will be the experience of most hon. Members that the smaller a committee, the better job it does.<br/>
Concerning the possible inclusion of a local government representative, the right hon. Member also said in Committee that it would be a pity to bring people with a local authority viewpoint


into a sphere where it was not appropriate; it would only waste their time and, possibly, lead to a corporation with more people than were needed. The Government Amendment, in conformity with the provisional views expressed by the right hon. Member in Committee, provides for each corporation to include a person having
<q>adequate experience in the organisation of workers</q>
but does not provide for a local government representative or for an increase in numbers.

<p>Here again, the Parliamentary Secretary comes some way to meet us but feels himself inhibited, as usual, from coming the whole way.

I cannot agree with the hon. Gentleman that local authority representatives would not be suitable. Several of the industrial estate companies in the past fifteen or twenty years have had persons who were experienced in local authority work, particularly on building and land, with the estate management type of qualification. It is not fundamental to the Bill whether this is included. It is a pity that the Parliamentary Secretary has left it out, but I hope that even though he does not now lay a statutory duty upon himself to include local authority experts, the Government are not prohibiting themselves from selecting somebody of that kind if there is an individual who seems to them particularly suitable far the job.</p>

<q>We are examining the pension schemes which the companies have been running and we shall ensure that the rights of the officers concerned will not be adversely affected by the Bill. If it is found necessary, I will table an appropriate Amendment at a later stage to cover this."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 9th December, 1959; Vol. 615, c. 685.]</q>
The Amendments give effect to my right hon. Friend's undertaking. The first Amendment is a tidying-up. consequential Amendment only.<br/>
The second Amendment introduces provisions designed to ensure that the

pensions and life assurance schemes now operated by the estate companies for the benefit of their employees will continue to operate satisfactorily after the transfer of the rights and liabilities of those companies and of their staff to the management corporations created by Clause 9 of the Bill.<br/>
Clause 13 (2) makes provision for a general transfer of the rights and liabilities of estate companies to the management corporations. This subsection effects certain of the necessary changes in the pension and life assurance schemes. It will, for example, result in the transfer to the appropriate management corporations of the obligations of estate companies to pay contributions under the scheme.<br/>
Clause 13 (2) does not, however, go far enough. It is necessary to do more than transfer the rights and liabilities of the estate companies. The provisions set out in the Amendment are required to effect the following changes. Paragraph (<i>a</i>) is couched in wide and general terms. It is necessary because certain of the pension schemes provide, for example, that notices in writing have to be deposited with the relevant estate company. Obviously, once the Bill comes into operation, it will be desirable that such deposits should be with the appropriate management corporation. Paragraph (<i>a</i>) effects this change. It also deals with the situation where the right to appoint trustees of a pension scheme is vested not in an estate company itself, but in its directors. The right would not be transferred to the appropriate management corporation by Clause 13 (2), but it will be so transferred by this new provision.<br/>
Paragraph (<i>b</i>) is necessary because certain of the pension schemes are so worded that the transfer of employees in the estate companies to the employment of the management corporation would have to be regarded by the trustees of the scheme as terminating their employment with the company in question and, therefore, <i>ipso facto</i> terminating their membership of the scheme.<br/>
Paragraph (<i>c</i>) deals simply with matters requiring to be done under pension schemes at the registered offices of an estate company. It provides that they should require to be done at the head


office of the appropriate management corporation.<br/>
The last three lines of the Amendment provide for the necessary textual changes to be made in the light of the provisions of the Amendment when reading any document connected with the pensions or life-assurance schemes.<br/>
I hope that the House will accept the Amendments. I think that they are in line with the undertaking which my right hon. Friend gave.</p>

<p>The Minister has gone a great deal of the way to meet some of the criticisms made in Committee by the hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) and myself. He has not gone the whole way, and I am wondering whether, even at this stage, it would be possible for him to look again at one of the other problems that arise over the transfer of staffs from the old companies to the new corporations.<br/>
Two points arose when we discussed this matter in Committee. One was the question of the pension schemes applicable to the staff, and the other, which was in two parts, concerned, one, the changing or possible changing of status of some members of the staff, and two, the possible redundancy of some other members of the staff. The Minister then indicated quite clearly that there was no guarantee that under the new setup the same number of staff would be required. He admitted that there might well be changes in the status and functions of the staff that would be required.<br/>
I feel that the Minister should look more closely at the question of the possibility of staff redundancy, particularly in view of the fact that we are in practice now dealing with the whole question of unemployment. In my view, the functions and degree of activity of the new corporations, in comparison with the old trading companies, will mean a reduction of staff. There is no provision whatsoever in this Measure to face up to the responsibility of dealing with those redundancies.<br/>
The question of compensation has now become acceptable, in a large measure, throughout the whole of industry. The principle of compensation for loss of jobs, both of staff personnel and workpeople, is one that has received a great deal of

attention in the last few years. I should have thought that the Minister would have faced up to this because even the Government accept the principle of compensation for unemployment and because it will be recalled that one of the conditions for the assistance given to the cotton industry was that the industry would be prepared to negotiate with the trade unions adequate compensation for redundant staff as a result of the reorganisation.<br/>
Then there is the question of the changing of the top management of the old companies, some of whom will not he required to do their present jobs under the new corporations. I think that the Minister might well have a closer look at the possibility of dealing with the position of redundant personnel of the old companies and compensation for loss of jobs for those people who will no longer be required in top management under the new corporations.</p>

<p>I rise only to thank the Parliamentary Secretary and his right hon. Friend for now including in the Bill at least part of the Amendment which I tabled in Committee. I am indeed grateful for his dealing with the pensions side of this problem. With regard to the remarks of the hon. Gentleman the Member for Gloucestershire, West (Mr. Loughlin) on the other part of the problem which he and I discussed in Committee, I think it may be that the Bill already covers it. If the management corporations take on the liabilities of the existing undertakings, then they surely take on the liability to compensate if redundancy occurs.</p>

<p>I think that from the fact that there is doubt between the hon. Gentleman and myself calls for some explanation from my hon.

<p>In answer to the hon. Gentleman the Member for Gloucestershire, West (Mr. Loughlin) and my hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page), they are quite right in thinking that every employee of a company becomes on the appointed day an employee under the same conditions of service of the appropriate corporation and his employment thereafter will be governed by contract of service as it is now. I think that the point which has been made by the hon. Member for Gloucestershire, West will be adequately taken care of.</p>

<p>Is it not a fact that the sum total of the contract of service merely necessitates the requisite notice of termination of employment if the person concerned is redundant? Provided that the requisite notice of termination of employment is given, then the contract under the provisions of this Bill is carried out and there is no compensation or provision for compensation of any kind for those people who are moved from job to job or who become redundant.</p>

<p>Surely this is a point worth labouring. The difficulty in the textile industry was that the question of compensation was not written into the agreement and it was only by virtue of the fact that the firms themselves were prepared to pay that those concerned actually got it. Can the Minister say whether people at present employed are liable for compensation in the event of redundancy, because if not, there is no point in taking over the liabilities if those liabilities to the workmen do not exist.</p>

<p>I have no detailed knowledge of the actual contracts of service of the employees of the various companies. All the contractual obligations to the companies are transferred to the corporations and each employee of the companies will become, on the appointed day, an employee of the corporations, and all the same obligations of the companies will be transferred to the corporations.</p>

<p>I wonder whether the Parliamentary Secretary, as he has no intimate knowledge of the details of the contract between the present employers and employees, will again look at this matter if what my hon. Friend the Member for Gloucestershire, West (Mr. Loughlin) has said is correct, that the new Corporation when created can escape any obligation to pay compensation to servants in their employment by reason of a previous commitment which gave them the right to sever the employment provided that they gave the requisite notice. That requisite notice would not be the means to use in a takeover such as this. if we can have some undertaking tonight that the Government will look at it in order that some protective provision will be put in if things are like that, I am certain the House will be very pleased.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 12, line 8, after "employment" to insert:
<q>and for providing research and development which would lead to employment".</q>
In spite of the provocation of my hon. Friend the Member for Central Ayrshire (Mr. Manuel), I move this Amendment. He ought not to have said that this Amendment in the name of the hon. Member for Bute and North Ayrshire (sir F. Maclean) has "my" support.

He should have said it has "our" support. I was trained in one of the largest industrial establishments, where, before the war, they spent &#x00A3;150,000 a year on research, which was more than most industries as a whole in Britain were spending on research. The reason they spent that amount was that it was a good business proposition; they had to spend it to keep pace with foreign competition and to hold their own in the world. It is very annoying, when one is involved in this kind of research and development, and if one has developed a new product which needs a new factory for its manufacture, if the factory is taken to some other part of the country and one is not even considered.<br/>
To avoid any misunderstanding on this, let me make it quite clear, speaking for myself and for those with whom I am very friendly, that there is no section of the community in this country more friendly disposed than we are to those who suffer from unemployment. There are very few people to stand for a national overall plan such as I stand for, because I believe it is in the best interests of our country. My fellow countrymen, including my own party, do not accept the fundamental ideas, on which I do not compromise, for planning our economy in the way in which it should be planned in accordance with our national needs and international position, and it is with those in mind that I move this Amendment.<br/>
I am reminded of the position in my own locality in North Staffordshire. We spend a large amount on research, and some time ago His Royal Highness the Duke of Edinburgh opened a large extension of premises there and made a very fine speech showing the need for scientific research. To undertake research of that character means an enormous expenditure. If, having embarked upon that expenditure, one is faced with the proposition to carry out the development in another area, it is most unfair.<br/>
So what we are asking for in this Amendment is that consideration should be given to the needs of an area where research has been carried out, and where research has been carried out leading to development. I am mostly familiar with development in engineering and in pottery. By this Amendment we say that, all things being equal, if the requirements of the locality are such that


more employment is needed there, and the research and development leads to employment, that ought to be considered. For this and other reasons, I beg to move the Amendment.</p>

<p>I beg to second the Amendment.<br/>
It is most unusual that we should have an Amendment put down by four Members on the Government side and my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South (Mr. Ellis Smith), and that none of the hon. Members on the Government side is here to move the Amendment, particularly as it is an Amendment which they have now put down twice, once for consideration by the Committee on the Bill and again now on Report. It really is a disgraceful piece of shadow boxing to put down words suggesting that they are actively concerned with research and development and then to run away when the time comes to move the Amendment in the House. I think we are indebted to my hon. Friend who did see the importance of this Amendment and moved it.<br/>
At this time of night, and in view of the amount we have still to do before we finish with the Bill, I do not wish to keep the House for more than a few moments, but it does seem to me that the insertion of these words in the Bill can do nothing but good. I think that everyone now recognises the importance of research and development, and to insert these words in a Clause dealing with the factors to be taken into account in issuing industrial development certificates will be helpful. It will place upon the Board of Trade the obligation to recognise the importance of this.<br/>
I hope that the Parliamentary Secrtary is going to accept this Amendment. I rather gather that he may be, in view of the way he is straining at the leash to get to the Dispatch Box. On most occasions during our proceedings on the Bill Ministers have not been too anxious to get to the Dispatch Box. We have had almost to drag them to it by various tactics.</p>

<p>Not true? Had the hon. Gentleman been present at all our proceedings on the Bill &#x2014;I think he has been present at most of them&#x2014;he would know

that we have had to go to considerable lengths to get the Minister to the Dispatch Box on occasion. However, I can see that the hon. Gentleman is really dying to tell us that he is going to accept this excellent Amendment and to congratulate the Opposition on their courage and initiative in moving the Amendment, and on the fact that they have sufficient interest in the Bill to be present during the discussion of it, which is more, apparently, than can be said for the Government supporters.

<p>If I am straining at the leash it is merely because I regret very much that I played my part in agreeing with my hon. Friends whose names appear in support of the Amendment that it might be more appropriate if they raised the matter on Third Reading rather than at this stage, because I am sure that they would have moved it in better terms than did the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South (Mr. Ellis Smith) and the hon. Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis).<br/>
The hon. Member for Edinburgh, East talks as if the object of the Amendment was to help us to recognise at the Board of Trade the importance of research and development. We, of course, recognise that very much and we do not need the Amendment to remind us. The object of the Amendment, I thought, and I am sure it was the intention of my hon. Friend, was to make clear that firms would be discouraged from establishing research and development projects in the south of England where a disproportionate amount of this work is taking place. It is argued that once a research and development project has been set up there is a tendency and a pressure for production to be put next to it or located near it.<br/>
That is a very valid point, but the Clause as drafted completely covers it because it provides that
<q>in considering whether any development for which a certificate under the principal enactment &#x2026; is applied for can be carried out consistently with the proper distribution of industry, the Board shall have particular regard to the need for providing appropriate employment in the localities &#x2026;</q>
where it is high and persistent. I can give an assurance that in considering


applications for industrial development certificates, either for a research and development project or for a productive undertaking alleged to need to be near its research unit, the Board will take account of the need to provide employment in the listed localities.<br/>
This is the policy at the moment and we shall not weaken in it. It would be wrong to specify this one consideration among the many which the Board must have in mind in dealing with applications for industrial development certificates. Indeed, to specify research might be taken to mean that considerations of distribution and diversification of industry and the proper use of local resources did not matter very much. The concept of the proper distribution of industry, with particular regard to the needs of unemployment areas, covers the case.<br/>
It is also important to bear in mind that not all research work involves the carrying on of an industrial process. [An HON. MEMBER: "Reading too quickly."] It is only when the structure in which research is to be carried on is an industrial building within the meaning of Clause 22 that an industrial development certificate is necessary, and for this reason I hope that the Amendment will be withdrawn or rejected.</p>

<p>The Parliamentary Secretary's conduct is almost as odd as that of the original backers of the Amendment. It is oddly characteristic of the Tory Party that five hon. Members opposite should have put their names to the Amendment twice, for which quite strong arguments can be adduced, and when the time comes round to consider it on an important Bill like this, affecting the employment of millions of people, just because, as I suppose, it is dinner time, there is nobody on the Tory benches except the Parliamentary Private Secretary who has to be there compulsorily whether he likes it or not. I see that another hon. Member has just arrived rather belatedly but not in time to move the Amendment. I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South (Mr. Ellis Smith) on having had the initiative and the wit to be in his place and to move this important Amendment. On top of all that, the Parliamentary Secretary gets

up and makes a gratuitous attack on my hon. Friends, I suppose in order to conceal the flimsiness of the arguments which he has just put before the House.<br/>
8.15 p.m.<br/>
I do not think that the Parliamentary Secretary can contest the substance, that it is not only desirable to get direct employment to the areas which need it but that it is also desirable to see that there are research establishments which might provide employment later on. I remember that back in 1945 when the location of the Harwell Atomic Energy Establishment was being discussed I advocated that this original establishment should go to one of the Development Areas. That was turned down because all the scientists wanted to be near Oxford University. The result has been, as we suspected, that having got Harwell in Berkshire we were then told that the station now at Aldermaston had to be near Harwell.<br/>
I do not think that the Parliamentary Secretary seriously contests all this, but in spite of that he tells us that there is no need for the Amendment. What possible objection can there be to putting these words in the Bill? The hon. Gentleman says the matter is covered already by words such as "distribution of industry" and "diversification" in the other Clause, but if he thinks that the words are there already I do not see what objection there can be to accepting the Amendment. These are perfectly plain words which merely express an argument which the hon. Gentleman has already been compelled to accept. Has the hon. Gentleman any really good reason, despite the extraordinary conduct of his hon. Friends, for so obstinately rejecting the Amendment?</p>

<p>The conduct of the Parliamentary Secretary's hon. Friends, who are not behind him and really ought to be, is something which calls for comment. I see that the first name to the Amendment is that of the hon. Member for Bute and North Ayrshire (Sir F. Maclean). I would not say that he was an Ayrshire man, for he is a recent import. He now represents Bute and North Ayrshire but he was the former hon. Member for Lancaster. It is surprising to me that he is not here to


proclaim the needs of his area, in respect of exactly this kind of research and development. It shows a rather tepid sort of enthusiasm for development and the provision of work for that area if the hon. Gentleman cannot spare a few hours' time to be here, if only to give the Minister an opportunity to make the statement which he has just made. But for the Parliamentary astuteness of my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South (Mr. Ellis Smith) the statement would never have been made.</p>

<p>The hon. Members concerned certainly owe an explanation to the House. They had an Amendment on the Order Paper which they were neither prepared to withdraw nor yet to move, but the Parliamentary Secretary says that he advised them to raise the matter on Third Reading. At times when there is a point in relation to a Money Resolution and we ask whether it is in order to raise it at that stage we are told that it is not; and it is not the hon. Gentleman's province but that of the Chair to say what is in order on Third Reading. Since there is no mention of research and development in the Clause, any reference to it might well be ruled out of order on Third Reading. The Parliamentary Secretary's Parliamentary experience is not terribly long, but he should appreciate that discussion on Third Reading is very tight and is confined to what is actually in the Bill.<br/>
The subject matter of the Amendment is so important in relation to research and development that we thought that it should be in the Bill, and we still think so. The hon. Gentleman told us that he was concerned about the concentration of research projects which tends generally to lead to the siting of development projects in certain areas outside the present Development Areas. Is not that sufficient reason why this change should

be made here? The hon. Gentleman has been longer at the Board of Trade than his right hon. Friend. Is he telling us that the Board of Trade has been lax in this respect? He tells us, "Leave things alone. We have powers under legislation which continues the present position that will enable us to do what the House desires."<br/>
Not long ago a delegation of Scottish Members of Parliament went to see the Minister for Science about the siting of an atomic research establishment in the South of England. This is not ancient history. That is what has been done, and is being done now, despite the fact that the powers are there, as the Minister has said. I am referring to the siting of an atomic research establishment somewhere near Oxford. We felt that this should go to the Development Areas and we mentioned that Scotland was one such suitable area. We were fobbed off with the same kind of answer.<br/>
In each instance we are given plenty of reasons why such projects could not go to the Development Areas. Can the hon. Gentleman wonder that we are concerned to ensure that such projects are properly considered in relation to the granting of certificates?<br/>
Can the hon. Gentleman wonder at my lack of enthusiasm when I hear about a new tractor factory going to a part of Scotland? We have one in my constituency already, which we got without the benefit of this Bill under Labour Government legislation. In fact, anything to do with Scotland can be done without this Bill. The point is that Massey-Ferguson have announced that they are moving that tractor factory, its development unit, from Kilmarnock and taking it back to Coventry. May I take it then that, using the powers which he says are there without this instruction to the Board of Trade, the Minister will take steps to prevent that happening and will ensure that the unit now in Kilmarnock, which is partly research and development, will remain where it started instead of going to the Midlands?<br/>
We are concerned about the Board of Trade not exercising its present powers, and we are concerned to ensure that by putting these words in the Clause it will be plain to everyone dealing with the question that these matters must be specifically considered. The hon. Gentleman said that if we put in those words


it would mean that all the emphasis would be on them and that all the other considerations would be forgotten. It does not work that way. The fact is that we would be adding only a phrase and joining to the words already there, which he considers sufficient, the words:
<q>and for providing research and development which would lead to employment.</q>
Does the hon. Gentleman still think that is limiting or tending to limit? No, it is an extension, an amplification. If the hon. Gentleman wishes to particularise, he will find these words in subsection (2) of Clause 7&#x2014;" &#x2026; in particular of industrial undertakings therein.&#x2026;" That phrase does not rule out other considerations, as the hon. Gentleman told us during the Committee stage, so he should be logical and consistent.<br/>
This Amendment is a clarification, an amplification and an emphasising of the power that exists, that should be there and that should be used. The hon. Gentleman admitted to the House his own concern about this, so let that concern be further displayed by accepting the Amendment, which has been more clearly explained by my hon. Friend than it could have been by the transient Scotsman whose name headed the list of those supporting the Amendment but who has not seen fit to be here.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1960-02-03a.1101.0" hansard_membership_id="3309" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/14082" speakername="Mr. Dempsey" colnum="1101" time="">
<p>I support the Amendment. I am surprised at the attitude of the Parliamentary Secretary, which seems to me to be a contradiction in terms. In his original remarks the hon. Gentleman indicated that he accepted the Amendment in principle, but eventually arrived at the culminating factor when he said that he did not think it was appropriate. So here we have what is in my view an important Amendment which meets with his approval, but apparently the timing is indiscreet, and because of its importance the hon. Gentleman sets out to give the House certain assurances. I am sure that hon. and right hon. Members appreciate those assurances, but would it not be much better if the hon. Gentleman converted them into writing and agreed to their insertion in the Bill? There may be other Parliamentary Secretaries in the days that lie ahead and I do not think they will accept his responsibility in offering assurances. Accordingly, it is not unreasonable to

be asking that the House should be adequately safeguarded by having those assurances in writing.<br/>
It is obvious to me that it is essential to re-allocate diversified industry&#x2014;a contention we accepted during the Committee stage. It is also equally important to have the allocation of research projects sited in certain areas which require them. It is reasonable, in accordance with the words of the Clause and the Amendment, that the Board of Trade should have regard to that factor before issuing industrial development certificates.<br/>
It is a well-known fact that, where there are attractive research units, certain types of consequential employment automatically follow. If the Parliamentary Secretary cares to look at certain Development Areas initiated under the old Distribution of Industry Act, he will find that consequential employment followed the establishment of research units, whether it was the mechanism of motor cars or even the manufacture of road material. Therefore, the hon. Gentleman should realise that this is also important in combating unemployment.<br/>
There is another particular aspect which the Parliamentary Secretary should take into consideration. Apart from the general employment aspect, we have to bear in mind individuals looking for employment, such as students leaving our central institutions and universities. They are prepared to equip themselves mentally and physically, with a view to serving our country. Yet I know that students leaving a Scottish university require to look for the type of research employment which they want to do in the Midlands or the south of England.<br/>
I have in my possession a letter from a student at Glasgow University begging me to use all my influence to impress upon the Minister the need to encourage the siting of research units in parts of the country where there is a need to provide employment of this nature, so that students can serve the country without having to leave home. Surely the hon. Gentleman is bound to acknowledge the validity of that point of view. If he does, he can respond to it in a very simple fashion&#x2014;by accepting the Amendment instead of giving a verbal assurance.</p>

<p>I implore the Parliamentary Secretary to reconsider the matter. I compliment my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South (Mr. Ellis Smith) upon his persistence and remaining in the Chamber although his name was fourth on the list of the names attached to the Amendment.<br/>
I wish to add to what has been said by my hon. Friend the Member for Coatbridge and Airdrie (Mr. Dempsey) about young students. I would impress upon the Parliamentary Secretary that one of the reasons for bringing forward the Bill was the dire state of many of our coal mining areas at present. Not long ago I had the fortune to spend a day at the National Coal Board experimental research station at Stoke Orchard, near Cheltenham, where processes have been developed for producing coal by-products. No one in his senses would deny that if the coal industry is to succeed it must very quickly develop by-products. In my constituency there is a "Phurnacite" plant, producing smokeless fuel, a very successful venture indeed which employs about 500 or 600 men and supplies areas such as London and the north of England with this very fine coal by-product.<br/>
Cannot the Parliamentary Secretary see that if, for example, in my area&#x2014;fortunately, we do not need it at the moment, but I can envisage such a need in the future&#x2014;we could have a research station concerned with new forms of coal by-products certain demands would be satisfied? It would be doing the very thing that my hon. Friend mentioned, providing vacancies for young students in the locality. I had a sad experience at Stoke Orchard. I asked the young students where they came from and found that their homes included Aberdare, Rhondda and Swansea. If there had been a research station in their own locality these young lads could have remained at home. There is a great future for by-products such as "Shape". A plant might be installed in an area when a colliery closed down, and about 500 displaced men could then be immediately employed.<br/>
I implore the Parliamentary Secretary to make certain that this sort of thing will happen by embodying such a provision in the Bill.</p>

<p>Then the hon. Gentleman tells us that he has now dissuaded his hon. Friends from being in the Chamber to attend to their business and justify their words. However, I would point out to hon. Members who are present that it is a little more shocking than that because the Amendment has had publicity in the Press and, accordingly, people are expecting us to discuss its subject matter, the provision of research and development which would lead to employment. There have been reports in the local Press in the constituencies of these hon. Members and I think that amounts to sailing under false colours. We should be stern in our condemnation of such tactics.<br/>
I am sure the House will agree that this Amendment is necessary. May I compliment my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South (Mr. Ellis Smith) on his ingenuity and courage in moving the Amendment, despite the fact that he did not have the support of his hon. Friends to bolster up the strong arguments which he advanced. Alone and unaided, my hon. Friend strode into conflict with the President of the Board of Trade and the Parliamentary Secretary&#x2014;</p>

<p>I do not wish to get out of order, but I think, Mr. Deputy-Speaker, that you would agree that it would not be in order to discuss this Amendment during the Third Reading debate and that it was not good reasoning on the part of the Parliamentary Secretary.<br/>
I consider this Amendment of particular importance to Scotland. My hon. Friend the Member for Kilmarnock (Mr. Ross) mentioned that there had been a deputation from the Scottish Parliamentary Labour Group to the Minister for Science to express to him our keen anxiety that we should get a research development unit in Scotland, and that the

atomic energy installation&#x2014;for peacetime pursuits may I say&#x2014;should not be sited in the south of England. I understand that the deputation failed in its objective, but in Scotland at any rate we have a particular interest in this matter.<br/>
The Parliamentary Secretary knows that frequent reference has been made in this House to the plight of the constituency of Greenock over the question of heavy unemployment there. Despite that, by a deliberate act of Government policy the torpedo research factory has been moved from Greenock to the south of England. If Clause 18 had buttressed&#x2014;[<i>Interruption.</i>] I am delighted to see reinforcements slowly rolling up. I want hon. Members who are present to be seized of the importance of this aspect of the matter. We should have had a much stronger argument for retention of the torpedo research establishment at Greenock rather than its removal to the South of England if this Bill had already become an Act and Clause 18 contained the words:
<q>and for providing research and development which would lead to employment</q>
I feel that we have said quite enough for the Parliamentary Secretary to be completely seized of the idea that we on this side of the House consider this very important. We are very weak on the question of research in Scotland. We should be giving far more help to Scottish industry and to Scottish industrialists if we were providing scope for our students coming from university to go into research establishments sited in Scotland. We should then be doing a great deal more for Scottish industry and providing many more jobs in Scotland than at present.</p>

<p>With the leave of the House, I wish to deal with some of the points which have been raised. First, I am sorry that in trying to defend my hon. Friends against what I thought, perhaps wrongly, was an attack by the hon. Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis) I unwittingly did a disservice to the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South (Mr. Ellis Smith). I apologise for that, and withdraw it. I think the hon. Member showed initiative by being in his place when the Amendment was called, even though he was fourth on the list of those under whose names the Amendment appears. Perhaps in defending my hon. Friends I did him that disservice, but I certainly did not advise my hon. Friends to leave the Chamber, nor dissuade them from being in the Chamber. I merely agreed with them that perhaps they would make their point more appropriately on Third Reading.<br/>
It is true that research and development problems are extremely important. It is also unfortunately true, as the right hon. Member for Battersea, North (Mr. Jay) knows only too well, that there is a tendency for scientists and research workers in general to want to be near Oxford, Cambridge or London. I believe that research and development are vital to our existence in the expansionist climate in which we are now living.<br/>
It would be wrong to specify any one consideration among the many to which we at the Board of Trade must have regard in the granting of I.D.Cs. It would be wrong of us to pick out this one element of research and development. If it were possible to steer research projects which provide employment to development districts, I should be one of the first to try to do it, but the major consideration must be whether the research and development projects are situated most efficiently to make their major contribution. That is the main point to which we at the Board of Trade must pay attention. If we can steer them, we certainly will. Many of them do not provide much employment and many do not require industrial premises.</p>

<p>I hope that other hon. Members will not mind if I point out that almost all the areas affected by this problem are areas where there is

a wonderful provision of education. I worked at one time with colleagues who were in the Ministry of Education. I know that if we look, for example, at the proportion of places provided in grammar schools, we find these areas at the top of the list. We want not only balanced industry but balanced population in these areas, and we must get young men and young women trained in our own grammar schools and working in these areas.</p>

<p>I said that we must bear in mind that we want a balanced population as well as balanced industry. The Minister says that he already has the power which we offer him. It has not been much used. Let us use it in the future. He also said something of vital importance when he admitted earlier that he realised that wherever these research establishments are located, they pull the industry after them. That is another reason why he should do everything within his power to steer them to these areas, because they will pull the other industries after them.</p>

<p>I said that there was a tendency to put productive units around research and development projects, and I therefore can give an assurance that where projects are steerable, we will steer them to the Development Areas. We have powers in the Bill and they need not be spelled out as they are in the Amendment. I deny the suggestion that we at the Board of Trade do not appreciate research and development; indeed we do, but it is only one of the criteria which we must take into account in granting an I.D.C. For that reason I must resist the Amendment.</p>

<p>The Minister says that by mentioning research and development we exclude other things which ought to be considered. We have already mentioned one factor&#x2014;"appropriate employment". If his argument were sound, that would mean that we have excluded everything else. Surely by making this addition we extend rather than exclude. The hon. Member's argument, while relevant to many Amendments which are moved from time to time, does not apply in the context of this Clause.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1960-02-03a.1109.0" hansard_membership_id="4636" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/31214" speakername="Mr. T. Fraser" colnum="1109" time="">
<p>I could not understand the Parliamentary Secretary when he said the he could not accept the Amendment because it particularises too much. Once we have reached this Clause, the Amendment is in its proper context. The Clause sets out the considerations which the Board will have in mind when deciding whether to grant an industrial development certificate, and it ends:
<q>&#x2026; the Board shall have particular regard to the need for providing appropriate employment in the localities mentioned in subsection (2) of section one of this Act.</q>
The Amendment seeks to insert the words on the Order Paper after the word "employment". The latter part of the subsection would then read:
<q>&#x2026; the Board shall have particular regard to the need for providing appropriate employment and for providing research and development which would lead to employment in the localities mentioned in subsection (2) of section one of this Act.</q>
That does not particularise to the exclusion of any other consideration. The hon. Member has mentioned the effect which research and development have on employment in this country.<br/>
Does the Parliamentary Secretary realise that in London and the South-East we have some 19 per cent. of the country's industrial workers and 28&#x00B7;8 per cent. of its research and development workers; and that, because of that, so many industrialists who apply for I.D.Cs. tell the President of the Board of Trade when he is inclined to refuse a certificate that they cannot afford to go elsewhere because all the research and development work on which their industry depends takes place in London and the South-East?<br/>
Perhaps I may give some figures at the opposite extreme. Looking at a table contained in the 1958 Report of the D.S.I.R.&#x2014;the last one published&#x2014;on this very subject, we find that in London and the South-East there is the greatest proportional excess of research and development workers over industrial workers of any part of Great Britain. In the Midlands the two are almost equated but, going beyond the Midlands, we suddenly find a movement in the opposite direction.<br/>
The further north one goes the smaller the proportion of research and development workers and the larger the proportion of industrial workers. So, when

we get to Scotland, we have almost 10 per cent. of the industrial workers of Great Britain, but our share of research and development workers is only 2&#x00B7;7 per cent. It is because of that that a great many industrialists say that they are unable to accept the Board of Trade's advice to take their industries to Scotland. Those are important considerations.<br/>
It is true that in Scotland we have more university students in ratio to the population than has any other part, taking the country as a whole. It is also true that in recent years 60 per cent. of our Scottish science graduates have had to leave Scotland to find a job; 6 out of every 10 never find a job in Scotland. If we had more research and development work there, we could provide more work for our science graduates. That would provide the magnet to attract industry, and, at the end of the day, we would make a less heavy demand on the central Government for finance to provide employment in Scotland.<br/>
In that context, it is highly desirable that the Government should accept the Amendment. After all, by accepting it, all that the Parliamentary Secretary would do would be to undertake that is his own right hon. Friend, in considering an application for an I.D.C., would have regard to this matter. It would not necessarily be the final determining factor. The President of the Board of Trade, in making up his mind, would still have to weigh other considerations, but I think that he would regard this as being a factor of some importance.<br/>
The Parliamentary Secretary said that he understood that the complaint was that most of these people setting up these establishments wanted to be between Oxford, Cambridge and London. We recently made representations against the decision of the Atomic Energy Authority to build a new thermo-nuclear research establishment at Culham, in Berkshire. Originally, the Authority proposed to set this up at Winfrith Heath, in Dorset. We understand that the boffins said, "No, we want to be near our pals"&#x2014;and they got their way.<br/>
The Government have now agreed that the research establishment shall be built in the most congested part of the country. This strip between London and the Midlands, where the great M.1 runs, is


the most congested part of the country. This new establishment will provide 1,000 new jobs for highly skilled workers and will inevitably in the long run be a magnet attracting still more industries to that part of the country. Some of us said at that time that we thought that it should go north. I was with the deputation of Scottish Members which said that it should go to Scotland. I should have understood perfectly if my Welsh hon. Friends had said that it should go to Wales or if other hon. Members had said that it should go to Merseyside or the north-east.<br/>
It is nonsense to say that this cannot be done except in a congested part of the country. Research and development work is being done at Dounreay, in the most northerly tip of the island. This is not for the convenience of the boffins, but because the work being done there must be done on tidal water where there is a plentiful water supply and as far away from population as possible. That was the reason for deciding to take that research establishment right up to Dounreay. Therefore, we can persuade boffins to go to out-of-the-way and not easily accessible places. We do not ask that all these establishments should go to inaccessible places. We ask merely that they should be spread out a little more than at present and that at least the President of the Board of Trade in considering an application for an industrial development certificate should have regard to the provision of research and development, which would lead to further employment.<br/>
The Parliamentary Secretary should accept the Amendment. It does not tie the hands of his right hon. Friend in any way. If accepted, it would be an acknowledgment of the employment provided in those establishments and the effect that they have on employment generally. We in Scotland in recent years have had one new research establishment.</p>

<p>I am sorry to disagree with my hon. Friend. He might learn from the Minister concerned that his justification for the project going to Culham was its proximity to where the main work is done at Harwell. That is a long way from Windscale. It is a dreadful justification. In the days of the Labour Government we thought that we were doing something to induce industry to go to difficult areas when we took the National Engineering Laboratory to East Kilbride.<br/>
We must spread research and development out a little. The Government can do much in this respect. Private industry provides much of its own research, but unfortunately almost all of it is in the south. Private industry provides precious little research in the north. There is only one private industry in Scotland which provides research services. Oddly enough, it is one which is going downhill. That is the jute industry. No other privately-owned industry in Scotland provides research.<br/>
I beg the Parliamentary Secretary to take account of our need and of the needs of other parts of the country and to say that research and development are matters to be taken into account when the President of the Board of Trade in future considers an application for an industrial development certificate.</p>

<p>I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton (Mr. T. Fraser) that the Government should accept the Amendment, and I shall not quibble about which area should have which research station. I agree that the more research establishments are distributed, the better. But I hope that we shall not use the argument which the Minister used. Indirectly, there is a danger. The Minister implied that most young scientists wished to concentrate their activities around Oxford and Cambridge. I reject that argument.<br/>
Many young scientists wish to be outside those centres. That is why I quoted a case in my own area where, under the old Distribution of Industry legislation, with the need to diversify industry, we got the atomic energy


projects at Calder Hall and Windscale. I assure my hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton that they are great centres of fundamental research, and, according to the latest pronouncements of the Atomic Energy Authority, most of the fundamental research work is to be done there.<br/>
I am certain that young scientists will be attracted to such centres. They are being attracted to them now, which is a good thing for an area which was formerly a distressed area. Most of the fundamental research into nuclear power is now done not at Oxford or Cambridge, but at Risley and Springfields and similar places. A study of those places will show that it is not true that scientists wish to flock to Oxford and Cambridge.<br/>
After all, there are great research centres in Scotland. There are great universities with great traditions in pure research. I have always defended Glasgow and Edinburgh Universities against the fashionable places in Oxford and Cambridge, and in Durham there is a great tradition of research, particularly in engineering on Tyneside.<br/>
If it is Government policy to have this distribution, young scientists can be attracted to the new centres. I hope that the right hon. Gentleman accepts the Amendment, which will help decentralisation and ease the concentration around London and other areas. Young scientists should be attracted to new areas, such as those in Cumberland, where new power techniques are being evolved.</p>

<p>I am not at all surprised that the Parliamentary Secretary should confess that scientists and research workers are, concentrating around Oxford, Cambridge, London and similar areas. Although my hon. Friend the Member for Workington (Mr. Peart) rejects the argument that that is the case, I nevertheless feel that there was a great deal of truth in what the Parliamentary Secretary said.<br/>
I recently asked the Minister of Works how many establishments had been completed in Great Britain on behalf of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, the Atomic Energy Authority, arid other scientific organisations. I was

told that about 300 establishments had been completed, at a total cost of &#x00A3;21 million, three of them in Scotland. representing only &#x00A3;270,000 worth of work. In other words, we have got 1 per cent. of that total expenditure. No wonder that my hon. Friend the Member for Central Ayrshire (Mr. Manuel) has had to say that Scotland is very weak in research establishments. I wonder whether he realises that we have only one research association in Scotland, for the jute industry. We should take the opportunity&#x2014;and the Minister will if he accepts the Amendment&#x2014;of directing, guiding or steering research establishments North of the Border. My hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton (Mr. T. Fraser) has already referred to the Culham project of the Atomic Energy Authority and said that that could have been steered to Scotland.<br/>
In view of his own statement that research people and scientists wish to concentrate South of the Border, we must ask the Minister to take the opportunity now to accept this Amendment which has been justified beyond all doubt by the speeches made from this side of the House. I hope that he will say now that he intends to accept it</p>

<p>Most of us who have been here for any length of time have sorry memories of leaving the Chamber without having been called and tearing up notes for speeches which we were quite certain would have established our Parliamentary reputation had we only been able to catch the eye of the occupant of the Chair. We, therefore, congratulate the hon. Member for Bute and North Ayrshire (Sir F. Maclean) on the opportunity which has been saved for him by the assiduity of my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South (Mr. Ellis Smith).<br/>
We have had from the Parliamentary Secretary two explanations why the hon. Gentleman was not here when his name was called. I think that the hon. Gentleman himself heard one of them. We recognise that the hon. Gentleman, in conjunction with my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South and certain of his own hon. Friends, placed the Amendment on the Notice Paper. There has been no supporter of the Amendment so far from the Government benches, but there have been two


emphatic rejections of it by the Parliamentary Secretary.<br/>
One of the stories we heard was that the hon. Gentleman had been advised by the Parliamentary Secretary that he should try to make the speech on Third Reading. It is a well-known fact that one can mention on Third Reading only what is actually in the Bill. It would appear that the Parliamentary Secretary advised his hon. Friend not to speak on the Amendment but to speak on Third Reading and, at the same time, he was prepared to prevent this matter going into the Bill so that, when Third Reading came, the hon. Member for Bute and North Ayrshire would be out of order if he attempted to mention it.<br/>
We have had a long and interesting debate. Various of my hon. Friends have spoken in favour of the Amendment. I hope that, if the Parliamentary Secretary still finds it impossible to accept the Amendment, we shall show our displeasure at that attitude by going into the Lobby. But we should very much like to hear what the hon. Member for Bute and North Ayrshire, whose name appears at the head of the list against the Amendment on the Notice Paper, has to say before we pass from it.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1960-02-03a.1115.0" hansard_membership_id="8738" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/29357" speakername="Sir Fitzroy Maclean" colnum="1115" time="">
<p>The right hon. Member for South Shields (Mr. Ede) is a far greater expert than I shall ever be on Parliamentary procedure. I am, therefore, quite prepared to be warned by him that anything I could say on this subject on Third Reading might be out of order.<br/>
Having failed to be called in Committee, I do not want to miss my chance altogether, and, therefore, as this is a subject on which I feel extremely strongly, I am only too glad to speak now, lest I should be ruled out of order were I to try and discuss it on Third Reading.<br/>
I am in general agreement with much of what has been said by hon. Members opposite and, in particular, with what I thought were the very cogent remarks of the hon. Member for Hamilton (Mr. T. Fraser). I think that the need for increased research and development must be obvious to anyone, and I am glad that it has been recognised by the D.S.I.R's new five-year plan, which provides for a 70 per cent. increase in

expenditure on research and development. The purpose of this Amendment, as it was tabled originally by my hon. Friend the Member for Morecambe and Lonsdale (Mr. de Ferranti), was, I think, to try to provide a link between this expanded programme of research and development and the idea which underlies the Bill&#x2014;in other words, to take advantage of this expanded programme of research and development in order to bring new industries to parts of the country where they are most needed and where it is most necessary to stimulate the economy and provide increased employment.<br/>
Nowhere is there a greater need for new industries in general and for the diversification of industry in particular than in Scotland, and it is with the Scottish aspect of the problem that I am chiefly concerned. One thing about which I think everyone is agreed is that research and development brings industry in its train, particularly science-based industry&#x2014;chemicals, oil, electronics, and so on&#x2014;and that is exactly what we need in Scotland&#x2014;projects with a high development potential which can be used to replace waning industries and in general to revive the economy where this is needed and also completely new industries which at present do not exist in Scotland and which will serve further to diversify the economy.<br/>
Such projects, particularly science-based industries, would undoubtedly help to utilise the many very great assets which we in Scotland possess. To my mind, the greatest of these assets is our output of men who possess special skills and special technical and scientific qualifications. The House has heard before, but I think it is worth repeating, that in Scotland one person in about 250 goes to university as opposed to one in 500 in England. There is, therefore, in Scotland a very plentiful supply of skill and brains.<br/>
The tragedy to my mind&#x2014;and one hon. Member brought this out very well&#x2014;is that we do not succeed in keeping them. In 1957, 64 per cent. of our science graduates and 66 per cent. of our engineering graduates left Scotland. In 1958 38 per cent. of our science graduates and 59 per cent. of our engineering graduates left Scotland. I have not the figures for 1959. Certainly


the 1958 figures show an improvement which, let us hope, will continue. But it is still far too high a proportion.<br/>
9.15 p.m.<br/>
To illustrate what I mean, I should like to read a letter which I recently received from a young constituent, who states:
<q>Scotland has had a pitiable share of Government sponsored research and this is one reason why young Scottish scientists are forced to leave the country in their hundreds. To quote my own experience, of the 18 graduates who qualified at the same time as myself, 15 went to England to work and one went to Canada. Only one or two at most wanted to leave the country. I was only able to return later to Scotland by incurring some financial loss myself.</q>
That case is not untypical of the state of affairs in Scotland.<br/>
That would be a sad enough state of affairs if we did not need these men. The fact is that we need them badly. It is a case where the laws of supply and demand are not operating properly. We have already had some discussion about planning and Government intervention generally. I personally regard this as a case where Government intervention is called for. It is the Government's business in this case to try to make the laws of supply and demand operate as they should.<br/>
What we need most of all in Scotland is more science-based industry, more new industry and a more diversified industrial structure. The best way in which the Government can help to bring this about is by bringing more scientific research to Scotland. I wish that I had got my speech in before the hon. Member for Hamilton made his, but perhaps I might correct him. We have, I think, 9 per cent. rather than 10 per cent. of the total labour force and, as the hon. Member said, only 2&#x00B7;7 per cent. of research and development workers, which is nothing like the Goschen formula. Whether the figure is 9 or 10 per cent., 2&#x00B7;7 per cent. is still far too small a proportion.<br/>
In all this, we should, of course, realise that there is a limit to what the Government can do. They have neither unlimited powers nor unlimited funds. It is also true that private industry could do more than it does, although we should not underestimate what is in fact done

by private firms. Nevertheless, there is still quite a lot that the Government can do.<br/>
Seventy per cent. of all research and development is financed by the Government. To the extent of 70 per cent., the Government therefore control its geographical distribution. It lies with the Government to say where the 70 per cent. will be directed. The whole purpose of the Bill is not to direct private industry&#x2014;my right hon. Friend has made that clear&#x2014;but to encourage private industry by the use of deterrents and inducements to go where it can do most good, in this instance to undertake more research and development in Scotland. Of the forty grants which are made throughout the country to research associations, only one grant&#x2014;for the jute industry&#x2014;has gone to Scotland. Clearly, that is not as much as we in Scotland have the right to expect.<br/>
Another thing that the Government can do is to bring to Scotland installations that are Government-owned or Government-controlled. It was a great disappointment to hon. Members on this side of the House, as well as to hon. Members opposite, that the new nuclear research centre was not sited in Scotland but, instead, was sent to Culham. Knowing as little as any of us do about these matters, one is bound, I suppose, to accept the argument that it had to be sited near Harwell and near Aldermaston. Obviously, when a scientific installation is established somewhere, it immediately becomes much simpler to bring the next one there, too. And the one after that. And so on, indefinitely until it becomes out of the question to site them anywhere else.<br/>
I hope that now that we have a Minister for Science he will use his powers to break what I consider is a thoroughly vicious circle, and that he will not allow himself to be blinded with science by his own boffins who are all too apt to hold up their hands in horror&#x2014;and of course their wives even more so&#x2014;at the idea of being sent anywhere outside the Home Counties, let alone anywhere as remote as Scotland.<br/>
That is a vicious circle which it ought to be quite easy to break once we get things going. I think that once we get our fair share of research and development a great many of these difficulties


will very quickly disappear. I have met and talked to quite a lot of the boffins, if they will forgive me for calling them that, who are working at Hunterston, in my constituency, and they all seem perfectly happy&#x2014;just as happy as, if not happier than, they would have been in the Home Counties. If the Government will give a lead, I have no doubt that private industry will very quickly follow suit and it will then become just as easy and popular to site such an establishment in Scotland as anywhere else.<br/>
If this could be done&#x2014;and Dounreay is an example&#x2014;it would mean that we should be able to offer far better opportunities to our own scientists and technicians in their own country where they want to be than it is at present possible to offer. It would also mean that we in Scotland would get our proper share of science-based industry and also the new industry which we need to give our economic structure diversification and the long-term stability which it so greatly needs. It could be done by a once-for-all injection of capital which would produce a permanent economic improvement. That is why I very much hope that my right hon. Friend will see his way to accept the Amendment which stands in my name on the Notice Paper.</p>

<p>I hoped that the hon. Member for Bute and North Ayrshire (Sir F. Maclean) would answer the points made in variation of the narrative which we have had as to why he was not here when the Amendment was called. I am sure that the readers of the <i>Largs and Millport Weekly News and the Ardrossan and Saltcoats Herald,</i> who may be likely to read his speech, will be much more interested to know whether the hon. Baronet will honour his Amendment and stand by his sentiments with his vote on this matter. All the "Hear, hears" during his speech came entirely from this side of the Committee and none at all from his own side, and I hope that his constituents will know that as well.<br/>
He has enunciated exactly what is behind the Amendment and the case argued so far. What has he argued? He

has argued that once we have achieved a fair share of research and development in these areas things will be well. Where does "once" begin? Do I take it that when the Amendment is passed, that is the beginning of "once"? Because the hon. Baronet said in answer to a comment that 1 per cent. of D.S.I.R.'s recent transfers in 1958 have gone to Scotland. That is nowhere near the Goschen Formula. One could go further, and say that because the total number of university students bears a certain proportion to the population we ought to get twice the Goschen Formula, or twice whatever proportion might be worked out on a population basis. That is nowhere near 1 per cent.<br/>
He has argued the case that the D.S.I.R. has announced that for the next quinquennial part of its programme it will have a 70 per cent. increase in funds. It does not, however, follow that we shall get a higher proportion or a higher ratio unless articles like this are written into Bills like this, making the actions of the Government match their professions. After all, if a 70 per cent. increase in the D.S.I.R.'s budget is voted, it follows that we shall have only a rise from 1 per cent. to 1&#x00B7;7 per cent, in an actual share of the research stations throughout the United Kingdom.<br/>
I view with great distress this assertion of the Parliamentary Secretary about the position of scientists, namely, that the community of scientists somehow or another all want to transfer to Oxford or Cambridge or London. This is nonsense. In the case of an institution of which I have personal and intimate knowledge, a very substantial research station in Scotland which made a transfer down to Portland, almost every senior scientist and every first-class technologist in that institution wanted to stay in Scotland, and I know of only three who wanted to go to Portland. The rest all dissented from the idea. They wished to stay where they were.<br/>
Indeed, I can remember that the late Walter Elliot, a very distinguished Member of this House, a former Member for Scotstoun and two Labour Members went to the Admiralty to argue this case about taking that research station from Greenock, on the grounds that we were deserting a very formidable and learned university, namely, the University of


Glasgow, which had pioneered many of the achievements of natural philosophy in research, which had gone on since the station was erected there in 1910. It is a most remarkable thing that the station actually left not because it was a temporary war-time institution but because it had arrived there before the First World War.<br/>
It seems to me incredible that we should be willing to accept the professions of the Parliamentary Secretary who belongs to a Government who in the last few years have been willing to transfer formidable research stations from one part of the country where we have high unemployment to another part of the country where unemployment is overfull. It seems to me incredible. I do not think it is unreasonable for hon. Members on this side of the House to join reluctant hon. Members on the other side, who put their names to the Amendment but who probably now regret that very much, in insisting that we ought to have a declaration from the Government and written into this Bill that we should have consideration for research and development in those areas.<br/>
As I say, in my own constituency, ever since the Government were elected, the average unemployment rate has run at 7 per cent., and yet the best brains of the labour force were transferred only because of this action by the Government.<br/>
In his argument the hon. Member for Bute and North Ayrshire said that the Government did not have unlimited facilities for achieving this. My hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton (Mr. T. Fraser) has been good enough to argue the case in moderate tones, in the sense that this is not an Amendment imposing upon the Board an absolutely cast-iron condition which it must observe. He has argued the matter moderately, but the hon. Baronet has nevertheless emphasised that the Government have absolute, unquestioned control over where they put their own installations for research and development. Yet we have seen them actually taken away from a place where high unemployment has persisted.<br/>
I think that the hon. Baronet and his ho a. Friends and hon. Members on this side can at least say that we are not being unreasonable in asking that these

words should be written into the Bill. I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary&#x2014;even if he does seem not to know very much about the transfer of these establishments to be entirely out of sympathy with the community of scientists in this country and to believe that they all want to go to Oxford, Cambridge or London&#x2014;if he really wants to see the proper distribution of scientific amenities throughout the country, will accept the Amendment. I hope that, if he does not, we shall divide on the Amendment, because I am sure we disagree with him about this concept of concentrating in those areas.</p>

<p>I certainly hope the Government will give way on the Amendment. I hope that there will be a Division if they do not give way. I feel that the whole credit of the Bill depends on the Government's willingness to meet this kind of situation. I shall not go into all the scientific details, but here is an opportunity of extending over the whole area some of the advantages of scientific and technical development. When so much of the power rests in the hands of the Government, I do not see why they should not be prepared to do what they are asking private industry to do. The Government have kept on saying that they cannot force industrialists to go to this or that part of the country and that they can only offer inducements. I say to the Government, "Here you can set them an example, and there is a great deal in the force of example."<br/>
I have accepted the Bill as being a Measure which follows in the tradition of trying to help employment in areas where it is difficult. At the same time, I am not as satisfied as all that that the Government are absolutely sold on doing the maximum that they can to make the stated policy operative. This is a matter of good faith. I cannot for the life of me see why the Government should not set the example. There have been a lot of jeers and comments about people not being interested in this matter on this side of the House. That is entirely wrong, but I notice that my hon. Friend the Member for Bute and North Ayrshire (Sir F. Maclean) said that this was all a matter for Scotland. It is not all a matter for Scotland. It is a matter for the North of England as well.


We are coming to a stage where nuclear power is being developed for application to marine engineering. Oxford and Cambridge and parts of London are not connected with shipping and marine engineering and the application of nuclear power to marine engineering development, but the North of England is and we say to the Government that on this kind of provision depends whether we believe that they are acting in good faith towards employment and development in our part of the country. If the Parliamentary Secretary cannot give way, I shall be delighted to vote in the Opposition Lobby.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1960-02-03a.1123.0" speakerid="unknown" speakername="Mr. Lee" colnum="1123" time="">
<p>I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary, having heard a very powerful appeal to him from his hon. Friends the Member for Tynemouth (Dame Irene Ward) and the hon. Member for Bute and North Ayrshire (Sir F. Maclean) will reconsider the very reasonable approach and the reasonable words spoken to him in favour of accepting the Amendment. I believe that the hon. Gentleman is not seized of this serious point. We invite him to realise that we are now facing a situation in the North which is most serious for us all. We all know that the "bulge" of school-leavers is now rising very rapidly and that by 1962 there will be a vast increase in the number of school-leavers compared with 1956. In my constituency the number has risen to 85 per cent. above the 1956 level. Along with this we also know that a larger ratio of school leavers are now not going into the kind of employment which requires technical education. In other words, a larger ratio is going into work which can lead to a blind alley occupation.<br/>
In the areas to which I have referred we have the older industries. The Industrial Revolution took place in the North. We have there the heavy industry which now requires new techniques, new approaches, if we are to maintain our position in the competitive world which is now developing. I invite the hon. Gentleman to remember that, of all the great industrial nations in the world, Britain is the slowest in applying research to its productive industries. This is a vital matter. I hope the hon. Gentleman will realise that in the North we have a large number of school leavers

who do not feel that it is necessary for them to undertake technical training for research work because, when they have finished it, they cannot get jobs as technicians and technologists.<br/>
This is an artificial divorce. We see research confined in a large degree to the test-tube atmosphere of Oxford and Cambridge, divorced to a great extent from the great, heavy, basic industries of Britain which are concentrated largely in the North. I hope the hon. Gentleman will appreciate that if this kind of thing goes on we shall speedily reach the point where it will be impossible for Britain to compete in world markets. These are most relevant points because in the new type of industrial production we shall need a far higher ratio of technologists and highly skilled men than we have needed at any other time in our industrial history. Yet it is at precisely this time that young people in the North are not being encouraged to take up technological studies because there is no scope for them when they leave the grammar schools and technical universities.<br/>
I hope then that the hon. Gentleman will realise that it is most relevant to ask the Government to give more facilities for research on the site of our great heavy industries. The Financial Secretary to the Treasury will know as well as I do, because he was at the same firm, that there are some large organisations which are doing fine work in this respect, but it appears to me that the Government are not in any way encouraging our young people in the North to turn their minds and abilities to technological training, which would enable us to modernise our industries and so be able to compete with those of other nations.<br/>
For these reasons, I hope that even now the hon. Gentleman will listen to the words of wisdom he has heard from this side of the House as well as from his hon. Friends. It would not mean any loss of face to him if he said that, having heard the opinions expressed in all parts of the House, he will bow to those opinions and will accept the Amendment.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 16, line 11, at the end, to insert:
<q>or that section as extended by the Distribution of Industry (Industrial Finance) Act, 1958".</q>
This is a technical Amendment. The object of subsection (5) is to transfer from the Treasury to the Board of Trade securities for the repayment of outstanding D.A.T.A.C. loans as part of the general transfer of functions between the Treasury and the Board of Trade. The existing draft of subsection (5) operates

only in relation to securities given for loans under Section 4 of the 1945 Act. Of course, it should also cover securities for loans given under that Section as extended by the Act of 1958. This is an omission from the original drafting which this Amendment repairs.</p>

<p>I beg to move, That the Bill be now read the Third time.<br/>
In moving the Second Reading of the Bill, my right hon. Friend the President of the Board of Trade underlined the basic philosophy which lies behind this Local Employment Bill. While tonight we are discussing the Local Employment Bill, nevertheless the first concern of the Government, and particularly of the Board of Trade, must be with the economy as a whole. As my right hon. Friend said during the Second Reading:
<q>Anything which distorts that strength, anything which adds additional burdens, must weaken our competitive position, and if we weaken our competitive position as a country we endanger our ability not only to maintain full employment generally, but to deal with


the special problems of individual areas."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 9th November, 1959; Vol. 613, c. 32.]</q>
While that must remain our overriding objective, it is recognised on all sides that the free play of economic forces may have unhappy social consequences. It is the Government's responsibility to do what they can to mitigate those social consequences. Frankly, having listened to a great deal of the debate, I think that the only difference between the two sides of the House is how far that mitigation can go without jeopardising the national economy as a whole. We believe that this Bill goes a long way in the right direction, and that is why we commend it to the House.<br/>
The Bill, as I think hon. Members will agree, has had a very full and thorough discussion in Committee and the speeches which have been made from both sides of the House show the great interest hon. Members, wherever they sit, have in this subject of unemployment. Broadly, the Bill, despite the many hours spent in Committee, has emerged substantially as it was presented to the House. There have been a few Amendments, and I think I should say improvements, made to the Bill. I should like to single out the robust proposal of the hon. Member for Hamilton (Mr. T. Fraser), which my right hon. Friend was glad to accept, that we get rid altogether of the suggested co-ordinating committee. This will have the effect of bringing the management corporations closer to the Government, and also of getting rid of some red tape.<br/>
I mention also the Amendment to provide that each of the management corporations shall have both an industrialist and a trade unionist among its members. This, I think, is a useful provision to ensure that the corporations exercise their professional functions with proper knowledge of industrial problems. Lastly, I mention the Amendment which the Government put down to ensure the preservation of the pension and superannuation rights of the estate company employees. I think their contractual rights are now safeguarded in all respects.<br/>
There have been these Amendments and others but broadly, as I said, the Bill has emerged unscathed. Hon. Members pointed out in the Second Reading debate

and in Committee that the actual terms of the Bill are less important than the way in which it is administered. I agree wholeheartedly with this contention, and I can assure the House that we are determined to administer the powers given to us by the Bill vigorously and relentlessly. The recent announcement of the British Motor Corporation's tremendous development in Scotland, West South Wales, Merseyside and Stafford is an indication of what can be done when there is a conjunction of an expansionist climate and a Government determined to exploit those conditions in the national interest. Rootes have made a provisional announcement and I hope that others will follow from the motor car industry.<br/>
I apologise for again uttering the old <i>cliche</i> of the stick and the carrot, but I think it important to have in mind these complementary instruments for achieving our objective, both of which find their place in the Bill&#x2014;namely, the industrial development certificate and the financial and other inducements. The Bill does not alter either the system of industrial development certificate control or the Government's policy in administering it.<br/>
What it does is to emphasise the importance we attach in our consideration of each and every application to the need for helping what are to be called the Development Districts. If a firm can go to one of these districts or hive off part of its activities there, we shall not let it expand in a congested area. But that does not mean that we shall inflexibly refuse I.D.Cs for everywhere else. There are many firms which are tied to their existing base or which can go some distance&#x2014;for example to an overspill town from its parent town&#x2014;but which could not go to a development district. In all those cases we shall, of course, grant industrial development certificates. To refuse them would merely lead to a frustration of economic expansion.<br/>
There are other parts of the country which need further industry, although they have not such high unemployment; here the benefits of this Bill ought not to be made available. In those districts also we shall not refuse I.D.Cs for any suitable expansions, but in the case of new projects we shall, of course, consider whether they could not go to a place


which needs them even more. So much for the negative side of our control, without which the inducements offered in this Bill would not hold the attractions which I am confident they will hold.<br/>
I will not go in detail through the Bill, but it may be useful to the House if I recapitulate the five chief facilities which the Bill offers.<br/>
First there is the power to build factories for leasing or sale on favourable terms. This is not a new power, but it is now for the first time available over all the places which are judged to be areas of high unemployment.<br/>
Moreover, there is one useful extension in that the Board can build factories for an industrialist on his own land: there need no longer be the complication and expense of a double conveyance.<br/>
About a year ago I announced in the House that we would grant certain concessions on the rentals of Board of Trade factories either when the lease became due for renewal or when a factory was empty. These concessions were to be limited to cases arising in the following twelve months. I am glad to say that there has been a substantial improvement in the employment position and it is no longer necessary to make any abatement from current market rents. For instance, today we have only seventeen empty factories compared with twenty-eight a year ago. These special concessions have therefore been allowed to lapse as from 1st February in accordance with my previous announcement. The powers to grant concessions, however, remain, and if in the future we felt conditions justified such special treatment again, we would not hesitate to take similar action.<br/>
I should add that the position of Board of Trade factories outside the new Development Districts has not been forgotten. We are taking powers under Clauses 15 and 28 of the Bill to enable us to continue to carry out work already begun in the former Development Areas, to honour agreements already made and to carry out the normal functions of a good landlord.<br/>
On the other hand, in view of the importance of concentrating our resources on the Development Districts, our policy elsewhere will be to build

new factories only in exceptional circumstances and to apply somewhat more stringent rules about building extensions to existing premises. If a firm occupying a Board of Trade factory outside the Development Districts requires an extension of its premises, we shall expect it first to consider the possibility of building for itself, and in most cases we shall be willing to sell the factory to the firm if it is willing to buy. If we are satisfied that these courses are impracticable, we shall in suitable cases be willing to build at Board of Trade expense, but we shall then expect to receive a rental for the extension calculated to give an economic return on the cost of building.<br/>
To move on to the second chief facility in the Bill, industry is now offered the choice of building its own premises instead of taking a lease or conveyance of premises built by the Board. The inquiries which we have already had, perhaps two months before the Bill becomes law, give us confidence of the interest which industry is taking in this new facility. I hope that it will prove of great value, especially to firms already in development districts, which want to extend their premises.<br/>
Thirdly, there is the provision again for loans and grants to be made to firms needing finance for their expansion in order to buy equipment or for the requisite working capital.<br/>
I am glad to acknowledge again the Government's gratitude to Mr. Slimmings, the Chairman of D.A.T.A.C., and his colleagues for agreeing to serve on the new Committee and so continue to make their advice and assistance available to the Government.<br/>
We have considered what should be the name of the new Committee, and have decided that it would be as well to preserve it as nearly as possible. It will, therefore, be called the Board of Trade Advisory Committee, or B.O.T.A.C. for short. While this may show a lack of inspiration, it at least should go some way to avoid confusion.<br/>
Fourthly, there is the provison that the Government can make grants for clearing up derelict, neglected or unsightly areas&#x2014;or, indeed, the Board of Trade can itself undertake this work. I hope that much use will be made of this provision, not only for economic reasons but for


improving the appearance of our towns and countryside. But hon. Members will not overlook that it is not a blank cheque for aesthetic improvements, desirable as that might be. Powers can be exercised only when the Board judge that their exercise would promote employment in the places that need it.<br/>
Lastly, there is the provision for basic services. This has been fully debated here, and I am sure that the House will not want me to say more about it.<br/>
So much for the main features of the Bill. Hon. Members opposite have said that it does not go far enough. The Government's view is that the inducements offered by it will prove of real encouragement to industry and commerce. Time will show which side is right, but I can tell the House that the omens, based on the inquiries already received from all parts of the country, are favourable to our view.<br/>
Throughout the Bill's Parliamentary history so far, the interest of Members has been not so much in the powers that we will exercise as in the places where they will be available. As my right hon. Friend said when we were discussing the Bill before Christmas, it was then&#x2014;that is, before Christmas&#x2014;too early to give any indication of our list of development districts, as they are now to be called.<br/>
Hon. Members will have in mind that the districts to benefit are those in which
<q>&#x2026;in the opinion of the Board of Trade &#x2026;a high rate of unemployment exists or is to be expected &#x2026;</q>
We have to look, not only at actual figures of unemployment but also at the prospects of change either way&#x2014;on the one hand, of further unemployment and, on the other, of new jobs coming to the area. We cannot, therefore, say what our opinion will be several months ahead, but if the Bill passes through its remaining Parliamentary stages without serious delays, we intend to bring it into force on 1st April, now less than two months away.<br/>
In these circumstances, the time has come when we can properly consider which are the places which should benefit under the new Bill. The Government are accordingly doing this,

and my right hon. Friend has asked me to tell the House tonight that he proposes early next week to announce what he expects the list of development districts to be. This will not be an alteration of the D.A.T.A.C. list, on which we are at present working; it will be a list of the districts which we expect will benefit when this Bill becomes law.<br/>
The Government hope that this advance intimation will be of help both to industry in the areas mentioned in my right hon. Friend's statement, in that it will enable them to get ahead with new projects, and also to firms in congested areas, in that it will let them know the places in which they can look for help if they expand there. We also have to arrange for a smooth transition from the present D.A.T.A.C. arrangements to the time when the Board of Trade will become responsible for operating the financial provisions of the Bill.<br/>
I have already paid tribute to the excellent work which D.A.T.A.C. has done over the last 15 years, and have said how glad I am that the present members of the Committee are willing to go on in the future without break of continuity. Hon. Members will appreciate that it takes some time&#x2014;normally two months or more&#x2014;for D.A.T.A.C. to examine applications for assistance. It has to get a technical report on the project, which involves almost always a visit to the site, and there has to be a full and detailed report by accountants in order that the Committee may be satisfied about finances.<br/>
The Committee has, at present, some months' work in hand, more in fact than it can possibly dispose of before the new Bill comes into operation, which, as I have already said, we hope will be on the 1st April. In these circumstances my hon. Friend, the Financial Secretary, has agreed with my right hon. Friend that it would serve no useful purpose to put more cases to D.A.T.A.C. for consideration under the present legislation. The Committee will, of course, continue to deal with the cases they now have before them until the new Act comes into force. We hope that, in the intervening period, D.A.T.A.C. will be able to deal with a large number of the outstanding applications from other places on the present list.


This need not hold up consideration of new cases for districts that are in the new list which my right hon. Friend will announce at the beginning of next week. The firms which have projects for those districts can prepare their applications for financial assistance and, if they like, send them to D.A.T.A.C. When the Bill comes into effect D.A.T.A.C. will pass the applications to the new Committee, B.O.T.A.C., which will be advising the Board of Trade. The new Committee will deal with them as soon as possible.<br/>
The Bill has been fully debated and I do not think that I need refer specifically to any other provisions than those I have already mentioned. I confidently commend the Bill to the House as one which meets the social and human needs of the community and what is perhaps the most important problem a man can face, that of having a livelihood which will give him both security and dignity.</p>

<p>I thought that for once the Parliamentary Secretary did himself rather less than justice in saying that practically no improvements had been made in the course of our discussions. On the initiative of my hon. Friends, a number of substantial improvements have been made. Nevertheless, it is our opinion that all that need have been done in distribution of industry policy could have been done under the 1945 Act if the Government had extended the development areas. We go through this vast legislative process and, at the end of it all, we have changed D.A.T.A.C. to B.O.T.A.C. There is not very much more than that to say about it.<br/>
The only possible argument which the Government could advance for our having got any new power is the 85 per cent. building grant, which is not 85 per cent. of the value of the factory. but 85 per cent. of the difference between the cost and the alleged marked value. The Government have admitted that in the form of an annual grant that could have been done already under D.A.T.A.C. When it is analysed, the only extension in the Bill is the tiny difference between an annual and an outright grant for this purpose.<br/>
Against that, in at least four important respects the powers we now have will

be narrower than the powers we had under the previous Act. The first and most important is that the Government will apply the powers to a very much smaller part of the country than was previously eligible for them. The Development Areas, as they still stand at this moment, cover 19 per cent. of the population and the D.A.T.A.C. areas cover another portion. Therefore, over 20 per cent., perhaps 25 per cent., is covered at present. We have been told by the President of the Board of Trade that the new list which is now to be published covers only 14 per cent. of the population. Therefore, there will be a substantial narrowing of the areas which will be helped.<br/>
Secondly, we now have a Bill which will entirely expire at the end of seven years, unless something is done to continue it. That is totally unjustifiable. The previous powers were permanent. The Parliamentary Secretary has not yet answered the requests addressed to him yesterday&#x2014;I hope that the President of the Board of Trade still may&#x2014;to explain what will be the position of the management corporations if the Bill were simply to lapse at the end of seven years, as it would if unaltered. Apparently they will remain in existence but will have no powers to carry out any of their functions, even though they will be the owners of a very large amount of public property. We should be told before we part with the Bill tonight what will be their position in that situation.<br/>
Thirdly, the powers of the President of the Board of Trade for declaring areas development districts, as they will now be, will also be less flexible than they were under the previous Act. Under the previous Act they could be made Development Areas if the distribution of industry was such as to give rise to a danger of unemployment. In the Bill there is no such provision. In that respect also the power is narrower.<br/>
Fourthly, Parliament is still deprived of its right to examine the list and say which areas are to be included in it. The Parliamentary Secretary tonight made the extraordinary statement that the list, which he has refused to disclose throughout the Bill's proceedings in this House, is to be published next week, so that it is obvious that he knows what it is and must have known for some time. He


has been afraid to entrust the House of Commons with the information until we have parted with the Bill. That is an extraordinary procedure. He is willing that the House of Lords should discuss the Bill with full information about the areas before it, but he has consistently withheld that information from the House of Commons. I know that my right hon. and noble Friend the former Member for Bishop Auckland, Lord Dalton, has this very week taken his place in the Upper House&#x2014;</p>

<p>&#x2014;this very day&#x2014;and one reason for publishing the list may be so that he can discuss it in the proceedings on the Bill in the Upper House. In spite of that, it was an extraordinary decision to withhold the list from the House of Commons and then make it available for subsequent proceedings. Nothing the hon. Gentleman has said has convinced us that that decision was justified.<br/>
I fully agree with him, as we have said all along, that it is not the powers but the policy which matters. For that reason, I was a little disquieted by two remarks which the Parliamentary Secretary has just made. First, he said that he was to terminate the rent concessions altogether. That is a step backwards. Although we are very glad that only seventeen factories are now empty, it is in itself an argument for advance factories if the total is going down and there are seventeen factories empty My hon. Friend the Member for Aberavon (Mr. Morris) has a factory in his constituency which has been unlet for two years<br/>
The hon. Member is to take another step backwards, for he told us that there was to be an embargo on D.A.T.A.C,. or B.O.T.A.C., applications for the next month. That is not very encouraging and I hope that it does not mean that, as soon as the Bill leaves the House, the right hon. Gentleman will retrace all the steps he has taken.<br/>
Nevertheless, we should say how much we all welcome what has been achieved in the expansion of the motor industry. I regard the announcements of the last few weeks as a great success for the campaign on the distribution of industry

policy which my hon. Friends have been running throughout the past year. Indeed, if Government policy were still what it was a year ago and by agitation and argument my hon. Friends have not altered it, I am afraid that we would have seen all that expansion in the Midlands and London areas.<br/>
We are to have three major expansions, that of the British Motor Corporation, that of Rootes in Paisley and I have heard a rumour that the Ford Company is planning a major expansion on Merseyside. I hope that that rumour proves to be the truth. However, it is notable that in these motor expansions there has not so far been anything said about Lanarkshire, which is the worst unemployment area in Scotland and is yet the area where steel sheet is to be produced. It is also significant that the North East Coast has been so far entirely omitted from the list of these expansions. I hope that the Government will keep the other motor firms up to the mark.<br/>
Incidentally, we have heard nothing from the Vauxhall Company. It is notable that the Vauxhall Company is one of the very few major companies in British manufacturing industry which has so far made almost no contribution to the Development Areas. I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will see that with the help of these powers the firm is made to make its due contribution.<br/>
We have had a lot of talk tonight about the play of competition and economic forces, and so on. I believe that that is a distorted view of the problem. On the whole, now that the Government have come to our way, to some extent, I hope that they will not think that in every case where a firm is steered to one of these development districts it is necessarily operating on higher economic costs to set against social costs. If it were, it would still be worth while, but I do not believe that that is true in practice. About half the products of the motor industry are exported, and that industry uses steel sheet, which is now produced in North Wales, at Shotton, and near to Clydeside. The most economic place to produce motor cars for export is therefore near the estuaries where the sheet steel is produced. It really cannot be economic to do what the motor industry has been


doing, to carry sheet from Shotton to Birmingham and then send the cars for export from the London docks.<br/>
I hope the Government will not work on the basis of the facile assumption which, I know, comes from the academic economists but which is very seldom true. I address this argument seriously to the President of the Board of Trade. If he will talk to the people who actually discuss these extensions with many companies&#x2014;this is not a party point&#x2014;he will find that there are usually many alternative sites to which an extension could go between which there is very little difference in economic cost; but in the case of one site a great contribution to employment would be made whereas in other cases there would be all sorts of social difficulties. He ought to look at the matter in that light.<br/>
We welcome the motor car industry extensions and we extend congratulations to the companies as well as to the Government for the co-operation which has led to them. But we are not satisfied yet with the efforts the Government are making to restrain the extensions of new employment both in factories and offices in the greatest congested area of all, namely, London. In answer to a Question last week, the Parliamentary Secretary gave me some figures which work out in this way. During the period of the Labour Government, the London and South-Eastern Region had only about 12 per cent. of the total new factory space. The percentage rose to over 20 in the period until a year ago when the right hon. Gentleman's predecessor had more or less abandoned distribution of industry policy altogether.<br/>
In 1958, the figure was 21 per cent. for the London area. In 1959, it had come down to 17&#x00B7;6, but that was not a great reduction after all the talk we had heard. In the successive quarters of 1959, it was about 16 or 18 per cent. I hope the right hon. Gentleman will make up his mind about this. He wants us to think that he is doing his best. We will take it on trust from him, but the results in terms of figures are still far from impressive.<br/>
Office development has been the real cause of the huge extension of employment in London during the last five years. According to the London County

Council's figures, total employment in Central London is increasing by 15,000 persons per year. If that is happening, then the Government really have not proper control of distribution of industry policy. We were very disappointed at the replies we received late last night to the suggestions we made about achieving greater control over office employment. The Parliamentary Secretary said that he wants to do something but he really does not know how to do it. He then said that it was not a distribution of industry problem but it was a planning problem, by which he meant town planning.<br/>
This is not really true. It is both a town planning issue and an employment policy issue. Indeed, if the major reason for further growth of employment in London is office work rather than factory work, then this is clearly a matter of employment policy as well as planning. He seemed to argue that it was not possible for new office work to be dispersed out of London; but he answered that argument himself because he said he thought it was a pity that the Egg Marketing Board had come to London and it should have gone somewhere else.<br/>
The Government know perfectly well that the Ministry of National Insurance was induced to go to Newcastle and the Inland Revenue went to Cardiff. I should think that the Prudential Assurance Company could do equally well what the Ministry of National Insurance did. I am sure that the right hon. Gentleman would not suggest that the efficiency of private enterprise is so much lower than that of a Government Department that the Prudential and other great companies could not organise their affairs as effectively in this matter as the Ministry.<br/>
Finally, on the subject of offices, I hope that, under the existing rather defective machinery by which office development is under the control of local authorities and distribution of industry policy is under the control of the Board of Trade, there will, at least, be practical consultation, even if there is nothing statutory, so that where there is an application for an office block to employ 3,000 or 5,000 people in the London area, that application will go through the Ministry of Housing and Local Government to the Board of Trade before a decision is taken. If that is not done, I do not see how we can have control in this affair at all.


Finally, if the President of the Board of Trade and the Parliamentary Secretary will stick to their present protestations, both in stimulating new employment in the areas that need it and also in restraining it where it is not needed and where it is creating so many social problems, they will continue to have our support. We do not believe that the Bill is really necessary or that the job could not have been done under previous legislation, but now, having got it, we hope that it will he used. We shall support the hon. Member if he uses it, because, when all is said and done, it is the policy and not the powers that matter.</p>

<p>Many hon. Members on this side will feel that the Bill, which we hope will shortly become an Act, is in many ways a much more suitable and appropriate instrument for dealing with the present problem than previous legislation. The right hon. Member for Battersea, North (Mr. Jay) reiterated many of the arguments adduced throughout our debates, and I do not think that he made a stronger case tonight than he has made on previous occasions. Among his criticisms was the fact that under this Bill only 14 per cent. of the country is likely to benefit. The right hon. Gentleman regarded that as a criticism of the Bill. I should have thought that, on consideration, he might agree that in the old Development Areas there are still today some districts still in need of assistance. On the other hand, in those areas there are districts no longer in need of help. For that reason, I think that it is an advantage in this Bill that the aid which will be given will be concentrated in districts, often smaller than those in the old areas, where help is most needed.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman also suggested that the Bill does little apart from changing the form of one of the grants. He completely omitted to refer to the strengthening of my right hon. Friend's powers in the matter of applications for development certificates. I regard this as of considerable importance. He also did not refer to the fact that under the Bill the applications which can be made cover a much wider field. He also appropriated or arrogated to the Opposition most of the credit for the very definite achievements made in recent

months by my right hon. Friend and the Parliamentary Secretary in implementing this sort of policy without some of the powers which they needed and which they will obtain under this Bill if it is enacted.<br/>
In recent months, in Wales&#x2014;I can, perhaps, speak with greater knowledge about Wales than other parts of the country&#x2014;and also, I believe, in Scotland a good deal of progress has been made along the lines which we want to pursue. We have noted with approval how my right hon. Friend, following the influence which he brought to bear upon some of the motor manufacturers not to develop in areas where they wished to develop originally, has followed up his success by persuading them to go to other areas in Scotland and South-West Wales. That has come about largely by my right hon. Friend's exertions, with the help in Wales of the Minister for Welsh Affairs and in Scotland, no doubt, with the help of the Secretary of State for Scotland. I am sure that the energy which my right hon. Friend and hon. Friends have shown in recent months will also be used in implementing the powers of this Bill.<br/>
With regard to the list which is to be published next week, it is inevitable that many districts will be disappointed, but the Bill is in that respect much more flexible than previous legislation. In previous legislation, we had for long periods rather large and somewhat inflexible Development Areas, whereas under the new Bill areas in which unemployment either increases or shows definite signs of increasing may qualify for the benefits of the Bill.<br/>
I conclude my comparatively brief remarks, by saying that we on this side feel that this is a most appropriate and flexible Measure for dealing with the problems which we face today and which are different from the problems which we faced at the end of the war</p>

<p>I expressed my dislike of the Bill on Second Reading and throughout Committee. Even now, at this late stage, I still dislike the Bill and the fact that we are to end local initiative by the creation of a large corporation. There is still vagueness about its duration in the sense that the Bill caters only for a seven-year period. In Committee, we


pressed for more reasons from the Minister why this should be.<br/>
I would have thought that in Committee more hon. Members opposite would have expressed their dislike of a large bureaucracy, which is what it could well be&#x2014;a large organisation responsible for planning in England&#x2014;instead of the old estate companies which we had, such as, for example, in my area, the West Cumberland Industrial Development Company. I dislike its ending and, for this reason, I have expressed concern. I am glad, however, that in Committee the Minister said that there would be, particularly in my area, consultation with bodies like the Cumberland Development Council. Although this has not been written into the Bill, my hon. Friend the Member for Whitehaven (Mr. Symonds) and I put down an Amendment and we have had that assurance.<br/>
Whilst I dislike the Bill, which will end local initiative and destroy something which has been created over the years, we must make it work. I only wish that

there had been a statement earlier about the list. It is true, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Battersea, North (Mr. Jay) has said, that another place will be debating the Bill and will have an opportunity to study the list. That is the key to administration. I assure the Minister that if west Cumberland is not on the list or if our area of west Cumberland is fragmented, we will oppose it strongly.<br/>
I agree that what matters about the Bill is how it is administered and the will of the Government behind it. I believe that the President of the Board of Trade and the Parliamentary Secretary are anxious that the Bill should succeed&#x2014;I think they are sincere when they say that; I am afraid, however, that I have no confidence in the broad commercial and economic policy of the Government. However, we shall wait and see, examine and probe. If areas are neglected, we will certainly criticise and if the corporations for England, for Scotland and for Wales do not do their job, certainly we will be vigilant and critical at every opportunity.</p>

<p>I sincerely hope that, in giving my support to the Bill, I am serving the interests of the whole of the country and of the North-East Coast in particular. [<i>Interruption.</i>] Having gone through the 1930s, when in part of the constituency which I then represented in the House of Commons 84 per cent. of the employable population were unemployed, I hope that all Members of the House will do me the honour of believing that I am doing the right thing in supporting this new Bill without knowing what the list comprises. I must take that on trust, and I do so with some misgiving, because I know how difficult it will be if the list, when it is published, does not measure up to the hopes of those of us who want employment to be properly distributed.<br/>
No one would do other than congratulate those areas which have been fortunate to get the expansion of the motor car industry. I am delighted. I think we want prosperity in the whole of the British Isles. However, as my hon. Friend has laid a great deal of emphasis on the way in which the Bill will be administered, I want to point out that, as we have had the Secretary of State for Scotland, the Minister for Welsh Affairs, and the Cabinet interested in this whole expansion of the motor car industry in the parts of the country which require a stimulus to employment, I should have thought that it would have been possible, and at least psychologically desirable, for the President of the Board of Trade to have seen that some of the outstanding requests of the North-East Coast were met at the same time. Deep down in the hearts of those who live on the North-East Coast is the ghastly fear, which has been handed down from grandfather through father to grandson, that our interests are not being quite as well looked after, because we have neither a Secretary of State nor a Minister particularly looking after them.<br/>
I feel bound to say this because my hon. Friend suddenly gets up and shoots off a lot of statements about the position of those projects which come under the old D.A.T.A.C. till the appointed day, 1st April, and we have had no chance of hearing about them before. There

has been no real opportunity of discussing whether these matters are being wisely dealt with. I should have had much greater confidence if I had been able to do what I was unable to do, to get in touch with the President of the Board of Trade while that policy was being built up and while the Cabinet and the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Minister for Welsh Affairs were busy dealing with the expansion of the motor car industry. In that way the interests of the North-East Coast have not, I think, been served. We have not been able to get the answer to the question, what is going to happen to the outstanding projects for a decision on which we are waiting.<br/>
I want for a moment or two to develop another aspect of the situation. When one has been in political life as long as I have one becomes rather suspicious. A great deal is said: I take it with a grain of salt. I refer to Clause 3, which says:
<q>For the purposes of this Part of this Act the Board may with the consent of the Treasury &#x2026;</q>
With the consent of the Treasury. Will my right hon. Friend tell me, if I want to ask Questions, can I address them to the Treasury? Have we to take exactly the word of my right hon. Friend? Or, as the Treasury is involved in this, shall be able to raise matters with the Treasury as well?<br/>
I would ask my right hon. Friend a further question. I refer to the industrial development of all kinds and the expansion of industry and the need for industry in areas which are threatened, possibly, with unemployment through pit closures or the slackening off of demand for ships, and the like. Will these Treasury people, who are specifically referred to in the Bill, take any steps to inform themselves about how industry operates?<br/>
As I say, I have been in political life for a long time, and I have seen my area and other parts of the country which have been hit by heavy unemployment dealt with in varying ways. In the wanderings about that I have done and the inquiries that I have made from time to time I have never met a Treasury official in the areas looking into the problems affecting them. That is a great weakness.


My hon. Friend has laid great stress on how the Bill is to be administered. We have had visits by the Minister for Welsh Affairs, the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Minister of Labour&#x2014;I am delighted to pay tribute to him&#x2014; to the North-East Coast looking at our unemployment problem. But we have had no visit from a senior Minister at the Board of Trade.<br/>
I am deeply suspicious that when people go to the Board of Trade to ascertain the best place for an expanding industry, my right hon. Friend and hon. Friend who have not been to the North-East Coast are not in a very good position to give information about my area. They do not know how absolutely grand our labour is. All who have developed industry on the North-East Coast under previous legislation have spoken of the happy relations which they have had with the workers, employers and local authorities. It is right that we should pay tribute to those who have made the North-East Coast the virile, vital place that it is.<br/>
When representatives of the motor car industry visit the Secretary of State for Scotland they find that he knows everything about Scotland. But as neither my right hon. Friend nor my hon. Friend has been to the North-East Coast, how can they paint to inquirers a picture of the North-East Coast in the glowing fashion in which it should be painted? I feel that in that respect we have not had the attention that we ought to have had.<br/>
I have listened to people talking about Scotland, Wales and Merseyside. I would just mention in passing that when the North-East Coast and Wales were suffering severe unemployment in the 30s the Midlands and Lancashire were relatively prosperous areas. My area, unfortunately, has a long tradition of unemployment, and the fact that we have had so little attention paid to us does not make us particularly hopeful that the Bill will do for us what we should like it to do.<br/>
I do not want to say anything against my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary because I know that he will visit us. He is always very polite and I am sure that he is a very competent Minister, but as a junior Minister, having been in the Government for a very short time

and not very long in the House, he cannot have on the Treasury anything like the effect that the Secretary of State for Scotland has. I see my right hon. Friend patting my hon. Friend on the back; my hon. Friend needs it. I do not think that the North-East Coast ought to be served by somebody who cannot dictate to the Treasury. I have had enough experience to know that in the hierarchy of the Government weight is one of the means by which one obtains favours from the powers that be. It is rather like the difference between a fly and an elephant. One really needs an elephant to do something about getting favours and dealing with matters of this kind.<br/>
I hope that in supporting this Bill I shall not be offering a hostage to fortune, because I should regret that very much indeed. I hope also that people in those parts of the country where there is satisfaction over the policy of the Government will not object if I say that I consider a little more attention should be paid to the North-East Coast, which has provided great inventive genius over a wide sphere. The Government and the country owe a great debt of gratitude to the late Sir Claud Gibb, managing director of Parsons marine engineering works, whose death was a great loss to the North-East Coast. I should like an assurance that our part of the world will have the support of the Minister to make up for the fact that we have not a Minister of our own.</p>

<p>I wish to comment on the announcement by the Minister that the concessionary rents for Board of Trade factories will cease from 31st January. Reference has been made to the fact that I have one of these factories in my constituency. The Parliamentary Secretary said that there are 17 such factories still unlet. I welcome the fact that that is a reduction on the previous figure of unlet factories, but it is still 17 too many.<br/>
During the past fortnight I have been trying to obtain information from the Parliamentary Secretary about what would happen when the concession ends. I have written to him but so far have failed to get that information. It is a serious matter. We who have these factories in our constituencies consider that the rents asked for them by the Board


of Trade is a major stumbling block to obtaining tenants. If there are still 17 factories unlet, I consider it a restrictive step to end the concessionary rents. The period should be extended and the concession improved. We have in my constituency a large and beautiful factory built by the Board of Trade where until two years ago 800 men were employed. Today there are none. A large amount of public money was spent on this factory. Now the property is deteriorating.</p>

<p>I am sure that the increased flexibility provided by this Bill will be welcomed by hon. Members on both sides of the House, but, as has been said, it depends on the administration of the provisions contained in the Bill and the policy which is applied to it. It would be entirely wrong to think that unemployment can be mopped up merely by building a factory in a district and letting it cheap.<br/>
I do not feel that in my area on Merseyside the lack of factory space is a problem. One cannot mop up unemployment among dock workers and ship repairers by providing a factory. But Government contracts could be provided to give work to ship repairers. In my area, a considerable amount of factory space has been closed and there is redundancy due to a decline in the number of Government contracts. I hope that the provision in the Bill for making loans and grants will be operated in conjunction with an intelligent use of Government contracts for regional work. It may not be satisfactory if a loan or grant is made to build a factory and if the undertaking is then left to fend for itself. After all, the Government are the largest single buyer in the country. A quarter of the goods and services of the country are purchased by Government Departments.<br/>
Regional purchases must affect regional employment. As hon. Members will recollect, there is a Government Contracts Preference Scheme. The Board of Trade Journal of 22nd May last year stated:
<q>Government Departments and the nationalized industries when awarding contracts by competitive tender are normally prepared to give preference to firms in the Development Areas and other areas of high

unemployment (i.e. areas which have included in the list of places where Government assistance is available under the Distribution of Industry (Industrial Finance) Act, 1958), provided that price, specification, delivery, etc., are equal.</q>
If under the previous legislation, this Government Contracts Preference Scheme was applied, may I have an assurance from my right hon. Friend that it will be applied to those areas which will come in the list which he intends to publish? In my experience, the Government Contracts Preference Scheme has not operated as described in that paragraph. It may have been operated by some Government Departments in that way, but there is certainly lack of enthusiasm for it in the nationalised industries. Is my right hon. Friend satisfied that it will operate under this new legislation in conjunction with loans and grants?<br/>
It is no good sitting down to a beautifully laid table if no food is going to be served. It is no good our giving industry tools to do a job if there is no job there to do. I am sure that by combining this Government Contracts Preference Scheme and making it really operative, with the loans and grants and building of factories, this Bill will be a real success.</p>

<p>I do not think very much of this Bill, but I hope it will be of some help in the north-east of England. As the hon. Member for Tyne-mouth (Dame Irene Ward) said, the problems there are getting worse day by day. I think this Bill will be a very blunt instrument for the job it has to do. The problem is how to cure regional unemployment in specific limited areas when there are almost boom conditions in the rest of the country. Those are areas which are not necessarily affected by a rise in incomes elsewhere.<br/>
The Government's remedy in this Bill is to encourage industry to go to those areas by offering financial inducement to them. When I was a boy I used to watch my mother at the wash-tub. I have a clear picture of the big bubbles made by the sheets in the water. I always remember distinctly as a small boy pushing down a bubble with my finger only to see it appear somewhere else. I cannot help feeling that this policy of the Government will do that&#x2014;


when there is a pocket of unemployment in X town and a firm is established there to produce, say, nylon stockings in order to provide employment, it will have the effect of making an unemployment "bubble" pop up somewhere else.<br/>
There seems to be no one in the Board of Trade, or in the universities where we might expect to find such persons, giving any real study to the question of regional unemployment. The last issue of <i>Lloyds Bank Review</i> had a well-informed article on the subject, but I believe no one is doing such work thoroughly. The hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) referred to regional purchase, but I do not think anyone has gone into the question of regional purchase in this context.<br/>
In the North-East the problem is that the two basic industries of coalmining and shipbuilding are contracting very rapidly. They are basic industries which are not affected by a rise in incomes elsewhere. The coal industry is contracting very rapidly, and we have also to face the fact that shipbuilding and ship-repairing will contract, too. The capacity of the world's shipyards is far too big. All the world's merchant shipping could be replaced in twelve to fourteen years, but the life of a ship is twenty-five years. We must face the fact that our shipbuilding and ship-repairing capacity will never be used to the full again. On the Tyne, as well as elsewhere, we must face that.<br/>
No analysis is being made of these trends in the North-East. How far will these industries contract? At what stage will the contraction stop? What type of labour needs absorbing? Hon. Members on both sides of the House press for anything that is going. My hon. Friend the Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Bence) and I are almost in a state of open warfare about the Cunarders.</p>

<p>Such is the position in our areas that we press for everything that is going&#x2014; motor-car manufacture, Cunarders and anything else. We do this without any sound information about the causes of unemployment in the areas which we represent. That is one of the grave weaknesses in the Government's industrial policy.<br/>
Another weakness is that no attempt whatever is made to integrate the social planning and social development of our region with the industrial development. In my area all the local authorities are building their great housing estates, educational facilities and so on. They are pushing ahead with slum clearance, although the Minister of Housing and Local Government, whom I am glad to see in the Chamber, is not helping us very much at the moment because of his delays with C.P.Os. All this development is taking place without any knowledge of what the future industrial pattern of the area will be. We do not know. There is no long-term planning of the way in which those industries will contract, nor do we know what will replace them when they have contracted.<br/>
I believe that it would be much better to tackle industries instead of tackling areas. For example, if the Government had an integrated and properly worked-out fuel policy it would bring some stability to the coal industry. If the Government made up their mind about shipping and put before us some shipping policy, that would help. Rather than tackling the problem by regions, there is much to be said for tackling industries.<br/>
Our long-term problem in the North-East is how to develop our industries and our social planning, too, in the face of our two contracting industries. I emphasise to the President of the Board of Trade the seriousness of the position. In the short term we have heavy unemployment. As I said in the House at Question Time today, we have the highest unemployment in the country in shipbuilding and ship-repairing. About 30 per cent. of our boiler makers are unemployed. The second oldest engineering works in the country, Stephenson Hawthorn, in Newcastle, which employs a large number of boiler makers, is being closed. The factory, which has a six-acre site in the middle of Newcastle&#x2014;a well-equipped factory with railway sidings, buildings, drawing offices and other offices&#x2014;will be vacated in March or shortly afterwards. This is private enterprise at its worst. This old firm, of Robert Stephenson and Hawthorn, which still bears Robert Stephenson's name&#x2014;the Rocket was made there and hundreds and hundreds


of other locomotives have been made there and sent all over the world&#x2014;was purchased three years ago by English Electric. Three years later it is being closed down.<br/>
The name, which is a household word in engineering throughout the world, is being retained by English Electric and used elsewhere. It is a name which has been made famous by generations of Tyneside engineers. It is being taken away from us by English Electric and used elsewhere. I think that that is private enterprise at its worst. I hope to see the President of the Board of Trade about this in the near future, and I hope that he will help in this problem.<br/>
My point is that, in addition to the slump in shipbuilding and ship-repairing, the closing of this factory makes the position very much worse for our Tyneside boilermakers. The situation is extremely urgent, and I hope that the President of the Board of Trade will do his utmost to get some industry to the North-East. I am not so sure about getting Ministers to visit us. As far as I can see, every time a Minister comes to see us the unemployment figures go up. But I hope that the Minister will inform himself of our position, and do what he can to help us.</p>

<p>Many of my hon. Friends have said that they do not like the Bill, but we have also said that we welcome it, and hope that its provisions will be carried out in the spirit of the speeches already made on behalf of the Government. I sincerely hope that many of the promises we have heard will be carried out. As one who was a member of a recent deputation, I should like to join my right hon. Friend the Member for Battersea, North. (Mr. Jay) in congratulating the Government on their recent assistance in the expansion of industry, particularly in West Wales. I would be less than generous if I did not also acknowledge the assistance given by the Minister for Welsh Affairs, whom I am glad to see is with us now.<br/>
I also want to draw attention to the purpose of the Bill, which is stated to be the promotion of employment in areas of high and persistent unemployment. In this connection, I acknowledge that in parts of my constituency the unemployment figures are slowly decreasing, not

because of the presence in that area&#x2014;and I refer particularly to the Swansea Valley&#x2014;of new factories, but because a very large number of people are now obliged to travel long distances to employment obtained outside these areas.<br/>
That poses a very serious problem, to which I should like to draw the particular attention of the Minister for Welsh Affairs. The Swansea Valley has suffered grievously from the closure of pits and obsolete mills and, bearing in mind the establishment of a motor-car factory in close proximity to my constituency, I am pressing for Government assistance in securing ancillary industries, particularly to the Swansea Valley. I ask, because the local authority has suffered greatly from diminution of rateable value as a result of the closure of the older industries.<br/>
The Bill also refers to assistance for the clearing of derelict land. The need for this in my constituency is also well known to Ministers from their various visits to Wales. Following his visit to Swansea, the Minister for Welsh Affairs will well remember also the derelict land on the immediate approach to the station. I hope I am not pleading in vain, but that, in the spirit of the Bill, we shall receive the support of the Government in this connection also.<br/>
I therefore welcome the Bill as it now is, in the sense that I hope that we shall receive Government help in response to our pleas on behalf of these areas which have been so grievously affected in recent years by the loss of their traditional industries.</p>

<p>Like my hon. Friends, I welcome this small Measure. It is a small Measure, and I think that it will be totally inadequate to deal with the problem facing us in the next year or so. If, at a time when unemployment is going up, the Bank Rate is also going up, it is an indication of the nature and size of the problem that we shall have to face shortly.<br/>
I do not believe that this Bill will do for the North-East any more than could have been done by the Government with their existing powers The problem facing my constituency has faced it now for five or six years, and


no matter how many Ministers come to see us, no matter how many deputations come to London, no matter how many questions are asked, in the House of Commons, nothing appears to happen at all.<br/>
The Parliamentary Secretary said that 12 months ago there were 28 factories unoccupied and there were now only 17, but I can tell him that for two years there has been a large factory unoccupied on the Bede Trading Estate and that last week another firm announced that it would leave that trading estate and transfer its activities to the South. I think the right hon. Gentleman has known about the empty factory and about the firm which intends to leave, but nothing has been done.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman must know that the problem in the North-East, especially in my constituency, gets more acute week by week. Efforts must now be made enough in the North-East to stabilise the position, because we already have to face the closure of further pits and a considerable contraction in shipbuilding and ship-repairing work seems inevitable. No Government could deal with the problems of the contraction of coal mining and shipbuilding with a miserable Bill like this. Something much more substantial is needed. Much more determination than the Government have so far shown will be required if the problems of constituencies like mine are to be solved.<br/>
Throughout our discussions we have been unable to get any idea from the Minister of how much the Government think these provisions will cost&#x2014;&#x00A3;5&#x2013;10 million, &#x00A3;15 million, &#x00A3;50 million, or &#x00A3;150 million. The Government are so sure about the outcome of the Bill that they are unable to say what it will cost. Unless more is spent under this legislation than the Tory Governments since 1951 spent under the 1945 legislation, and the 1958 Act constituencies like mine will continue to face a growing unemployment problem.<br/>
I put this to hon. Members opposite as much as to my hon. Friends; whatever the difference between us. we all believe in democracy and democratic institutions. Men's support of democracy and democratic institutions is tried

to the limit if week by week, month by month and year by year they are denied a place in society. Men who are unemployed feel outcasts and not wanted and can easily become the apostles of all kinds of philosophies to which we do not subscribe. The Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary have said that the world challenge now lies in the social and economic struggle. The test of democracy in this country will be whether it can provide work for men able and capable of working. I make no apology for not believing that that is possible under the existing system. I do not believe that capitalism can, in the last analysis&#x2014;</p>

<p>We cannot discuss capitalism and alternative systems because there is nothing about them in the Bill. Perhaps we could on some other occasion, but not now.</p>

<p>Then I will merely say that I do not believe that the economic and social policies which this Government will pursue under the Bill can answer our problems. And if they cannot, the time will come when the Government will have to give way to people who will find an answer.<br/>
The President of the Board of Trade said that it would not be possible under the Bill for any money to be spent on aesthetic projects without them showing an economic return. Why in the name of fortune should not the slag heaps in the north-east area be removed whether that makes an economic return or not? Why should the north-east and other parts of the country, and South Wales, be despoiled by slag heaps, while the Minister says, in the year 1960, that these eyesores cannot be removed unless someone is able to make a profit out of it? So much wealth has been created in these areas that these eyesores ought to be removed, and many able and skilled men wanting work would be glad even to do that, provided it would give them the dignity of earning their daily bread. I hope that on this aspect the Minister will not be so niggardly.<br/>
I hope I am proved wrong. I hope this Bill fulfils the purpose which the Government hope it will. I hope the Government will be able to prove that they can plan for and provide full employment, because I know what that


means to ordinary men and women. If they do, I shall be the first to shout their praises, but I do not believe that when the Government's tenure of office comes to an end I shall be able to do that. I believe the old industrial areas at the next General Election will be facing the same problems as now.</p>

<p>The purposes of this Bill are of supreme importance, because the Bill deals not with localities or districts, as the new name is, but with people who are presently unemployed or likely to be unemployed. The purpose is to build up the industrial health of Britain and to improve the economic strength of Britain. I cannot imagine any purpose being more important than that.<br/>
The question arises whether or not this Bill in its present form will be able to do what it seeks. Even if we had added all sorts of additional powers to the Bill, it would not have guaranteed its success. In its present form, the Bill gives a tremendous responsibility to the President of the Board of Trade, a greater responsibility free from Parliamentary control than he has had in past legislation. With his advisers, he can decide which areas under Clause I are to get the benefit of help under these powers.<br/>
One of the strangest things is that wile we have been discussing all this in relation to various areas, we have not had the slightest idea what areas are going to be covered. We hear about new projects going to Scotland, but we do not even now know the areas that are going to be specified. The President of the Board of Trade has not been very fair to the House in this respect. If he can announce this for the greater enlightenment of another place, he might have speeded matters up and enabled us to conduct Report and Third Reading knowing whether certain areas are to be included or excluded. It depends entirely on the right hon. Gentleman.<br/>
Decisions concerning building grants, loans, derelict land and all the rest of it rest with the right hon. Gentleman. He has a serious job. The history of the problem right back from the old designated areas, the fact that it has been so intractable and so far has not been solved despite many Acts of Parliament and many Presidents of the Board of Trade. I hope will make the right

hon. Gentleman appreciate just how important it is and how continuous must his attention be if he is to make any impact upon it.<br/>
I have not the slightest doubt that after the Bill is passed the right hon. Gentleman will turn his attention to the Outer Seven or to some other aspect of trade. If this were his only job, it would take all his time, but this is only one of his many jobs. It is one of the weaknesses of the Bill that we are not getting the full attention of one Department to this problem. It is not a question of one area, but many areas with different problems. I doubt whether we shall be satisfied by the Bill as it is at present.<br/>
In Scotland, we have a national tradition that we look gift horses in the mouth. When we were discussing some matter relating to Scotland yesterday, the right hon. Gentleman said that there was to be a development employing 3,500 workers in a part of the motor car industry. Whatever else that is, it is not to be done under the Bill, but under the existing powers. Not one of those jobs is to be provided for three years. Despite this transfer of part of the B.M.C. interests to Scotland and all that has been said about restricting development in presently over-industrialised areas, the main development of B.M.C. will go on in the present areas.</p>

<p>Scotland will get a transfer of what is being presently done, but there will be a considerable expansion in the present area. I do not think that the right hon. Gentleman will deny that. The build-up in relation to employing labour in Scotland will not start for about two years. At present there are 100,000 unemployed in Scotland, and the situation is worsening. I welcome the fact that the right hon. Gentleman changed his mind about keeping the word "imminent." We now have in Clause 1 a much better definition of the time within which he can take action to meet expected unemployment. Where is the action which will lead to the necessary 20,000 jobs per year in Scotland, starting this year? Was it taken three years ago, two years ago or last year? It is not in the Bill


I hope that the right hon. Gentleman does not think that Scotland will be fobbed off with a few headlines, a few new factories, some expansions and bits and pieces of this and that when we are faced with the present problem and there is no indication that the Government will meet it properly.</p>

<p>Even with what we have got in relation to the expansion of the motor car industry, Scotland has a pretty poor share. We welcome it, but we are certainly not satisfied that it will meet all Scotland's difficulties. I sincerely hope that in the decision still to be taken concerning Vauxhall, the needs of Lanarkshire, of Ayrshire and of Scotland will be properly considered.<br/>
The Bill is simply meeting a commitment that was entered into during the General Election when itinerant Tory statesmen discovered that there was unemployment in Scotland and they had to do something about it. Here is their major Bill. It is a bit of temporary Tory tinkering. What is being done, and what is being headlined, could be done under existing legislation. The Bill tinkers with that existing legislation. Members were not sufficiently persuaded last night why the Government must stick in the business of seven years. The result is this temporary Measure.<br/>
The outcome will depend upon the will and the power of the President of the Board of Trade to use his powers. I assure him that Scotland will be watching and will be anxious to ensure that no opportunity is missed to impress upon him the continuing need, month by month and year by year, to attend to the problems of Scotland and to overtake the time lag in relation to industrial development.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman's hand has been strengthened to a certain extent by the granting of industrial development certificates. If he looks through his files to see what has been done in the past. I think he will admit that opportunities have been let slip. I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will use his powers and that if ever there is any question that the person behind him is in any way obstructing him in getting on with the

job, he will give the House of Commons an opportunity of coming to his assistance. I refer, of course, to the Treasury. The hon. Lady the Member for Tynemouth (Dame Irene Ward was right.<br/>
When the Bill is implemented, we may well need to spend an awful lot more money than we have been spending. The noble Lord the Member for Dorset. South (Viscount Hinchingbrooke) complained about grants and I gave him the figure about grants in relation to Scotland for over a year&#x2014;just a few thousand pounds, which meant only about 500 jobs. I hope that hon. Members opposite will be as vigilant as we are to ensure that for the well-being of our country, with its persistent high rate of unemployment, with which our people&#x2014;it is no use the hon. Member for Torquay (Mr. F. M. Bennett) smiling. We have had to live with this problem for many years in Scotland and unemployment at the rate at which we have had it&#x2014;and it is getting worse&#x2014;causes considerable worry and insecurity. I wish I was as sure as the hon. Member that something will be done. The passing of the Bill alone will not get it done. Whether anything is done depends on the use that is made of the powers and on the Treasury, the Board of Trade and Members of Parliament here. We must keep on to ensure that something is done.<br/>
Hon. Members opposite should realise that the existence of the Bill points to the failure of what they were proclaiming to the people of Scotland as the salvation of Scotland&#x2014;private enterprise. If private enterprise was fulfilling its job and meeting the needs of the country, the Bill would not be necessary. It is because it does not meet the needs of the nation that we must resort to the bribery of loan, the inducement of grants and the persuasive powers of negative control, added to all the rest, to try to steer undertakings into areas where, for the well-being of the community, industry is needed. That is really the job which the President of the Board of Trade has got to start on after this Bill is through.<br/>
I can assure him that we from Scotland shall not slacken in our vigilance, because this is just about his last chance in this business. If we in Scotland continue to have mounting unemployment, of which the figures have doubled since


the Tories came to power in 1951, I can assure him that at the next election it will not only be a question of more Conservatives being defeated: let him not be surprised if Scotland turns to nationalism&#x2014;that has happened before&#x2014;if we see that our just demands are being neglected by an English-dominated Parliament. The hon. Lady the Member for Tynemouth knows quite well that when she went to support her point of view in the Lobby tonight, along with me, we were voted down by a majority of Members from English constituencies, most of whom do not properly appreciate the effect of unemployment in these areas.<br/>
I give the President of the Board of Trade this warning. Let him not weary of well doing. I am satisfied that after his visit to Scotland he appreciates the problems of Scotland, but it will take continuous and persistent efforts on his part to ensure that sufficient industries are steered there, or sufficient Scottish industries are encouraged in growth to fulfil the need of the people of Scotland.</p>

<p>In all the speeches I have heard from that side of the House, I have not yet heard one which was enthusiastic in support of the Bill. I have spent a good deal of time in the Chamber, in Commitee, on Second Reading, and now on Third Reading, and I have not heard one speech from that side of the House enthusiastic in support of the Bill. From every northern part of the Kingdom and even from the South Coast there have been expressed fears that this Bill will not really be effective.<br/>
However, my main reason for rising tonight is that I was interested in the point of view of my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle-upon-Tyne, Central (Mr. Short). I assume that under the Bill the President of the Board of Trade, in consultation with his advisory committee and the Treasury, will have power to use discrimination as between types of industrial enterprise which he may choose to encourage to move from one area to another. This Bill deals, presumably, only with financing any sort of industry which will give employment in moving from a densely industrialised area into areas like Scotland, the North-East

Coast or Wales where unemployment is heavy mainly because the mainspring of economic activity in the past has been a group of capital-producing industries.<br/>
I believe that there is something in this and that it ought to be considered. I believe it is very important. Taking the whole of Scotland, it might be desirable in the interests not only of the economy but of Scotland to induce into Scotland industries which produce those consumer durable goods which enter regularly into the domestic market.</p>

<p>Not too durable, I agree. I have been in the motor car industry all my working life. Let my hon. Friend be assured that I am well inculcated with the idea that eighteen months is about long enough for a car to last. I will not mention a particular make of car. We can make them last a good time more. However, I appreciate the point.<br/>
This employment problem is a frightful one, and it is difficult for any Government to try to ease the pressure on labour in certain areas and to stimulate employment in other areas. In trying to solve it, we might consider not only geographical areas but also types of industry.<br/>

<p>I suggested&#x2014;I thought I saw the President of the Board of Trade nod&#x2014;that the Minister would have powers within the Bill, in consultation with his advisory committee and the Treasury, to make the inducement perhaps a little better to certain types of industry which would more favour his purpose in that they would provide more employment. I believe that he has the power to make a choice between industries. Will he assure me that he has power to discriminate? If he has not, then I cannot deal with the point. As the Minister makes no reply, I assume that he has the power. The point is that in Scotland&#x2014;</p>

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. Surely this is very relevant to


the Bill, because the whole point is that this is the type of industry that we want in these areas, industries producing durable consumer goods which will benefit from an increase in income elsewhere, and not the old basic industries which do not necessarily benefit appreciably from a rise in income elsewhere? This is the only way to ensure that these areas share in the general prosperity of the country.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend has helped me considerably and made the point I was about to make, on the assumption that the Minister can discriminate, that it would be advisable to place industries of the type he mentioned in Scotland. When B.M.C. commercial vehicle production comes to Scotland, that will not be further diversification. In Scotstoun we already have a huge commercial vehicle plant, Albion Motor Co. Ltd., now controlled by Ley-lands, and it produces the same capital goods as B.M.C. will do. It is not diversification in the sense that we shall be producing goods which will skim off purchasing power from other parts of the country. If we had industries producing consumer durable goods such as electric fires, kettles and saucepans and other articles for the general domestic market and for export as well, it would help us to get away from the frightful dependence on the production of merely capital goods. The Scottish position is that much of the extra purchasing power generated will be plunged down to the Midlands market where all the consumer durable goods are produced. It would be good economic policy to differentiate between different types of industries when dealing with certain regions.<br/>
The B.M.C. factory will, it is estimated, employ 3,000&#x2013;4,000 men. By the end of March a factory in Dunbartonshire employing 6,000&#x2013;7,000 men will be closing down, so that the effect of the B.M.C. factory is nullified already. Unemployment is now in the region of 98,000, having gone up about 2,000 in the last few months, and it is likely to continue rising. When the Rootes Group and B.M.C., on their own figures, come into operation they will employ only 7,000 men between them.<br/>
I shall be very much surprised if when B.M.C. has laid down the plant and is

ready to go into production the toolmakers and production engineers have not so designed the production techniques that they increase the output per man-hour as a result of new technology, so that it may well be that the estimate of 3,000&#x2013;4,000 men being employed in three years' time may be reduced to below 3,000. Because the capacity of the industry to progress technologically is terrific, especially after moving to a new site and getting a factory built with the maximum functional design. Anyone who knows the Renault plant in Paris and has seen its techniques will know that it is the most modern and the fastest producing plant in the world.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman referred to the placing of regional contracts by the Government. In this Bill there are powers to enable the Government to assist those enterprises which are already in existence. In Kirkintilloch, in my constituency, there are several boundaries where for years before the war castings were made. In the last five years they have lost their contracts for the Post Office. The Government have placed those contracts somewhere in England. Surely the Government could play their part in this matter by ensuring that contracts are places where there are resources and equipment capable of producing what Government Departments require,


whether it is on the North-East Coast or in Scotland. Surely it is reasonable to expect that from a Government whose purpose it is to try to solve the terrible problem which has existed for the past 30 or 40 years.<br/>
There is a sort of schizophrenia among hon. Members opposite. We have had three Measures designed to solve this problem and failed, and this one may fail for the same reason&#x2014;the fear of State intervention and State planning. Let us be honest about this, for goodness sake. No group of business men can be expected to solve a social problem which is essentially the responsibility of the Government. A motor car manufacturer cannot be expected to solve a social problem. It is his job to study the conditions under which he employs his workers and to see that he pays them decent wages and that his equipment is good. He has no power to solve a social problem. His bank manager would not allow him to do so. If he were successful in solving a social problem, and his bank overdraft went up by &#x00A3;1 million every year, he would soon he out of business. Private enterprise cannot be expected to do this. Hon. Members opposite know that, so they bring in a Bill to utilise the taxpayers' money to finance him to do a bit towards solving this social problem. That is what the Bill is doing.<br/>
I believe every hon and right hon. Member opposite is really anxious to get rid of this top-heaviness in our social structure. A great friend of mine is just as sincere when he says he does not want to drink, but someone has only to take him in and buy him a couple of drinks to start him off again.<br/>
The financial conditions laid down by the laws of commerce must be adhered to by those who engage in the productive process, and this Bill cannot fill the gap. Very often the gap gets wider. I do not believe that within ten years this Bill will solve the problem of the disparity between employment conditions in Scotland and conditions in the Midlands and the South. If in five years we reach full employment in Scotland there will be twenty jobs vacant here and one man looking for them. The B.M.C. is coming to Scotland, but the space vacated in Birmingham will be occupied and developed for a further spurt in production at that

point. The labour is going to be retained there; it is not coming to Scotland, except for selected skilled labour. We shall not reduce the pressure here, but maintain employment here. There will not be a movement of population as well as absorption of unemployment in Scotland. I do not believe the problem can be solved unless there is relief of the pressure here and an increase of pressure in Scotland.<br/>
I hope the President of the Board of Trade can assure us that when he is considering an area like the North-East Coast, Wales or Scotland, where there is terrific dependence on industries which are entirely capital producing, in making his various contacts and moves to induce industries to go to those areas he will do what he can to look for industries which are not in their nature producers of capital goods but producers of all the smaller merchandise and consumer durables which enter the domestic market and the export market. If he can do that there is a greater chance of a more equitable distribution of economic activity in the country than if we rely entirely on producer-consumer industries.</p>

<p>I should like to say a few words of welcome for the Bill. I do not share the pessimism of the hon. Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Bence). I think this Bill may well be successful in its inspiration of spreading employment throughout the areas of the United Kingdom which are experiencing and have experienced persistent high unemployment.<br/>
In their economic planning and in their decision to introduce the Bill&#x2014;perhaps the most important Bill in the present Parliament&#x2014;the Government are making a brave attempt to solve this terrible problem, which is a social as well as an economic problem. What greater wastage can there be than to have trained and skilled men in various parts of the country, where the pattern of employment is changing, who cannot find other work when their industries contract? This method of combating unemployment and of spending public money in encouraging industry to go to these areas is perhaps the most sensible way in which the taxpayers' money can be spent.


In exercising his powers under Clause 18 and in granting industrial development certificates, I hope that the President of the Board of Trade will remember the high unemployment in Northern Ireland. I hope that he will remember that unemployment there has recently risen to 8 per cent. I have had the unpleasant news that in my constituency 1,200 skilled engineers who are working in the aircraft factory of Short and Harland are to be laid off. With 8 per cent. unemployed, it will be very difficult for these men to find other work in Northern Ireland. I hope that in exercising his powers under Clause 18, which allow him in granting industrial development certificates to pay particular regard
<q>to the need for providing appropriate employment in the localities mentioned</q>
in Clause 2&#x2014;which unfortunately is restricted to Great Britain&#x2014;the Minister will not forget the rest of the United Kingdom. I hope that he will not forget Northern Ireland. In our shipbuilding and aircraft industry we are very vulnerable to this scourge and this great wastage.<br/>
I wish my right hon. Friend every success in this attempt to deal with the problem. I hope that the economic planning of the whole country, which our party has accepted, will be successful in making the maximum use of the available resources throughout the United Kingdom in order to raise the general standard of living and the prosperity of the country.</p>

<p>It can be said that since the Bill was introduced into the House there have been some material improvements in it. I have attended practically every sitting on the Bill, because my constituency is deeply concerned about the operation of the Bill.<br/>
I was happy to see that Minister introduce the word "diversification," for unless we have diversification of industry it will become impossible to provide adequate employment prospects for both the male and female insured population on the register. In most of our areas the old basic industries are contracting, and it will be necessary to replace them with diversified industries to compensate for this loss of employment. If the

Minister is anxious to apply the principles which he outlined to us and which he mas incorporated in the Bill, he will find that the inclusion of the word "diversification" will assist greatly in his efforts.<br/>
I was also delighted to notice that he still defended the need to provide for both grants and loans to be included of the Bill. Only when living in an area of considerable unemployment can one really appreciate the tremendous difficulty of inducing industrialists to move from the South to such areas. In some circumstances, it can be accomplished by loans; in other circumstances, it can not possibly be done without grants. I am glad, therefore, that the right hon. Gentleman has insisted on retaining provision for both loans and grants as a working element in ensuring that the Bill has some measure of success.<br/>
I am also glad that the President of the Board of Trade is very keen on the Clause 5, which deals with the clearance of derelict sites. The underlying intention of Clause 5 (1) is that work can be done with a view to improving amenities in the neighbourhood. That is the purpose of Clause 5 (1). As requested, I intend to be really optimistic about this provision. I believe that the right hon. Gentleman could use that provision very effectively to assist communities in the elimination of eyesores.<br/>
I hope that one of the first results of his generosity will be the tackling of the Monkland Canal at Coatbridge; that we will receive a substantial grant to remove what is not only physically unsightly and obnoxious to the nostrils, but an obscenity which is a menace to the community's health. That objectionable stretch of disused waterway passes through a community of 53,000 people. In being optimistic about this, I say to the President of the Board of Trade, "I am sure that your intentions are good and your desires honourable. By making a substantial grant towards the removal of this nuisance you will make a name for yourself, and your Bill in my constituency.<br/>
It is also good to know that, according to the right hon. Gentleman and the Parliamentary Secretary, we are to tackle the unemployment problem really


earnestly. I am not unmindful of the good news that was recently proclaimed for one part of Scotland. We are grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for his co-operation in this respect, but I ask him to remember that we are looking for 90,000 jobs in Scotland&#x2014;not 4,500. I know it is a tall order, but it is indicative of the nature of our problem.<br/>
The County of Lanark is looking for 10,000 jobs. North Lanark is the hardest hit place in West Scotland, at intervals unemployment there being as high as between 11 per cent. and 12 per cent. of the insured population. If the President of the Board of Trade could, through the operation of the appropriate Clauses of this Bill, steer a car industry into North Lanark to give employment for 4,000 to 5,000 workers, and could also create the prerequisites for attracting ancillary industries, I can assure him that in those parts both he and this Bill would go clown in the annals of our history for having achieved such a remarkable record of success.<br/>
I appeal to him to ensure that the provisions of this Measure will be operated irrespective of whether there is likely to be any obstreperousness from other sections of the Government. That is a very important qualification. Quite apart from the financial machinations that arise&#x2014;and they will be many&#x2014;I have no doubt that when we make application for certain grants we will be told by the Treasury that the country is in a state of poverty, that the Treasury itself is on the verge of bankruptcy&#x2014;and, eventually, that we have never really had it so bad. After hearing the right hon. Gentleman's promises and his arguments for the Bill, I think that he will be prepared to fight against any obstacles or difficulties put in his way by the Treasury.<br/>
I return to a plea which I made to the Parliamentary Secretary and to which he did not reply. I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will give us an assurance, which he refused to give earlier, about the activity of other Departments with their own responsibility and authority&#x2014;that such Departments will ensure that other aspects of industrial development for which they are responsible will be fully effected. I refer to the need for someone to speak on behalf of the Scottish Department of Health. I ask the right hon. Gentleman to undertake

to acquaint the Secretary of State for Scotland with the terms of the Bill, so that that right hon. Gentleman will know what we have been doing, in order that when we make our representations for houses for industrial workers, he will be able to approve them immediately, understanding that such is the intention of Parliament. I am not trying to be facetious, insulting, or in any way offensive to the Secretary of State, but we have bitter experience of the operations of the Scottish Office North of the Border.<br/>
The President of the Board of Trade and his Parliamentary Secretary have said that the powers provided by the Bill will be sufficiently effective to enable them to deal once and for all with the sad and tragic problem of unemployment. We have discussed the Bill for several days and I am very glad to have had the opportunity to participate in these discussions, because I come from an area which suffers bitterly from this problem and, though lacking in Parliamentary experience, I understand the unemployment problem and hope that I have been able to make useful contributions to the discussions. I am concerned always with policies and not with personalities, but the Bill puts the right hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friend on trial. I hope that they will acquit themselves well and ensure the success of an admitted effort to eliminate this serious social problem from our midst.</p>

<p>We are very near to the end of our House of Commons consideration of what right hon. Gentlemen opposite have described as the major Bill of this Session. It is a Bill which many hon. Members opposite have regarded as giving the President of the Board of Trade power which he had hitherto not possessed to assist areas which he could not hitherto assist. However, the right hon. Gentleman knows full well that his supporters are gravely mistaken in their assumptions.<br/>
The Bill does not provide the right hon. Gentleman with additional powers. He was just as free under the Distribution of Industry (Industrial Finance) Act, 1958, to give areas not scheduled under the 1945 legislation all the financial assistance which he could give for the promotion of industrial activity leading to increased employment. In earlier


debates, the right hon. Gentleman himself made it clear that the proportion of the population which he expects will be included in the list which he is to publish will be broadly similar to the proportion of the population covered by the now existing D.A.T.A.C. list.<br/>
The new list which, we are told, will come out next week and which, according to the Parliamentary Secretary will be the B.O.T.A.C. list, is surely the D.A.T.A.C. list of this week. We shall be very surprised if it is different. It will be different only inasmuch as the level of unemployment has moved a little between one area and another since then. Of course, there are development districts, but they may not then be B.O.T.A.C. areas. Development districts, according to the definition given by the President of the Board of Trade in an earlier discussion of districts that are to be assisted by him, will, in fact, be those parts of the country which he has listed under the Act of 1958. some of them inside and some outside the areas scheduled as Development Areas under the 1945 Act. So that all that is new in this major Bill&#x2014;this bit of revolutionary legislation&#x2014;is that the right hon. Gentleman will be able to give to an industrialist in one of these listed areas a grant of 85 per cent. of the difference between the cost of building his factory and the value put upon it by the district valuer at the time the application for the grant was made, which is some time before the district valuer is able to have a look at the factory, because obviously it is long before the factory is built.<br/>
One is bound to say to the right hon. Gentleman as we conclude our deliberations that it is a pity that he should have kept us in the dark about his list until a week after the Bill leaves this House. Members of another place will have the list before them, but they do not represent constituencies or have constituents as we do. It is a pity that they are given a facility that has been denied to Members of this House by a Minister, one is bound to believe, who considered it impolitic to let us have the information we should properly have had in considering whether or not to allow him to scrap all the distribution of industry legislation passed since 1945, with all the provision for scheduling, and to give us this Bill in its place.<br/>
However, if the President feels that he would rather solve the problem of local unemployment by this Bill then we must defer to his wish. If he is determined to solve the problem and would prefer to do so under this Bill than under existing legislation, we cannot object. The important thing is that he should have this determination.<br/>
The Parliamentary Secretary uttered some words about the new policy on rents. He told us this evening that as from Monday of this week, 1st February, the rents concession announced more than a year ago was withdrawn. That means that as from Monday the rents to be determined for factories owned by the Government in those areas listed for special assistance because of the high level of unemployment will be the market value rents as determined by the district valuer. I think that is true.<br/>
I hope that hon. Gentlemen realise what the position is and how much Government finance has gone into the alleviation of unemployment in those socially distressed areas. The biggest of them is Scotland. The Board of Trade has invested in all the Government factories in the Scottish Development Areas &#x00A3;25 million over twenty-five years. This is not taxpayers' money given away. Over twenty-five years &#x00A3;25 million has been invested in industrial buildings, every one of which is making a return in rent to the Government. By charging the market value rent today for many of those factories the right hon. Gentleman is making a substantial profit on the investment.<br/>
That should be borne in mind when hon. Gentlemen talk about the expenditure involved in taking industry to parts of the country where it does not want to go. No one can conceivably compare this kind of investment with the granting of &#x00A3;30 million or &#x00A3;50 million to re-organise the cotton industry. This is an investment all along the line which, by the policy announced by the Parliamentary Secretary in moving Third Reading, is calculated to return a profit to the President of the Board of Trade as the owner of the factories.</p>

<p>The right hon. Gentleman will not make a profit on the factories that he built last year, but he will make a substantial profit on the factories built before the war and he will make a very substantial annual profit on those factories built by other Government Departments for war purposes and then handed over to the Board of Trade after the war for the purpose of the Distribution of Industry Act.<br/>
We should get this matter into perspective. A large amount of taxpayers' money has been spent on the implementation of distribution of industry policy. There is much misunderstanding about this. If the right hon. Gentleman believes that I am wrong in any of my figures, particularly about the figure of &#x00A3;25 million spent in Scotland over twenty-five years, I hope that he will correct me later. I must warn him that if he does he will be contradicting the figures I obtained from Scottish Industrial Estates Limited a little while ago.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman has a big job to do. I will not labour Scotland's problem too much, because we have heard much about it. It is serious. We still have 98,000 unemployed, and the figure is rising. I have said much about the industrial parts of Scotland.<br/>
I will now say a word about the parts of Scotland which were by-passed by the Industrial Revolution. I mean the northern part of Scotland, the Highlands, the far north, the part of the country represented by the hon. Member for Caithness and Sutherland (Sir D. Robertson), who is not with us at this late hour but who has been with us most of the time we have been considering the Bill. In Caithness at the Wick Employment Exchange 12&#x00B7;9 per cent. of the insured population are registered as unemployed. In Sutherland at the Thurso Employment Exchange 8&#x00B7;6 per cent. of the insured population are registered as unemployed. This is the part of the country that has suffered more depopulation than any other part in recent years. People have been pouring out of the area for a long time, and yet it still shows these high figures of unemployment. Although the powers that the right hon. Gentleman has taken in the Bill are a repetition of existing powers, I hope he will feel that the powers he

now has will enable him to deal with an area like that.<br/>
I should like to give another two figures to show the difference between the position in Scotland and the position elsewhere. We are concerned about the opportunity of employment for young people. It is bad enough for a middle-aged man, a man of 45, 50 or 55, to be out of a job and to find difficulty in getting another&#x2014;</p>

<p>I appreciate my hon. Friend's wish to detail his examination of the position in Scotland, but we are dealing with a Bill which applies to other parts of the country with equally bad unemployment problems. Is he concerned solely with Scotland, or is he concerned with the Bill as it applies throughout the whole of the country?</p>

<p>My hon. Friend has sat through a lot of the consideration of the Bill and he has heard me make a number of speeches on it. I would have thought that by this time he realised that I was interested in unemployment anywhere. Just as I should not be surprised that my hon. Friend should mention Gloucestershire in the course of one of his speeches, he must not be surprised if I mention Scotland. I have not mentioned my constituency, but I have mentioned the area that has 10 per cent. of the population and over 20 per cent. of the unemployment.<br/>
It is serious enough for the middle-aged man to be out of a job and to find it exceedingly difficult to get another, but it is much worse for the school leavers to find that they have no prospect of employment in the areas in which they live. Their only hope of getting a job is to leave home.</p>

<p>Yes, but they have to leave their homes and their parents and go away. That, unfortunately, is the position.<br/>
I take the figures that one finds in the Ministry of Labour Gazette and in the Digest of Statistics published by the Board of Trade. One cannot take every small part of the country, because they are not all listed, but I compare the region of Scotland with the region called the Midlands, with, broadly


speaking, the same population, although the size of population does not matter for this comparison. In Scotland, in December, there were 22 notified vacancies for every 100 unemployed boys under 18 years of age; there were five unemployed boys for every job. In the Midlands, however, there were 1,700 vacancies for every 100 unemployed boys. So that in Scotland there were five unemployed boys chasing every available job, whereas in the Midlands seventeen jobs were chasing every available boy.<br/>
That is the difference between two parts of the country. That is why I should be failing in my responsibility if I had not called attention to the need for the powers given in the Bill to be vigorously implemented in favour of an area such as that. And in this area where there are seventeen jobs chasing every unemployed boy we have, despite what the B.M.C. is putting into other parts of the country, new capital investment by B.M.C., according to newspaper reports, of &#x00A3;26 million. Is that not right? The President of the Board of Trade says, "A jolly good thing." I say that in this area where seventeen jobs are chasing every unemployed boy there is still now to be a further &#x00A3;26 million of capital investment, and the President of the Board of Trade says, "A jolly good thing." He was inviting us yesterday to throw our hate into the air because we should be delighted because in Scotland, where there are 98,000 unemployed, and five unemployed boys chasing every job, there will be &#x00A3;9 million of capital investment.</p>

<p>May I add once again that the new jobs being created by the B.M.C. scheme will be outside the Birmingham area, and that the new investment in the Birmingham area will greatly increase the productivity of the existing labour force? Surely to goodness that is in the interest of the whole nation, including Scotland.</p>

<p>I am not disagreeing with capital investment in any part of the country, but the right hon. Gentleman will agree that he sounded very much yesterday as though the only capital investment that was being made at this time by B.M.C. was in Scotland and that we ought to be jolly pleased it was

there. All I am saying now is that according to Press reports there will be some &#x00A3;9 million of capital investment in Scotland.</p>

<p>Yesterday, we were not on Third Reading. We are now. Whether or not capital investment is going on in those companies in the Midlands has nothing whatever to do with this Bill. If the hon. Member relates what he is saying to the Bill, then I do not mind his saying it, but at the moment it seems to me he is not.</p>

<p>With all respect, Mr. Speaker, I would point out that Part I of the Bill deals with positive steps which the President of the Board of Trade can take to assist areas where there is a high and persistent rate of unemployment and that Part II deals with the steps which he can take to discourage, or refuse assistance to, industrial development which will permit of further employment and further capital investment in those areas which are already congested.<br/>
But I leave this matter there now. In any case, we have had a long debate. There is not much point in our continuing it further; at least, I do not feel that there is any point in my continuing it further at this time of night.<br/>
There have been one or two pleas from both sides of the House to the President of the Board of Trade that he should influence his colleagues in the Government to secure that Government Departments will give some preference to development districts in the placing of contracts. I hope he has listened with sympathy to those pleas. I believe that Government Departments could do very much more than they do at present. It is the declared policy, and has been for some time, that they should give some preference. We do not want improperly to give support to incompetence and inefficiency, but I believe that a good deal more could be done than is being done. I believe that the nationalised industries could follow suit. I believe that they have not played the part they could in supporting industry in the difficult areas. I believe that local authorities, too, could do a great deal more than they do at present.<br/>
We are delighted to give to the President of the Board of Trade the powers which are contained in the 1945 Act of nearly fifteen years ago, albeit


he has insisted in having them dressed up in new clothing. The important thing, however, is that he should use the powers.<br/>
Despite the exchange we had just a moment ago, let me say this as I sit down. I believe that the right hon. Gentleman wishes to use the powers. I believe that there is a far better chance of those powers being exercised now than there was, a better chance now that he occupies his present office than ever there was when his predecessor was in the job. I never had any hope then whatsoever. The right hon. Gentleman who then held the office knew that very well indeed. However, I think a great many of us believe that the right hon. Gentleman really does wish to make a large contribution towards the solving of the problems that have been so very much in our minds during the consideration of the Bill. I can safely say on behalf of my right hon. and hon. Friends that we wish him well in this task, and we therefore give our blessing to the Bill as it leaves us.</p>

<p>I am grateful to the hon. Member for Hamilton (Mr. T. Fraser) for the blessing that he has given to the Bill, though I expect that in his view it is still inadequate. Once again, I will certainly accept that the test of the Bill is not so much the text of it but the effect it has when the powers are implemented.<br/>
I shall try to deal as briefly as I can with the various points which have been raised in the course of the debate. A number of hon. Members have referred to the fact that many Government Departments are concerned in this problem. That is perfectly true. That is one of the reasons why the Bill, though presented by the Board of Trade, is supported by the Secretary of State for Scotland, the Minister of Housing and Local Government and Minister for Welsh Affairs and other members of the Government; and, of course, in all these matters the Government act as one.<br/>
To my hon. Friend the Member for Tynemouth (Dame Irene Ward), who was concerned about the shadow of the Treasury falling over my shoulder, perhaps I can speak as gamekeeper turned poacher in these matters; I can tell her that if she is asking questions about the

carrying out of the Bill she should direct them to the Board of Trade because it is our responsibility not only to take action but to obtain the necessary consent of the Treasury to the carrying out of that action. If she has any rocks to throw, we are the target.<br/>
The question of the concessionary rates was raised by the hon. Member for Aberavon (Mr. Morris) and the hon. Member for Hamilton. This is not a new announcement. I should point out that when my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary announced the creation of the concessionary rates over a year ago he then said specifically that this was a special arrangement only to last for twelve months. What he said this afternoon merely confirmed what was said at that time.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) referred to the question of Government contracts. I should particularly like to take this opportunity of confirming that the Government preference scheme, to which he referred, will continue in its present form and apply to the districts which will be specified under the Bill.<br/>
The hon. Members for Gower (Mr. I. Davies), Jarrow (Mr. Fernyhough) and Coatbridge and Airdrie (Mr Dempsey) referred to the powers for dealing with derelict areas. We certainly believe that the new form of the Bill will widen our powers in this regard which so far have been restricted by the legal definition of "derelict" as being "ownerless and abandoned". I should make it clear once again that as this is a Bill to deal with local unemployment it does not give us powers to remove slagheaps and so on simply for the sake of amenity but only where doing so will contribute to the basic purpose of the Bill, namely to make the area more attractive to industrialists to go into it and create employment. I share the views of hon Members that there may well be cases&#x2014;I will not refer to any particular example&#x2014;where the use of these powers may be of considerable value.<br/>
I have one or two words to say to the hon. Member for Kilmarnock (Mr. Ross). He and the hon. Member for Hamilton referred to the B.M.C. scheme I must pay tribute to the British Motor Corporation for what I think is the very public spirited attitude which it has


adopted. Its new big expansion is being spread over the country as a whole, taking place in Birmingham, Scotland, South Wales, Merseyside and Swynnerton.<br/>
The real thing that we are concerned about is the creation of employment. The scheme which the Corporation put forward, on the basis of which we have granted it I.D.C.s, provides that all new employment will be created outside the Birmingham area. At the same time we have given the Corporation I.D.C.s for expansion in Birmingham which will mean the creation of greater amenities and the reduction of overcrowding in its Birmingham premises without increasing the existing labour force, and, secondly will mean that with the existing labour force the Corporation will be able to make a great increase in productivity. Therefore, there will be a great strengthening of its competitive position particularly in the overseas markets. I should have thought that satisfactory both from the point of view of the country as a whole and the areas where employment is required. On the one hand, the country will get the benefit of the increased competitive power of the Corporation and on the other, all the new employment which is created will be outside the crowded Birmingham area. I was a little disappointed that the hon. Member for Hamilton was, possibly, a little grudging about it.</p>

<p>I think I speak for all my hon. Friends when I say that we were delighted about the B.M.C. development in Scotland. The thing which has annoyed us a little is the impression we got that the Minister, and certainly the supporters of the Government, felt that because this thing has happened, Scotland's worries are over. That is not the position.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1960-02-03a.1179.1" hansard_membership_id="9029" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/18046" speakername="Mr. Maudling" colnum="1179" time="">
<p>Certainly I agree that any such impression would be nonsense. This is just a beginning. I hope that ancillary firms and the makers of components will follow and, in so far as the hon. Member for Hamilton is expressing that hope, I accept his point of view.<br/>
I was not so surprised at the hon. Member for Kilmarnock and I should like to address a word or two to the hon. Gentleman. Having listened to

many of his speeches during the passage of this Bill, I cannot think of any series of speeches more calculated to damage the true interests of Scotland. It seems to me that any non-Scot foolish enough to attach importance to the mixture of threats and discourtesy that comes from the hon. Gentleman would think not only twice, but three times, before going near Scotland with his enterprise.<br/>
I assure the House that the Government will continue to base their policy in these matters on what the hon. Member for Hamilton so rightly said about the very high level of unemployment in Scotland, because it is the motive of the Government to try to cure this problem. My hon. Friend the Member for Belfast, East (Mr. McMaster) raised an important point. I should like to confirm, whatever is said in the Bill&#x2014;and he was right on the narrow point of what is in the Bill&#x2014;that in operating the I.D.C. system we shall certainly bear in mind not only the unemployment requirements in Great Britain but in Northern Ireland as well, and I am glad to have the opportunity of confirming that.<br/>
As has been announced by my hon. Friend, we shall shortly be publishing an initial list of districts. There will be room to add more if conditions require because we have not yet finalised it. But, in any case, it would not have been appropriate to publish the list before this Bill had completed its passage through the House of Commons, because there is here a change of conception. Under the earlier legislation the House of Commons determined that certain areas should be given special treatment. This Bill changes the conception to saying that any area qualifying by certain criteria shall be entitled to certain benefits and those areas therefore will change from time to time This is not Parliamentary determination of special areas, it is Parliamentary determination on a general principle to be applied administratively.<br/>
I hope very much that in dealing with these matters we shall try to avoid controversy between one district and another but I am quite certain that in practice we shall not be able entirely to do so. In recent weeks I have become aware of the great difficulty which arises here. Clearly, there are fewer companies coming forward, which are available to


be guided into these areas of unemployment, than we require to satisfy the needs of everyone. Therefore there is competition between Merseyside, the North East Coast, Scotland, and Wales for the available new enterprises. We shall do our best to avoid any discrimination all round. I assure my hon. Friend the Member for Tynemouth that although there is no Secretary of State for England&#x2014;I sympathise with her point of view in this matten&#x2014;I have taken great pains in discussions with industrialists to point out the importance of the North East Coast and particularly the availability of skilled labour in that area. The fact is that we must recognise that we cannot direct people to go to particular places. I think that is accepted on both sides of the House. If industrialists are prepared to go to an area where there is a really serious problem of unemployment, I do not see how we can refuse to give them the support to which they are entitled under the Bill for doing so.<br/>
We must be careful not to take decisions on the basis of whether a place is in Scotland, England or Wales. It is true that there is a special problem in Scotland, but it is a special problem, not a Scottish problem, special because of the remoteness and the figures of unemployment there. Probably Anglesey could produce similar figures. I make the plea again that we should treat it as a special

problem and not as a Scottish problem. If we do that I think we shall reach the desired conclusion.<br/>
I do not think there is anything more I need add. On many occasions in the House and in Committee I have explained the basic purpose the Government have in the Bill. I know that members of the party opposite do not feel that it contributes very much to the legislation of the country. I accept that they feel that, but the point is that we now have the powers to do the job and we wish to do it.</p>

<p>I wish at this late hour to raise the problem of caravans in the country. The problem arises in two forms. One is that of the holiday caravan. There it is an alternative to a tent, but a tent has the big advantage that it can be taken down and moved away easily whereas a caravan cannot. Secondly, the holiday caravan is an increasing danger on the roads. Anyone who, at week-ends or in August, has travelled in many parts of the country following a caravan pulled as a trailer behind a car and has found difficulty in passing it, knows that a large increase in the use of caravans would increase the dangers on the roads.<br/>
There is a need for caravan sites at the seaside and at beauty spots. They should be properly located to prevent the amenities of the countryside being destroyed and to ensure that reasonable facilities, such as toilets, water supply and so on, are provided for the people using them. It is a serious problem to preserve the amenities and to provide reasonable facilities on the site.<br/>
The great difficulty about the caravan site is that it tends to become permanent. After the holiday season, people tend to remain in the caravans, and some caravans gradually become permanent dwellings. The difficulty about a permanent caravan site is that the law does not differentiate between the caravan site as a temporary holiday place and the caravan site which has become a permanent dwelling place.<br/>
The problem of the permanent caravan site is becoming very serious for all planning authorities in the country. The recent Arton Wilson Report shows that 150,000 people are dwelling in caravans at present, which means about 60,000 households, and that it is a growing problem, because the number of caravans is increasing year by year. The Report shows that most people living in caravans are young married couples, who usually have work available in the neighbourhood but who do not have a house available near their work. They

hope to get a house at some time in the future, and most of them ultimately succeed, but they are replaced in the caravan or on the site by someone else. Most of these people collect around areas where work is available but houses are not available.<br/>
The problem is most acute, therefore, in the Greater London area and the Midlands, where there are prosperity and boom conditions. The problem is particularly serious to planning authorities in Surrey and my own county, Essex, but is generally a problem in all areas where industry is booming.<br/>
In Essex the problem has become so serious that last year the county planning committee set up a special sub-committee to consider and report on the problems arising from the caravan sites in Essex and to make recommendations. They have not been able to find a solution to their problems locally but they have made a number of suggestions to the Ministry on the matter.<br/>
It is basically a problem of housing and the location of industry. We do not find these colonies of caravans in areas where there is unemployment, and therefore&#x2014;bearing in mind the discussions earlier this evening&#x2014;in so far as we can direct industry into areas where there is unemployment and where houses are available, to that extent we relieve the need of people to have caravans in other areas. In so far as we can persuade development to take place either in new towns away from the developed industrial areas such as greater London or in developing towns such as Thetford and Ashford, which are out of the Greater London area but fairly near it; and in so far as we can bring new development to such places, both in industry and in houses, to that extent we reduce the pressure of those people who create caravan colonies and build up a problem in the Home Counties and other boom areas.<br/>
This is a way of dealing with the background of the problem as part of a way of dealing with the problem itself, but even when one has dealt with the background there remains a very serious problem. I do not think we can say that the caravan problem will disappear. It is a permanent feature. Some people pine for the caravan as a way of living at a certain period of their lives. We must accept the fact that


some people want to live in that way and will live in that way.<br/>
In providing an opportunity for them to do so we must see that it does not create other serious problems. In providing sites for caravans we must deal satisfactorily with the problems of sanitation and health and with amenities both for the residents on the caravan sites and the remainder&#x2014;the major part&#x2014;of the population, who do not want to see the countryside destroyed, or made ugly, by a litter of caravans all over the place. If we are to deal with the problem we must see that sites for caravans are satisfactory from the point of view of both the people dwelling in the caravans and the community as a whole. That means that one does not have the caravan sites in the green belts. It is most important that we should not allow intrusion of odd caravans on any of the green belts round our industrial centres.<br/>
There is a strong case for putting these caravan sites near industrial areas on land intended for development for either industrial or housing purposes in the fairly near future. If the land is to be developed in that way then, temporarily, at any rate, it does no harm for it to be developed as a suitable caravan site.<br/>
When one comes to the open country and the seaside, it is very important that very careful selection of the sites should be made on a long-term basis&#x2014;on a reasonable lease&#x2014;so that the necessary hygienic amenities, shelter belts and the like can be provided, in order that the sites do not intrude on the public amenities as a whole. However, if we are to solve this satisfactorily, the local authorities must have adequate powers to control selection, and to prevent sudden development in the wrong places where satisfactory facilities cannot be provided, or where the caravans will annoy the general public. Under the present law there are very great difficulties and, particularly, delays in dealing with the matter.<br/>
The Essex County Council has drawn up an interesting programme of the sort of dates that arise in trying to prevent seasonal caravan camps coming into being. In giving these dates, the authority has assumed that the planning authority has moved at the earliest possible time all the way through.

However, human nature being as it is, that is not always the case.<br/>
It is assumed that the operator brings caravans on to his site on 1st April. Under the general development order, he has 28 days' use. On 29th April the local planning authority, having ascertained that the operator is continuing to use the site, serves an enforcement notice in advance. The said notice is served by post on 30th April. The notice cannot become effective until 28th May. On 27th May the operator applies for planning permission.<br/>
On 1st June, the planning authority decides to refuse permission. Notice of that decision is served on the operator, who then has 28 days in which to appeal to the Minister. On 27th June, the operator appeals to the Minister for a local inquiry, and that local inquiry cannot be held before mid-August. The Minister rarely issues his decision before the expiration of two months from the
date of the local inquiry. In mid-October, the Minister dismisses the appeal.<br/>
The enforcement notice then becomes effective and the second period specified&#x2014;probably about a fortnight&#x2014;begins to run. On 31st October, the site is cleared&#x2014;at exactly the time that the seasonal planning permission ends. Therefore, to prevent such a site coming into being the whole period from 1st April to 31st October might pass and, of course, the same thing might happen again the next year if the same person again seeks to operate a seasonal caravan site.<br/>
I agree that some relief is furnished by Section 38 of the 1959 Town and Country Planning Act, which makes it possible to take enforcement action in respect of unauthorised use of land for the siting of caravans. That does not remove the difficulties created by the 1947 Town and Country Planning Act. In many cases it can be proved that caravans have been on a site before 1947. They may have been there occasionally since then, and suddenly the site is developed with a large number of caravans. It may be argued that there has been change of user, but if it can be proved that caravans were there before 1947 nothing can be done about it.<br/>
I would have thought that it was reasonable to give compensation for any


capital sunk into development of a possible site, but the value of the site itself is largely created by the planning authority agreeing to that site and ruling out other possible sites. There should not be compensation for the site, therefore, but it would be reasonable to pay compensation for any capital sunk into the project.<br/>
I very much welcome the announcement yesterday that it was proposed to introduce legislation on this matter. I hope that it will be possible to bring in legislation which local authorities will agree to be facing up to the problem, but I hope that it will insist on the same planning and accommodation standards which one normally expects from council housing estates. Many caravans are slums on wheels, although, of course, there are many which are not. We want to see those bad caravan sites ruled out.<br/>
I also hope that, in dealing with the problem, the Government will not forget the background problems which I have mentioned&#x2014;the question of the location of industry and the provision of housing to remedy the pressure to create these caravan sites in the areas around the boom areas. I have pleasure in welcoming the legislation to deal with these various problems.</p>

<p>I had not anticipated that at this late hour the House would have the benefit of hearing from the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Parker) about caravans. I had stayed to hear him talking, as I thought he would, about the development of Tower Hill in the City of London. He has spoken about caravans and as a caravanner, although I do not take strong exception to anything he has said, I do not think that he has sufficiently differentiated between two distinct types of caravan user.<br/>
On the one hand, there are those who are compelled, or prefer for their own private reasons, permanently to live in a caravan on a permanent residential caravan site. On the other hand, there are those, perhaps strange people, who, like myself, have their own caravan and like to go away into the country and spend their holidays on sites such as the hon. Member mentioned, on farms

or other places where they are allowed to stay and enjoy a caravaning or camping holiday, living in the fresh air and so on. There are problems connected with both users.<br/>
On the question of the seasonal as opposed to the residential site, I very much agree with the hon. Gentleman that legislation is required.</p>

<p>I must ask you to excuse me, Mr. Speaker, in view of the lateness of the hour. I should have said that administrative action was required to prevent the kind of thing of which the hon. Member has reminded the House&#x2014;site operators, whom no one would defend, seeking permission for temporary use of land for holiday caravans and using all the loopholes the law and lack of administrative action allow to extend the profitability of letting sites for caravans right through the season, then starting again the next year. I would not defend that for a moment and I hope that some sort of action will be possible to prevent it in future.<br/>
I am not sure that I agree with the hon. Member about permanent caravan sites not being in the green belt around our cities. I think that for seasonal caravan sites it is perfectly possible in a green belt to ensure the amenities if the sites are properly selected and the caravan is so placed under trees that it may be almost out of sight and without detriment to the amenities of the countryside.<br/>
The Minister is aware that a great deal of work has been done recently by an organisation of which I have been a member for many years and on the executive committee of which I sat for a long time. I am a member of its council at present. I refer to the Caravan Club, which is working in the closest harmony with planning officers of the counties, selecting sites for seasonal, mobile, caravaning, and awarding, as it were, a badge or sign approved by the Council for Industrial Design, which may be displayed only at sites which are approved by the planning authorities and by the Club, which is a large organisation, equivalent to the R.A.C. or A.A., and which has its site inspectors who


make sure that it does not suggest to a planning authority that any site should be licensed unless it has full services and that the amenities are preserved.</p>

<p>I must once again, as on Monday, walk with great verbal delicacy in your sight, Mr. Speaker, because, as the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Parker) has already indicated, my right hon. Friend told the House on Tuesday of his intention to legislate on this subject. I hope that the two hon. Members who have spoken will not think me discourteous if I say that I found their speeches most interesting, and I will read them with care. But I must be very cautious what I say about them.<br/>
May I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for North Angus and Mearns (Sir C. Thornton-Kemsley) on his facility and ability to talk equally spontaneously on Tower Hill or caravans. Of course, we are much indebted to Sir Arton Wilson for setting out so clearly the facts about caravans as homes and the problems arising from the use of caravans as homes. It was my right hon. Friend who invited Sir Arton Wilson to write the Report because he was so aware of the problems, and one of the lessons we can learn from the Report is that caravans tend to

cluster where employment exceeds housing accommodation.<br/>
The hon. Member for Dagenham rightly drew the conclusion that the Government's policy, which has been discussed this week, to take employment to places of more than average unemployment, will as a by-product, help to solve this very problem. It is one which we are most aware of, and I hope the hon. Gentleman will allow me to leave it at that.<br/>
It also arises from any reading of the Report that caravans must now be accepted as part of our national life, and a place must be found for them&#x2014;a right place in each area&#x2014;and if the right place is to be found, as has been said, local authorities must have proper planning and enforcement weapons in their power. Here I come back to where I began, and I hope I will not be thought discourteous if I deny myself the pleasure of discussing exactly how the present controls operate, and take refuge in my right hon. Friend's statement, in answer to a Question by the hon. Member for Dagenham when he said:
<q>My consultations have disclosed a wide measure of agreement on the need for remedying defects in the existing law, and I hope to introduce legislation for this purpose in the present Session."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 2nd February, 1960; Vol. 616, c. 103.]</q></p>
