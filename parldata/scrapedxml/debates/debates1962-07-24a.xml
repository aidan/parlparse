<p>Will my hon. Friend inform his right hon. Friend that a foreign visitor who stayed in my house queued for over an hour to see the jewels? Is my hon. Friend further aware that parties of Women's Institutes coming to London do not think it is worth going to the Tower to see the jewels for this reason?

<p>My right hon.

<p>That is a pretty stony answer. What comment has the right hon. Gentleman to make on the paragraph in the Emmerson Report which refers to the way in which the surge of private enterprise building has passed Scotland and my constituency by and caused twice the unemployment in the building industry in Scotland compared with England and Wales, and what constructive steps is he going to take for areas like Scotland and my constituency?</p>

<p>Will my right hon. Friend have a look at this question, because it is widely believed that very substantial additions are sometimes made in these cases whereby it is possible that public money may be excessively expended, and it is believed that that is especially so when secondhand materials are very properly specified? I ask my right hon. Friend to look into the matter to see whether economies can be effected.</p>

<p>I will certainly look into the matter, and I should be grateful if my hon. Friend could give me further details of any matter he has in mind. Of course, the majority of contracts now are fixed-price lump-sum contracts entered into on a competitive basis. How the contractor arrives at his tender is, of course, no concern of ours.</p>

<p>Is my hon. Friend aware that that information will be warmly received in all parts of Wales, particularly in those areas which are so dependent on the slate industry? Will my hon.

<p>The B.B.C. tells me it hopes to start a survey in the Weardale area about the beginning of September. It will, however, take some time to select a site which will give the best coverage, since this is particularly difficult country and a series of tests will need to be made.</p>

<p>Will the Postmaster-General bear in mind that the North-East still suffers from a shared sound wavelength and that many of my constituents, together with the constituents of my hon.

<p>The right hon. Gentleman is do doubt aware that there are still a number of shadow areas. Has any survey been carried out nationally by the B.B.C. and the I.T.A. to ascertain all the difficulties involved and what early prospects there are of giving shadow areas good reception?</p>

<p>Yes, The B.B.C. and the I.T.A. have this constantly under review. The B.B.C, in particular, is pressing forward with Stages 1, 2 and 3 of its plans for new stations, and eventually Stage 4, to help areas with poor reception.</p>

<p>asked the Postmaster-General if he will exercise his powers under Section 15 (1) of the Licence and Agreement of the British Broadcasting Corporation to amend the prescribed hours of Home sound broadcasting, so that the British Broadcasting Corporation could broadcast all-night programmes of music for the benefit of sick and elderly people.</p>

<p>The B.B.C. has never sought a prescription of this kind. It has said, however, that it would wish to extend the Light Programme up to 2 a.m. in due course, and, as paragraph 21 of the White Paper on Broadcasting says, extensions up to this hour will be authorised. I think this is as far as we should go at present.</p>

<p>Is the Minister aware that for the elderly, the sick, the disabled and the injured these hours can be hours of loneliness and, in some circumstances, fear? Would it not be worth while having some experiment into the possibility or advisability of providing some form of light music as solace during this period?</p>

<p>Is the Postmaster-General aware that there is quite a demand for this from my part of the country? Representations have been made to me to that effect.

<p>Will my right hon. Friend not only take it into account but ensure that early action is taken in this regard, because there is often a very substantial difference in the quality of reception in these areas as between the I.T.A. and B.B.C? An immediate improvement is essential.</p>

<p>The matter raised by my hon. Friend is really one for the B.B.C. and the medical profession. The inclusion of the surgeon's name in the broadcast I think my hon. Friend has in mind was most unfortunate. It was made inadvertently and the B.B.C. has apologised.</p>

<p>Despite what my right hon. Friend says, will he ask the B.B.C. generally to get itself organised on this question of names? I accept that this unfortunate incident happened in the way he has described, but I seem to remember that a year or two ago I got myself into great trouble for using a name which was already entirely public.

it does not deliberately set out to shock or offend people. Very often the cam-plaint is the other way round. The B.B.C. is sorry if the use of these expletives has given offence to some of my horn.

<p>No, Sir. The powers of direction contained in the B.B.C.

<p>I appreciate that Answer, but the Commissioner of Police has stated that it is not only his opinion but, he says, the belief of every policeman that the daily presentation of violence in dramatic form has largely contributed to the increase in crime.

<p>With respect, the hon. Gentleman is quite wrong. The Chief Commissioner of Police for the Metropolitan area did not say that at all. He referred to one possible contributory cause of the increase in crime and then referred to television, but made it perfectly dear that there was no evidence in support of this assertion. The amount of crime and violence shown on television is one thing and the effect that it has on society is quite another. That is why I think that the whole House welcomed the initiative of the then Home Secretary in setting up a study group or committee to look into this whole matter.</p>

Is not the Postmaster-General aware that a month after the Public Accounts Committee reported, a further merger took place inside this particular ring and that the Plessey Company, the Automatic Telephone and Electric Company and Ericsson Telephones merged in a &#x00A3;55 million merger and captured 40 per cent. of all the telecommunication and telephone equipment supplied to the Post Office? Will he say to what extant now this ring, or this combine within the ring of firms, will be able to carry on in its monopoly position in regard to exchange equipment?</p>

<p>Is the Prime Minister aware that most of us would accept the point made by the hon.

Members who have tabled the Questions under discussion could represent other hon.

Members&#x2014;to discuss their particular proposal? Is the right hon. Gentleman aware that, while appreciating that there are certain objections to outside bodies, there is also a fairly strong argument in favour of this kind of decision being, to some extent, supported by outside evidence and the views of outsiders?

<p>The right hon. Gentleman has said that if necessary the Lord Privy Seal will make a public statement. Surely the House is entitled to be communicated with directly, even if we are in recess, and the way to do that is, as suggested in my hon. Friend's Question, by publishing a White Paper?</p>

<p>No, I think there are two stages. My right hon. Friend the Lord Privy Seal has made a statement after each stage of the negotiations. The House has been sitting. He made

one, I think, yesterday. He hopes to make one next week. The hon. Gentleman suggested that a similar statement should be made if the House is not sitting.

<p>Will my right hon.

<p>All that will be borne in mind. There are two questions &#x2014;first, the making of a progress report while the House is sitting, the making of a progress report as soon as the negotiations finish; and then whether it would be helpful to bring them all together into a joint publication stating just what are the problems and what progress is made towards their resolution.

<p>On the two points which have been distinguished by the Prime Minister, may I ask him whether he is aware that the Lord Privy Seal's statements in the House of Commons are published in HANSARD in full and that, therefore, hon.

Secondly, may I ask the right hon. Gentleman to give us an assurance that


the outline of proposals, if such exists, which is put to the Prime Minister's Conference will be published at least as a White Paper, even if it is difficult to publish all the previous arrangements? Will that outline be made fully public before the Prime Minister's Conference meets?</p>

<p>I beg to move,
<q>That an humble Address be presented to Her Majesty, praying that Her Majesty will give directions that there be presented, on behalf of this House, a Speaker's Chair to the House of Representatives of Nigeria, and assuring Her Majesty that this House will make good the expenses attending the same.</q>
It falls to me as Leader of the House to move a great number of Motions of very differing sorts. The last one, I recall, was in relation to an Allocation of Time Motion for the Pipe-lines Bill, which did not attract universal applause from the House of Commons. It is, therefore, all the more pleasant that one can be certain of moving this sort of Motion and of having the warm support of all hon. Members in all quarters of the House. It is indeed a great pleasure to have the opportunity briefly to move this Motion, which, of course, the whole House will wish to support. The gift that we propose is in accordance with the traditions that we have, and there have been a long line of such gifts. I am sure we all feel that, surrounded as we are everywhere we look with gifts from different parts of the Commonwealth, it is an excellent thing that from time to time we should remember these links of affection and friendship and that we in our turn should convey our feelings and send similar good wishes to other Legislative Assemblies.<br/>
If I may mention the story of this gift, on 19th April this year my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister, replying to a Question from the Leader of the Opposition, told the House that it was proposed that Mr. Speaker, on behalf of

the House, should offer to the House of Representatives of Nigeria the gift of a Speaker's Chair, and we have, of course, ascertained that that gift would be much welcomed in Nigeria.<br/>
The Chair itself is in the process of being made and is expected to be completed by the end of August. We hope to be able to display it before it is sent to Nigeria for presentation The purpose of this gift is to mark Nigeria's attainment of full independence within the Commonwealth, and it carries with it our very best wishes for her future happiness and prosperity.<br/>
All I need add is that the Motion proposes that the presentation shall be made on behalf of the House of Commons. When we accept this Motion, at the same time we will pledge ourselves to honour the necessary estimate. The actual arrangements for presenting the gift will be made by Mr. Speaker and, indeed, I think arrangements are already in hand for it to be presented probably early in November by a small Parliamentary delegation which will be composed of members of the United Kingdom branch of the C.P.A. who will then be attending a conference in Nigeria. This carries our very best wishes to that very great country. Many of us have many friends in Nigeria. All of us wish that great country well, and I am sure we will send this gift with our best wishes for the future.</p>

<p>I am not quite sure how far it would be politic or even honest of me to express pleasure in being able to agree with the Leader of the House on anything at this moment, but I would say, on behalf of my right hon. and hon. Friends and myself, how much we welcome the proposal to give a Chair to the Nigerian Parliament and that we subscribe wholeheartedly to the Humble Address to Her Majesty for this purpose.<br/>
I think all of us on both sides of the House are extremely proud of the r&#x00F4;le which Nigeria has been playing in the last year or so as an independent State within the Commonwealth and of the outstanding contribution which it has made in African affairs in general. I was most impressed, when I was in the Congo in January, to find how deeply the action of the Nigerian police and


troops in the United Nations forces was appreciated and admired by the Congolese people. I think that generally one can say that most African peoples have the same impression of the conduct and bearing of Nigeria as an independent State.<br/>
I think we are all also extremely proud of the loyalty of Nigeria to Parliamentary institutions, which in a sense is symbolised by the gift of this Chair. We have noted with interest that the precedent of some Parliamentary turbulence which was set by Nigeria in recent months has been followed in our own Parliament in the last week or so.<br/>
We were very pleased to welcome Mr. Njoku in London last week as the Chairman this year of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, and we shall all be extremely proud that the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association is holding its annual conference in Nigeria in two months time.<br/>
As I have said, on behalf of my right hon. and hon. Friends and myself, I fully support the wish of the Leader of the House that Nigeria shall continue to enjoy prosperity and good fortune as an independent State, and we strongly subscribe to the provision of this Chair as a token of our affection and respect for this new State inside the Commonwealth.</p>

<p>I beg to move,
<q>That the Exchequer Advances (Limit) Order 1962, dated 2nd July, 1962, a copy of which was laid before this House on 5th July, be approved.</q>
This is the second Exchequer Advances (Limit) Order, which the House has been asked to approve. I take it that the House would wish to have a short explanation of the matter.<br/>
This Order is the instrument for enabling the Exchequer to lend to a number of nationalised industries under Section 42 of the Finance Act, 1956, for a further year. The Order is necessary because of the provisions of Section 78 of the Finance Act, 1960. This Section provides first that Exchequer advances to the nationalised industries concerned should not exceed &#x00A3;2,050 million in all up to the end of August, 1961. It also provides that advances in each of the two succeeding years ending in August, 1962, and 1963, respectively, may be made only if the Treasury makes an Order under Section 42 of the Finance Act, 1956, fixing a maximum amount for the total advances to be made under Section 42 up to the end of each of these two years, and this Order is approved by a Resolution of the House of Commons.<br/>
In July, 1961, the House approved an Order increasing the total amount which the Treasury might lend to the nationalised industries concerned up to the end of August, 1962, from the figure of &#x00A3;2,050 million, prescribed in Section 78 of the Finance Act, 1960, to &#x00A3;2,450 million. The present Order, which covers the period from September, 1962, to August, 1963, increases the limit to &#x00A3;2,930 million, that is, an increase of &#x00A3;480 million. For the avoidance of doubt I should perhaps emphasise that the figure of &#x00A3;2,930 million referred to is a limit on the total advances that may be made under Section 42 of the Finance Act, 1956.<br/>
There is no suggestion that the Treasury should lend this astronomical sum to the nationalised industries during


the forthcoming twelve months. The limit of &#x00A3;2,930 million is, in short, the cumulative total that may be advanced from the advent of Exchequer lending to the nationalised industries concerned in 1956, to the end of August, 1963.<br/>
I turn now to the purposes for which the sanction is required. The Order applies to lending by the Treasury to seven nationalised industries: they are the Electricity Council, the South of Scotland Electricity Board, the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board, the Gas Council, B.O.A.C, B.E.A. and the British Transport Commission.<br/>
In the exceptional case of the British Transport Commission the Order makes provision for the Treasury to lend to that body only until the end of December, 1962. Thereafter, Exchequer lending to the successor bodies of the British Transport Commission will, under the terms of the Transport Bill now before the House, be under Clause 20 of that Bill. The new undertakings will not be covered by the provisions of Section 42 of the 1956 Finance Act. Both their borrowing and the Exchequer's lending to them will be governed by Clauses 19 and 20 of the Transport Bill.<br/>
In the case of the remaining six bodies, the Order provides for Exchequer lending to them for the twelve months from September, 1962, to August 1963. The Order increases the Treasury's lending powers by &#x00A3;480 million. This figure reflects the borrowing estimates for the nationalised industries concerned in the financial year 1962&#x2013;63 as set out in the White Paper on Government Expenditure Below the Line, Cmnd. 1680, presented to Parliament in April of this year. The new limit also includes an allowance for lending to these bodies in the period April to August, 1963, that is to say, the early months of the financial year 1963&#x2013;64.<br/>
The actual lending in the coming twelve months is expected to be rather more than &#x00A3;480 million&#x2014;in fact, &#x00A3;510 million&#x2014;but we shall need to provide for an increase of only &#x00A3;480 million because we shall probably start the next next twelve-month period with a margin in hand by virtue of the fact that advances to the nationalised industries up to the end of the current twelve-month period may well be some &#x00A3;30 million less than the present limit.<br/>
The House may be interested to know how the lending figure of &#x00A3;510 million has been built up. Lending to the Electricity Council accounts for almost exactly half of it; the figure is &#x00A3;255 million. This is &#x00A3;53 million greater than in the current period and reflects the need for increasing capital expenditure on both the production and distribution of electricity. Next in order of importance comes the British Transport Commission. We expect to lend the Commission up to &#x00A3;110 million between September and the end of December, 1962, some of it to finance capital expenditure, some to meet normal interest and repayment obligations, and the remainder to meet the Commission's terminal liabilities under the Transport Bill. Lending to the successor bodies will, as I explained, be under that Bill.<br/>
The other five boards concerned, the Gas Council, the Scottish electricity boards and the two Airways Corporations, account for the balance of the lending. The Gas Council expects to draw up to &#x00A3;30 million. Some of this will be needed to finance the import and processing of methane gas on the lines explained by my right hon. Friend the Minister of Power in November last year. The two Scottish boards expect to draw &#x00A3;55 million between them, much the same amount as in the present year. B.E.A. expects to draw &#x00A3;22 million. B.O.A.C. expects to need &#x00A3;51 million, which is about &#x00A3;19 million more than in the current period. This is chiefly due to the Corporation's need to make payments in the coming months for its new fleet of VC 10s.<br/>
I do not think that there is anything else I need say by way of explaining the Order and commending it to the House, except, perhaps, to remind right hon. and hon. Members that the Order does not in any way affect the borrowing powers of the nationalised industries concerned. It certainly does not increase their borrowing powers. All it does is to renew and to extend the Treasury's powers to lend to these industries. In a word, it is a procedural and not a policy-making Order. I should like to stress this.<br/>
The House approved the policy of lending to the nationalised industries for a further three years when it enacted Section 78 of the Finance Act, 1960,


which, as hon. Members will remember, extended the Exchequer's power to lend to these seven nationalised industries up to the end of August, 1963. The procedure for making annual Orders under this Section is simply the way of ensuring that the House is kept aware of and approves the rate at which we are lending to the nationalised industries concerned. I would remind any hon. Members who have doubts about the case for continuing the policy about Exchequer financing of the nationalised industries that this is a matter which they will have the opportunity to go into thoroughly next year when the present powers for lending to the nationalised industries expire.<br/>
With that explanation, I invite the House to approve the Order.</p>

<p>I have the very happy and pleasant duty this evening to be the first on this side of the House to congratulate my hon. Friend upon his recent appointment as Economic Secretary to the Treasury. I hope that he will reign for the remainder of the lifetime of this Parliament, and I know that his eminent career in the City and his astute knowledge of all economic and financial affairs will stand him in excellent stead in dealing with the difficult matters which fall within his Ministerial responsibility.<br/>
This evening he has commenced with an extraordinarily difficult Order. He pointed out that it was procedural in character and not policy-making, and therefore I should be out of order if I discussed any of the programmes or the policies of the seven nationalised industries to which my hon. Friend referred. But I should like to address a few comments to the House on an Order which brings within its scope an increase in spending of no less than &#x00A3;880 million.<br/>
Once it goes through the House this evening, as I have no doubt it will, we shall have no opportunity of controlling or amending in any way. We are virtually voting this very large sum of money for the capital expenditure programmes of seven nationalised industries until August, 1963, and it rather underlines the criticisms which I made to the Committee on the Finance Bill when

my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister was Chancellor of the Exchequer in May, 1956, as to the inadvisability of financing nationalised industries by Exchequer loan, for the House is inevitably called on to vote one huge global sum to seven nationalised industries and thereafter keep its peace, for it has no further means whatever of scrutinising or dealing in any detail with the capital sums for any of the individual industries concerned.<br/>
In 1956 three of my hon. Friends joined me in protesting strongly to the then Chancellor of the Exchequer at four o'clock in the morning. My hon. Friends were, first, my hon. Friend the Member for Yeovil (Mr. Peyton), now the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Power, one of the sponsors of the Order before the House. A second was Lord Sandwich, sadly no longer with us, and the third was Mr. Angus Maude, shortly to return to us.</p>

<p>Shortly to return to us. I am the sole survivor to speak this evening on this Order. My hon. Friend rightly reminded us that next year when the Finance Bill comes along we shall have an opportunity once again of examining this system of financing nationalised industries, which manifestly is unsatisfactory in its present form. I will not attempt to deal with alternative systems, and I rise this evening really to make two specific points to my hon. Friend, which I hope he will deal with and respond to in some detail.<br/>
The actual sum to be spent during the next twelve months on capital account for these seven industries is of the order of &#x00A3;508 million. This is the biggest sum that we have spent on these seven industries in any single year. A study of the Financial Statement for the relevant years will show for example since we commenced this system of Exchequer financing that in 1956&#x2013;57 the actual expenditure was &#x00A3;284 million; in 1957&#x2013;58 it was &#x00A3;295 million; in 1958&#x2013;59 it was &#x00A3;352 million; in 1959&#x2013;60 it was &#x00A3;424 million; in 1960&#x2013;61 it was &#x00A3;449 million; in 1961&#x2013;62 it was &#x00A3;489 million; and in 1962&#x2013;63 it is to be &#x00A3;508 million.<br/>
Though it would be possible for me to adjust all those figures in respect of


rising costs, or conversely, to express the falling value of money, I make the simple point that this year's allocation or tranche on capital account for these seven industries represents by far the largest sum that this House has ever voted. It represents something of the order of 75 per cent. more than in 1956&#x2013;57, after adjustments for changed money values. Is that increase justified in the case of these seven nationalised industries?<br/>
I am not allowed to discuss their individual programmes, but I ask hon. Members to take two of them&#x2014;the South of Scotland Electricity Board and the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board. They are to spend between them a sum of &#x00A3;55 million. It is because the House is dissatisfied with the conduct of those industries that they are at present being examined by a Select Committee in Scotland called the Mackenzie Committee, to determine whether the application of these capital sums is fully justified. Yet we, this evening, are being asked to vote a larger sum of money for these two boards than ever before in their history.<br/>
I therefore ask my hon. Friend, as a Treasury Minister, whether this very large sum of money provided for in the year 1962&#x2013;63 represents a deliberate loosening of the purse strings. Is it a policy of injecting greater purchasing power into the economy by increasing deliberately the capital expenditure programmes of these seven industries? It seems to me that it might be, because it comes in a progression of items which I should be out of order in going into in detail now but which I mention because they seem to be related to each other.<br/>
First, there was the increase in National Assistance Board rates; secondly, the increase in certain forms of public service retirement pensions; thirdly, the relaxation of hire-purchase restrictions and now, fourthly, a very large increase in the capital expenditure of these seven nationalised boards for the forthcoming year. I hope that the Economic Secretary will respond to that point.<br/>
Is this a deliberate loosening of the purse strings, as part of Treasury policy to inject more purchasing power into the economy, and reflate&#x2014;to use the

economists' term&#x2014;by exciting or promoting a larger demand for capital goods and equipment by these seven industries?</p>

<p>Sensible, I hope. Does the hon. Member seriously suggest that there is any connection between an increase in the National Assistance scales and the provision of increased capital expenditure for the nationalised industries? Does not he realise that the increase in the National Assistance scales was based on an increase in the cost of living, which was bearing harshly on the poorest people? Is that really anything to do with capital expenditure for the Hydro-Electric Board in Scotland?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1962-07-24a.1430.3" hansard_membership_id="9701" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/18748" speakername="Mr. Nabarro" colnum="1430" time="">
<p>Yes. I cannot deal with the National Assistance Board in detail, but I used the term&#x2014;and I shall content myself by repeating it&#x2014;that this is one of a progression of items in a policy of loosening the purse strings. Four such items have come before us in a matter of weeks. I believe that there is a connection between them.<br/>
My second point is in connection with deficit financing. These seven industries exclude the National Coal Board, but several of them are running at a heavy loss at present. For example, to quote from the <i>Daily Mail</i> of 19th July:
<q>Air Losses Pile Up. Amery walks into jobs and cash crisis. Mr. Julian Amery, the new Minister of Aviation, warned the Commons of ' a serious situation '. And while he was speaking, British Overseas Airways forecast a &#x00A3;15,000,000 loss for the second year running.</q>
Is any of this capital sum to which the Economic Secretary referred to be devoted to deficit financing, or is it truly on account of new capital equipment?<br/>
B.E.A. is not in quite such a serious position as B.O.A.C. in the matter of trading losses, but it has also been known to earn a deficit, and the deficit of the British Transport Commission is popularly stated to be about &#x00A3;50 million for the last year. I should like the Economic Secretary to endeavour to relate that figure to the sum of &#x00A3;110 million which he mentioned this evening, and say how those two figures can be adjusted to each


other&#x2014;the one in respect of losses on the part of the Commission and the other in respect of its capital expenditure programme.<br/>
That is enough for this evening, because I do not wish to keep the House at this late hour. I should like to conclude, however, by pointing out to my right hon. Friend the Leader of the House, whom I am delighted to see in his place, that these sums of money are much too large and momentous to be discussed late at night or in the early hours of the morning. The history of this battle to try to bring the nationalised industries within proper Parliamentary accountability goes back to 1956. Then the debate concluded at four o'clock in the morning. In 1958 the debate was switched and came to a conclusion between two and three o'clock in the morning. In 1960 it was deliberately thrust to the end of the queue so that all my hon. Friends and myself had to debate the matter after midnight and it came to a conclusion at three o'clock in the morning. This is the fourth incident where these vitally important matters are brought to the House at a late hour of the night.<br/>
I am the culprit in this matter of Statutory Instruments for nationalised industries. I am glad to see present my hon Friend the Member for Shipley (Mr. Hirst), one of the original hon. Members with me in threatening the Government that a large body of us would vote against them. I am glad to see present my hon. Friend the Member for Yeovil, another miscreant who threatened to vote with us unless we had this Statutory Instrument procedure. To present it very late to the House when the House is thinly attended, when I see on the benches opposite only four hon. Members of the Opposition&#x2014;[An HON. MEMBER: "And no Liberals."]&#x2014;and no Liberals, and not the Chancellor of the Exchequer present with us when discussing the sacred cow of the Labour Party, nationalisation&#x2014;</p>

I am led astray, Mr. Deputy-Speaker, and I apologise. I was endeavouring to address my comments to the Leader of the House. These are very large sums of money. On the next Finance Bill my hon. Friends and I will have an opportunity of altering the method of financing on capital account these seven immensely costly industries. I believe that the present method of financing them as enshrined in this Order is highly inflationary. I appeal to my right hon. Friend that when this matter comes up for discussion in the Finance Bill the Whips Office and the Patronage Secretary should not be allowed to manipulate the business in such a fashion as to put it on the Floor of the House in the early hours of the morning, thereby frustrating


the legitimate desire of so many of my hon. Friends and myself to examine these important matters with the meticulous care that they surely deserve.<br/>
With these few comments, I hope that my hon. Friend will now reply to my questions.</p>

<p>&#x2014;but I am sure that that loss will be made up by the gain we have secured by having him on the Front Bench.<br/>
As he has said, this is a purely procedural Order which follows from the Finance Act, 1960. That Act dealt with the principle on which advances are made to the nationalised industries. It seems to me that there is little that we can say tonight on the very large question of the policy of the nationalised industries and the investment policy which we pursue. In fact, we have already admitted that it is out of order even to discuss the matter, and to that, I think, my hon. Friend the Member for Kidderminster (Mr. Nabarro) agreed. As I understand the view of my hon. Friend the Member for Kidderminster, he believes that the nationalised industries should raise their money in the market. Were that to happen, as I understand it, we should have no opportunity for a debate under any circumstances.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend must not put words into my mouth. It would have been grossly out of order for me to have referred to any alternative method of financing, as he well knows. I do not subscribe to the Liberal policy of raising entirely these large sums of money on the open market.</p>

<p>I am sorry to hear that my hon. Friend does not subscribe to that. Now I am confused about what he does want.<br/>
It has been brought to my attention that my hon. Friend and others who, in 1956 and 1960, first raised this point about the accountability of the nationalised industries to Parliament, took the line that this procedure of having an Order every year would make the nationalised industries more accountable. I cannot see why this should be so. It seems to me to be out of order to discuss the policy and investment of the nationalised industries in a debate on this Order. I cannot see how the procedure we have gone through increases their accountability in any way.<br/>
We have&#x2014;I think that we are pleased that it is so&#x2014;three days set aside for discussing the nationalised industries in detail. We are to have a debate on Friday, and that would seem to be the moment when we should discuss whether investments have been wisely made or whether the right sort of investments are made. If there have been losses and mistakes, that is the time to voice our criticisms. I do not think that this improvement, as it is called, in our procedure is an improvement at all.<br/>
My hon. Friend referred to the increased capital borrowing in connection with the Order as being an inflationary move. I cannot see what is inflationary about it. About &#x00A3;508 million will be invested in the nationalised industries which is not entirely covered by the Government borrowing; it is largely accounted for by taxpayers' money above the line. So it would seem to be deflationary and not inflationary.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend has referred to Friday as being a nationalised industry day. Friday is not a nationalised industry day at all.

<p>As always.<br/>
All I wish to say is that this does not seam to me to have been a very fruitful debate. I think that there is an important subject to discuss before August of next year, when we are to decide how to finance the capital requirements of the nationalised industries in future. I look forward to taking part in the debates, as I am sure does my hon. Friend the Member for Kidderminster. I do not think that we shall gain anything by insisting on having an annual Order rather than a more workman-like and long-term arrangement. I hope that the Order will be dealt with speedily.</p>

<p>The wise allocation of our capital investment is one of the most important matters for the country at the moment. Like many others, I am concerned about the way in which capital has been applied in the nationalised industries in the past. It is, for example, a fact that to produce a 1 per cent. increase in productivity in the nationalised industries it has required twice the investment required to produce a comparable increase in private industry.<br/>
The Estimates Committee, among others, in recent years has drawn attention to somewhat lax methods of Treasury control in the expenditure of money, for example in airports and other things associated with the nationalised industries. While agreeing to the passage of the Order tonight, I join with my hon. Friend the Member for Kidderminster (Mr. Nabarro) in impressing upon my right hon. and hon. Friends on the Front Bench that, when the method of financing the nationalised industries comes up for discussion next year, we shall expect a most serious discussion and a different method from that we have had in the past. It would be wrong to pass the Order tonight without giving that warning to the Government.</p>

<p>With permission, I will address myself very shortly to some of the points which have been raised. I hope, Mr. Deputy-Speaker, you will allow me to say how very much I appreciate the most kind things which my

hon. Friends the Members for Kidderminster (Mr. Nabarro) and Cirencester and Tewkesbury (Mr. Ridley) have said about me. I am most grateful to them. I remember very well the earlier debates to which my hon. Friend the Member for Kidderminster referred, because I played some tiny and perhaps ineffective part in them. They certainly made a great impression upon me, not least because one of them at any rate took place immediately after my election to the House, when we were dealing with one of the Electricity Bills in Committee, as my hon. Friend the Member for Kidderminster may remember. Together we were able to effect, we thought, some improvements to that Bill.<br/>
We will pay strict attention to the points which have been raised tonight, particularly the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Mitcham (Mr. R. Carr). In reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Kidderminster, I want to say four things. First, I think that it is worth recording that the total borrowing by these nationalised industries at 30th June, 1962, the latest date for which I have been able to obtain information, is &#x00A3;3,763 million. That compares with their total borrowing power of &#x00A3;4,650 million already authorised by Parliament. In seeking approval of this Order we are well within the possible limit of total borrowing. That is not to say in any way, however, that the advances of these huge sums are matters which should be lightly considered or lightly dealt with. They are very serious matters indeed and require to be taken seriously.<br/>
Secondly, I was asked a particular question about reflation. It is obvious &#x2014;my hon. Friend the Member for Kidderminster will know this as well as I do from our respective business experience&#x2014;that it is not the way in any business to plan one's operations, particularly very large business, on a year-to-year basis. In general, investment programmes and the like are settled for further ahead than that, perhaps on a two-year or a three-year basis. That is part of the matter which we are discussing tonight. Certainly the increase in this figure is no part of a policy of reflation.<br/>
I was asked particularly about deficit financing. In general, it is true to say that this money is not required for deficit financing. Certainly in the case of the British Transport Commission, which perhaps springs immediately to mind, none of this money is for deficit purposes. As the House will know very well, that is provided from the B.T.C. deficit Vote. On the other hand, there is an exception, and that is the possible case of B.O.A.C.&#x2014;a matter specifically raised by my hon. Friend the Member far Kidderminster&#x2014;where a sum of money may be needed to finance losses. I may say that I have never believed in losses&#x2014;one can never survive on them&#x2014; and we hope to see a better future for the Air Corporation.<br/>
The rise in capital expenditure of the nationalised industries is due to increasing investment by them. In the particular case of electricity, about which I was asked, the rise is due to a rising demand for electricity, a thing that I believe we are all happy to see, since it must in part follow that it is an example of the rising standard of life of our people.<br/>
It seems to me that we have been making good progress in establishing a new financial framework for the nationalised industries and I hope that that progress will continue and, perhaps, be accelerated. It is very important that we should consider these matters most seriously. These are large sums of money, even when related to the turnover and the size of the industries concerned. We shall certainly bear prominently in mind the points made in this debate by my three hon. Friends, but perhaps I might add again that this is a procedural and not a policy-making Order, and we look forward to fuller debates on these subjects in the days to come.</p>

<p>I am grateful for this opportunity to raise a matter of great concern to some of my constituents, in which there is also a general underlying principle. Because of the lateness of the hour, I shall try to be brief, but this is an important matter. My constituents have a good case which I shall try to reveal adequately, and I am hopeful that the Minister will grant our reasonable request, which does not call for legislation.<br/>
I should like, at the outset, to congratulate my right hon. Friend and my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary on their new appointments. I wish them success in their many tasks, which concern and touch the daily lives of our people. I was interested that one of the first pronouncements of my right hon. Friend was a rebuke to the London County Council for its apparent intention not to co-operate with him in London's local government reform. I only hope that he and the Parliamentary Secretary will be able to evade a similar charge that I shall undoubtedly make against them unless they show some concern for my constituents, and co-operation with my local authority.<br/>
It is necessary, first, to give a brief background for the record before coming to my special plea. In December, 1942, the Wembley Borough Council granted planning permission for the erection by the Ministry of Supply on behalf of the British Oxygen Co. Ltd., of a factory building on land fronting Carlton Avenue East, in my constituency. That land had been zoned by the council in 1936 for general industrial purposes. I have no doubt that the consent was given because of the urgent wartime need for the production of liquid oxygen. It should be remember that the council did everything to help in the exigencies of war, and I feel that it should not be later penalised for what it then did.<br/>
In order at that time to minimise the effect of the building on the adjacent


houses in Carlton Avenue East, a condition was imposed by the council that the land in front of the building should be covered with a screen of trees and shrubs, to be laid to the satisfaction of the council. However, following the erection of the company's building, complaints were received at once, early in 1943, from residents in the vicinity about the noise and vibration caused by the compressors, but because of the war conditions then prevailing, it seemed that little could be done to rectify the position in any way.<br/>
After the war&#x2014;in August, 1950&#x2014;the company submitted an application for permission to improve and extend the existing building which had been erected following the planning consent given in December, 1942. It is important to state that the council at that time gave long and careful consideration to the application before it decided to refuse it. It refused for two main reasons: first, that it was intended that the extension should contain additional compressing plant and, secondly, that no satisfactory assurance could be given by the applicants that the operation of the plant which it was proposed to install in the extension would not increase the vibration caused by the existing plant which was already proving detrimental to the amenities of the adjoining residential neighbourhood.<br/>
The British Oxygen Company appealed to the then Minister of Town and Country Planning against the council's decision. A public inquiry was held in the Wembley Town Hall in December, 1950, at which both the borough council and the residents were represented by counsel. The company's proposals were vigorously opposed but the Minister allowed the appeal and here we come to the crux of the matter. The Government of the day accepted the responsibility for the extension in the face of opposition by the local council. Therefore, the Government of the day must accept the consequences of that decision.<br/>
From that date there have been difficulties for the nearby residents and frustration for the borough council, the advice and experience of which had been arbitrarily rejected by the Government. Following the 1950 appeal, which

was granted, British Oxygen proceeded to erect a building and install plant. As the council had anticipated, violent complaints came quickly from residents at the increased noise and vibration caused by these further operations of the company. Considerable discussions were held at the offices of the Ministry in an endeavour to find a satisfactory solution to the problem caused by the Minister allowing the appeal.<br/>
In June, 1953, the borough health committee decided to remind the Minister of Housing and Local Government that the siting of the offending plant was allowed by him on appeal and that he should be pressed urgently to take steps to bring the trouble to an end. The reply the council received was most unsatisfactory, but consideration of any further action was deferred because I myself, as the hon. Member for Parliament for Wembley, North, raised the whole subject in the House in an Adjournment debate on 10th November, 1953.<br/>
The than Parliamentary Secretary, the present Minister of Transport, gave an equally unsatisfactory reply and concluded by saying that the initiative lay with the borough council&#x2014;this after the Government in 1950 had rejected the council's well-considered decision to refuse permission for any extension. Despite this further rebuff, the council persisted with discussions with the company which were held from time to time.<br/>
Meanwhile, the complaints continued to come in from residents and the council health committee considered possible courses of action in January, 1955. There were three main courses. First, it was considered that purchase of the affected residential property in the area would be too costly and would not solve the problem. That, therefore, was discounted. Secondly, there was the question of compensation for the company under Section 26 of the Town and Country Planning Act, 1947. That was deemed impracticable. Thirdly, there was the possibility of legal proceedings against the company and the obtaining of an injunction. That, also, would have involved the council in considerable expense with no guarantee of success.<br/>
So the council decided at that time that it was unable to take any further action in the matter and that the further


complaints of residents would have to be forwarded direct to the Ministry. That was the position at the beginning of this year. But since that time there have been two explosions at the Wembley works. The more recent one was on 20th May last, and this once again brought matters to a head. In view of the natural anxiety of the residents, the council sought to arrange an early meeting of representatives of the Ministry, of the council, of the company and of the local residents association. The Ministry reply to the request was that the Minister
<q>notes the renewed concern </q>
and understood that the matter
<q>which is outside the Minister's province is being investigated by the Factory Inspectorate of the Ministry of Labour.</q>
This reply is totally unacceptable.<br/>
I have also received to my representation a not dissimilar reply except that this note was added:
<q>The Council decided not to take any action under the Town and Country Planning Act, 1947 because an order under Section 26 of that Act requiring the company to discontinue the use of any of their buildings or works would involve a liability to pay compensation which might be heavy. It is true "&#x2014;</q>
writes the Minister&#x2014;
<q>that I have power to direct the council to take this action, but I am as unwilling to do so as was my predecessor, since it is usual to leave such action to the discretion of the local authority, who of course would have to pay the compensation.</q>
To that I say "Thank you very much." Of course, the council would have to pay the compensation, but it had no say in the planning permission which was given by the Ministry in the face of the vigorous opposition of the council. While it is recognised that the decision of the council to zone the land for industrial purposes established the value, the decision of the Minister on the appeal in 1950 had the effect of increasing the amount of compensation which the company could claim should the council decide to make an order under the relevant Section of the 1947 Act.<br/>
This increase would amount to the value of the buildings and the costs incurred by the company in installing plant and possibly the losses which it might incur should it remove the plant. It is not known what these costs would be. One estimate has been that it would be in the region of &#x00A3;&#x00BC; million, and, as the

product of a penny rate in Wembley is &#x00A3;12,700, one can see that this would mean a considerable increase in the rates.<br/>
The Ministry suggests that the council should pay compensation when the Ministry's own action against the council's advice was to increase substantially the amount the council would have to pay if the necessary order were made. Also such order would have to be confirmed by the Minister who would thereby admit the mistake of the Ministry in 1950. Should the borough council have to pay for the Ministry's mistake?<br/>
That is a very brief history of the case. It is, I maintain, unanswerable. But my main concern is the genuine apprehension of my constituents, and my sympathies are entirely with them. The company, I recognise, is a good one and has been helpful when it could, at some considerable expense. Nevertheless, in addition to the noise and vibration, there is the added worry of explosions, the most recent of which meant loss of life. Some of my constituents are most apprehensive. It has been told to me that some of them are actually frightened to go to bed at night.<br/>
The residents themselves have compiled a list, which I understand is by no means complete, of damage to residential property and other effects. There were 26 houses damaged by the most recent explosion, with broken windows and tiles on roofs, and 66 persons suffered slight to severe shock; 8 persons had to have medical treatment for nervous disorder and 90 per cent. of the local residents expressed fear that an explosion could happen again. All of those interviewed wanted the removal of the plant.<br/>
No one doubts that the company is a good one and that it has tried to be very helpful in settling claims made for damage, but there is no doubt either that the best and the only thing to be done at present is to get the interested parties round the table.<br/>
The company would, I believe, send representatives; the borough council and the South Kenton and Preston Park Residents' Association are pressing for such a meeting and the Government must agree to attend such a meeting. They have so far resisted the invitation,


but I urge&#x2014;nay, I must demand&#x2014;that the Minister co-operates with the local authority and actively demonstrates his appreciation of the concern and anxiety of my constituents who have an undeniable claim to be heard.</p>

<p>I should like to thank my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Wembley, North (Wing Commander Bullus) for his very kind words of welcome. I can assure him that my right hon. Friend is very conscious of his very wide responsibilities in this Ministry, but although I have read the former speech of my hon. and gallant Friend in the debate in 1953, to which he referred, and realise how anxious, and rightly anxious, he is for the welfare of his constituents, I am bound to say that I feel he is placing my right hon. Friend's sense of responsibility a little high to ask for the buying out&#x2014; for that is what it amounts to&#x2014;of this company at a cost which he himself puts at &#x00A3;&#x00BC; million after some years of establishment in Wembley.<br/>
I think that it is fair to point out to my hon. and gallant Friend that 1936 was not a year in which there was any pressure from the national point of view to establish this factory in Wembley. As my information goes, the borough council decided to change the allocation of this land to industrial purposes in that year, but the buildings were not erected until 1942, when they were erected by the then Ministry of Supply. I think, therefore, it must be faced&#x2014;and I do not want to argue with my hon. and gallant Friend at this time of night as to the degree of responsibility&#x2014;that the borough council had some degree, and a substantial one, of responsibility in the original mistake, if mistake it was&#x2014;and it may well have been.<br/>
When the former Minister, the then Minister of Town and Country Planning, the late Lord Dalton, came to consider the proposed extension on appeal in, I think, 1950, one must face the fact that the position was that this industrial allocation of the land was settled, that the factory was there and

that a compressor of sorts, though of a different type, was, in fact, at work. At the inquiry&#x2014;I fully agree with my hon. and gallant Friend&#x2014;there was, as there so often is on these occasions, a conflict of technical evidence. As I understand it, the proposal was to install what was then a new type of compressor. I have no doubt that the optimism of the technical witnesses called on behalf of the company was perfectly genuine, but, nevertheless, with the advantage of hindsight I think we all agree now that it was optimism.<br/>
However that may be, the Minister decided the appeal in favour of the company, and although that decision might be different if taken today I have no reason to believe with the information which was then available that any other decision would or could have been arrived at. As my hon. and gallant Friend knows, I have been in my Department only a week, but I am already aware of how difficult some of these cases are. I am sure my hon. and gallant Friend appreciates&#x2014;the planning procedures seem immensely complicated&#x2014; that if we had means by which the decision of the Minister, which is laid down in the Act as final, could be reviewed there would be endless uncertainty and endless further delay.<br/>
As regards remedies available to the Wembley Borough Council, we have to face the fact that this whole planning control procedure, although it goes back to the beginning of the century, is really relatively modern, and it was never the intention that planning control should replace the ordinary common law liabilities or remedies. I think that the very fact that my hon. and gallant Friend makes the point that the difficulties facing the council in deciding whether to take legal action are increased because it has no guarantee of success&#x2014;which, I think, is almost inevitable in any form of litigation&#x2014;is in a sense an admission that this case is not quite as clear cut as my hon. and gallant Friend would have us believe. I do not say that in any disparaging manner because, as I said earlier, I know that he is nightly most anxious for the safety and welfare of constituents. But I ask him to realise 'that we, too, who in the Department are responsible for public funds, have our responsibility in the matter as well.<br/>
If the council decides that the procedure under Section 26 of the Town and Country Planning Act is out so far as it is concerned, and if my hon. and gallant Friend appreciates, as I am sure he does, that buying out this factory, Which is what it would amount to, at this vast sum is not something Which my right hon. Friend could contemplate after twenty years, the only real remedy, as I see it, is co-operation between the borough council and the company. I have no reason to think that this has not been good in the past. If my hon. and gallant Friend thinks that, by bringing a deputation of representa-

tives of the council and of the company to the Ministry, I can help in trying to work out some means by which this nuisance can be abated, I should be only too willing to assist if I can. But I must warn him that, as I see the matter at present, I do not Chink that this is a case in which it would be right for my right hon. Friend the Minister to intervene and in effect provide the funds to support a Section 26 Order.</p>
