<p>My hon. Friend has always taken a great interest in this. I assure him that we are in the lead in matters to do with food labelling. The Food Advisory Committee has been doing work on this in Britain. Much of labelling is now in the European Community domain, of course, and we take a lead in the Community in ensuring that the public have clear labelling of what is in the products that they buy. It is not my intention to tell the public what they ought to eat; it is my intention to allow them to choose for themselves&#x2014;that is why they need proper labels.</p>

<p>Existing rights of public access are preserved over land which is entered under the set-aside and environmentally sensitive areas schemes. Neither scheme imposes additional obligations as regards access, but the meadowland option of the related countryside premium scheme provides areas set aside for walking and quiet enjoyment by the public.</p>

<p>Does the Minister agree that, as more than 10 million people enjoy walking as a pastime, at Easter and on other public holidays many honey spots in the countryside will be overused and peace and quiet will be denied to people going out to enjoy them? Is not there a good argument for increasing the number of parts of Britain to which people can gain access and spreading the money that people spend when they go out into the countryside? Will the Government try to incorporate in the set-aside and environmentally sensitive schemes some encouragement to farmers to improve access?</p>

<p>I think that access is best improved by improving footpaths, bridleways and the like. We must also recognise that in all these areas a balance must be maintained. In our environmentally sensitive areas it is sometimes access that causes much of the problem. I cite for instance, the difficulties in the South Downs where access for people with dogs makes it extremely difficult to graze those areas in the way that would be desirable. I also remind the hon. Gentleman that problems in the Pennine Way now mean that in some cases and circumstances we are spending more there than on similar lengths of the M1.</p>

<p>Is my right hon. Friend aware that, with the exception of the small areas that he mentioned, there is no particularly good reason why environmentally sensitive areas should have special access to the public, bearing in mind that huge areas of equally sensitive land often adjoin them? My right hon. Friend should concentrate on trying to expand the environmentally sensitive areas, which have been so successful.</p>

<p>I am sure that my right hon. Friend will not mind my saying that such areas are his creation. The fact that the whole of Europe is copying Britain in creating such areas owes much to his perseverance in the Council of Ministers. I should like to see how best we can extend the scheme as time goes on. I emphasise my right hon. Friend's argument that access must often compete with other aspects of the countryside to achieve a balance. To conserve the countryside, we must sometimes restrict rather than extend access. Environmentally sensitive areas will work only if farmers can farm them properly, so we must ensure that the demands and needs of farming play their part in the balance between them.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman will know that I am deeply opposed to the concept of compulsory set-aside, which is damaging both to the countryside and to the

farmer. I seek a system in the European Community in which each country will take a fair share of the amount of set-aside necessary. A voluntary scheme should set a target to be achieved within each country. A voluntary scheme means that farmers must be paid enough to make it possible for them to look after the land, which is in their interests and the wider interests of the country as a whole.</p>

<p>My right hon. Friend is absolutely right to say that we must get the balance right in environmentally sensitive areas. In the Somerset levels, which I represent, there is a genuine need for a limited amount of access to see the birds and fauna there. However, if too many people want to come at once, as they often do, they will destroy the areas that we wish to protect.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend is right. We have spent a lot of money and employed much manpower, especially in the Somerset levels, to try to achieve a balance between the needs of farming and those of wildlife. We have discovered that, by bringing both sides together, the level of water necessary turns out to be very different from that which many conservationists had thought. When one is trying to bring two groups together in such a way, it must be realised that total access to the general public cannot always be afforded if wildlife is to be protected. It is important to achieve a balance. The hon. Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett) is among the first to say that he wants not access which destroys the countryside but access which opens it up.</p>

<p>I thank my hon. Friend for that reply. Does he agree that that success story owes much to the efforts of British agriculture? Should we not also

<p>I agree with my hon. Friend that the factor that will most benefit the farmer is for us to get on top of inflation. The farmer makes a contribution towards defeating inflation because of the performance of food prices. It is also true that if the farmer wishes to benefit more from consumer spending, the more he can produce processed products that the consumer wants to buy, the better. Nobody goes into a a shop to buy sheep&#x2014;they go to buy meat products and the more the farmer can get into that business, the more he will benefit from his own primary production.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend has just said something rather interesting&#x2014;<i>[Interruption.]</i> It was not so much unusual, but it anticipated the flow of my own question.<br/>
Farmers may well have been contributing to the lowering of inflation. That is unfortunate for them in that they do not receive what they consider to be a proper rate of return. Does my hon. Friend agree that they should therefore concentrate their efforts on getting value added and adding some sex appeal to the crops that they sell?</p>

<p>It is true that people selling unbranded commodities will never receive the same return from them as the people who take the commodity, transform it, package it and give it new appeal. It is equally true that the consumer clearly wants the processed convenience product. The more that farmers can get into that business through greater collaborative effort and greater links with the retail trade, the more they will realise the benefits of their own primary production.</p>

<p>Does the Minister accept that the price paid to the producers&#x2014;farmers&#x2014;is an extremely low percentage of the price paid by consumers? Does he also accept that unless a proper check is kept on the prices paid to producers there will inevitably be a shortfall in production, which will put prices to consumers through the ceiling? Will he endeavour to assist farmers in marketing their produce so that they can gain more for the agricultural produce of their farms?</p>

<p>We certainly try to take our decisions in European negotiations and in the Ministry with a view to helping British farmers get their products on the table in front of British housewives and other people. It is also true that the reason for lower returns in agriculture is the persistence of over-supply in the marketplace. The greatest service that we can do for a farmer is to conquer the problem of over-supply and inflation. When we can do that, the farmer will be able to realise his returns much more easily.</p>

We have made it clear to Mr. MacSharry and our colleagues that, although we agree that changes must be made and that prices must fall closer to those of the marketplace, agriculture should be based on commercially viable farms and the United Kingdom farmer should not be discriminated against merely because he is efficient, modern and effective.</p>

<p>Incomes will not be buoyant if the market is constantly over-supplied. If farmers wish to achieve better returns, the Government must conquer inflation and over-supply and take more interest in producing what the consumer wants in the form that the consumer wants it. If the consumer wants products that the farmer thinks inappropriate, it is the farmer and not the consumer who is wrong. There is only one market and it must deliver what the consumer wants.</p>

<p>I know that my hon. Friend is concerned about the drop in farm gate prices. Will he confirm that to raise farm gate prices farmers must add more value to their products?

<p>Farmers should certainly use all the help that is available. I do not wish to transform agriculture into some form of cottage industry producing pies and salami, but unless farmers get further down the food chain and produce goods that people want by adding value on the farm, they will be stuck with producing unbranded raw materials. As I said, people do not go into supermarkets to buy sheep&#x2014;they buy products, which is what the farmer must produce.</p>

<p>I thank the hon. Gentleman for any influence that he may have had on the letter that I received this morning from the Grimsby fish producer organisation thanking us for our excellent efforts in producing the gear option as an alternative to the tie-up scheme.<br/>
A decommissioning scheme is not the most effective method. Taking out old boats would be bad value and taking out new boats would be bad economics. If some boats are taken out under a decommissioning scheme, the remaining boats must be controlled to prevent them from simply mopping up all the additional effort; otherwise, there would have to be a new system of regulation, including compulsory tie-ups for longer periods than those that we unfortunately have at present.</p>

<p>I am sure that my hon. Friend will appreciate that I do not welcome his remarks on a decommissioning scheme, but what other initiatives will he take to reduce the fishing effort?

<p>We have just completed a consultation with the industry. We considered whether we should introduce a square mesh panel on nets used for the nephrops fishery. We suggested a 70 mm square panel, but the industry said that it would like to go further. I shall do all that I can to go as far as possible so that we do not catch so many small round fish in the nephrops fishery. That is an important conservation measure.</p>

<p>Does the Minister accept that he is totally isolated from the fishing community in his opposition to decommissioning and in his support for the eight-day tie-up? Does he understand that even members of the Conservative party are embarrassed by the contemptuous attitude that he showed to Scottish fishermen during the eight-day tie-up debate?

<p>To be isolated is not necessarily to be wrong&#x2014;and I do not accept that I am isolated. The hon. Gentleman's remarks about the previous debate are silly. He suggests that fishermen want to be able to fish exactly as they have always fished and yet to have conservation. That cannot be delivered.<br/>
If fishermen genuinely want conservation, they can take their suggestions about mesh sizes further forward. I shall always listen to them. Since I have been a fisheries Minister, not one hon.

<p>The Minister knows very well that he is isolated on the decommissioning issue in terms both of the industry and of Europe. The revision of the common fisheries policy provides an opportunity to use the available structural funds to finance a proper decommissioning scheme which takes account of all the points that the hon. Gentleman raised. Will he take the opportunity to tap into that funding? Will he also use the opportunity offered by the review of regional policies to extend the Hague preference south from Bridlington to include all the east coast ports?</p>

<p>I know that the Hague preference is a sensitive issue. It is designed for the northern communities. The Scottish industry attaches particular importance to it. Even the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan (Mr. Salmond) would agree that it is particularly important to the Scottish industry and to communities in northern England.<br/>
I realise that the Hague preference causes difficulties. As I am anxious that the review of the fisheries policy should be a limited review&#x2014;I do not want the common fisheries policy to be busted open, because we benefit greatly from it&#x2014;I should hesitate before introducing that element into the discussions, as it would encourage other people to seek a wider review than we think would be helpful.</p>

<p>How does the Minister propose to arrest the depressing erosion of incomes of hill and upland farms which are dependent upon the sheep industry? Will he do three things? Will he announce his proposals to end the sheepmeat variable premium? Will he support a private storage scheme to ease the undoubted danger of fluctuations occuring in the market following the ending of the variable premium scheme? May we have a five-year continuance of the wool guarantee, as wool constitutes some 14 per cent. of the incomes of sheep farmers in the hills and uplands?</p>

<p>We retain the option to accelerate the phase-out of the variable premium. When we take that decision, we shall certainly bear in mind the importance of accelerating our exports and getting rid of the clawback.<br/>
Giving a five-year guarantee is not a practical proposition. We recently increased the hill livestock compensatory allowances. About &#x00A3;400 million per year goes into the British sheep industry as a whole, a large proportion of it to the less-favoured areas. We recently increased HLCAs by &#x00A3;142 million. We have a system of market support in the livestock sector which costs us &#x00A3;800


million per year. That is a great deal of taxpayers' money to support the industry. We are committed to that industry.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman has got his facts the wrong way round. The common agricultural policy has enabled us to produce a great deal more of the food that we need.

However, there is &#x00A3;2,500 million worth of food that we could produce. I do not recommend that people buy British when British is not best, but I believe that farmers, other producers, manufacturers and retailers could do a great deal more to use home sources, so long as they produce food that the public want.

<p>Does my right hon. Friend acknowledge the serious decline in the agricultural rented sector since the end of the second world war? Does he agree that it would be in the best interests of British agriculture if that trend were reversed?

<p>My hon. Friend is perfectly right. The tenanted sector is indeed in decline. We want to improve the opportunities for new entrants to the farming industry. The only way to achieve that is to ensure that more land is available. That is why I have made some radical propositions for change in the landlord and tenant scheme. I am pleased that there is widespread acceptance of both the need for more land and the need for radical change.</p>

<p>Does the Prime Minister recall that in the 1989 autumn statement he predicted that inflation would be down to 5&#x00B7;5 per cent. at the end of last year and that he revised that figure to 7&#x00B7;25 per cent. in the last Budget? In fact, it turned out to be over 10 per cent. What credibility should we give the Chancellor's forecast that inflation will fall to 4 per cent. by the end of the year when the rise in average earnings is 9 per cent., electricity prices are to go up by 13 per cent., water charges are to go up by 16 per cent. and petrol will rise by 20p a gallon?</p>

There were 150,000 casualties and deaths, there is martial law in Kuwait and environmental destruction throughout the region. It is the product of arms sales. Does the Prime Minister consider that all the money that has been spent by the Government on the Gulf war compares unfavourably with the miserly figure of &#x00A3;28 million spent on the African famine?

<p>The House will remember that when I announced the review on 5 December I explained the comprehensive nature of our review. For the first time we are looking at the structure, functions and finance of local government in the round.<br/>
I should like to thank the very large number of people and organisations who have put forward their views. I do not need to tell the House that they have not always been compatible one with another.<br/>
We took as our starting point our firm belief that the local delivery of certain services&#x2014;many of them essential&#x2014;is a central feature of a pluralist society. Local government must enable local people to exercise continuing influence over the quality and the range of the services which Parliament entrusts to them.<br/>
Local government is responsible for the efficient delivery of these services. We need responsible, elected local authorities, not only to provide a check and a balance to Westminster, but also to reflect the multiplicity of aspirations amongst local communities.<br/>
But, given the primary responsibilities of central Government, local government cannot be a fully independent power in the land. It traditionally derives its power from Parliament, and it must complement and not compete with central Government in its activities.<br/>
Within this framework, we believe that councils should be accountable for their actions and that there should be a direct and visible relationship between the costs of services and the local bills to which they give rise. We believe that those bills should be spread widely and fairly throughout communities; that they should bear some relation to people's ability to pay; and that it should be possible to levy and collect them without difficulty.<br/>
These principles are guiding our review. I am able to announce today some interim conclusions and, in other areas, to narrow the options so as to proceed to more detailed consultations.<br/>
Many parts of England now have, in effect, unitary local government. The Greater London council and the metropolitan county councils were abolished in 1986. The Inner London education authority went in 1990. There is little demand for their restoration. Indeed, it is difficult now to perceive any real role that they played.<br/>
Outside the main conurbations, leaving aside the valuable rol&#x00EB; played by parishes, the system of two principal tiers is being questioned. Also being questioned is the continued existence of certain of the authorities which were created by the local government reorganisation of 1974, but which have not succeeded in inspiring local loyalty. Another challenge is that the role of authorities is changing as they increasingly become enablers rather than direct providers of services.<br/>
There is, therefore, now an opportunity to think afresh about the structure of local authorities. But the Government do not see this as an opportunity to impose

a new pattern of local authorities according to a national prescription. Nor do we believe that it is necessary to have a uniform pattern of authorities in every part of the country. Local people should have an important role in determining what structure of local government best reflects their community loyalties. That does not mean, therefore, the wholesale abolition of either county councils or district councils, nor even unitary authorities everywhere. It means arriving at the right solution for each community. We intend to adopt a practical approach in response to local views and local conditions, but it seems likely that we shall move to a larger number of unitary authorities.<br/>
We shall, therefore, consult on the proposition that a local government commission shall be charged with responsibility for evaluating the most appropriate form of local government for individual areas, taking account of the wishes of local people and putting forward proposals for reform. We will proceed area by area.<br/>
The reduction in the local tax burden and the correspondingly larger contribution from central taxation announced in my right hon. Friend's Budget statement imply a need to consider whether a number of functions should now be brought into or financed directly by central Government. That would be without further changes to the balance between central and local taxation.<br/>
My right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State for Education and Science is bringing forward today proposals for such a transfer in one area of his responsibility.<br/>
The issue of how local authorities are managed is no less crucial. The problems that local authorities face are compounded by the cumbersome internal arrangements for the management of councils. The committee system&#x2014;which dates back to the Municipal Corporations Act of 1835&#x2014;requires that all decisions are taken collectively by large numbers of councillors, in full council or committees. Too many councillors spend too much time achieving too little.<br/>
Consequently, it is difficult for local government to attract and keep enough men and women of the right calibre both to lead what are now multi-million pound organisations providing a range of key services and to represent properly the interests of the people who elected them. We believe, therefore, that there should be a new look at the internal workings of local authorities to improve the decision-making process. I shall issue a consultation paper on these issues.<br/>
Alongside that, we also want to develop further the idea of the enabling council. Many of the Government's policies have been designed to move power to individual members of the community&#x2014;in particular, the right to buy, the tenants' charter and local management of schools. Compulsory competitive tendering has also been part of that process and we will be looking at ways to make it more effective and to carry it forward. In particular, we will be looking at new areas where contracting out should be applied. Those will include professional and technical tasks, as well as manual tasks. Housing management, legal services and computer services could all be added to the list. The success of a local authority must be measured not by its size, but by the quality of the services delivered, from whatever source, by its responsiveness to its clients and customers and by the value that it squeezes out of each pound of taxpayers' money.<br/>
I now turn to the question of finance. A local tax base is essential if there is to be any meaning to the concept of local government. But local government services cost a great deal of money&#x2014;more than &#x00A3;50 billion in the corning year&#x2014;and the burden on local taxpayers has become too great. We have therefore decided to make a fundamental shift in the amounts which central and local taxpayers pay towards the cost of local government services. This change will take effect in 1991&#x2013;92, and will reduce local taxation to a level that should be sustainable in the longer term.<br/>
The first consequence of this was announced by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer on Tuesday. We have concluded that it is right to reduce the present average headline community charge of &#x00A3;392 in England for 1991&#x2013;92 by &#x00A3;140 to &#x00A3;252. The average amount payable by charge payers, after allowing for the community charge reduction scheme and benefits, will then be considerably less than this. To secure this, my right hon. Friend is providing a further &#x00A3;4&#x00BC;billion from national taxation to local authorities.<br/>
As a result, in 1991&#x2013;92, the community charge will be raising less than rates in their last full year. For the coming year, locally raised finance will fund 22 per cent. of local government expenditure, compared to 34 per cent. this year. And these figures are before the substantial benefit of rebates and the community charge reduction scheme.<br/>
To achieve these objectives, my right hon. Friends the Secretaries of State for Scotland and Wales and I are today introducing in the House a short Bill. If enacted, this will have broadly three effects.<br/>
First, it will provide that the community charges which authorities have set for 1991&#x2013;92 are replaced the day after the Bill's enactment by new charges &#x00A3;140 lower. Councils will not need to meet to set the new charges, but they will be treated in all respects as if they were set by authorities in the usual way.<br/>
Secondly, my right hon. Friends and I will be empowered to pay grants to charging authorities to make up the loss of income resulting from the reduction in charges brought about by the Bill's provisions. It is also our intention to pay grant to cover authorities' additional administrative expenses arising as a consequence of the Bill.<br/>
All this means that where authorities have already issued their charge bills for 1991&#x2013;92&#x2014;I know that some authorities have done so&#x2014;they will, after the Bill's enactment, need to issue fresh bills reflecting their new lower charges. We propose to amend the regulations on the community charge demand notice slightly to provide the basis for the new bills but we believe not in ways that would result in significant changes to authorities' computing arrangements. We are revising the profile of payments from the non-domestic rates pool to ensure that our proposals have no significant effect on authorities' cash flow.<br/>
These proposals do not affect the operation of the community charge reduction scheme or community charge benefits, though it will, of course, be necessary to recalculate entitlements under both schemes.<br/>
My Department has written to local authorities, and to the local authority associations, explaining the details of all these arrangements. Clearly, it is desirable that the new charges should be in place at the earliest opportunity. Accordingly, we shall be looking to Parliament to consider the Bill as a matter of urgency.<br/>
Having reduced community charges to reasonable levels, we shall expect local authorities to restrain their spending to keep them at those levels. I shall therefore be prepared to use my capping powers rigorously again in 1992&#x2013;93.<br/>
Having achieved a reasonable balance between funding from national sources and funding from local tax, we need to address the question of the local tax itself. I referred briefly in my opening remarks to the principles which I believe should underpin any form of local tax. Let me spell them out.<br/>
First, accountability. As far as possible, a local tax should buttress the accountability of a local council to its taxpayers. People should be able to see some link between what they are being asked to pay and what their council is spending.<br/>
Second, fairness. Nobody likes paying taxes. But in our society taxes have to be basically acceptable to taxpayers; and to achieve that they must be perceived to be fair.<br/>
Third, ease of collection. Any tax will require administrative arrangements to collect the revenue, including measures to chase up those who are late in paying. But if the tax is too difficult to collect, the costs of collection become unacceptable.<br/>
Fourth, most people should make some contribution. We believe that it is right that, as far as possible, any tax should take some account of the number of adults in each household so that they contribute to the cost of services provided by the local councils which they elect. This principle has gained a wide measure of acceptance.<br/>
Fifth, restraint. No tax is acceptable if it is levied at penal rates either as a result of local authority overspending or because the burden on any individual or household is excessively high. We are adamantly opposed to excessively high bills for a minority of electors&#x2014;a feature of the old rates system.<br/>
In accordance with these criteria, we have reached our conclusions about the future of the community charge. In spite of the comprehensive system of income-related rebates, and the reduction scheme that we devised, the public have not been persuaded that the charge is fair. We have therefore decided that from the earliest possible moment the community charge will be replaced by a new system of local taxation.<br/>
After a careful reappraisal of the options, we have decided in principle to bring forward a new local tax under which there will be a single bill for each household comprising two essential elements, the number of adults living there and the value of the property. There are a number of ways of assessing values, on a capital or a rental basis, which require careful evaluation and extensive discussion and consultation. But it is our intention that the system that we introduce should have the following features: it should reflect people's concern that the system is fair; the balance of funding as between central taxes and the new local tax should be broadly in line with that announced by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer on Tuesday; it will be essential to ensure that local taxpayers do not face undue changes in their bills as a result of the introduction of the new local tax arrangements: there will therefore, need to be arrangements to protect them during the transition to the new system; the system should ensure that regional variations in property values do not lead to disproportionate bills in high price areas; there should be rebate arrangements to protect people on low incomes from making a


disproportionate contribution to local taxation; there must also be restraints to ensure that local taxpayers do not face excessive bills as a result of overspending by local councils, either before or after the introduction of the new system: there are a number of ways, including capping, by which this may be achieved.<br/>
I made clear at the beginning of this statement my commitment to the institution of local government. But, for its part, local government must recognise economic reality and the duty and responsibility of central Government to manage the economy. Central Government also have a duty to protect local taxpayers from excessive bills.<br/>
I intend to publish a consultative document after the Easter recess setting out alternative approaches and dealing with these issues. At present, the Government have no intention to propose changes to the uniform business rate. My right hon. Friends the Secretaries of State for Scotland and for Wales will be making separate statements about the outcome of the review as it relates to those countries.<br/>
Let me summarise. We have already dealt with the burden of the local tax. I shall shortly publish consultation papers on structure, internal management and the new local tax. We will conclude the period of consultation in the summer. Depending on the outcome of that consultation, we intend to introduce legislation setting up the local government commission and providing for the new local tax in the next Session of Parliament. We anticipate that the first of the new authorities could be in place by April 1994. We shall consult local authorities on the basis that the new tax could be in place in 1993&#x2013;94.<br/>
The proposals that I have outlined will establish a system of local government which will carry through into the next century. These proposals are designed to end the sterile quarrel between supporters of central and local government. They should attract men and women of sufficient quality and commitment to restore authority to and confidence in local government. They should enhance the quality of services and give extra momentum to the pursuit of value for money. They should result in a local government which puts people first. I commend the proposals to the House.</p>

<p>We have just heard the most complete capitulation, the most startling U-turn and the most shameless abandonment of consistency and principle in modern political history. The former Prime Minister, the right hon. Member for Finchley (Mrs. Thatcher), who cannot bear to be present, was famously not for turning. The Secretary of State and his new Prime Minister have not only turned; they have been through a revolving door. May we be assured that the new Prime Minister will not complain tomorrow that he has once again been bounced by this latest leak by the Secretary of State of his own proposals?<br/>
We have not heard from the Secretary of State a single word of contrition or apology. Will he now make a formal apology to the people of Britain for 12 years of arrogance, to local government for unprecedented chaos, and to millions of people who have been driven to despair by shattered services and unfair and ever rising bills? Is it not

astonishing incompetence that, after 12 years in office and &#x00A3;13&#x00B7;5 billion of taxpayers' money, the Secretary of State still cannot tell us what he intends to do?<br/>
What happened to the Prime Minister's assurances on Tuesday that we would have all the answers this week? How could a Prime Minister on top of his job make promises on Tuesday which his Secretary of State is unable to fulfil on Thursday? Why are we left not with the answers but with the questions? Why have we not had answers to the most obvious questions? When will the charge take effect, what will be the valuation rate, how many people will be assumed to constitute a household, what will be the size of the poll tax element, and how many people will be losers?<br/>
Is not the problem that, while the Secretary of State clearly concedes that the poll tax flagship has been holed beneath the waterline, the wreck is still afloat and is a danger to all shipping? What the Secretary of State told us today, with its continued uncertainty and confusion, its inevitable doubts and delays, is in effect that the poll tax bills will keep on coming&#x2014;this year, next year, in 1993 and in all probability in 1994 as well. Why will not he accept our offers of co-operation on a Bill to abolish the poll tax, on the basis of our fair rates proposals&#x2014;the only way in which we can ensure that this year's poll tax bills will be the last?<br/>
Is it not clear that under the Secretary of State's proposals the poll tax will still be with us even after 1994? This is the tax that refuses to lie down and die. Under those proposals, will not people continue to be taxed simply because they live and breath? Are we not still faced with a head tax, with all the problems of a register, with all the unfairness of a flat rate tax, and with all the difficulties of extricating money from people with no income? Does not the right hon. Gentleman recognise that he cannot rely on the electoral register to solve his problems without putting a price tax on the right to vote and then inviting people to sell that vote at a price which may be as much as &#x00A3;150 or &#x00A3;200 per vote? Are we not left with all the objectionable features of the poll tax but with all the difficult and transitional problems of a new and untried property tax? Are we not faced with a pig-in-a-poke tax, a bed-and-breakfast tax, a property poll tax, a tax on the roof over one's head and a tax on the heads under one's roof?<br/>
How can the Secretary of State be confident of persuading his own party to support these proposals in the Division Lobbies? Does he recall the right hon. Member for Finchley assuring the country that she would never introduce a property tax? Does he expect her to follow him through the Lobbies? And what of himself and all his Front Bench colleagues&#x2014;indeed, of the whole Tory party, all of whose members fought the last election on a manifesto commitment to abandon property taxes? Are they now to be whipped through the Lobbies&#x2014;and how many of them will refuse to follow?<br/>
Are not the right hon. Gentleman's proposals for reorganising local government, vague as they are, also driven by the poll tax? Should not structure determine finance rather than the other way round? Why is the poll tax still in the driving seat, spreading its malign influence not just through education and through the whole of the Budget strategy but into the whole structure of local government, too? Are not this a Government who, despite their belated confession of terrible error, are still in thrall to the monster that they created?<br/>
There is, after all, some justice in the spectacle of the Government continuing to pay a heavy price for their poll tax debacle. The tragedy is that the rest of the country will also continue to pay that price&#x2014;the price of a mistake borne of arrogance and perpetuated by a leaking and limping Government who, on the evidence of this broken-backed and blood-stained statement, are too weak and divided to correct their own error.</p>

To conduct that consultative process with the thoroughness that the hon. Member for Dagenham would want, I need to know answers to some questions about the costs of the fair rate proposals. The House knows that, in the past few days, we have put &#x00A3;4&#x00BC; billion into switching the incidence of responsibility from local people to the centre. The Labour party said that it would not have increased VAT to do that. What would it have increased? I need to know the answer so that I may consult thoroughly. If people need to know exactly who will pay how much, which is the complaint of the hon. Member for Dagenham, he must say precisely where he wants the tax burdens to fall. When the Labour party has worked out the answers to those questions, we shall have already won the next general election.</p>

<p>I am grateful to my hon. Friend. Obviously, we must address the equalisation problem in the consultative document. It is not possible to do so in general terms, but we must weigh up the various elements of the local tax before making a judgment. Some remarkable figures have been quoted as the likely consequence of our proposals for people living in the south-east, but they bear no relationship to reality.<br/>
On my hon. Friend's first point about the discrediting of local government, it is impossible to overstate the damage that has been done to the institution of local government by the behaviour of many Labour-run local councils.</p>

<p>Why has the Secretary of State chosen to move from the most unpopular local tax ever to the second most unpopular local tax ever? He has gone straight from the frying pan into the fire.

Will the Secretary of State accept our welcome for the fact that his proposals on structure follow closely&#x2014;even, in places, word for word&#x2014;our proposals?

We started our review in the hope that we could find a measure of agreement on the various aspects of local goverment. We have been able to meet with the Liberal party on some of the approaches that we have adopted and I have no ground for complaint about that.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman asked why we did not pursue the option of a local income tax as advocated by the Liberal party. There were several reasons, one of which was that the mood of the country means that it would not be inclined to want to entrust its income tax rates to local Labour-controlled authorities. Having listened to the hon. Gentleman at great length and with courtesy, I was persuaded not to follow his arguments, but to reject them.</p>

<p>I support much of what my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State said in the first part of his statement. However, now that my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer has made a huge sum of money available to reduce the community charge, if my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State had put that money into improving the rebate system rather than reducing the total, might not the community charge have become acceptable in two years' time? The fact that my right hon. Friend has suggested a two-tax system that will be just as hard to collect as the present one, will not be related to ability to pay and will create a new class of losers might be simply because he decided to make his statement on the Ides of March.</p>

<p>As my right hon. Friend rises behind me, I do not think that anyone would suggest that he has a lean and hungry look. I very much welcome his support for the first part of my statement. To receive any agreement or support at all when dealing with the reorganisation and reform of local government is something of an achievement, so I am grateful to my right hon. Friend.<br/>
My right hon. Friend suggests that we should have taken the hypothetical concept of allowing the community charge to run on, perhaps spending more and more money and underpinning it with more and more social security arrangements. That is not a credible basis on which to sustain a tax. First, the tax is widely perceived as not being as fair as was originally intended and hoped. Secondly, there are undoubtedly collection difficulties because of the significant number of changes during the course of a given year. Therefore, introducing a new, local tax that


combines many of the elements of my right hon. Friend's ideas but also holds out greater certainty of collecting most of the money moves us towards an important consensus.</p>

This was not an hypothecated revenue that the Chancellor described when increasing VAT by 2&#x00B7;5 per cent. The important point that my right hon. Friend made was that he was broadly creating a new balance between revenue raised from local sources and revenue from the central Exchequer. The single biggest change for which he was responsible was in the balance between the very substantial amount funded from the centre and the amount that will increasingly be funded by the local ratepayer or charge payer.

We incorporated in the review many of the ideas which we discussed. A desperate bankruptcy exists, and it is to be found among Opposition Members.<br/>
We considered a local income tax, but we were not persuaded, for several reasons. First, within the totality of local government, entrusting local Labour authorities with setting the levels of income tax would have given them the power to reverse what was one of the main thrusts of Government economic strategy in the past decade. Secondly, in many local authority areas, where the number of income tax payers was relatively limited and the number of people on a form of rebate or exemption was high, the

danger was that people with significant resources would be imprisoned in an area without having any effective control over the outcome of elections there. Adding a local income tax to a national income tax would create confusion in people's minds as to which function or service they were financing&#x2014;whether local or central.<br/>
There were many complicating factors. We decided that a local tax formula would leave a clear idea in people's minds that they were paying a local authority which they could identify for local services.</p>

<p>May I wholeheartedly congratulate my right hon.

Will my right hon. Friend confirm that, for the two years&#x2014;or whatever period&#x2014;for which the present system remains, he, and local authorities, will expect all those liable under it to pay, whether they are Opposition Members or people occupying less illustrious positions in society?</p>

<p>While I was listening to my hon. Friend's important question, I was conducting a further interim review of local government and, on mature reflection, I have come to the view that some councillors from Lambeth are really rather good people.<br/>
There can be no shadow of a doubt about the need to collect in respect of legitimate bills issued by the legitimate authorities of our local democracy. There can be no question about that and the utmost rigour should be


applied in enforcing the law. Nothing makes that harder than the utterly unforgivable behaviour of those hon. Members who do everything in their power to undermine the process.</p>

<p>Does the Secretary of State accept that the most unbelievably arrogant part of his statement was his assertion that he would "improve the quality of local decision making"? That came from a representative of a Government the quality of whose decision making has so far cost us &#x00A3;13&#x00B7;5 billion. Will the Secretary of State assure us that any future assessment or review of the quality of decision making will include the quality of decision making in the Tory Government?</p>

<p>If the hon. Gentleman had spent even a tiny fraction of the time that my hon. Friends and I have spent consulting local councils, he would have discovered that what I said about the ability to manage local authorities and about the sort of people now attracted to them was not a party matter. Everyone is preoccupied about the problem of finding men and women with the time and resource to give to that vital part of our national life. By turning this into a party issue, the hon.

Certainly he will not get an atom of constructive help from the Labour party.<br/>
My right hon. Friend has not mentioned business taxation, although he did talk about a wider local government tax base. Will business taxation still be left out? Does he recall that a previous Secretary of State, during our debates on local business taxation, assured the House that close and intimate links between the local authorities and businesses in their areas would be reinforced?</p>

<p>I am very grateful to my right hon. Friend for his kind remarks. It is fundamental that, in the review, the structure, functions and financing of local government be linked.

<p>Has not the main cause of the suffering and turmoil in local government been the successive cuts in rate support grant&#x2014;from 60 per cent. in 1979 to 42 per cent. today? The burden of taxation was switched from central government to local government so that the Government might take the credit for tax cuts, and the local authorities the blame for increased rates and cuts in services. Was not the purpose of the poll tax to sweep away Labour local government by imposing a large charge on everyone in the hope that the town halls would get the blame? The British people had too much intelligence to fall for that scheme. It backfired and swept away the right hon. Member for Finchley (Mrs. Thatcher). Is not the present commotion the sound of panic-stricken rats deserting the flagship?</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman cannot have been listening. The switch in resources, at the expense of the

local payer, whether of rates or of the community charge, began in 1976 under the right hon. Member for Bethnal Green and Stepney (Mr. Shore). By 1979, the rate support grant had been reduced to 61 per cent. It is perfectly true that the change continued thereafter. Not until the Budget that my right hon. Friend the Chancellor delivered on Tuesday was the direction reversed. The reversal is to be maintained at about the present rate.</p>

<p>Is my right hon. Friend aware that many of our constituents fully supported the principles that lay behind the community charge but thought that there were faults in the way in which it was implemented? People will feel that the proposals that he has presented in outline today meet the criteria and, at the same time, are practical. I congratulate him on his refusal to be pushed into presenting detailed proposals at this stage, and on his intention to put the matter out to consultation. That will provide the opportunity to ensure that, before matters are finalised, there has been proper discussion, that details have been worked out, and possible anomalies avoided.</p>

<p>I am extremely grateful to my hon. Friend for his remarks. We have tried very hard to adopt an evolutionary approach. The local tax meets certain criteria that are widely accepted, especially in the Conservative party. It is absolutely fundamental that changes of this sort be introduced following consultation with the people who will have to apply them. That is what we are doing, and we have no intention of allowing ourselves to be stampeded or forced to move faster than we think is compatible with proper completion of the job.</p>

<p>If the hon. Lady waits until we have produced the consultation document, she will see the assumptions upon which it is based.

<p>My right hon. Friend the Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury (Mr. Ridley) appears to have confused the Ides of March with the equinox&#x2014;not that either appears to be particularly relevant.<br/>
I congratulate the Secretary of State on one aspect in particular of his excellent statement, and that is the proposal to introduce more unitary authorities, which has the great merit of making it easier for the taxpayer to identify excessive spending authorities. Is he aware that that is particularly relevant in Lancashire, where there used to be several county boroughs and where we now have an excessively spending Labour-controlled county council?</p>

<p>My right hon. Friend represents his constituents extremely effectively because when I was in Blackpool not long ago I was left in no doubt about the depth of feeling there. I must not prejudge any local

<p>In relation to the &#x00A3;140 per head subsidy for the poll tax mark 1, does the right hon. Gentleman agree that it is wholly unrelated to the demands on, or resources of, the local authority? If there is to be a subsidy for the poll tax in the current year, should it not be based on the principle, from each according to his resources and to each according to his needs? In relation to the poll tax mark 2, will the registration arrangements be substantially different from those obtaining now?</p>

<p>I have already said that it is possible in the new arrangements that a register of the sort associated with the community charge will not be necessary. It is a detailed and technical matter that must be looked at. We shall be putting forward in the consultation document a number of options&#x2014;they are not firm proposals now&#x2014;to deal with the matter because it is important, as I have said several times, that the local authorities become involved at this stage in advising on the most effective way forward.

<p>There will be great sighs of relief among my constituents in Lambeth as a consequence of the abolition of the community charge. Will my right hon. Friend please use his powers to cap the Lambeth budget, which is &#x00A3;8 million or &#x00A3;9 million above the &#x00A3;307 million allowed by the Government? On the other hand, will he urge his Department to be as sympathetic as possible over the back debt repayment due to Lambeth's inefficiency over many years? He must be aware that, of the present poll tax set by Lambeth, little over half is going to pay for the services of the council and the remainder towards the wretched debt accumulated by its inefficiency.</p>

<p>I am wholly in agreement with my hon. Friend. The new system that we introduce will, of course, be seen as a fair system, but it will also reflect the need for local authorities to bear down on their expenditure patterns. That principle will remain with the new system. It is worth saying that it is not just the community charge that the Lambeth authority does not collect. It does not collect the rents, and it did not collect the rates before the community charge was introduced. The most profound anxieties are developing about that local authority. They exist across the Floor of the House, and there are deep and justifiable concerns on the part of the Labour party because, after all, that party is in control there.</p>

<p>In the muddle of criteria, platitudes and principles contained in the Secretary of State's announcement, he seemed to forget two principles that we used to hear from the Conservatives. The first was that one could not solve problems by throwing money at them&#x2014;even though the Conservatives then threw &#x00A3;4&#x00B7;25 billion at the poll tax problem&#x2014;and, secondly, that the Government had no money of their own because it was all taxpayers' money. Those two points seemed to escape the right hon. Gentleman as he tried to get out of the muddle into which the Conservatives got themselves.<br/>
Why does the right hon. Gentleman think it behoves Opposition Members to give him advice now when he was

so well advised by us before he introduced the poll tax? We gave him advice on Second Reading, in Committee and on Third Reading of the measure which introduced the poll tax. He took no notice whatever of our advice. Why should we think that he will take notice of any advice that we give him now?</p>

<p>The more I listen to Labour Members, the more I wonder why I keep asking them whether they want to join the consultative process. Patently they have little to say.

Will he accept that I and many of my hon. Friends to whom I have spoken about the matter will do all that we can to unite the party and the people behind the proposals, which this time have been fully discussed and agreed within a united Government and a united Cabinet?

<p>I hope that my hon. and learned Friend will feel that, as the last question but one referred to it as a poll tax and he sees it as a property tax, it may be that I am entitled to insist that it is a local tax and cannot be defined in any of the neat packages that are being used so to do. I believe that it will be seen as a tax which complies with the principles that I have set out, which means that most people will pay towards it, it will reflect people's ability to pay and it will be seen as fair. It is in no way capable of being described by either of the labels put on it.<br/>
What I have said today is not a prescription for getting rid of counties or districts; it is to look at the administration of local government on the ground and come to a view of what makes sense.</p>

When the Secretary of State says that the 22 per cent. and the means of obtaining it will be reviewed, does he


include by definition the poll tax or "head" element, or would he permit other ways of raising that relatively modest 22 per cent. Of tax?</p>

The hon. Gentleman also asked whether we should move faster. The practical solution is that there is no way of moving from where we are today in a quicker time scale than that I have outlined.

<p>Much of the Secretary of State's statement was taken up with setting up consultations and commissions to rectify the actions taken by the Government since 1979 and the reorganisation by the previous Tory Government of 1970&#x2013;74. The words that he used to commend the sanitised version of the poll tax&#x2014;poll tax 2&#x2014;were similar to those used to commend the original version. Why should the people of Burnley, which is Labour controlled and has a low poll tax, and the people of Ribble Valley, part of which I represent, which is Tory controlled and has a high poll tax, have confidence that the Government have got it right? How much has this sorry saga cost the nation over the past two years?</p>

<p>My right hon. Friend deserves great praise for coming forward with a system that should answer many of the points of unfairness that are perceived in the present system. One of the flaws of the present system is the seeming inability to control local authorities that seem hell-bent on levying at a rate greater than they should. Capping has proved an imperfect instrument for achieving that control. There are some councils&#x2014;regrettably some are even Conservative&#x2014;in which the councillors seem to be incapable of resisting the money-spending propensities of the officers who run them.

<p>My hon. Friend makes an important point. The awfulness of some of the high levels of expenditure is that they often go hand in hand with some of the least effective deliveries of services.

They were less pleased when they found out that they were paying 45 per cent., business was paying 45 per cent. and central Government were paying 10 per cent. My right hon.

The Secretary of State has suggested this

afternoon a tax that he is not willing to spell out, a tax without a valuation system, and a tax that retains the 20 per cent. contribution, some form of register and the proposals for water metering while not solving the basic problem of ability to pay.<br/>
Will the Secretary of State concede that any new valuation system will take at least two years to implement from the day that legislation is completed? That means that, if the Conservatives stay in office, apart from those who live in Wandsworth and Westminster&#x2014;the only people who have seen their poll tax abolished-the country will have to suffer the poll tax until April 1994. We will suffer the chaos, the cost and the confusion for the simple reason that the Government refuse to accept our fair rates proposal because they are hooked on the idea of numbers rather than on income and fairness and are determined at all costs to get through the general election before announcing what they mean to do.</p>

I do not confirm that a valuation should take the time envisaged by the hon. Gentleman. Valuations can be carried out much more expeditiously, and we will discuss ways to do so in the consultation document.<br/>
The overwhelming view of the House has been a broad welcome for what I have announced today. It has given local government a new sense of opportunity. We are determined to build on that and to develop it. I commend our proposals to the House.</p>

<p>With permission, Mr. Speaker, I will make a statement about the Government's plans for the reorganisation of further education in England.<br/>
We are determined to achieve better standards throughout the education service. The national curriculum is improving teaching and motivating young people in schools as never before. Parental choice is being exercised in more and more schools. A new and clearer system of vocational qualifications is beginning to open up exciting opportunities for school leavers. The proportion going on to higher education has nearly doubled since this Government took office, but we still lag behind our competitors in the participation of our school leavers in further education and training, and their achievement of useful qualifications.<br/>
I believe that the further education colleges have a vital role in providing education and training for both school leavers and adults. They have never in the past been given the attention that their importance in education policy should justify. Through links with business they are well placed to provide the knowledge and skills needed in the workplace. The Education Reform Act 1988 has given them greater managerial autonomy and they are recruiting more students, but they are still subject to bureaucratic controls from local authorities. They lack the full freedom which we gave the polytechnics and higher education colleges in 1989 to respond to the demands of students and of the labour market. The polytechnics are demonstrating quite spectacularly the gains in increased student numbers and increased efficiency without any loss of academic standards that can be achieved with full independence.<br/>
The Government therefore propose to introduce legislation at the earliest opportunity to form a new sector of post-16 education from April 1993, by taking all further education colleges offering full-time education and all sixth form colleges out of local authority control. They will be funded directly by the Government, through a council appointed by and responsible to me. The funding regime will consist of a basic annual budget together with an element dependent on the numbers actually enrolled. It will be designed to provide a powerful incentive to recruit additional students and reduce unit costs. The further education colleges will also assume responsibility for some adult continuing education.<br/>
Spending by local authorities on further education colleges and sixth form colleges in England currently totals over &#x00A3;2 billion of current spending and &#x00A3;100 million of capital. That will become central Government spending with a corresponding reduction in grant to local authorities.<br/>
The colleges will work closely with the training and enterprise councils. The Government attach great importance to the developing partnership between TECs and other local interests in education and training. We have already given TECs specific responsibilities in work-related further education. They and the new independent colleges will have much to gain from close co-operation. The colleges will own their assets and employ their own staff. They will provide for an


ever-increasing proportion of our young people the preparation they need for their working life in the rest of this decade, and in the 21st century.<br/>
I have a duty to ensure that the interim period before the establishment of the new independent sector is as smooth as possible. We must place the interests of the student first and ensure that the work of colleges continues undisturbed. I intend to give the right of transfer of employment to the staff of the colleges that will form the new sector.<br/>
I intend to vest the institutions, which I propose will be free-standing corporate bodies, with the land, buildings and plant which they currently use. I intend to seek Parliament's approval in the legislation that I shall introduce for a measure which requires my specific consent for all disposals by local education authorities of land or interests in land, including buildings used or held or obtained for or in connection with the purposes of the institutions.<br/>
I am concerned that from now on local authorities should not enter into new contracts which bind the colleges beyond 1 April 1993 when they begin to manage their own affairs. Such contracts should be entered into only with the specific consent of the governing bodies of the institutions affected. Contracts for a consideration having a value in excess of &#x00A3;50,000 will in addition require my consent. The forthcoming legislation will seek Parliament's approval to a measure with this purpose. I shall also seek Parliament's approval for appropriate sanctions where consent has not been obtained in advance.<br/>
I shall seek Parliament's approval for these transitional measures to have effect from midnight tonight. In this way, I intend both to put beyond any doubt the long-term future of the colleges and to enable the transition period to be as smooth and trouble-free as possible. I am placing further details of these measures in the <i>Official Report.</i> My Department will write to all LEAs to explain how these measures will be applied.<br/>
These developments will still leave much of the education of young people with school sixth forms. I assure the House of my determination to see good sixth forms continue. Whether under local authority control or in the grant-maintained sector, proposals for the opening of new sixth forms and the closure of existing sixth forms already have to come to me for approval. I shall use the powers available to me to ensure that sixth forms thrive, and to encourage choice between schools and colleges wherever possible.<br/>
This new sector of education will have a great deal to offer our young people. Indeed, it is the education and training of our 16 to 19-year-olds which will be at the heart of a White Paper which will come jointly from my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State for Employment and myself in due course. That White Paper will contain further details of the proposals that I have just described. I believe that the proposals will be widely welcomed by all sections of the community, especially those which have always sought to further the interests of further education in Britain. I commend the proposals to the House.<br/>
<i>Following are details of the measures:</i>
<q>The Government propose to introduce legislation this autumn to form an independent sector of post-16 education fromApril 1993. All further education colleges, maintained or

assisted by a local education authority, offering full-time education, including tertiary colleges, and all sixth form colleges, that is maintained schools which normally provide education only for pupils who have attained the age of 16, will be taken out of local authority control. They will be funded directly by the Government through a new council appointed by and responsible to the Secretary of State. New sixth form colleges and further education colleges, including tertiary colleges, which are established after this announcement will also be funded through the new council, including any grant-maintained sixth form colleges.</q>
<q>Institutions in the new sector, apart from volutary sixth form colleges, will be free-standing corporate bodies, and will be vested with the land, buildings and plant which are currently used by them. I intend to seek Parliament's approval to legislation which requires the specific consent of the Secretary of State for all disposals by local education authorities of land or interests in land, including buildings, used or held or obtained for or in connection with the purposes of the institutions. I shall seek similar powers to ensure that the LEA's interest in any land, including buildings, used or held or obtained for or in connection with the purposes of a voluntary sixth form college are not disposed of without the specific consent of the Secretary of State and that the LEA conveys its interest in these to the trustees of the school.</q>
<q>The disposals of land or interests in land requiring the consent of the Secretary of State will include outright sale, granting or otherwise disposing of any leasehold or other interest in land, direct sale and leaseback, any mortgage or other charge designed to raise capital on the security of the land. It will also include any disposal which is made in return for the supply of goods or services. In referring to disposals I include entering into any binding obligation to make a disposal of the kind in question.</q>
<q>To ease the interim period before the establishment of the new sector, I am concerned that local authorities should not enter into contracts which bind the colleges beyond 1 April 1993 when they begin to manage their own affairs. Such contracts should be entered into only with the specific consent of the governing bodies of the institutions affected. Contracts for a consideration having a value in excess of &#x00A3;50,000 will in addition require the consent of the Secretary of State. The forthcoming legislation will seek Parliament's approval to a measure having this purpose.</q>
<q>I shall also seek Parliament's approval for appropriate sanctions where consent has not been obtained in advance. With the disposal of land or interests in land without the consent of the Secretary of State, there will be a power of compulsory purchase with a right of recovery from the local authority of any compensation payable. In the case of contracts, including contracts for disposal, entered into without the consent of the governing body concerned or, where applicable, the consent of the Secretary of State, there will be a right of repudiation, and such repudiation will be deemed to be a repudiation by the relevant local authority, so that any liability in damages will remain with the relevant local authority.</q>
<q>I shall seek the approval of Parliament for these two measures to have effect from midnight tonight. This statement does not affect enforceable obligations entered into before midnight tonight.</q></p>

<p>As the timing of the statement so exquisitely demonstrates, the Secretary of State's announcement has been motivated by nothing whatever to do with the needs of the education service. Instead, it has simply been dictated by the Government's blind poll tax panic. The right hon. and learned Gentleman comes to the House this afternoon not as Secretary of State for Education but simply as the Environment Secretary's subordinate.<br/>
The whole House will be delighted that the Secretary of State has at last noticed, after 12 years of Conservative government, that
<q>we still lag behind our competitors in the participation of our school leavers in further education".</q>


That is a major admission by the Secretary of State of 12 years of Conservative failure&#x2014;12 years in which the share of Britain's national wealth devoted to education has fallen, while almost all our major competitors have invested more and have had far better results in their education and training services.<br/>
Is not it typical of this Government that, faced with the yawning education and training deficit between the United Kingdom and its major competitors, the only solution that Ministers can find is to set up a centralising bureaucracy, establish a new national quango and deny local people both a voice and choice? The Secretary of State could adduce no evidence whatever to back his claims of a lack of responsiveness to the needs of 16 to 19-year-olds among either further education colleges or local education authorities. The problems that colleges and LEAs have faced were imposed on them by central Government and central Government alone.<br/>
Does not the Secretary of State realise that the major problems in increasing opportunity and choice at 16-plus are educational, not bureaucratic? Does he realise that there is an urgent need, as Her Majesty's inspectorate said, to end the jungle of qualifications, with over 200 examining boards for those between 16 and 19? Does he realise that instead we must establish a coherent, unified system of 16 to 19 examinations? The statement said riot a word about that. Instead, the Secretary of State has blighted all chances of sensible reform of examinations for those between 16 and 19.<br/>
Does not the Secretary of State also understand that there is the widest support for setting clear national and local targets for improvement in participation rates for 16 to 19-year-olds, as the Labour party has proposed? That sensible reform, backed by both the Confederation of British Industry and the Trades Union Congress, has been rejected out of hand by the Secretary of State's friend, the Employment Secretary.<br/>
Will the Secretary of State confirm that, despite what he says, his proposals will place school sixth forms at risk and in financial limbo, with less financial support than sixth forms in further education colleges? What will be the position of both church schools with sixth forms and voluntary-aided sixth form and further education colleges? What guarantees does the Secretary of State give about the future of adult and community education, especially where that provision is contained within existing further education colleges?<br/>
Although one understands&#x2014;especially in view of his record in the health service&#x2014;the Secretary of State's profound contempt for those who are locally elected to represent their communities, and his desire to place all institutions under quangos appointed by him, what planning or strategic role will local education authorities have in respect of planning 16 to 19 provision?<br/>
Nothing has caused greater resentment or loss of efficiency in the education service or greater unpopularity for the Government than piling one hasty and impulsive change after another on the service. Has anyone told the Secretary of State that the last major changes in further education took effect only 11 months ago and have yet to be established? Those changes were made under the Education Reform Act 1988 and, in commending them to the House, the former Minister of State for Education and Science, the right hon. Member for Mitcham and Morden (Mrs. Rumbold), praised the work of local education authorities. Given the ghastly mess that the Government

have made in education and on the poll tax through impulsive decisions taken without proper consultation and consent, would not it be sensible for the Secretary of State to consult those who run 16 to 19 education, those in colleges and schools and the public, before seeking to ram these ill-considered and hasty proposals through the House?</p>

<p>My hon. Friends and I have been working for some time on these further education proposals and I commend them to the House for education reasons. I have met principals of further education colleges who have pressed me to be allowed to have the independence from local government that we are now giving them. Our proposals will be widely welcomed in the world of education, especially by those in further education colleges, tertiary colleges and sixth form colleges which concentrate on 16 to 19-year-old provision.<br/>
The hon. Member for Blackburn (Mr. Straw) comes in as a little Sir Echo from our debate on the previous statement and tries to imitate his colleagues in their exchanges on the poll tax when he should be addressing the education issues that are involved. When he goes outside he will find that my proposals are welcomed by those in education whose advice he should heed.<br/>
Secondly, I am not taking anything under central control, but I am taking colleges out of local government control. The body that we are setting up is a funding council which will distribute the funds and will bear in mind quality that is assessed as I have described. It will otherwise leave the management of the colleges to themselves. Colleges will be free to spend the money and the funding regime will ensure that they increase the participation of students and improve their efficiency at the same time, exactly as the polytechnics have done.<br/>
That is modelled on the freedom that we gave to polytechnics in 1989. Polytechnics are not controlled centrally by me, although funds are distributed to them by a funding council. Polytechnics are brilliantly successful in increasing the participation of students in higher education, and we have seen 36,000 more students this year alone. They are at the same time increasing efficiency and maintaining excellent academic standards. Therefore, removing from local government control those responsible for higher and further education institutions which want to be entrepreneurial and to expand opportunities for young people is a good education policy which the hon. Gentleman should not oppose.<br/>
The hon. Member for Blackburn made rather strange remarks about funding having more to do with this. He knows that we spend a higher percentage of our GNP on education than do most of our competitors, and that spending per pupil in this country has gone up by 40 per cent. He was right in what he said about the jungle of qualifications for 16 to 19-year-olds. We are already addressing that with the help of the National Council for Vocational Qualifications which we have set up. My right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State for Employment and I are closely addressing that matter and some of the others that the hon. Gentleman mentioned. We shall shortly produce a White Paper setting out better opportunities for young people which will include further clarification of qualifications.<br/>
I have already said that I shall use my powers to protect sixth forms and certainly good sixth forms which are of benefit to the schools to which they are attached. Parents


would also like to have local choice of sixth forms. Voluntary-aided sixth form colleges will be affected by my proposals. They will acquire the new status and join the new sector and I have today written to people in the churches involved to set up a way to have discussions about the mechanics.<br/>
Adult education presently carried out and delivered by colleges will also be covered by the proposals and the funding arrangements that I have described. Details on that will be contained in the White Paper. My statement should be addressed by the hon. Member for Blackburn in his capacity as spokesman for the Opposition on education matters. If he addresses it objectively and uses educational judgments, he will welcome and commend my proposals.</p>

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. This is a serious point of order, not an attempt to interrupt the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth (Mr. Pawsey).<br/>
A written statement was issued to hon. Members when the Secretary of State started to give details of his proposals. The Secretary of State said that from midnight tonight he would take certain action to prevent local education authorities from entering into arrangements with further education colleges. In the written statement issued to hon. Members, the Secretary of State says that he will not seek legislative powers to do that until the autumn. That seems to pre-empt a decision of the House in relation to the Secretary of State taking powers. Is it in order for a Secretary of State to implement proposals from midnight when he has no statutory right to do so and will not have such a right until the legislation is passed by the House in the autumn?</p>

<p>This is serious, Mr. Speaker. I am speaking about what is contained in the written statement that accompanied the oral statement by the Secretary of State. He has said that from midnight he is implementing proposals which will be contained in legislation in the autumn. As I have said, that pre-empts a decision of the House and I seek a judgment from you, Mr. Speaker, on the powers under which the Secretary of State proposes to do that. Is what he is doing ultra vires, because the House has not given him the necessary power?</p>

<p>Further to that point of order, Mr. Speaker. What I have announced is well precedented. My statement had to contain details towards the end about what I proposed because I was announcing to the House that certain measures would take effect from midnight tonight and that I would later seek parliamentary approval for those steps. That was done when polytechnics were given independence and it is frequently done for changes in taxation and for changes in regimes of this kind. It is to make sure that from midnight tonight local authorities will not be tempted to strip assets, sell land or enter into contracts.</p>

<p>Once again the Secretary of State has managed to remove an element of local democracy without, as he admitted himself, tackling the problems of confusion or underfunding in this sector. Can he confirm that local people from whom power has been removed will see no financial benefit, as it is his intention to achieve the change entirely by removing Government grant without allowing any fall in local spending? Conservative Members who have argued for the centralisation of education are now faced with a measure of that centralisation, hut with none of its expected benefits.<br/>
Can the right hon. and learned Gentleman explain to local people how they are to fare in future? In Truro, for instance, there is a proposal for a tertiary college on which we had expected a decision by the Minister next week. How are we to proceed? Is everything to come to a grinding halt until the Minister has published the White Paper and passed the legislation?</p>

<p>The management of local further education colleges and polytechnics was not usually directly affected in the past by local democracy. They were not at the heart of the red meat of local politics&#x2014;indeed, the sector was sadly neglected. Tertiary education achieves a great deal, but it has never attracted the degree of attention that it deserves. The test of whether it is anti democratic is to talk to some of the principals of the polytechnics. So far I have not found any lecturer in or principal of a polytechnic&#x2014;including a number of the classic left-wing, bearded variety&#x2014;who believes that it is a good idea to go back to local government control. Such people have been liberated by the change and have acquired, not lost, freedom. That is what will happen to colleges under my proposals. In the White Paper we shall deal with the details of how new colleges are to develop, but I expect that we shall adopt a system in which the funding council will make proposals of that sort to me.</p>

<p>Is my right hon. and learned Friend looking to members of the training and enterprise councils automatically to become governors of colleges of further education?

<p>The answer to the first point is certainly yes. I would expect a member of the local TEC invariably to become a member of the governing body of these institutions. We are not talking about opting for the new status, because at the moment schools under local authority control can opt for grant-maintained status&#x2014;although curiously further education colleges do not have

that choice. So they do not have a natural constituency that we can ballot; their populations are more transitional; so the parent body is not so closely connected with them.<br/>

<p>The real danger of the Secretary of State's proposals is that they will entrench the division between sixth form FE colleges and sixth form colleges. The flaw in our secondary education system has always been the divide between the academic and the vocational, and these proposals will deepen that divide. We need to train all our young people together in a system in which vocational work and academic work are equally respected. This change will be destructive and will further entrench the divide.</p>

<p>I assure the hon. Lady that I share her concern not to deepen that divide. My colleagues and I are working to ensure that vocational education acquires the same status as academic education, so that there are no artificial divisions between them. Sixth form colleges will enter the new sector as a result of my announcement. They tend to concentrate on traditional academic courses, so many of the young people in the colleges that I am talking about will study, for instance, for A-levels; but many others will be doing vocational courses. I do not believe that she is correct to suspect that the proposals will widen the divide.</p>

We shall have to consider ways in which the new funding council can make proposals to us for opening new colleges

<p>Will the Secretary of State hesitate before proceeding rapidly on this course until he has considered the view that many people, bearded or otherwise, may express? It is that there is likely to be an excess of centralisation and a greater degree of bureaucracy. Whatever he may say, there will certainly be great anxiety in successful sixth forms.

<p>The universities receive their funds from the Universities Funding Council and are not centralised under the control of central Government. The polytechnics and higher education colleges receive their funds from a funding council and are not under my control or over-centralised. The same will apply to the new sector. The desirable pattern for education is not detailed control by either local or central government. More power should be devolved and delegated and responsibility for and control over funds go to those who work in the institutions themselves and serve on their governing bodies. That is the pattern that we are following.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman says that we should not rush into it, but it is necessary to make an announcement and to outline the provisions that will come into effect from midnight tonight simply to ensure that certain local authorities do not start apostating. We have much experience&#x2014;<i>[Interruption.]</i> The hon. Member for Newham, South (Mr. Spearing) is protesting but his hon. Friend the Member for Newham, North-West (Mr. Banks) should know that we had to take that measure when the Greater London council began to take similar steps immediately after we announced that we would abolish it.<br/>
We are still sorting out problems in the case of the polytechnics. Only a week ago I met a principal who said that his local authority had accepted that the polytechnic

now owned the building but still insisted that it owned the grass in front of the building. Such disputes exist throughout the country. Had we not made such arrangements, I am sure that great pressure would be put on many colleges to enter into long-term contracts, binding them to their local authority, and their assets would be clawed back into local authority control. All the tricks of the trade, which many local authorities know only too well, would be used to keep their bureaucratic empires intact.</p>

Will my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State follow through the logic of his statement and consider the position of school sixth forms? Would not it be right for high schools and secondary schools to have arrangements made for them similar to those that he has announced for non-advanced and advanced further education and tertiary colleges?</p>

<p>I am sure that the opinion of those involved with Ealing higher education college is shared by everyone in higher education colleges that have been given their independence. Whereas at present we are offering to secondary schools, including those with sixth forms, the opportunity to seek grant-maintained status, the first step is that the local management of all schools will be placed in the hands of the governors and the head teachers shortly, with 85 per cent. of the schools' budgets under their control by 1993. Beyond that, the best will rapidly move to full grant-maintained status, with 100 per cent. of their budgets under their control and comparative freedom and autonomy from local authority control.<br/>
Thus, a parallel course is already set out. The pace at which schools are choosing grant-maintained status is accelerating at a remarkable rate, even in the few months that I have been in office.</p>

In what ways does the Secretary of State intend to enhance the relationship of adult and continued education with the further education sector?

<p>I will not debate the history with the hon. Gentleman, but the system of education that grew up did so rather by accident. The Education Act 1944 did not even impose a duty on local education authorities to provide schools. It was a matter of chance that they grew

up as they did. We reached the position where every school was under the detailed, day-to-day management of local authorities&#x2014;some good, some not so good and some bad. My preferred method of management is one that distributes the money by a fair method and retains some ability to monitor standards, but puts the day-to-day responsibility firmly in the hands of the principal, head teacher or governing body&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>

As for the proportion of local government spending, &#x00A3;2 billion will be affected by my announcement today. Off the cuff, I believe that the total local government spending on education is about &#x00A3;17 billion.

<p>When making this welcome statement my right hon. and learned Friend was right to ignore the advice of the hon. Member for Newham, North-West (Mr. Banks), whose asset-stripping instincts were in keeping with the old activities of the Inner London education authority, which laid to waste academic standards throughout London.<br/>
The statement is particularly welcome to me. My right hon. and learned Friend knows that Esher sixth form college in my constituency was already considering applying for grant-maintained status, which shows that the system has been running longer than the hon. Member for Blackburn (Mr. Straw) suggested. That sixth form college was worried that it might have been alone, if it were one of the first and only ones to have applied for grant-maintained status. The proposals give a structure to post-16 education which is extremely welcome. I hope that my right hon. and learned Friend will now turn his attention to items such as inter-authority transfers, which sixth form colleges thought worked badly against them when attracting pupils from out of their areas.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend's sixth form college will no longer be unique in its independence, but I am sure that it will be one of the best in the new sector. The problem of inter-authority transfers and their financing will disappear almost completely. The financing of the colleges will depend, first, on core funding, based on planning and judgments of quality by the funding council, then on their success in attracting young people from wherever in the surrounding area to come to good quality courses. That is a much better way of financing the expansion of colleges such as that in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Esher (Mr. Taylor).<br/>
I am grateful to my hon. Friend for reminding me of the Labour party's passionate defence of ILEA, that singularly useless and unlamented education body that used to control London. The only Labour education policy is the defence of bureaucracy and the dead hand of local government on the day-to-day management of schools.</p>

There is something sinister about a Government who take power away from people in local democracy and put it under the Government's jackboot. Unlike my hon.

If such a promise appears in the next Labour party manifesto, I promise the hon.

It is symptomatic of the way in which many of the left-wingers with whom I have to deal in local education authorities behave.

<p>May I ask my right hon. and learned Friend about administrators and advisers who exist within the education departments of county councils? How will he ease the passage of reducing their numbers, which must clearly be done if their responsibility is taken away? After the removal of polytechnics from the control of education authorities, how many advisers and administrators were saved? That is a serious question and I hope that my right hon. and learned Friend will answer it. I know that Dorset county council already has some worries about losing various schools that want to opt out and reducing the burden of those administrators. Nothing will be saved unless those administrators move elsewhere or sell their services, thus taking the burden of expense away from the local taxpayer.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend makes a valuable point. The changes that we have made, and the steady change to enabling authorities, gives local authorities the opportunity greatly to reduce their central staff, thereby reducing the burden on the community charge payer. I cannot give an off-the-cuff answer on Dorset, but the numbers of advisers should be reduced as a result of the decision that I have announced. Local education authorities are large enough to redeploy those people as they move from those duties. Far too many local authorities do not adequately reduce their central administration, even when they lose responsibilities. I shall not comment on Dorset&#x2014;it is far away&#x2014;but my local authority shows signs of having grown like Topsy for many years. Nottinghamshire combines extravagance and sometimes incompetence with poor supervision of its education services.</p>

<p>Does the Secretary of State recognise that the most important element of his statement is the acknowledgement that after 12 years of this Government we still lag behind other countries in education and training for 16 to 19-year-olds? Does not that show the Government's failure in providing for our young people?<br/>
Does the Secretary of State recognise that his statement will cause much anxiety among schools that have sixth forms? How will he use what he called his "additional powers" to protect and secure the future of sixth forms?<br/>
What is likely to happen to free-standing adult education centres? The Secretary of State did not refer to adult education centres in his statement, but in response to a question he said that they will be included under the funding council. Is that the intention, is the right hon. and learned Gentleman mistaken or must he obtain that information from the Minister of State? If so, will he give it to the House?<br/>
Does the Secretary of State recognise that adult education, which is important to thousands of people, will be put at risk by the statement and by the Government's approach to funding?<br/>
All hon. Members recognise the need for a statement on an integrated approach to the education and training of 16 to 19-year-olds. It would have had more credence if the Secretary of State had made that statement first and the institutional reforms had flowed from it, but the education arguments are to be advanced second and the institutional arguments to be made first. That is final confirmation and evidence that the statement is not about education but about the chaos that has been created by the poll tax.</p>

<p>The proportion of our young people in higher and further education is increasing dramatically. I agree that we are behind many of our competitors, but we are catching them fast and making up for past deficiencies in the service. The number of students in polytechnics and higher education colleges is 54 per cent. higher&#x2014;more than half as many again as when the Government took office.<br/>
I expressed the importance that I attach to keeping good sixth forms and to giving parents the choice of a good sixth form where possible. My existing powers will enable me to protect sixth forms because any proposal to open or close one will continue to need my consent and because we can bear in mind the needs of sixth forms when constructing the standard spending assessments in the equalisation measures necessary to distribute grants to local authorities. We can thereby consider the weighting to be given to post-16 pupils.<br/>
I did not say that adult education colleges&#x2014;free-standing institutions that deliver solely adult education&#x2014;would be covered by my statement, but that the adult education responsibilities of an FE college would be considered. The details of the provision for adult education were addressed in the White Paper, and nothing that I have announced will diminish the opportunities for adult education.<br/>
The hon. Member for Leeds, Central (Mr. Fatchett) came near to welcoming the proposal of my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State for Employment and myself for a comprehensive statement of policy on 16 to 19-year-olds. He is quite wrong in believing that my announcement today is inconsistent with such a statement. As I keep pointing out to him and to the hon. Member for Blackburn, they are obsessed with the structures. It is extraordinary that they are most shocked by the idea that colleges should be taken away from their friends in local government. The people about whom we are all concerned will benefit from our giving colleges the independence that I have announced today.</p>

<p>With permission, Mr. Speaker, I should like to make a statement on local government in Wales.<br/>
The Government have already explained to the House our new arrangements for further reductions in community charges. The people of Wales will be delighted to know that, although average charges in Wales were substantially lower than elsewhere in Britain, I have been able to secure exactly the same reductions as those offered to English and Scottish charge payers: Welsh charging authorities will reduce all charges by &#x00A3;140, and Wales will receive &#x00A3;300 million in additional resources.<br/>
The remarkable consequence is that, taken with my announcement last January on the community charge reduction scheme, the average charge in Wales before the award of community charge benefit will be &#x00A3;95. As nearly &#x00A3;1,170 per charge payer will be spent by Welsh local authorities in the forthcoming year, it is an astonishing good deal for Wales.<br/>
We abolished domestic rates and we intend, from the earliest possible moment, to abolish the community charge and replace it with a new local tax that will be linked to two essential elements of a household&#x2014;the number of adults, and the value of the property. I propose to consult in Wales on the basis of that proposal. I should make it absolutely clear that I am prepared to consider a system whereby the balance between the two elements&#x2014;the property element and the element attributed to residents&#x2014;may be different in Wales from that elsewhere. That balance, and other matters, will be the subject of consultation. I look forward to receiving the views of hon. Members, among others, and I very much hope that the Opposition can be persuaded to make a constructive contribution to the debate.<br/>
I have received representations from Opposition Members and from the local authority associations that we should move towards a system of unitary authorities in Wales. I can see some advantages in such a structure, but before I could commend any new system to the House I would need to be satisfied that whatever is proposed represents the best deal possible for the people of Wales.<br/>
In reaching conclusions on that matter, I must pay particular regard to the views of the local authority associations. Both associations have pressed on me the case for unitary authorities, but as yet there is no agreement between them on the appropriate size or number of authorities. I have suggested that they should seek to establish common ground on the future structure of Welsh local government. I am therefore pleased to hear that they will meet on 5 April to consider that further, and I have informed the chairman of each association that I shall not reach final decisions until I have had the benefit of further discussions with them following that meeting.<br/>
I should, however, like to make two further points. First, community councils play an important role, especially in rural areas, and I shall need to consider the merits of any proposals for change. Secondly, I shall consult on how the decision-making process of local authorities can be improved. I shall try to build on the excellent work that Welsh authorities are undertaking with the efficiency initiative.<br/>
We must look at the problems of finance, functions and structure together. No institution, even one as important as local government, can remain unchanged for ever. I shall consider whether the present range of local government functions is appropriate and what should be the balance between central and local responsibility.<br/>
In that context, I can tell the House that I intend that the further education and sixth form colleges in Wales should become independent from their local authorities from 1 April 1993. The legislation which we will introduce for Parliament's approval will provide for the colleges to become independent corporations, owning their own assets and employing their own staff.<br/>
The colleges play a vital role in producing the well-educated and well-trained labour force which Wales needs. They will work closely with the training and enterprise councils. The colleges could, however, increase their contribution still further by recruiting more young people to their courses. The proposals which will be set out in the White Paper to be published shortly will give further details of how that can be achieved.<br/>
I intend establishing a Wales funding council through which the colleges will be funded. The council will be appointed by, and be responsible to, me. It is my intention that the land, buildings and plant currently used by the colleges should be vested in them on incorporation. The arrangements which my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State for Education and Science has said will be included in the legislation requiring local authorities to obtain specific consent for the disposal of assets currently used by the colleges will apply to local authorities in Wales; so too will the measure he referred to preventing local authorities from entering into contracts which bind the colleges beyond 1 April 1993. As in England, these measures will be effective in Wales from midnight tonight, subject to Parliament's approval of the legislation.<br/>
Further details of these measures are in the statement which my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State for Education and Science placed in the <i>Official Report</i> today. My Department will write to all local education authorities in Wales to explain how those measures will be applied.<br/>
It is now in the interests of the whole of Wales that we create a lasting framework for local government to provide high-quality services effectively and efficiently. That is a goal to which we can all aspire.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister said on Tuesday that we would get the details today, but the outcome of the Government's four-month review is a statement of dithering, delay and indecision. We still have no details or answers. Today's statement simply leaves Wales with many questions. How will the new system work? Will it be fair? How much will it cost? Will it improve local accountability? Will it improve local democracy? Will it improve the standard of local services? People in Wales do not just want a reduction in their bills; they want the poll tax to end. The statement will not give them that. In effect, the poll tax lives on.<br/>
Does the Secretary of State remember criticising the Labour party at the Conservative party's annual conference when, referring to the Labour party, he said:
<q>The party that loves tax wants two taxes to replace one, a twin tax torture for local people and a double disaster for responsible spending"?</q>


Does not the statement in some respects show that the right hon. Gentleman has gone for a triple tax torture&#x2014;a property tax, a 2&#x00B7;5 per cent. VAT increase and a poll tax? Again, the poll tax remains for the people of Wales.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman boasts of the huge sums of money which he is throwing at the problem of the poll tax, but are not the Government bribing the people of Wales with their own VAT money? Is it not incredible to hear the right hon. Gentleman seeking plaudits for lessening the poll tax pain when he himself approved that hated tax? Did he not gain promotion to Cabinet by his devoted service to the poll tax? Never before in the history of local government in Wales has a Minister presided over such chaos.<br/>
Swansea city council has sent out 145,000 poll tax demands; Ceredigion council has filled its vaults with tens of thousands of printed, and now useless, demands; and our capital city of Cardiff has sent out its poll tax demands. This shambles invites nothing but contempt from the dedicated professionals in the Welsh local authorities, and the Secretary of State must carry responsibility for this chaos. I know of no Welsh Office Minister who has presided over such a humiliation. Is not an apology owed to the people and councils of Wales? I ask the right hon. Gentleman to give that apology here and now.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman mentioned structure and functions. He proposed consultation with local authority associations. That will create bitterness. I issue the right hon. Gentleman a warning: do not tamper carelessly with our education service. Does the right hon. Gentleman know that parents and teachers are weary of the upheavals and constant ideological changes? His proposal to make sixth form colleges independent of their LEAs is lamentable.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman mentioned the Opposition parties and consultation. The Labour party is interested in co-operation, but on the basis of ruling out the poll tax now and ruling in an efficient system of property tax, charged according to the ability to pay. The right hon. Gentleman's statement does not change the position one jot. Does he truly believe in consultation? For example, did he consult with the LEAs on sixth form colleges, or is it a diktat?<br/>
The statement represents the final act of a Government gripped by poll tax panic, ready to throw local government into chaos in one last desperate bid to save their political skin. It will not work and it will not wash. To use the Prime Minister's phrase, it is a "bogus sham".</p>

<p>I wish to move swiftly to answer seven points. First, there is a paradox in what the hon. Gentleman said. On the one hand, he accused me of delay and, on the other, he said that I acted too speedily and was arrogant. If he will reflect, he will see that the people guilty of delay are on the Labour Benches&#x2014;they are still failing to publish details of their proposals.<br/>
Secondly, the hon. Gentleman said that we now have two taxes to replace one. He quoted what I said. I was referring to the marvellous document "Local Services, Local Choices, Local Tax: Labour's approach to the Poll Tax". That document states:
<q>A combination of a reformed property tax and a local income tax would bring equity, flexibility, accountability and stability to local government finance.</q>
The document is dated September 1988. I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman wrote that, but he is just the sort of person to whom I am referring.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman now refers to the Labour party's fair rates document. That document, entitled "Fair Rates: Labour's Alternative to the Poll Tax", is one of 67 different documents and statements from the Labour party that I have had the privilege of seeing in the past few years. It says:
<q>The existing rates registers will provide a quick and convenient means of getting rid of the poll tax.</q>
Fine. So what does the Labour party think about rates? [HON. MEMBERS: "Answer the question."] I will answer all the questions, but I want the hon. Member for Alyn and Deeside (Mr. Jones) to reflect on this. A news release issued by the Labour party's press and publicity department has fallen into my hands. On Saturday 20 September 1980, Neil Kinnock spoke at Pontllanfraith, Gwent. [HON. MEMBERS: "Who?"] The news release says&#x2014;[HON.

<p>Despite his delaying tactics, I ask the hon. Member for Bridgend (Mr. Griffiths) to listen to what was said by his right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition, who criticised my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for the Environment for increases in
<q>the most unjust of all taxes".</q>
What tax does the right hon. Gentleman describe as the most unjust of all&#x2014;"Local rates", the very system that the Labour party proposes to use,
<q>which take most from those who can afford least.</q>
Perhaps the Leader of the Opposition will eat his words. <i>[Interruption.]</i> Opposition Members ought to listen. The Leader of the Opposition will either have to eat his words or come up with yet another policy.<br/>
The hon. Member for Alyn and Deeside, describing my proposals, which are one tax, accused me of bribery. I apologise here and now for the record amount of extra money that I have won for Wales in the resources that I am able to announce to the House.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman's fourth point was that I had created chaos because of the present billing procedures. After ringing round all the authorities, we have discovered that only 13 of the 37 charging authorities in Wales have started billing. I make it absolutely clear here and now that the Government will provide any additional costs that our announcement has necessitated, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will join forces with the Government in pushing through legislation as quickly as possible to bring about a reduction of &#x00A3;140.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman then said that independence for further education colleges was a lamentable proposition.</p>

<p>I thank the Secretary of State for meeting my hon. Friends and me in consultation some days ago. I warmly welcome the commitment to unitary authorities, which will benefit Wales, and also the decision to consult on how that should be achieved. I also urge the Secretary of State to give community councils in Wales more responsibility. They should be obliged to take those responsibilities and should not be allowed to opt out of doing so, because they have a considerable contribution to make.<br/>
Will the Secretary of State explain to a puzzled Welsh population why he&#x2014;the person who, just over a year ago, described the poll tax as being central to the vision behind which all Conservatives could unite&#x2014;has now changed his mind? Could it be that he stopped at Ribble Valley for a cup of tea on his way to Damascus? In particular, will he explain why he rejected the notion of a local income tax, which all those Welsh Members who took the trouble to meet him were united in recommending?<br/>
Will the Secretary of State join me in praising Powys county council for its considerable success in creating

Coleg Powys, which is an excellent college of further education, and will he assure us that that institution will continue&#x2014;albeit perhaps under other governance?<br/>
Finally, will the Secretary of State assure the House that he will do his best to preserve the good sixth forms and comprehensive schools that exist in rural Wales?</p>

<p>I appreciate the comments of the hon. and learned Member about consultation. The Labour party ought to reconsider its inflexible stance and stop hurling party political invective and insults. The people of Wales do not understand why the Labour party is the only political party in Wales that refuses to discuss its proposals with me. I believe that that is because those proposals will not stand the test of cross-examination. I promise the hon. Member for Alyn and Deeside that, if he wants to avoid cross-examination, I am quite prepared to listen to him, without interrupting or asking fundamental questions. I am prepared to meet the hon. Gentleman anywhere in Wales. I would merely ask him not to continue to impose new preconditions on consultation, but to get round the table with the rest of us to work out a solution that will endure for generations to come.<br/>
I confirm that Coleg Powys will be given independence under my announcement, and the move will be widely welcomed among the other 30 further education establishments.<br/>
I recognise the importance of the community councils, and find myself in agreement with all but three of the propositions voiced by the hon. and learned Gentleman.</p>

<p>I join in the congratulations that have been offered to my right hon. Friend on achieving the same reduction in the community charge for Wales as for England. Will he take this a step further and adopt England's community charge reduction scheme, which is much fairer and will remove such absurd anomalies as have occurred as betwen Rhyl and Prestatyn? Is he aware that the only time the Select Committee on Welsh Affairs&#x2014;with Members of all four political parties&#x2014;ever broke into unanimous applause was when a witness passionately put forward the case for unitary authorities? Is he aware that there will be wide support for the policy of moving towards unitary local government in Wales? Thank God the word "devolved" was used by a Government Front-Bench Member today. Will he consider the need for a tier of government covering the whole of Wales? In my view, that should be a Welsh assembly or senate.</p>

<p>I appreciate my hon. Friend's comments, I realise that he has very strong views about transitional relief and about the community charge reduction scheme. He has made those views very clear to me in private and in this Chamber. The reduction of &#x00A3;140 applies to every community charge payer in Wales. That will mean a drop of 55 per cent. in community charge bills, whereas in England the figure is 35 per cent.<br/>
My hon. Friend raised the question of a Welsh assembly. The local authorities association and others have pressed upon me the case for such an assembly to perform executive functions in the Principality. I have not reached a final decision on this question, but I have to say that the suggestions that have been put to me pose very considerable problems, not least because of the uncertainties and ambiguities about the respective responsibilities of the Secretary of State and of the


assembly and about the powers of the assembly. I am not at present persuaded that the creation of an assembly along these lines would be in the best interests of the people of Wales.</p>

<p>Does the Secretary of State appreciate that it was a Conservative Government who reorganised local government in 1972, causing administrative chaos? In financial terms, it just about broke the Bank of England. What the right hon. Gentleman has said today suggests that the Government intend to try to repeat that exercise. Why does not he realise that the Conservative party is unrepresentative of the people of Wales? To realise how unrepresentative, he has only to look behind him.

Replying for the Government on a debate on local government finance on 25 July 1989, he referred to the Opposition's amendment to the motion:
<q>It says that the community charge is unfair, bureaucratic and difficult to collect."&#x2014;[<i>Official Report,</i> 25 July 1989; Vol. 157, c. 901.]</q>
We all know that the right hon. Gentleman is a "Heseltini". In his statement this afternoon, the Secretary of State for the Environment said that we must alter the system so that it will be possible to collect the tax without difficulty. The Secretary of State would be wise to reread what he said and, perhaps, make a further statement. The poll tax payers in the Garw valley are jubilant because they will not have to pay anything if they get a rebate of &#x00A3;140. The poll tax figure there is &#x00A3;137, so they wonder whether they will get a refund of &#x00A3;3. <i>[Interruption.]</i></p>

<p>Now we know why the Labour party is in such chaos over these proposals. The comment that I repeated was made not only by the leader of the party. The hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett), who is the party's spokesman on local government, said of a local income tax:
<q>I have been an advocate of this as an addition to&#x2014;not a replacement for&#x2014;the rating system for a long time.</q>
Those words are from the 16th of the 66 statements. No wonder we do not know what the Labour party stands for. The hon. Gentleman is fortunate not only to have more than one home but also to be able to expect a double dose of &#x00A3;140 in Westminster. The &#x00A3;140 comes off the community charge headline figure, not only in Wales but also in England.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman mentioned the Garw valley. Let me tell him that a lady from that area contacted my office and said, "Mr. Hunt, we all want you to come to the Garw valley and increase your popularity by distributing the money yourself." Sadly, there will be no refund, but people in the Garw valley will pay no community charge.</p>

<p>Is the Secretary of State aware of the very great welcome that we give to the ending of the poll tax? It is an iniquitous tax, and the people of Wales have wanted to see the end of it. However, we should have much preferred to see it replaced by a local income tax, and we have some doubts about the practicality of a head count in each household.<br/>
Will the Secretary of State, in the light of what has been said by the Secretary of State for the Environment, confirm that the local government commission for England that has been announced will have nothing to do with the situation in Wales? We in Wales have a tradition of doing these things ourselves. Does the right hon. Gentleman intend to set up a local government commission for Wales? He is considering the establishment of unitary authorities. This is something that appears to unite all four parties in Wales. Comments made by the hon. Member for Delyn (Mr. Raffan) a few moments ago suggest that there may be room for consensus also on the creation of an elected upon tier of democracy in Wales. If the Secretary of State were able to get representatives of the four parties together at this level, he would be doing a tremendous service for the people of Wales.</p>

<p>Those who argue for a local income tax have not thought through the implications of what they


propose. I am not persuaded that it is administratively feasible.

I assure the hon. Gentleman that I carefully thought through all the arguments that he put to me.<br/>
As for the commission, I agree with him that it is important for us to do these things ourselves in Wales. I was not proposing to set up a commission.

<p>The operation of the community charge has been remarkably successful in Wales compared with the

<p>It was apparent from the Secretary of State's announcement that, beyond saying that there would be a property tax with a poll tax element of some sort, he had little idea of precisely what we would end up with. In that connection, several questions must be answered. For example, will all houses in Wales be revalued? If they are revalued for the purpose of the new tax, will all house owners and tenants have the right to appeal against the new valuations?<br/>
Problems are likely to arise over the definition of "adult" in a household. The allowance for the number of people in a household may be as little as 1 per cent. Whatever the percentage, will any weighting be allowed for each adult, depending on whether they are or are not earning money? In other words, will there be a zero rating in that situation? Many other questions will have to be answered, but I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will answer those at this stage.<br/>

<p>The hon. Gentleman is a walking example of the fact that the Labour party should now rethink its whole approach to local government and come in and engage in the consultation process. Some of the questions that he asks are precisely those on which I shall now be consulting.<br/>
From the Labour party document on rates, it is clear that Labour Members have already decided that they will use the existing rates registers and will rely on them
<q>for as long as is needed to undertake a complete revaluation.</q>

<p>It is astonishing that the Secretary of State has not thought fit to apologise. He is claiming an alibi, though his fingerprints have been all over the poll tax from the start. Will someone in central Government, notably in the Cabinet, be surcharged for the cost to Swansea city council this week of sending out 140,000 poll tax bills? Someone is responsible for that and someone will have to pay. Will it be the taxpayer?<br/>
The new two-tier tax will require a head count. Will it involve a register analogous to that of the poll tax? Will that not involve the same sort of administrative costs and burdens as the poll tax? In Landore ward in my constituency, &#x00A3;7&#x00B7;40 will be the total charge for those with


full exemption under the poll tax system. It costs Swansea city council &#x00A3;11 to collect that sum. What is the Secretary of State's advice to that city council&#x2014;to collect or not to collect that &#x00A3;7&#x00B7;40?</p>

<p>Against a background where Wales&#x2014;I pay tribute to the local authority officials involved&#x2014;has achieved more or less the same collection rate as was achieved under the old rating system, I see no need to apologise. Indeed, there is need to praise local authorities in Wales for having achieved such a commendable result.<br/>
The question of collection is for the local council, and the hon. Member for Ogwr&#x2014;<i>[Interruption.]</i> The hon. Member who represents Ogwr, the hon. Member for Ogmore (Mr. Powell), will know the situation in Westminster, where apparently it is not thought to be worth collecting. The question of collection is for each individual council.<br/>
On the totality of what has been said, I wonder what the Labour party is so scared of. What is it so worried about that it will not follow the example of the Conservatives, Plaid Cymru and the Welsh Liberal Democrats? Are the Labour Members scared because they have not thought through their proposals and do not know the figures, and are not prepared, therefore, to put them on the table? They ought to be ashamed of themselves.</p>

<p>If the Secretary of State accepts my charitable assumption that the education changes that he has announced have more to do with education than with the survival of the Conservative party at the next general election, can he spell out what is wrong in his eyes with the present governance of the north-east Wales institute and its links with Clwyd county council? He must know that the county council was to spend &#x00A3;11 million on tertiary reorganisation. Who will provide that money now?</p>

<p>I made it absolutely clear that approximately &#x00A3;100 million is being spent in Wales on tertiary education. It is my intention to have the same amount of resources available for further education colleges and sixth form colleges. There are no problems on resources. The hon. Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek), who talks to me positively and constructively about problems in his area, should say to his hon. Friend the Member for Alyn and Deeside (Mr. Jones), "Go arid see the Welsh Secretary, just as all the others have done. Sit down and talk through the problem with him." The hon. Member for Alyn and Deeside cannot duck the issue of consultation any longer.</p>

<p>I listened carefully to the statement and to the questions. I am grateful to you, Mr. Speaker, for calling a Welsh-born Member who represents the English taxpayer. I cannot understand why my right hon. Friend, on the one hand, is saying that he is pleased to get rid of the community charge and, on the other, is making an enormous reduction in the bills. Will he be able to justify to the people of Wales doing away with a taxation system that would charge only &#x00A3;95 to someone in full work who could probably pay a great deal more? What will he put in its place? Because it is fair that

people in England should pay a particular percentage, should not exactly the same conditions apply in Wales in regard to the money given from central taxation?</p>

<p>I did make an apology before; the apology was for securing what has been described to me by some local authority leaders as an astonishingly excessive amount of Government support for local authority services in Wales. I plead guilty, but I will never stop fighting for the best possible deal for Wales. If it means that community charges in Wales come down by 55 per cent. whereas in England they come down by 35 per cent., I plead guilty, and I apologise to the House for winning too much money for Wales.<br/>
I see no reason why the introduction of a new system should lead to a reduction in resources for Wales. It did not do so when we introduced the community charge, and it should not if we decide to introduce a new system. The real question is, would the hon. Member for Alyn and Deeside win as much for Wales in a Labour Cabinet as I have done in a Conservative Cabinet?</p>

<speech hansard_id="791245" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1991-03-21a.461.1" hansard_membership_id="7549" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/17031" speakername="The Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Ian Lang)" colnum="461" time="19:10:00">
<p>With permission, Mr. Speaker, I wish to make a statement on the Government's community charge review as it affects Scotland.<br/>
These are our preliminary conclusions on local government finance, functions and structure, on which we will now have further and detailed consultation.<br/>
A vitally important part of our conclusions is the step change in central Government funding for local authorities announced by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer in his Budget statement on Tuesday. That is a major shift in the balance between central and local funding of local authority expenditure, and it recognises that the burden of local authority services has borne too heavily on the local tax base, not least because of the failure of local authorities to keep their spending at levels which it is reasonable to ask local taxpayers to support. For example, in the first year of the community charge, Scottish local authorities increased their budgets in real terms by 5 per cent. and, for the coming year, they have increased charge levels by an average of 30 per cent., despite a generous grant settlement. The Government have now tackled that aspect of the problem head on, by reducing local tax bills substantially.<br/>
We have nevertheless considered how best the reduced tax bill should be met, in a way which is fair, which is easy to administer, which spreads the burden as widely as possible, and which enables councils to remain accountable to their electors. As my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for the Environment has announced, we now propose to replace the community charge with a new local tax which will have elements based both on the value of the house and on the number of persons living there. We will be issuing a consultation paper on the new tax soon.<br/>
The details of the new tax and the options for the personal and property elements, and the relationship between them, will be set out in the consultation paper. For Scotland, that will take account of distinctive Scottish circumstances. I can reassure the House, however, that the new tax will not suffer from the defects of the old domestic rating system. Most obviously, it will take account of the number of people in the household. People will also, rightly, expect us to ensure that disproportionate tax burdens are not placed on a small minority of households and that there are no large fluctuations following periodic revaluations. There will also need to be effective transitional arrangements when the new tax is introduced, which we plan to be in 1993&#x2013;94 if possible, in Scotland as in England.<br/>
We will also ensure&#x2014;if need be through rigorous capping of local authorities' expenditure plans&#x2014;that the now reduced burden which local taxpayers will face is not increased once again to unacceptable levels by local authorities' spending decisions.<br/>
There is no change to the Government's policy on non-domestic rates, where we retain our aim of harmonising rates in Scotland with those in the rest of Great Britain.<br/>
It does not, however, make sense to look at the financing of local government in isolation from the functions which it discharges, and the burden thereby

placed on the local tax base. I shall be giving further consideration to the allocation of functions as between central and local government, and consulting on possible changes.<br/>
I have, however, already reached a view on the position of Scottish further education colleges, which have a vital role in meeting the skill requirement of industry and commerce. We wish to strengthen their ability to perform that role. Many local authorities have run further education colleges with commitment and skill, but we are entering a new era, both in local government and in vocational education and training. Following recent legislation, colleges now have increased management powers exercised by college councils, with a stronger employer representation; but I should like to see them have the appropriate degree of freedom to respond more fully to the demands of students and the labour market. I believe that, alongside the establishment of local enterprise companies in Scotland from 1 April, this would help to promote the development of a modern, skilled work force.<br/>
The Government propose, therefore, to introduce legislation at the earliest opportunity to take all further education colleges in Scotland out of local authority management. I intend to vest the colleges, which I propose should be free-standing corporate bodies, with the land, buildings and equipment which they currently use. From 1 April 1993, the colleges will be funded by the Government. I intend to give staff the right of transfer of employment to the Government-funded colleges. Over &#x00A3;200 million is spent by local authorities on further education in Scotland. These resources will become central spending, with the corresponding reduction in grant to local authorities.<br/>
My right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State for Education and Science has already highlighted the importance, prior to 1 April 1993, of ensuring that the work of the colleges, their staff and students continues undisturbed. Therefore, I also propose to seek Parliament's approval to a number of measures similar to those already announced by my right hon. and learned Friend to have effect from midnight tonight in the forthcoming legislation in order to achieve this. I am placing further details of these measures in the <i>Official Report.</i><br/>
My Department will be writing to all education authorities to explain how these measures will be applied. Details of our proposals will be published in due course.<br/>
It naturally flows from the consideration of funding and functions of local authorities, that we need to consider also the best structure for local government in Scotland. The present two-tier system has some advantages, but it also has some clear disadvantages. It blurs lines of accountability and it can lead to duplication, conflict and delay. It is often perceived as unnecessarily bureaucratic and remote from local needs.<br/>
The traditional role of local government is changing from provider to enabler. The structure must keep abreast of that change. I believe that we should now prepare to move to single-tier local authorities throughout Scotland. This will strengthen local accountability, and I believe that it will deliver local services more effectively. This is an important step to take and I envisage widespread consultation before proceeding to final decisions. I therefore propose to publish a consultative paper, setting out options for a new single-tier structure and seeking


views on possible functional changes and on options for improving the management and efficiency of local government in Scotland.<br/>
Since we announced our decision to review local government finance last December it has become clear that there is widespread demand for further change. The proposals that I have put forward today are, in the Government's view, a coherent and inter-related response affecting the funding, functions and structure of local government. They offer a basis for informed consultation and then durable change which, I hope, will command widespread support. I commend them to the House.<br/>
<i>Details of the measures are as follows:</i>
<q>The Government propose to introduce legislation this autumn by means of which, from April 1993, all further education colleges in Scotland, under the management of an education authority offering full-time education will be taken out of local authority control and will be funded by the Government. My Department will be writing to all education authorities to explain how these measures will be applied. Details will be published in due course.</q>
<q>Institutions in the new sector will be free-standing corporate bodies, and will be vested with the land, buildings and equipment which are currently used by them. It is important that, prior to April 1993, the work of the colleges, their staff and students continues undisturbed. I intend, therefore, to seek Parliament's approval to legislation which requires the specific consent of the Secretary of State for all disposals by local education authorities of land or interests in land, including buildings used or held or obtained for or in connection with the purposes of the colleges. This will also apply to disposals or removal of equipment.</q>
<q>The disposals of land or interests in land requiring the consent of the Secretary of State will include outright sale, feuing, granting or otherwise disposing of any leasehold or other interest in land, direct sale and leaseback, and any arrangement designed to raise capital on the security of the land. It will also include any disposal which is made in return for the supply of goods or services. In referring to disposals I include entering into any binding obligation to make a disposal of the kind in question.</q>
<q>I am also concerned that, in the interim period before the establishment of the new sector, local authorities should not enter into contracts which bind the colleges beyond 1 April 1993 when they begin to manage their own affairs. Such contracts should be entered into only with the specific consent of the college councils of the colleges affected. Contracts for a consideration having a value in excess of &#x00A3;50,000 will in addition require the consent of the Secretary of State. The forthcoming legislation will seek Parliament's approval to a measure having this purpose.</q>
<q>I shall also seek Parliament's approval for appropriate sanctions where property or equipment has been disposed of or removed or contracts entered into without obtaining consent in advance. In the case of the disposal of land or interests in land without the consent of the Secretary of State, there will be a power of compulsory purchase with a right of recovery from the local authority of any compensation payable. In the case of contracts, including contracts for disposal, entered into without the consent of the college council concerned or, where applicable, the consent of the Secretary of State, there will be a right of repudiation, and such repudiation will be deemed to be a repudiation by the relevant local authority, so that any liability in damages will remain with the relevant local authority.</q>
<q>I shall seek the approval of Parliament for these measures to have effect from midnight tonight. This statement does not affect enforceable obligations entered into before midnight tonight.</q></p>

<p>Given the right hon. Gentleman's known and oft-expressed views, this must be the greatest humiliation for a Scottish Secretary since the office was established. The Government are in disordered retreat. The poll tax, in their own words, is admitted as a monumental disaster. It has oppressed the

poor, divided the nation and created havoc. I am aware that many have been looking for apologies tonight, but I think that we in Scotland have a special case. The right hon. Gentleman should start with an apology to Scots for introducing the poll tax to Scotland a year before anywhere else, for defending the indefensible and for fighting to retain a poll tax element that Scotland does not want. The belated recognition that a property-based system&#x2014;a rating system, in fact&#x2014;makes sense means that the Secretary of State will have to spend the next two years denying everything that he has said in the past two years. Today's announcement is a massive vote of no confidence in his judgment.<br/>
We have been told that the poll tax is dead, but it is clear that a Tory vote at the next election means that people will be paying poll tax for at least another two years, and that even after April 1993 the one certain thing about the new measures is that there will still be a poll tax element in them. Does the Secretary of State accept that almost every Scot will see this as a desperate last throw by those in the Government who believe in getting the worst of every world?<br/>
The proposed package will mean delay, confusion and expense. It will mean chaos and misery because the system will simply be unable to cope with the Government's dithering and indecision. We know that the cost of shredding and reissuing bills in Scotland as a result of this week's Budget announcement will amount to &#x00A3;8 million. What will be the final price of this ill-thought-out, inconsistent dog's breakfast of a scheme? If so much had not been wasted by the Government, how many more teachers and home helps could be serving the community now?<br/>
The statement refers to a single bill for each household with two essential elements. Will the Secretary of State clarify one central point? Does this mean that there is a property tax and, added to it, a distinct charge based on the number of adults in the household? Or is it a case of the number of adults varying the property tax? To put it another way, is it two taxes added together in one bill, or a property tax varied by the number of adults in the house&#x2014;a form of rebate on the property tax? If it is a distinct, separate tax based on the number of people in the house, will it be a flat rate charge? The Secretary of State must surely be able to answer those fundamental questions. If not, it will be demonstrated that he has no idea what he is proposing in practical terms.<br/>
Can the Secretary of State guarantee that the new system will not involve the administrative apparatus of the poll tax in any form? Will the poll tax register go for good? If the householder alone is liable for the single bill, is that not an admission&#x2014;I hope that the Secretary of State will explain this&#x2014;that the wrong-headed theory of accountability used to justify the poll tax has been totally abandoned?<br/>
Can the Secretary of State give a guarantee that the oppressive 20 per cent. rule will be abolished? Does he accept that it would be intolerable if that were to scar any new system?<br/>
The Secretary of State referred in his statement to periodic revaluations. That sounds a bit like a rating system to me. Can he say a little more about when we shall know the basis of that revaluation and what options are in the frame?<br/>
On structural reform, can the Secretary of State say when the consultative document will be issued? In his


desperation to solve his problems, I warn him against attempting to do so by destroying local democracy. Does he, for instance, believe it right that after the switch in expenditure announced by the Chancellor local government in Scotland will control only about 13 per cent. of its expenditure? Will he perhaps comment on what that is likely to do for the gearing effect which has caused such problems under the poll tax?<br/>
Will the Secretary of State note that the Labour party is prepared to look at one-tier, all-purpose authorities but as part of a planned drive to strengthen democratic control by introducing a Scottish Parliament? What we will not support is any reform programme which amounts to sending in the broker's men to dismantle local democracy. The end product must be a system which allows local communities to run their own affairs through accountable local representatives. The Secretary of State will get no support from Labour Members for moves which are designed further to centralise power in the Scottish Office.<br/>
On Tuesday the Prime Minister promised all the answers, but what we have is a reflection of the Government's confusion. There is a total lack of detail and of clarity. The Prime Minister told us last November that he had not a clue what to do about the poll tax. Today's announcements suggest that nothing has changed.</p>

<p>I think that I can take the questions of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) as a qualified welcome for some of the proposals embodied in my statment.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman complained about the community charge being introduced a year earlier in Scotland than in England, but he forgets that we also abolished the domestic rates in Scotland a year earlier than in England. We are, of course, determined to allow no opportunity for the Labour party to reintroduce either its rates policy or its roof tax policy.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman asked about the waste embodied in the change-over. Perhaps he should look at the spending budgets of local authorities this year, those who are planning a 10 per cent. increase when inflation is likely to fall to about 5 per cent.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman also asked about the relationship between property and the personal element. We are consulting about that. I hope that the Labour party will overcome the natural shyness that has surrounded its proposals for funding local government and will offer to consult with us on that.<br/>
Further consideration is required on the 20 per cent. rule of the existing community charge. We shall look at that further in our own time.<br/>
We shall also be consulting on the basis of valuation and revaluation. Our purpose will be to ensure that under the new local tax local residents will not be open to the high charges that they faced under domestic rates and the community charge. The imposition of excessive burdens on individuals and small parts of the community will not be possible.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman asked when the consultation papers will be issued. The local tax paper will be issued soon after Easter and our consultation paper on the structure will be issued some time after that.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman asked about the effect of gearing on the contribution by local residents. Clearly, it is

important to take account of the interests of local residents. If local authorities have been unwilling to respond sensibly to their accountability to local residents under the community charge system, we shall have to take account of the need for accountability to the United Kingdom taxpayer who is now funding a substantial proportion of local government spending.<br/>
I welcome the hon. Gentleman's support for one-tier local authorities throughout Scotland, but it is absurd to reduce bureaucracy and tiers of government by abolishing one tier, only to reintroduce them in the form of a Scottish Assembly with tax-raising powers. That does not make sense. The hon. Gentleman should consider the package as a whole. For the first time, we are looking at the funding, function and structure of local government all at once. I believe that our answers will commend themselves to the people of Scotland.</p>

<p>Is my right hon. Friend aware that I am delighted at the Government's acceptance of some of the proposals contained in my paper? In particular, I commend the transfer to value added tax of a proportion of the community charge. The &#x00A3;140 reduction will be very welcome to the people in my constituency and throughout Scotland. I also welcome the proposals on education as the beginning of moves towards other measures proposed in my paper.<br/>
I welcome one-tier local authorities, which was also a proposal in my paper. I believe that it is essential that the authorities are close to the people. That is why I believe that they should be based on the districts. That is important. I welcome the opportunity for consultation because I believe that, thus far, the Government have shown that consultation means just that. If it did not, they would not have accepted so many of the measures contained in my paper.<br/>
We should now concentrate our energies and efforts on exposing the fraudulent individuals who have not paid their community charge and who are unfit to sit on local councils or in Parliament because they will not accept the law of the land.</p>

<p>I am delighted at my hon. Friend's delight. He is living testimony to the value of consultation. It is a pity that the Labour party does not have sufficient confidence in its proposals to enter into consultation with us.<br/>
My hon. Friend welcomed the increase in central Government funding which has enabled community charges to be reduced so substantially for next year. I am sure that he will welcome the fact that in Tayside region the community charge level will be down to &#x00A3;245 in Angus and &#x00A3;253 in Perth and Kinross. In Dundee city, however, under strong Labour control, the charge remains &#x00A3;295.<br/>
I note my hon. Friend's preference for districts as the basis for single-tier local authorities. That may be the best solution in some parts of Scotland. It may be individual districts or combinations of districts. However, that may not be appropriate throughout Scotland. In other areas it may be that the regions will form a better basis. The consultation process will give us an opportunity to hear views from all over Scotland on this important matter.</p>

State accept that for the past two years he and his Government have been digging a hole for themselves into which, on Tuesday, the Chancellor threw &#x00A3;4&#x00B7;25 billion of taxpayers' money? Today the Secretary of State and the Government are digging again. They have replaced the most unpopular tax with two unpopular taxes&#x2014;a combination of the rates and the poll tax. How will it be more efficient and simple to collect if it requires both a valuation of property and a head count? Will it not be more expensive to collect than either the rates or the poll tax?<br/>
We welcome the fact that the Government have taken on board almost all the recommendations that the Liberal Democrats put to them on the structure of local government. We believe that there should be single-tier local authorities and that they should be drawn up on the basis of the wishes of the local community and not imposed centrally or uniformly.<br/>
Will he acknowledge that the removal of further education colleges from local authorities is not justified in terms of administration? Which local authorities have failed to provide the necessary investment and support to the further education authorities upon which he is justifying this move?</p>

<p>I am not suggesting that any local authorities have failed to do that. I said that most local authorities had run their further education colleges with skill and commitment. However, we are making new arrangements and attaching new importance to vocational education and training and, given the changed role of further education colleges and the new college councils that we are setting up with a strong private sector component, it is appropriate to give them independence and fund them directly from the Scottish Office. That allows local authorities to concentrate more fully on providing services or enabling the services to he provided. That is their more important obligation.<br/>
I welcome the support of the hon. Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce) for some of the elements of the statement. Again, it is testimony to the value of consultation. I valued the meeting that I had with the Liberal Democrats. I did not agree with them about a local income tax because it would be difficult to administer. Also, a burden of 8p or 9p in the pound on the basic rate of income tax would not be an acceptable burden in Scotland. However, I value the hon. Gentleman's support for the other measures.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman suggested that we threw &#x00A3;4&#x00B7;25 billion of taxpayers' money at the problem. He forgets that that money is being raised from the taxpayer in the form of extra VAT. It is being raised in a way that is more widely spread and more certain of collection than has been the case with the community charge.<br/>
The new local tax will not be two taxes. It will be one tax bill with two components, the details of which have yet to be established. Again, I would welcome continuing consultation with the Liberal Democrats to establish how best that can be achieved.</p>

<p>Never in the course of human history has such abject failure been admitted with so little humility. The Secretary of State has demonstrated that he has learnt nothing from the poll tax disaster. Is he not simply producing the poll tax by another

name? The new system will have all the difficulties, penalties and failures that we have had to suffer for the past few years.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman said that he is prepared to consult on relationships in local government. Is he aware that we in Scotland are concerned with only one consultation&#x2014;a consultation with the electorate at a general election&#x2014;when the Secretary of State, like the right hon. Member for Finchley (Mrs. Thatcher) and the poll tax, will be swept into the dustbin of history?</p>

<p>I am happy to defend some of the underlying principles of the poll tax, which achieved a valuable improvement in accountability and in the spread of the burden of local government. Of course there have been disadvantages. The changes to the register were far more substantial than we had expected, even on the basis of the most professional advice. The failure of some local authorities adequately to collect the charge added to our problems, as did the high spending levels of some local authorities.<br/>
We must ensure that the gains and the underlying principles of the community charge, which were broadly accepted, are not lost sight of. Those principles are being carried forward in the new arrangements&#x2014;we are creating a broader tax base and greater accountability, and we have achieved a greater recognition by local residents that local services must be paid for. The cost of local services has risen substantially and we must find the fairest and most durable way of paying for them. In that context, it is sensible to consider function and structure as well as funding. That is what we are doing. We should welcome consultation with the Opposition on the details of our proposals.</p>

<p>Can the Secretary of State tell us whether, under his proposals, joint and several liability will be ended? Can he say whether Scottish poll tax payers will get more than the &#x00A3;140 reduction in their bills because we have faced those bills for a year longer? If any of the changes are justified, surely more money must be forthcoming for Scottish poll tax payers.<br/>
Is not it a disgrace that further education should be swept up in the general debate? It is an issue of such major importance that it should be dealt with in a debate of its own. What are Scottish further education students who wish to learn crafts and pursue other such studies and their potential or real employers supposed to do if they are dissatisfied with the level of funding for or provision of courses, or with any other aspects? They could take their complaints to the local authority, but they will now have to take them to a Government who, by their actions over the past 12 years, have shown that they never listen and never understand.</p>

<p>I entirely agree about the importance of further education. If I were to make a separate statement about that, the House would be sitting all night. I am sure that the House will understand the desirability of making a statement on further education alongside other local government reforms as they are related. The Government attach great importance to further education, which is why we are making changes. In the new funding arrangements for further education colleges, there will be a basic budget


and another incentive budget related to the number of students that they attract. That will be of great value to further education.<br/>
The hon. Lady asked about joint and several liability. That will remain for the remaining period of the community charge. Any new arrangements will apply in the context of the new local tax.<br/>
Retrospection of the increased contribution from central Government relates to the level of community charge payments being asked of local residents in the coming year. It is our purpose that the money should go straight to them and not run the risk of being diverted into local government to end up in higher spending. Does the hon. Lady believe that the increase in VAT should also be retrospective?</p>

<p>On the poll tax element of what we now know as the Bill Walker tax, can the Secretary of State tell us how he intends to deal with student nurses and students in general and with service men? What arrangements will he make for adults who move house during the course of a year and how will he deal with a household that takes in an elderly adult relative to care for? How will adults be registered? Will there continue to be a poll tax type register or will the electoral register or Inland Revenue information be used? Those are all important questions. If he cannot answer them&#x2014;as he and his colleagues have been unable to answer many previous detailed questions&#x2014;we can come to only one conclusion: the two-tax system has been introduced in panic in exactly the same way as the poll tax was introduced after the revolt of the Troon ratepayers&#x2014;the Secretary of State was one of them&#x2014;following revaluation. This tax would suffer the same fate as the poll tax if it were introduced.

The Secretary of State for Scotland has only one Back Bencher to support him, and that only because the hon. Gentleman concerned thinks that he wrote the paper. It is a shambles.

<p>No, that is not true. We propose a single tax with a property element and a personal element. The benefit of that is to achieve a tax which is durable and stable, and which keeps a broad base, such as we have achieved under the community charge.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman asked me about voting for the Conservative party and thus keeping the community charge that much longer. The Labour party could not wind up the existing community charge arrangements any quicker than we can. The hon. Gentleman asked which authority would be responsible for levying the tax.

The Secretary of State refuses to give an apology to the people of Scotland. Will not he acknowledge that there will be a tremendous groundswell of opinion that there should be compensation for the additional year in which Scotland had to suffer under the poll tax burden?<br/>
Is the remark in the statement by the Secretary of State for the Environment that most people should be asked for a contribution an acknowledgement from the Government, at last, that the sick, the poor and the unemployed&#x2014;those with no capacity to earn&#x2014;should not be dragooned into making contributions for local services? Does the Secretary of State agree that in those circumstances, with a tax in which no one&#x2014;not even he&#x2014;believes, it would be wholly unacceptable for poindings, warrant sales and benefit arrestments for the poll tax to continue for people who have no capacity to earn?

The hon. Gentleman raised the matter of recovery processes. He seems to live in a curious make-believe world which does not recognise that local government has to be paid for. He should contemplate the severe difficulties in which he and his hon. Friends in the Scottish National party have placed many people who followed his advice.

Does the Secretary of State realise that we have already lost 3,000 jobs in steel in Scotland this year and that there will probably be another 5,000 consequential job losses? At this time we need a smoothly functioning structure for local government, industrial development and local finance, but all we have is a shambles.<br/>
We have a new enterprise company which has had its training allowance cut at a time when it should he providing 8,000 new jobs.

We told him and his colleagues when they introduced the poll tax&#x2014;and his English colleagues marched through the Lobby without even understanding or caring to understand what the poll tax meant, and then inflicted it on the people of Scotland&#x2014;that it was obnoxious and unwanted. The Government refused to consult on the matter and entirely ignored the results of what little consultation they carried out.<br/>
I hope that I have got this right. The Secretary of State said that he wanted to change from a two-tier system of local authorities to a one-tier system because the two-tier system
<q>blurs lines of accountability, and it can lead to duplication, conflict and delay. It is often perceived as unnecessarily bureaucratic and remote from local needs.</q>
He then told us that he intended to change from a one-tier tax to a two-tier tax. Do not the same words apply? If the Secretary of State was consistent&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>

<p>I am trying to be brief, Mr. Speaker. You know that brevity is my hallmark.<br/>
I must comment on the Secretary of State's performance. Had he been an Olympic acrobat performing for Scotland, he would have picked up the gold, the silver and the bronze for the alacrity that he showed in turning somersaults. Will he not be honest with the people of Scotland and say that he does not believe that the poll tax should go? Should not he and his ministerial colleagues resign and make way for the real author of the document?</p>

<p>One of the few commitments that the Government have been willing to make this afternoon is that, under the new two-tax system, the poll tax register will go. The Secretary of State for the Environment said that repeatedly, and I take it that the Secretary of State for Scotland agrees with him. Having made that commitment, the Government must have some idea of an alternative means of tracing the number of adults in a household. Will the Secretary of State give us some idea&#x2014;I do not expect details&#x2014;of how the Government will keep track of the number of adults in a household if they do not have a register?</p>

<p>The Dalai Lama obviously got it wrong in thinking that he was the


reincarnation of the Buddha as the Dalai Walker from Tayside, North is clearly the fount of all wisdom on this earth. Now that the poll tax law has been seen to be an ass, can the Secretary of State find it within himself to congratulate the people of Scotland, who showed more wisdom than the politicians? Some of them argued that the only way to get rid of the poll tax was to have a general election, and that nothing could be done until there was a general election. Those Scots who marched, petitioned and protested, and some of whom withheld their tax in an act of civil disobedience, are the people who have destroyed the poll tax mark 1, as has been announced this evening.<br/>
We have heard about the tax mark 2. It is a tax on heads but not a poll tax, and a tax on roofs but not a property tax. It is a tax that dare not&#x2014;at least this evening, and until there has been a lot of consultation&#x2014;speak its name. When shall we know the real truth about what is to replace the poll tax mark 1? Will we know before the local elections in England and Wales in May? Will we know before a general election in June, or is that another trick to be pulled on the Scottish electorate?</p>

<p>While I have long been an advocate of single-tier local authorities in Scotland, with the retention of the islands councils, and a local tax, I am deeply distrustful of the Secretary of State's words. The one word that he has used more than any other is "consultation". He should tell that to our fishermen, those employed in the national health service, and the representatives of my local authority who have been most badly treated over the implementation of the RENAVAL programme, which is designed to help the unemployed in areas such as mine which are characterised by scandalously high unemployment.<br/>
I remind the Minister that consultation is defined in the Oxford and Chambers dictionaries as, inter alia, deliberation, taking counsel together and consulting with others. I do not believe that these Ministers will take counsel in a sensible, humane and fair-minded way with the representatives of local authorities. Is there to be a supervisory body, based in Edinburgh, over the new system of further education? Will that supervisory body be filled, as with many other quangos, by Conservative party supporters and members?</p>

<p>I see no need for the kind of body that the hon. Gentleman is suggesting. We are giving each further education college, under its college council, the independence to run its own affairs. Labour Members may find that concept hard to accept, but it is the best way to generate the best kind of motivation in the minds and attitudes of those who run colleges, and to get the best results for local industry.<br/>
As for consultation with local authorities, I shall be meeting the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities tomorrow. That will be, I hope, the first of a number of opportunities to consult. Consultation is an important part of this exercise and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will be as willing to enter into it as he is for me to do so.</p>

<p>It is clear from what the Secretary of State has said in reply to a number of questions that the detail of his proposals is still to be fleshed out. He also said in reply to one question that he will confidently put this tax before the electorate as part of the Conservative platform at the next general election. How much detail does he expect to be fleshed out by the time that happens?<br/>
As I understand it, the Secretary of State is proposing free-standing colleges, which will have their own buildings, equipment and land. How does he propose to deal with further education in Orkney, where the further education facility is fully integrated with the Kirkwall grammar school?</p>

<p>Orkney has a habit of being a special case. Apart from anything else, it managed to collect 105 per cent. of its budgeted revenue under the community charge in the first year of operation&#x2014;a wonderful example to other local authorities in Scotland.<br/>
As to the particular circumstances of the Orkney further education college, which shares its premises with a secondary school, that is a special situation to which we shall have to apply special arrangements. I shall keep the hon. Gentleman posted on developments there as early as I can. As to how much detail we shall be able to spell out in a general election, the hon.

<p>I thank you, Mr. Speaker, for calling an English Member of a United Kingdom Parliament, and one who always opposed the poll tax and did not support its introduction in Scotland when the Bill to set up the system was introduced in the last Parliament. I congratulate my right hon. Friend on his part in the demise of that unfortunate fiscal enormity. I hope that the consultations, although widespread, will not be too long and drawn out.

<p>The timetable may differ slightly north and south of the border. We shall consult on the tax itself in tandem with my right hon. Friends the Secretaries of State for the Environment and for Wales. It is clear that south of the border a rather longer timetable is contemplated for consultation on the structure of local government. The problem is rather more complex than that which we face in Scotland. Our consultation process may be somewhat shorter in Scotland, but I do not intend that it should be too short because local government is an important issue on which we are anxious to gain as wide a view as possible.</p>

<p>The tax is a single tax in which the components of property and the personal element are combined.

<p>The statement has shown how inappropriate the House is for dealing with such matters. We have attempted to deal with the three important topics&#x2014;abolition of the poll tax, the structure of local government, and further education in Scotland&#x2014;in a short period.<br/>
I have some specific questions for the Secretary of State, first about further education. The proposed measures have nothing to do with further education. They have arisen out of the poll tax panic and the need to move more services to centralised control. I cannot understand why the Secretary of State cannot see that he is centralising rather than localising control. Will he confirm that all the important decisions on further education will be made by him in the Scottish Office? That is particularly distressing because the Government's recent record on training is entirely one of cuts. Only local government has managed to safeguard training by not making the cuts that the Scottish Office has made with the establishment of the new local enterprise companies.<br/>
Exactly what will happen when decisions are made? Will there be no consultative body or funding council for further education in Scotland, as there is in England? Will decisions simply be the diktat of the Secretary of State?<br/>
In the English statement it was announced that a joint White Paper would emerge from the Department of Education and Science and the Department of Employment on the 16 to 19 age group. May I have a specific answer on that? What will be the relationship of Scotland to that White Paper? Will we have a link with it? It is disturbing that the statement and the few words that we have had on further education refer only to further education for the 16 to 19 group. But FE colleges are of enormous importance to their local communities, not only for vocational education. Will the Secretary of State give an assurance that the wider role of colleges in adult and continuing education will be respected?<br/>
Throughout his statement, why did the Secretary of State extol the virtues of consultation but fail to mention consultation with FE colleges? Why has he gone headlong into introducing regulations at midnight tonight, with no consultation with FE colleges?<br/>
Lastly, may I ask the Secretary of State&#x2014;<i>[Interruption.]</i> These are my final questions. I now come to the poll tax. Will the Secretary of State devote some time&#x2014;as long as he wishes&#x2014;to explaining the difference between the rates and his proposed property tax? Will he also confirm that he said that there would be some sort of separate register for levying the poll tax and a valuation roll to assess the property tax?</p>

<p>No, that is not what I said. To answer the hon. Gentleman's other points first, far from a poll tax panic on this side, I discern panic on the Opposition Benches. The hon. Gentleman asked me several questions about further education and local control. He asked whether I would take all the decisions. I assure him that on this side of the House we believe in devolving decision making wherever possible. That is why we set up the new college councils and brought the private sector into them. That is why we are proceeding to give them the independence that so many of them want&#x2014;he asked about consultation&#x2014;so that they can better run their affairs.<br/>
I shall consider the precise funding mechanism that I shall use, but the central institutions in Scotland are perfectly adequately funded so it may not be necessary to establish a Scottish funding council. The hon. Gentleman asked whether there would be a link between me and the other Departments involved in producing the White Paper. I shall certainly be fully associated with that White Paper.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman asked what was the difference between the rates and the property tax. Rates are the policy with which Opposition Members are concerned. Property is but one component of the new local tax that we support. That component and the single tax are but one part of the broad package which at long last addresses simultaneously the funding, function and structure of local government in Scotland. I believe that it will deliver a solution which gives us improved local government in Scotland and will be widely welcomed by the Scottish people.</p>

<p>Why has the Leader of the House created yet another precedent by asking the House to agree on Monday night the money resolution for the poll tax Bill on Tuesday? The House does not approve money resolutions before the Bills to which they relate have had a Second Reading. Before the Leader of the House cites the Prevention of Terrorism Act 1974 as a precedent, may I tell him that I hope he will not equate the crisis in the Conservative party over the poll tax with a national security crisis that arose because of IRA bombing in 1974? On that Act the money resolution was the subject of general agreement through the usual channels. The Prevention of Terrorism Act was not guillotined, and in those exceptional circumstances the money resolution was taken first. It would be shameful for the Leader of the House to use that precedent of a national emergency as justification for taking the money resolution for the poll tax Bill before Second Reading.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman has the ignominious reputation of having created two unsavoury parliamentary precedents, one on the money resolution itself and one on the guillotining in advance of a Finance Bill to replace most of an Act of Parliament which took months to put on the statute book and created hundreds of anomalies because of the capricious nature of the poll tax. That Bill is to be steamrollered through all its stages in just seven hours.<br/>
Will the Leader of the House confirm that he intends to keep the House waiting through the night of Wednesday/ Thursday next week to consider any Lords amendments to this invidious procedure? The Government will look even more stupid if they keep the House sitting for potential amendments to a Bill that seeks to introduce the Government's new twin tax&#x2014;a property tax and a poll tax with a VAT surcharge riding on its back. That is no way to conduct serious matters of government. It would be far better for the Leader of the House to announce a proclamation for a general election so that people might decide on these matters rather than ramrod them through the House.<br/>
When the House resumes after the Easter recess&#x2014;which seems inordinately lengthy when viewed alongside the panic-stricken activities of the Government and the poll tax Bill to be debated next week&#x2014;will the right hon. Gentleman find an early opportunity for a debate on criminal justice? People in all political parties were shocked by the revelations about the deep and fundamental failures of our criminal justice system following the release of the Birmingham Six.</p>

<p>The hon. and learned Gentleman need not be grateful to me because I am not paying him any compliments.<br/>
There is widespread dismay and concern about these matters, and it would be appropriate for the House to have an opportunity to debate them, although not in a party-political way because we know that such events have a long history. The Leader of the House would go some way towards restoring his tarnished reputation if he found time for such a debate.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman's remarks about a general election were rather stale and somewhat irrelevant. He asked about the money resolution. The way in which we propose to deal with that is for the general convenience of the House and is procedurally in order. I explained on Tuesday that we needed to get the Bill next week because that is to the advantage of local authorities and community charge payers. We shall be interested to hear in next week's debates and in the debate on the no confidence motion the view that the Opposition now take of the Bill, because their view is far from clear.<br/>
The Opposition are entitled to table no confidence motions and, as always, I have arranged time for a debate. We welcome the opportunity for a debate, but I wonder what can have possessed the Labour party to engage in a debate which will cruelly expose its lack of coherent policies. As the hon. Gentleman knows, we propose to reduce the charge to local residents by &#x00A3;140 per person in the coming year, and to get that done quickly is our reason for proposing speed on the Bill next week. Does Labour oppose that? We propose to pay for that reduction by increasing taxes on spending. Would Labour reverse that? There is no rush because next week there will be ample opportunity to expose the deficiencies in Labour's policies.<br/>
It is a short Bill of five clauses. We have had a full day on the purposes of the Bill and on other matters today and we shall have a full day on Monday during which the matter can be further discussed. We shall also debate it on Tuesday and Wednesday because the no confidence motion seems to be related to it. That means that there is plenty of time to debate these matters.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman spoke about criminal justice. It was entirely fair of him to say that this is not a party matter but one that concerns the whole House. My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary has announced the setting up of a royal commission. I have noted the hon. Gentleman's request for a debate. I rapidly had to find time for a debate on the no confidence motion. My problem is that there is a great deal of business for the House to conduct when we return after the recess. I shall certainly bear in mind the hon. Gentleman's request.</p>

<p>I was about to apply myself to today's problems because I suppose it is many years since we had statements which lasted until about 9 o'clock. Can my right hon. Friend the Leader of the House find some way to facilitate those of us


who wish to speak on the Budget? Could he find a way to extend beyond 10 o'clock the business on the third day of the Budget debate? I cannot think of a way to do that, but my confidence in his ingenuity is so great that perhaps he can think of one.</p>

<p>No doubt the Leader of the House will recall that in November, when we last had a no confidence motion, Conservative Members were somewhat divided on the question of leadership.

<p>Does my right hon. Friend agree that, if the Government had not come forward with &#x00A3;140 for each community charge payer, there would not be a no confidence motion?

<p>Will the Leader of the House arrange for the Home Secretary to come to the House next week to make a statement about a serious situation that has developed in the west Yorkshire police? Is the right hon. Gentleman aware that there is great worry in west Yorkshire about the fact that the criminal fraternity is well in advance of the police on new technology? Is he also aware that criminals in that area were buoyant last week when they saw an announcement from the police authority that, as well as having lost 500 policemen on the beat, it is now unable to fill the vacant post of assistant chief constable? The Home Secretary is obliged to come to the House and tell us why he is not forcing the Department of the Environment to allow that authority to fill the post in accordance with the Home Secretary's criteria.</p>

that they can give to the more than 3,000 workers who have been laid off by British Aerospace, including 675 at the Chadderton plant in Oldham? Can they look to the Government for any help in their difficulty?</p>

<p>As the hon. Gentleman may know, the company has said that it took the measures that it announced this morning to protect the long-term future of the business. It said that it is imperative that it achieves further improvements in operating efficiency if it is to maintain its competitive position in the world market.<br/>
On the commercial side, the company has quoted the effects of world recession, the weakness of the United States dollar and the continued price pressure on air fares as grounds for the need to reduce costs. I am afraid that I see no cause for a statement next week on this matter.</p>

Do the Government intend to find time for an early debate, given that the right hon.

<p>On the "Poll Tax (Panic and Bribery) Bill" next Monday and Tuesday, I assume that the money resolution will be open-ended. Presumably the Secretary of State will deal with it, because


we shall want a great deal of detailed information, especially about whether people in receipt of rebates and transitional relief will receive some or all of the &#x00A3;140.<br/>
I assume that the guillotine motion on Tuesday's business can be debated for a long time and may therefore eat into the debate. Therefore, can the debate be extended to midnight to give us a minimal opportunity of debating this attack on parliamentary democracy, and so that the Secretary of State can answer many of the questions that he was clearly unable to answer this afternoon?</p>

<p>I shall consider the hon. Gentleman's second point. As for his first, I agree about the importance of the document relating to the protection of horses during transport. Like many colleagues, I have received voluminous mail on the subject and I am sympathetic to those who have written to me. The Government's position has been made clear: we are endeavouring to achieve all the safeguards that we require.

<p>Someone else will have to explain what crime the hon. Gentleman committed to cause him to serve on the Committee. As I have often said, I am keen to review the workings of these Committees as we get more experience of them. They have not met at all in some weeks. One of the issues, as it was when EC documents were scrutinised in the previous system, is that the timetable is not entirely in our hands because it depends on what business is coming up in the Community. One step that we have taken to assist members of the Committee is to give them as much notice as possible of when it will meet&#x2014;usually longer notice than in the statement that I made to the House. I am certainly prepared to look into whether there should be more members and into other issues that may arise once we have more experience of the working of the Committees.</p>

<p>I do not know whether the Leader of the House missed me during questions on the last couple of business statements, but he may be interested to know that I was in Canada studying baby harp seals which used to be clubbed to death, rather in the same way as the Government are clubbing democracy to death in Parliament. He will be aware that the killing of these baby seals ended as the culmination of a political campaign in the House and in the European Parliament, which forced the Canadian Government to impose a ban. It now looks as though that Government may be considering allowing an extension of seal culling, so I ask the right hon. Gentleman whether we can have a debate, if not next week, as soon as possible thereafter, on animal conservation. It is a matter of great concern to many Members in the House and to many more people outside it. In such a debate we could discuss the Canadian seal cull along with many other matters relating to animal welfare.</p>

<p>At last we come to the event for which I know the whole House has been waiting throughout this long day.<br/>
In his Budget speech my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer set out the three essential foundations for the renewed growth in jobs that we all want to see. First, the prospect is for sharply falling inflation&#x2014;down to 4 per cent. in the last quarter of the year, and even lower in 1992. Secondly, interest rates are coming down&#x2014;a reduction of two full percentage points since last October. Thirdly, my right hon. Friend predicted that output would stabilise in the next few months and then grow again&#x2014;by 2 per cent. between the first half of this year and the first half of 1992.<br/>
In short, while the immediate prospect is for rising unemployment, the basis is already laid for a resumption in the jobs growth that has been such a remarkable feature of the second half of the 1980s; and for falling unemployment. How quickly unemployment comes down will depend partly on the speed with which pay settlements come down. The latest figures show a small fall in year-on-year average earnings, but that is not enough and it is not happening quickly enough.<br/>
Within the exchange rate mechanism, wage negotiators ultimately have no option, if they want to remain competitive, but to bring unit wage costs into line with those of our European competitors. If that lesson is not


learnt, more jobs will be lost. In that context, I particularly welcome the measures announced in the Budget to encourage more profit-related pay schemes and to stimulate employee share ownership.<br/>
The Government have always attached considerable importance to the financial participation of employees in the companies for which they work. One of the most effective ways of increasing commitment at work is to give employees a direct stake in the ownership and prosperity of the business for which they work. Tax reliefs to stimulate financial participation have been introduced or extended in almost all Budgets since 1979. A number of proposals in the latest Budget continue this process and take financial participation still further.<br/>
Those proposals are further evidence of the Government's commitment to financial participation as an important element in employee involvement. They will provide an important strengthening of the links between the rewards people receive and the performance of the company for which they work. They are important further steps on the road to making our pay and rewards systems more responsive to profitability.<br/>
However, although the medium-term prospect for jobs is optimistic, I do not underestimate the anxiety and uncertainty of those who are unemployed at the present time about how long they will be unemployed and how quickly they can get back to work. While unemployment remains high, I am determined to ensure that those unemployed people have the best possible advice and support and, where necessary, special help to put them on the road back to a job.<br/>
As a result of the measures that I announced a year ago, we already have in place throughout the country a comprehensive package of counselling and job-search advice geared to the specific needs of individuals. The central feature of those measures is an initial interview for all newly unemployed people and an individual back-to-work plan showing how that person can best help himself and how he can be most effectively helped by the employment service.<br/>
I announced yesterday that I propose to build on that new counselling framework extra advice and help with job search. I am providing the employment service with &#x00A3;55 million in extra resources for 1991&#x2013;92 on top of the resources already announced. Of that, some &#x00A3;38 million will ensure that its standards of service to its clients are maintained and, where possible, enhanced. Some &#x00A3;17 million will provide more help for those who do not find work in the first few weeks of unemployment.<br/>
As a result, for the first time, every unemployed person who reaches 13 weeks of unemployment and has no job to start will have a guaranteed offer of an interview&#x2014;an opportunity to review the back-to-work plan and to assess further options for getting back to work.<br/>
New jobs teams will be set up to search out jobs that are suitable for those who have marketable skills and to match individuals to jobs.<br/>
Jobs seminars will be run to provide extra advice on job search for those who are not seeking work in the most effective way. For those with more intensive problems and needs, who are already eligible to enter job clubs after 13 weeks of unemployment, more job club places will be provided.<br/>
We are also increasing help to those who have been unemployed for a longer period. In the course of the next financial year, there will be an extra 100,000 opportunities in job clubs and in the new job introduction guarantee scheme. Job clubs work: 66 per cent. of unemployed people leaving job clubs go into work or into training or further education.<br/>
Finally, as a result of the further &#x00A3;120 million that I am making available to employment training, up to 245,000 unemployed people will be able to learn skills to improve their chances of getting back to work. That represents the most comprehensive range of help and advice ever made available to unemployed people. It offers some 650,000 opportunities on Employment Department programmes. It provides a wide range of options, so that the available help matches individual needs. It guarantees help to unemployed people at the point at which they need it most. Above all, it focuses on jobs and getting back to work.<br/>
Even at a time of rising unemployment, some 450,000 job vacancies are available in the economy now. Almost 300,000 unemployed people leave unemployment every month. Over 50 per cent. of unemployed people find work within three months of becoming unemployed. The help that we are providing and the new help that I have announced today is designed to ensure that everyone has the best possible chance of getting back to work in the shortest possible time.<br/>
May I now turn to one of the most significant parts of the Budget speech: that concerned with initiatives to encourage individuals to invest in their own training. It is of particular importance at a time of economic downturn that we do everything possible to sustain both employer and individual investment in training, so that, as jobs are created, there is a ready supply of skilled people.<br/>
The foundations have already been laid for a significant improvement in the skills of the work force. There are many positive signs that skill levels are increasing, and that employers and individuals are becoming increasingly aware of the importance of education and training to our future economic well-being. I draw the attention of the House to the clear signs of that improvement.<br/>
First, more and more young people, encouraged by the Government's reforms to schools and the further education system, are staying on in full-time education to gain the qualifications that will enable them to progress to higher levels of skill and attainment. Last year, 350,000 16-year-olds chose to continue in full-time education; the percentage staying on has risen by a third over the past decade. The number of young people taking part in full-time vocational courses in further education is also increasing: in England it has doubled in the past 10 years.<br/>
The second clear sign is the success of youth training. The Labour party has a consistent record of opposition to youth training and to the YTS which preceded it. The hon. Member for Sedgefield (Mr. Blair) made a speech in January which set out Labour's supposedly superior alternative to youth training. But, as ever, he had failed to notice what was happening around him. He said that training for young people should lead to jobs or further education and training. Youth training already does that: 88 per cent. of young people who complete their YT course go into jobs, further education or training. He said that training should be based on national vocational qualifications attained, not on time served. Youth training already provides that too: there are no time limits on the training involved, and there is a minimum target level of a


national vocational qualification level 2. Already, two thirds of those who complete YT gain a vocational qualification&#x2014;something which was inconceivable 10 years ago. That number will increase in future as training and enterprise councils ensure that all the training they provide for young people leads to a national vocational qualification.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman called for closer integration of education and training. That is also already happening&#x2014;through the technical and vocational education initiative, through education business partnerships and through the assumption from next month of responsibility for work-related further education by TECs.<br/>
The third clear sign of the improvement in Britain's training performance is that the number of employees receiving job-related training has increased by 85 per cent. since 1984&#x2014;a remarkable testament to the new commitment of employers to upgrading the skills of their employees. The depth of that commitment is underlined by the results of an Industrial Society survey published only this week. Despite the difficult economic conditions, 87 per cent. of companies say that they will either maintain or increase their expenditure on training this year&#x2014;more than six times as many as those that say that they will reduce it.<br/>
Those positive trends are due in no small part to the wide range of steps that the Government have taken over the past 10 years to create an education and training system that is relevant and responsive to the needs of employers and individuals. But of course we are far from complacent; we still have much to achieve. We have set in train the reforms that will ensure that the momentum which has been built up does not diminish.<br/>
In the training and enterprise councils and the local enterprise companies in Scotland we now have the means of developing and building on this commitment to training. All 82 TECs and 22 LECs are now in being. More than 1,200 of the country's senior business men and women have committed themselves to providing the leadership needed to develop the skills that industry will need in the 1990s. That leadership has been built not by the regulation and compulsion so much favoured by the Opposition, but through voluntary commitment and willing participation.<br/>
Alongside employer commitment we must also stimulate individuals to take responsibility for their own training and development. Again, the way to do that is not by compulsion, but by providing new incentives and widening choice. We have already taken a number of steps in that direction. For 45,000 young people, in 11 pilot areas across the country training credits are only two weeks away. Training credits are a very important development. They offer real purchasing power to the individual and encourage young people to assume, at the very outset of their careers, proper control over their own training and development. If the pilots are successful, training credits will play a major part in transforming attitudes towards training in this country.<br/>
Career development loans, which were introduced in 1988, are giving valuable help to individuals who are financing their own training. They have led to a combined investment of &#x00A3;50 million in the training of about 17,000 individuals. Through the TECs, we are ensuring that individuals have access to comprehensive information and advice about training provision in every local area.<br/>
Finally, we have just announced an important new addition to our well-established national training awards, which give recognition for excellence in training. For the first time, the 1991 awards, for which His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales is patron, will include a new award for individual achievement.<br/>
The announcement in Tuesday's Budget of tax relief for individuals' expenditure on training provisions provides another important incentive for individuals to acquire new skills or upgrade existing ones. That sends a clear signal of the Government's support for individual effort and will provide a powerful incentive to those who wish to train, but are deterred by the cost. Tax relief will be given at source for training leading to national vocational qualifications&#x2014;or SVQs in Scotland&#x2014;up to and including level 4. The link to national vocational qualifications is essential. The achievement of recognised qualifications, based on standards of competence set by employers, is the best way of ensuring that people have the skills our economy needs.<br/>
These developments are all designed to give individuals the information, support and encouragement they need to improve their skill levels and widen the choices available to them. I am confident that they will have a significant impact on individuals' willingness to seek out training opportunities and take responsibility for their own training and development.<br/>
The Chancellor rightly referred to his Budget as a "Budget for business". With my special responsibilities for small firms, I take particular pleasure in the substantial additional help for small businesses. Every year my hon. Friend the Minister with responsibility for small firms invites those who represent small firms to put forward their views on what they would like to see in the Budget to assist small firms. We listen to their views and consider with the Chancellor what might be provided.<br/>
I am glad to say that this year the process has borne particular fruit with measures that further reduce the tax burden on small enterprises, lift further the bureaucracy and red tape which is the bane of a small firm's life and assist firms having cash flow and liquidity problems in the present recession. I do not propose to list again all the measures that will be of particular benefit to small firms, but I draw the attention of the House to the wide spread of measures.<br/>
There are measures which will benefit very small firms. One example is the increase in the VAT registration threshold to &#x00A3;35,000, an increase of 38 per cent. to its highest-ever level in real terms, which will take an estimated 150,000 traders out of the VAT net. A second example is the move from monthly to quarterly payments of PAYE and national insurance contributions for small employers, thereby improving the cash flow for about half all employers.</p>

<p>It is always possible to identify other measures, but I think that the hon. Gentleman will recognise that the combined effect of the package that my right hon. Friend introduced on Tuesday, which has been


widely welcomed by small firms' organisations, will go a long way to improving their position and relieving the burdens presently placed on them.<br/>
The increase in the threshold for the small company rate of corporation tax and the carrying back of trading losses from one year to three will be of particular benefit to the small incorporated company.<br/>
In addition to these, the Chancellor made two important announcements of concern to small firms. As the Chancellor said, there is a case for a more radical simplification of the taxation of the self-employed. The Inland Revenue will therefore shortly be publishing a consultative document outlining its proposals for change.<br/>
The Chancellor also announced a review of the serious misdeclaration of VAT penalty, because of complaints that the penalty it imposed was unfair; while the review takes place, the penalty has been reduced from 30 per cent. to 20 per cent.<br/>
The Budget will help training and businesses, especially small businesses, and will help to foster and create jobs. The Government will continue to create jobs to fuel growth and to raise the prosperity of our people. That is why we shall win the next election and many after it.</p>

<p>This is probably the first time that an opening speech has been made at a time normally reserved for the replies. That is a telling sign of the Government's incompetence. In the midst of the worst recession for a decade, with unemployment rising and output falling, the Budget will be remembered not for what it did for the economy but for the poll tax.<br/>
The poll tax, like some virulent contagious disease, is contaminating everything with which it comes into contact; no aspect of local or central government appears immune. On Tuesday, it infected the Budget with deadly results.</p>

<p>All the Budget did for local government finance was to shift the proportion financed locally to central Government. Is the hon.

<p>We would not have introduced the poll tax and be in this mess. I remind the Secretary of State that he was the Minister responsible for introducing the poll tax, but now he is going to stand on his head and tell us that he regretted it.<br/>
The Budget should have included, as we demanded, not a partial but the full restoration of the training cuts and made proper provision for a temporary work programme to assist unemployed people. Instead, the training concession, which is the only measure in the Budget on

training or unemployment, is costed at &#x00A3;20 million&#x2014;barely one third of the extra cost of resubmitting poll tax bills after Tuesday's announcement. Can there be any clearer sign of the Government's priorities or any better proof of their failure?<br/>
The real casualties of the Budget are all too clear. Unemployment is rising faster than at any time since the early 1980s&#x2014;the worst recession on record&#x2014;and 370,000 people were made redundant or have lost their jobs in the past few months. Twelve thousand jobs have gone since Tuesday's Budget. Almost 100 constituencies, three quarters of which are represented by Conservative Members, have suffered a rise of more than 1,000 in unemployed people. In the south-east, unemployment has risen by 50 per cent.; in the south-west by 47 per cent.; in East Anglia by 45 per cent.; and in the midlands by more than 20 per cent. Areas such as north Wales and Scotland, where the rise has been slower, are starting to rise inexorably from a much higher base.<br/>
The recovery for which the Government have striven so hard has been put at risk. In every constituency, there are closures, redundancy and short-time working. In every affected family, there is worry about paying the mortgage, meeting household bills and, above all, about how to get back to work in a labour market that is shrinking daily.<br/>
In every part of Britain, every sector of industry and every occupation in the workplace, the recession has taken its toll and is the direct responsibility of Ministers. They say that the recession is biting worldwide, but that is palpably untrue. No main European country is set for any fall in growth in 1991, let alone to register negative growth of 2 per cent. In Japan, growth will be 3&#x00B7;5 per cent., in Germany 2&#x00B7;5 per cent., in France 2 per cent. and in Italy 1&#x00B7;5 per cent. In the third and fourth quarters of 1991, we will be the only main economy in the world that will suffer falls in growth.<br/>
Moreover, it is not that we are first in and first out; we are first in and last out. Growth predictions for 1992 show that we shall grow more slowly than any other OECD country. We are worse off in another respect: in 1991, business investment will grow in Japan, Germany, France and Italy but plummet by almost 10 per cent. in Britain. Billions of pounds of investment are going to German, French, and Japanese firms from United Kingdom industry. Although, as the Secretary of State said, we do not have the highest absolute rates of unemployment in Europe, we have the fastest-rising unemployment anywhere in the OECD.<br/>
Against that background, we look at the Budget and the Department of Employment. In 1989, when unemployment stood at 1&#x00B7;8 million, the budget for employment training was about &#x00A3;1&#x00B7;5 billion. In 1990, when unemployment stood at 1&#x00B7;6 million, it was well over &#x00A3;1 billion. In 1991, when unemployment is topping 2 million, how can the figure of &#x00A3;850 million&#x2014;a cut of almost half what it was two years ago&#x2014;possibly be justified? If the money in 1989 was barely adequate for unemployment, then how can it be adequate now when unemployment is higher? The omission from the Budget of any proper measures for the unemployed is the most telling expression of the Budget and the Government's priorities. A clear and cynical calculation has been made that 2 million or more unemployed is electorally tolerable. I do not believe that the Government are right in thinking that, but even if they


are and it is electorally tolerable, it should not be tolerated by any Government who have proper respect for the society in which we live.<br/>
Our criticism, however, is not just of the Budget's failure to announce new measures to assist the unemployed but of its failure to correct past mistakes. Even now, because of the cuts in the budget of the Department of Employment, chaos and confusion are being caused across training provision in Britain, as hon. Members must know from representations that they have received. If we have received those representations, the Department of Employment must have done so, too. Our office has been inundated with scores of complaints that in every part of Britain training schemes are closing, trainers are being made redundant and training places are being lost. Many of those places are for the most disadvantaged people in our community. For some, employment training, with all its faults, offered their only lifeline to self-improvement. Many have written to us&#x2014;some from high technology schemes for the long-term unemployed, some who are handicapped and some young people whose only opportunity that was to get back into the job market.<br/>
We come to the one measure in this year's Budget that is remotely concerned with employment or training&#x2014;the tax relief on training fees. Anything that assists training is welcome. The great problem with tax relief is dead weight&#x2014;in other words, those gaining the tax relief may have undertaken a course anyway and many of the poorer and unskilled will be unlikely to gain by the proposals. Having said that, it is clearly right that anything that assists training deserves our support. When we put that against the scale of Britain's training deficit and realise how far behind we are, can it be said that this sole measure in the Budget that assists employment and training really faces up to the scale of the problem?<br/>
The Secretary of State said that more companies were training, and we welcome that. There are signs that they are. However, the right hon. and learned Gentleman should read the Industrial Society's report much more carefully before drawing his conclusion in quite such a black-and-white way. More companies are training in Germany, Japan and France, and to higher levels and more qualifications. The idea that they are standing still while we are catching up is nonsense. They are moving ahead, too. When we agree that Britain needs a training revolution, when we must accept that we have more unskilled employees than any other main European competitor, when we languish far behind Germany and France in skills for technicians, textile workers, shop assistants, engineers and computer programmers&#x2014;almost every sector of the economy, whether services or manufacturing&#x2014;and then we compensate for five years of cuts totalling &#x00A3;1 billion in Government funding with one tax concession worth &#x00A3;20 million, the notion that we are preparing ourselves adequately for the future is an affront to our common sense.<br/>
The tax concession is not unwelcome, but it is a sop&#x2014;a political nod in the direction of a serious issue, made without any credible intention of addressing it. It would have been far better to adopt the proposals that the Labour party advanced in our Budget submission, not only for the restoration of money lost through training cuts and the establishment of a good temporary work programme for the unemployed, but for a new special skills fund of &#x00A3;300 million-adequately financed, in other

words&#x2014;to allow us to provide access to those who want to obtain skills for the first time and to those who want to improve their skills.<br/>
This tax concession&#x2014;this sop&#x2014;reveals the nature of the present Government. They are a Government with no purpose except to be in government. They are a Government with no coherence, no commitment, no passion and no understanding of the needs of the country. A Government who were concerned for Britain in the middle of a recession would have produced a Budget for Britain&#x2014;a Budget for employment and training. If the Government can find &#x00A3;4&#x00B7;5 billion to salvage the wreckage of the Tory party over the poll tax, why cannot they find &#x00A3;200 million to help training for the unemployed? The reason is simple: they are more concerned about the jobs of 370 Tory MPs, at risk from the electorate, than about the 370,000 people made unemployed since the recession began.<br/>
On Tuesday we had a Budget that ignored the problems of the real economy. Today we had a poll tax announcement whose shambolic incompetence defied belief. It has been a fitting end to a farcical week. Contrary to what we were told by the Secretary of State, when the next election comes, this will be remembered as the week that saw the beginning of the end not just of the poll tax and the mismanagement of our economy but of the party responsible for both.</p>

<p>I hope that the hon. Member for Sedgefield (Mr. Blair) will forgive me if I do not follow him in detail. He spoke about the next election. I can only say that his speech did not impress me. On the contrary, it increased my conviction that, after the next election, I shall be greeting my eldest son and not the hon. Gentleman as the Member for Sedgefield.<br/>
I suppose that, following the Chancellor's statement on Tuesday, there can have been no prizes for guessing that all the headlines on Wednesday would be devoted to the increase in VAT and the &#x00A3;140 reduction for every community charge payer. In my view, that was not the most important lesson to be learnt from the Budget. The Budget was living proof that the Chancellor had refused to succumb to the many temptations that must have surrounded him in recent weeks to relax the stern and strict measures taken with the economy and to return as soon as possible to expansion and a period of lower inflation and interest rates. I was enormously relieved that the prospect of an election some time in the next year did not lead my right hon. Friend into irresponsibility. I am sure that siren voices must have tried to tempt him into taking steps that would not have been wise, and I congratulate him on having resisted that temptation, which must have been great.<br/>
My right hon. Friend referred to the prospects for the next year. With regard to economic growth, he said that we should return to an annual rate of 2 per cent. in the year to the end of the first half of 1992; that we can now see the prospect of the end of the current recession; and that, as we have already got two percentage points off the level of inflation, there are prospects of inflation falling to below 4 per cent.<br/>
Many people would have said that it was understandable had he succumbed and let off the brakes to the extent


of producing a Budget that was not prudent. I was especially struck by the Chancellor's repeated statements that a tight economic policy will continue. It is true that, nowadays, the room for manoeuvre by any Chancellor of the Exchequer is considerably reduced by Britain's membership of the exchange rate mechanism of the European monetary system. I believe that that is a good discipline for all Chancellors. If, by any chance, we were at any future time to find ourselves with a Labour Government, the discipline of the exchange rate mechanism on that Government's Chancellor&#x2014;history has shown that Labour Chancellors have always been much more tempted, and have always reacted by moving into the realms of imprudence&#x2014;would be much greater than is necessary on a Conservative Chancellor.<br/>
I was very pleased to hear that it remains the firm intention of the Government to move to the narrow exchange mechanism band as soon as that is prudent and possible. That is good news. Before the Budget, I worried that elements of imprudence might creep in. My worries are considerably abated. I believe that the battle to conquer inflation has not been diminished in any way and that the struggle to preserve honest money is being continued. I welcome the Chancellor's statement that the intention is to achieve a balanced budget over the period of the 1990s. That is certainly good news.<br/>
I have always measured Budgets by the reactions of my constituents. I am sure that the people in my constituency will be hugely pleased by the changes in the community charge and by the evolution from the Chancellor's speech about which we heard this afternoon&#x2014;the creation of a system which, I am sure, will seem fairer to the huge majority of people in this country. I was glad&#x2014;and I am sure that my constituents will be glad&#x2014;that the new proposals for the raising of money for local government will continue the concept that everybody should pay something. If we are to switch the raising of funds from local to central revenues, it is far better that that should be done through value added tax than through income tax. Many constituents have written to me saying that there should be such a switch. The great advantage of raising extra revenue centrally through VAT is that it achieves what many of my constituents want&#x2014;a system that reflects ability to pay. Because of the zero rating of food, rent and fuel, which represent such a high proportion of the expenditure of people on lower incomes, the VAT system gives a good deal of protection to those who are worst off.<br/>
My constituents will welcome the community charge changes. Because the proposed system is fairer, the taxes will be easier to collect, and there should not be repetitions of the absolutely outrageous behaviour of various Labour Members of Parliament, as well as Labour party supporters and others throughout the country, who have demonstrated that they have scant respect for the rule of law.<br/>
I am pleased that the new arrangements for the community charge will maintain the capping system to control extravagant local authorities that have been holding their charge payers to ransom. In Cumbria we have a grossly extravagant county council, run by a Labour-Liberal consortium, which escaped capping last year by the skin of its teeth but which is still holding the people to ransom by its various extravagances.<br/>
Not enough of my constituents have yet understood the pleasant surprises that are in store for them. When they receive their community charge bills for the coming year, they will see the considerable reductions in the charge as a result of the announcements of two months ago. Those reductions will especially help people living in houses which were previously on low rates. They will be even more surprised when they realise that a further &#x00A3;140 will be knocked off their bills.<br/>
The Budget's accent on industry will please those people even more. Most of my constituents never forget the role of industry in creating the wealth of the nation, on which everything else depends. The Secretary of State referred to the measures applying to small businesses. I shall not repeat them, except to point out that my constituents have been looking for such action for a long time. I refer to the reduction in tax rates, the help with VAT, the threshold exemption, the relaxation on capital gains tax and the new pay-as-you-earn arrangements. They are all welcome.<br/>
I congratulate the Chancellor on having achieved low taxation rates for industry which make this country the most attractive for overseas investors. We now have the lowest taxed industry in the European Community and the United States. As a result of the Budget, the powerhouse of the economy&#x2014;British industry&#x2014;will have tremendous opportunities in the coming years to expand and prosper and, as that happens, the nation will expand and prosper.</p>

<p>This truncated debate has been overshadowed in more ways than one by the poll tax debacle&#x2014;the biggest fiasco in modern political history and a U-turn of staggering proportions. A proud flagship has gone for ever, yet we still have to hear a word of apology or contrition from the Treasury Bench. Any Government with an ounce of shame or decency would have resigned. There is much that I could say about the poll tax, but because of the shortage of time I will leave the matter there and deal with the Budget and the state of the economy.<br/>
The Tories have had 12 years in which to implement their policies. After all that time, we are plunged into the depths of an appalling recession with an explosion of mass unemployment. They have had 12 years to get things right&#x2014;all those years of North sea oil, of &#x00A3;100 billion revenue and selling off state assets&#x2014;but it has all been squandered. Where is the economic miracle they used to talk about? Where are the apologies to the unemployed? There were 86,500 more out of work last month&#x2014;86,500 more tragedies.<br/>
We were told that inflation was to be the Government's judge and jury and that their aim was to achieve zero inflation. When inflation began to rise, we were told that it was just a blip. It has been blipping ever since. The Government have strangled the economy and brought it to a standstill in an effort to deal with inflation.<br/>
We have a record trade gap. When the trade gap went to &#x00A3;1 billion in one month the Government said that it was a freak. It has been a freak ever since. We have record bankruptcies, the highest interest and mortgage rates, the highest house repossession rates, unemployment surging, output down 2 per cent. this year on the Chancellor's own admission, manufacturing output down 5 per cent. this


year, and investment&#x2014;the seed corn&#x2014;down 10 per cent. It is an abysmal catalogue of failure. In no other country in Europe is the same thing happening.<br/>
The Tories used to talk about the Labour party being a party which might borrow. We have not heard much about that today. This year the Government are borrowing &#x00A3;8 billion and next year they propose to borrow &#x00A3;12 billion. If the Labour party had suggested borrowing that amount, we would have heard more about it. That money is not for investment, but to pay for unemployment and to balance the books. If the Government had restored child benefit to its proper level, they would have had to increase it by &#x00A3;2&#x00B7;30 instead of just 25p for the second and subsequent children.<br/>
The Government are a complete failure, not just at the margins but in all important essentials. We have a Government of incompetence and bungling. They should not be allowed to stay in office a moment longer. We need an immediate election to cleanse the country of so abysmal a regime.<br/>
I want to refer to some of the evidence taken by the Select Committee on Employment in the past three weeks. There was much else that I wanted to say, but there is not time. Last week the Confederation of British Industry told the Select Committee that unemployment would continue to rise all through next year, reaching at least 2&#x00B7;25 million. The CBI also told us that unemployment would go up for the whole of the following year. So unemployment will be rising for two more years, as far ahead as can be foreseen and certainly up to the next election.<br/>
Yesterday the Institute of Directors appeared before the Select Committee and told us that last year it had tried to be optimistic but that it no longer could. I will quote the exact words:
<q>Since 1984 the IOD has done its own bi-monthly survey of member opinion including asking members what their expectations are about economic developments. The February 1991 results are the worst in the life of the survey.</q>
The right hon. Member for Westmorland and Lonsdale (Mr. Jopling) mentioned Europe. In the IOD paper there is a passage on the impact of European Community membership going back to 1970. Hon. Members will recall that in 1970 a White Paper said that the effect of entry on the balance of payments would be positive and substantial. I quote the words of the IOD:
<q>Over the period of 1970 to 1988, UK manufactured exports to the EC rose by 210 per cent. in volume, but imports from the EC grew by 640 per cent. The impact on Britain's trade balance was adverse and severe. Membership of the EC was accompanied by a turnaround in UK manufacturing trade from a surplus in 1970 of &#x00A3;16&#x00B7;2 billion at 1988 prices to a deficit in 1988 of &#x00A3;15&#x00B7;7 billion.</q>
So during that period there was a turn around of &#x00A3;32 billion. The IOD said that the position is worse because in 1970 there was no North sea oil. The IOD also said:
<q>Although many jobs are created by trade within Europe, it is clear from the figures above that more jobs have been lost. This effect has had an impact on most industries in the UK. There is no reason to believe that 1992 will not accelerate this process.</q>
In other words, the Institute of Directors thinks that it will all get worse. In the next paragraph the IOD says:
<q>There is a strong likelihood of a painful period of adjustment to the UK's entry into the ERM".</q>
It also said that European monetary union could exacerbate what it called the marginalisation of the United Kingdom economy.<br/>
That is what we were told yesterday by the Institute of Directors, and it came out in the discussions and evidence

that to the extent that our inflation, our productivity and our containment of unit labour costs do not converge with those of Germany&#x2014;in other words, are not so good as Germany's&#x2014;we lose competitiveness from day 1 of exchange rate mechanism entry. The IOD fears that our trade deficit unemployment will grow and drew our attention to the experience of East Germany, which changed its currency to the deutschmark but without the same level of productivity and cost as West Germany, leading to the collapse of industry and mass unemployment.<br/>
The Select Committee has been interested in the effect on employment of joining the exchange rate mechanism. When we asked the Secretary of State what research had been done on this in the Department, he replied with a letter in which he quoted a memorandum from the director general of the National Economic Development Council and the November 1990 issue of the <i>National Institute Economic Review.</i> That was very worrying because it told us that ERM membership cost France 700,000 jobs and Italy 1 million jobs. Those facts ought to be brought to the attention of the British public rather more widely.<br/>
The current issue of <i>CBI News</i> has an article by Professor Douglas McWilliams, the CBI's chief economic adviser. Speaking of the effect on the French economy, he says:
<q>How has the French economy performed since the start of serious EMF membership of 1983? The initial effect was slow growth. French GNP rose by below trend for five consecutive years from 1983&#x2013;87 with a cumulative shortfall of 4&#x00B7;5 per cent. of growth compared with productive potential. The main feature of this recession was that output was depressed for an unusually long period &#x2026;</q>
The article went on to say that wages were reduced. It continued:
<q>Nevertheless, reducing inflation still required rather slow growth associated with rising unemployment</q>
&#x2014;a rise in the number of jobs lost of approximately half a million.<br/>
His last paragraph is very revealing and worrying, and all hon. Members should be concerned about it. He says that
<q>the French experience suggests that if British membership of the ERM is successful in reducing inflation it is likely that unemployment will rise to about 500,000 above its 1990 level at some time before 1994. And if Britain is unsuccessful the rise in unemployment could be substantially more than this&#x2014;perhaps as much as a million or more.</q>
The Institute of Directors told the Committee that the most important thing was training and that the responsibility for training the unemployed and paying for it was with the Government. A fortnight ago our witness was Mr. David Dickinson, the chairman of the group of 10 of the TECs who negotiates with the Government. He said that
<q>the TEC movement appealed very, very strongly to the Secretary of State in the run-up to the last Autumn Review, in that the level of funding should be maintained at last year's level in real terms, and that this should be maintained at least three years to allow the TEC movement to get up and running. In fact, we saw a reduction overall &#x2026; in the region of 20 per cent. and notably 36 per cent. in money terms in ET, which has given the TECs a major problem. So we think that it is sending the wrong message to the world, to have major cuts in budget.</q>
Mr. Dickinson referred to
<q>a most Draconian average cut of 45 per cent. in real terms &#x2026; in their adult training budgets.</q>
He then said:
<q>There is a Budget coming up very shortly, and it would be one of the most powerful things for this country if the


Chancellor were to reinstate the training and enterprise budgets at last year's level throughout, which would be three steps similar to the one that has just recently been taken.</q>
The Secretary of State will remember that he recently announced a budget increase of &#x00A3;120 million. Mr. Dickinson told us that the Secretary of State had previously made a cut of &#x00A3;365 million and that the increase announced was only one third of that previous cut. Mr. Dickinson wanted the remaining two thirds. He said:
<q>I think that would be one of the most powerful things to ensure the success of the TEC movement.</q>
That is what the TECs were waiting for and expecting from the Budget, but they did not get it.<br/>
What is the result of the TECs being underfunded? Mr. Dickinson said:
<q>Many ET providers will be virtually idle in the second half of 1991 due to the cuts in their funding.</q>
I asked him:
<q>What are we to make of that? What is the significance of that? Do you think that is right? Should we be worried about that?</q>
Speaking on behalf of the TECs, Mr. Dickinson said:
<q>I certainly think the TECs and the Employment Committee and the Government should all be worried about it.</q>
Therefore, not only are workers becoming unemployed, but the trainers are being put on the dole. That is the criticism that the TECs are making of the Government.<br/>
We heard evidence yesterday from Judith Donovan&#x2014;the only female chairperson. She is the chairperson of the Bradford TEC. She said:
<q>In the early days of getting TECs on the road&#x2014;less than a year ago&#x2014;the dream was that TECs would negotiate a budget based on what they proposed to deliver in response to local needs. How the mood has changed! We now see a reduced national budget allocated to TECs and scope for negotiation almost nil.</q>
<q>The 30 per cent. cut on employment training budgets announced in January 1991 appears cynical when one looks at the way unemployment has increased within the previous two or three months.</q>
That is the evidence that the TECs and the TECs' chairmen are giving to the Select Committee on Employment. <i>[Interruption.]</i> I have just quoted Judith Donovan, the chairperson of the Bradford TEC. The previous evidence was from David Dickinson, the chairman of the group of 10.</p>

<p>From the evidence given to the Select Committee, I understand that there is a group of 10 and that that group liaises&#x2014;even negotiates&#x2014;with the Secretary of State. It told me that it was to have a meeting with the Secretary of State on 18 March. I do not know whether the meeting took place. I have seen reports in the <i>Financial Times,</i> which is usually accurate, stating that the group could not agree with the Minister about the agenda because a new programme was being suggested&#x2014;a sort of "make work" programme, a resuscitated community programme, a blotting paper exercise to soak up all the extra unemployed. The Secretary of State did not want that on the agenda. I read in the press that, as a result, the group of 10 might not be having a meeting with him. I do not know whether it did.<br/>
The Secretary of State must agree that the group of 10 is a bona fide body. Mr. Dickinson described himself as the chairman of that group and it is for the group to decide who is its chairman. However much the Secretary of State shakes his head, Mr. Dickinson is a chairman of a TEC. I have quoted two chairpersons of TECs. It may interest the Secretary of State to know that another panel of three TEC chairmen will appear before the Select Committee. It is right that the House and the country should hear what the TECs are saying. They are criticising the Secretary of State and he knows that. Before the autumn statement they asked him not to cut the budget. It was cut and they asked him to make good the cuts in the Budget, but that has not been done. It is no good the Secretary of State sitting there shaking his head and squirming&#x2014;he knows that he is on a bad footing.</p>

<p>I am glad to follow the hon. Member for Newham, North-East (Mr. Leighton). I am always glad to follow him because, whatever I say, I am bound to appear more optimistic. His gloom&#x2014;especially over the European Community&#x2014;shows how essential it is to reduce inflation and to boost savings. The Budget has set out to do exactly that.<br/>
I am also glad to follow the hon. Gentleman because he is the only member of the Labour party present who has any chance of remembering what it was like when Labour was last in office. In its last year in office, it spent two and a half times less on training in real terms than the


Government are spending now. It is also worth remembering that the Labour party has difficulty with the whole business of training.<br/>
The hon. Member for Sedgefield (Mr. Blair) complained that the Budget did not contain initiatives to help the young or to help older workers who are unemployed, especially those with a lower level of skill. Yet it is interesting that when the youth training programme was introduced, Labour Members opposed it root and branch. Whenever they speak about it in the House, they give examples of how it is not working. The employment training programme was designed specially to help to bring those people back into the employment market. Perhaps it is not surprising that the present Labour party opposes the introduction of the employment training programme at every possible opportunity. I am not sure what the Labour party wants, although I know what some Labour-controlled local authorities want. No fewer than 13 Labour authorities have withdrawn altogether from the employment training programme.<br/>
We know that the Labour party wants a comprehensive system of vocational qualifications. One of the most encouraging features of training now is the move towards national vocational qualifications. An enormous amount of work has already been done and there is a huge amount still to do. I must tell my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State that the National Council for Vocational Qualifications needs to be a little careful about the elaboration with which it defines some of its competencies. It is putting a huge burden on many hard-working people and we may not need to be quite so refined.<br/>
The main point about the NCVQ and its work is that, for the first time, we have a way in which to find equivalence in the vast jungle of qualifications, which go from the bottom to the top of the training ladder. By the end of 1992, such qualifications will cover 80 per cent. of the work force. The national vocational qualification is the best instrument that this country has ever had for destroying the peculiarly British disease which rates academic learning higher than vocational learning. The universities already accept people on the basis of their national vocational qualifications. I want that to be carried through so that it covers everyone. We should then achieve the parity of esteem between academic learning and technological and vocational learning which is long overdue.<br/>
The Labour party also wants local training consortia. I am not quite sure what they are, but they sound quite like the training and enterprise councils. I am delighted that we are ahead of the Labour party and I am sure that it is pleased, too.<br/>
The Labour party also wants a 59 per cent. top rate of income tax&#x2014;undoubtedly a tremendous stimulus to the economy. It also wants a minimum wage. The issue that has put this country further behind in the training stakes than almost any other is the fact that the money that young people with no qualifications get is far too high a percentage of the money that those who have qualifications can achieve. The Labour party wants to enshrine that for ever by insisting on a minimum wage.<br/>
We should talk a little more about the good news. Yesterday, in the Palace of Westminster, I had the honour to give certificates to a number of key trainees who had been successful on employment training and on youth training courses. Their delight at having got their

qualifications and their tribute to the course that had taken them through were a welcome corrective to the rubbish on employment training and on youth training which is spoken in the House day after day by Opposition Members. If I am not mistaken, the Labour party's contribution to youth training would be to abolish it.<br/>
We also need to praise the provision in the Budget that has given tax relief to people who buy their own training. That change is long overdue. For far too long, individuals have regarded training as something that should be provided for them by the employer or by the state. Everything that we can do to encourage people to take individual responsibility for that is essential.<br/>
As my right hon. and learned Friend would expect, I must tell him that I am disturbed by the threat hanging over some high quality provision from voluntary organisations. I hope that even at this late stage more can be done to help.<br/>
The young homeless need to be helped back to work. I ask my right hon. and learned Friend whether there is any scope for using the employment offices to which such people go as their accommodation address. It is nonsense for young people to find themselves caught because they have no address and can get no benefit. If they can get no benefit, they find it difficult to get a job because they do not have an address. That is bureaucratic nonsense and we must be able to overcome it.</p>

<p>We have had a short and truncated debate, but one that was worth having. The statements made before the debate arise out of the Budget and the country will be able to judge the Government's inadequacies as a result of those statements and this debate. I pay tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Newham, North-East (Mr. Leighton) who, while not being as succinct as he usually is, this evening spelt out what the Confederation of British Industry and the Institute of Directors told the Select Committee. What they said is completely different from what the Government would have us believe that these bodies think about the economy.<br/>
I listened to the Secretary of State for Employment in amazement because what he said was "Through the Looking Glass" stuff. Everything in the garden is lovely, there is more training than ever before and more jobs, we are facing the problems of success&#x2014;where have we heard that phrase before?</p>

<p>Yes, he may have been biting the wrong mushroom.<br/>
We should look at last year's Red Book to see the forecast. These figures have been given before, and I make no apology for repeating them. Last year growth was estimated at 1&#x00B7;5 per cent. in the first half of 1991, but now the forecast is for a fall of 2 per cent. Last year, the Red Book forecast an increase in manufacturing output of 0&#x00B7;75 per cent.; the latest forecast is that it will fall by 5 per cent. Last year, fixed investment was forecast to decline, but not


by much&#x2014;0&#x00B7;75 per cent.&#x2014;and now the expectation is of a decline of 9&#x00B7;75 per cent. This is the second worst recession since the war.<br/>
No amount of gloss from Ministers will convince one of my constituents that the Government have got it right. Every day, the evening newspaper sets out job losses, losses in training places, general gloom and despondency. Until interest rates fall and the Government do something for employment, as opposed to saying that they will do something while in practice doing little, my constituents will remain unconvinced.<br/>
The training programme has been cut by &#x00A3;240 million. At some time in the future, &#x00A3;20 million will be returned, as a result of the Budget, but everyone in my constituency knows that there have been cuts. Great publicity has been given to the difficulties of students who have been on courses. To be fair, the training and enterprise councils are saying that the courses are finished, and that is a good thing, but many trainees do not know if they will get qualifications or whether they will be able to continue their courses.<br/>
I have a serious point about this Budget that is exemplified by an article on the front page of <i>The Times</i> today, which is headed:
<q>No tax cuts for four years, Lamont hints.</q>
The Conservative party is keen to tell us that it has been cutting taxes ever since it came into office, but what it means is that income taxes have been cut. Ten or 11 years ago, income tax rates were higher, with a basic rate of 33p.</p>

<p>The Secretary of State knows perfectly well that Labour party policy is to have a range of income tax rates based on the amount of money that people earn. That is a fair principle that has somehow escaped the Conservative party in relation to the poll tax until, miraculously, this afternoon.<br/>
Taxation as a percentage of gross domestic product has been consistently higher under this Administration, since 1979, and it will continue to be so.<br/>
Under the previous Labour Government it was only about 33 or 34 per cent.&#x2014;quite a low figure. As soon as the Conservative Administration came into office, the figure shot up to 38 or 39 per cent. The people of Britain will now realise what we mean by the phase, "taxation as a percentage of gross domestic product", because VAT will increase from 15 to 17&#x00B7;5 per cent. Traders will put prices up and the excuse will be that VAT has risen.<br/>
If the article in <i>The Times</i> reported the Chancellor of the Exchequer correctly, there is no prospect of taxation being brought down. The Conservative party is a party of high taxation. [HON. MEMBERS: "No."] Yes, it is. The forecasts are that taxation as a percentage of GDP will remain at 37 per cent. in the next year. Of course, the poll tax will not have helped in any way. That is why at the next general election the Conservative party will be seen by the electorate for what it is. It is empty of promises, incompetent&#x2014;as the poll tax farrago has shown&#x2014;and it will be turfed out justifiably.</p>

<p>This has been an interesting, if somewhat abbreviated, and intimate debate. I should have liked to comment on the speeches of my right hon. and hon. Friends, but clearly there is no time. I reiterate that the Budget, which is designed to help business, has been warmly welcomed by the Confederation of British Industry, the National Federation of Self Employed and Small Businesses, the Association of British Chambers of Commerce and the Institute of Directors. They all made the point that the Chancellor had listened to what business had to say.<br/>
The Budget also helped families by increasing child benefit and it helped the community charge payer. For the information of Opposition Members, a couple receiving the full relief&#x2014;a total of &#x00A3;280&#x2014;on community charge would need to spend &#x00A3;13,000 on standard VAT-rated goods to be worse off.<br/>
In debates on the Budget attention has rightly been concentrated on major matters and there is no time to speak about the many imaginative measures in the Budget, including the training measures which add to the &#x00A3;2&#x00B7;7 billion already being spent by the Government on training, the &#x00A3;20 billion being spent by employers and the new measures announced by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor, on which I congratulate him. There is no time to go into all those measures.<br/>
I wish to make one brief announcement which will be welcomed by the House about help for the disabled with their transport needs. It affects coach operators who have responded positively to the needs of disabled persons by fitting up their coaches to carry wheelchairs. Such operators sometimes laid themselves open to a tax penalty because their vehicles no longer had sufficient seats to avoid paying VAT and car tax. I am delighted to be able to say that not only will such operators no longer have to pay car tax and VAT where only the provision of wheelchair space made them liable but that Customs will consider claims for refunds from operators who have been caught and still have the vehicle.<br/>
Opposition Members have convenient memories. In their doom-laden comments they forget that while there is, indeed, a recession it comes after a period of unprecedented growth and that in the three years to 1989 business investment rose by 43 per cent. They forget that from 1981 to 1990 the United Kingdom economy grew by almost 30 per cent. and that in the same period unemployment fell by 1&#x00B7;5 million and jobs increased by 3&#x00B7;25 million. They forget that more people of working age are at work in the United Kingdom than in any other European Community member state. Moreover, they forget that unemployment increased under each and every Labour Government since the war.<br/>
Last night we were treated to an impressive and enjoyable display of the operatic knowledge of the hon. Member for Brent, South (Mr. Boateng). We were all greatly impressed by the extent of his knowledge. But tonight the utterances of Opposition Members reminded me of quite another song&#x2014;Noel Coward's "There are bad times just around the corner".<br/>
The Budget has helped business, families, the community charge payer, the disabled and the environment, and it means that good times are just around the corner for Britain and for the Government. The bad times


round the corner will be for the Opposition. They long for an election, but so do we, because when it comes we know that the electorate will see the Opposition's outworn and unconvincing policies for what they are.</p>

<p>It is almost eight years since I made my maiden spech on the controversial subject of coastguard reorganisation&#x2014;and at that time the Chamber was as full as it is now, that also being an Adjournment debate.<br/>
The debate that I am now initiating is about the review which the Government plan to put in hand into the whole question of the sectoral organisation of Her Majesty's coastguard, and particularly the auxiliary coastguard service. I made my maiden speech against the background of the Penlee disaster and, of course, the Penlee lifeboat was based in my constituency. After that disaster there was considerable concern about the reorganisation of the coastguard service in the south-west and especially in Cornwall.<br/>
In my maiden speech I asked for certain assurances, particularly about the retention of regular manning of the three remaining look-outs manned by auxiliaries in my constituency. The manning arrangements for those look-outs are unique because they are the only ones in the country that are regularly manned. The three look-outs are at Gwenap head, which is near Land's End and is manned for 24 hours a day every day of the year, the Lizard, which is manned for 12 hours a day, and St. Ives, which is manned for six to eight hours a day.<br/>
In reply to that debate, my hon. Friend the Member for Hampshire, North-West (Sir D. Mitchell), who was then the Minister for Shipping and Public Transport, assured me that I would be given prior warning of any change that was contemplated in the manning arrangements of those look-outs. In accordance with that pledge, my hon. Friend the present Minister for Shipping, who I am glad to say will reply to this debate, wrote to me on 23 January saying that there was now a possibility that regular manning would be stopped at those three look-out stations. He told me that a few days later he would announce in a written answer that there had been an internal review into the auxiliary coastguard station and that there was a question mark over the future of the three look-out stations.<br/>
I informed my hon. Friend right away of my total opposition to the possible abolition of regular manning at those stations. I base my argument for their retention on the simple fact that by any yardstick my constituency is remarkably exposed and has a very dangerous coastline. That fact is emphasised by another fact, that there are five major deep sea lifeboats&#x2014;not rubber duck lifeboats&#x2014;in my constituency. That is far more than in any other constituency in Britain. This all stems from the geographical position of the constituency, which juts out into the Atlantic and takes in the Isles of Scilly, Iand's End, the Lizard and quite a large slice of the north coast of Cornwall.<br/>
As a result of the warning that the Minister kindly gave me, in accordance with the pledge, I was able to alert local people and others to the threat hanging over these three look-outs, and to the fact that a review was in progress. A few days later that review was announced in a written answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Isle of Wight (Mr. Field) in what can only be described as a rather bland


reply, in which the Minister said that he had deposited in the Library an eight-page summary of the internal review document.<br/>
I would not quarrel with parts of the document. I am not arguing that it was not necessary to hold such a review. From time to time in any organisation it makes sense to see how it is working. I am, however, certainly arguing against one of its recommendations&#x2014;about the three look-outs I have mentioned&#x2014;and I certainly want to ask questions about the way in which the review has been and is being conducted.<br/>
Because I drew local attention to the situation, I received many letters, as did my hon. Friend the Minister, and as did the regional controller of the coastguard, Commander David Eliot. I pay tribute to him; he has a job to do and I do not mean in any way to criticise him.<br/>
I have had letters from honorary secretaries of lifeboats in my constituency. I have received many letters from the sea fish industry committee of the county council, from fishermen, from the Cornish Fish Producers Organisation and from the South West Hand Liners Association. Fishermen are extremely worried about the proposals for the look-outs and about the review in general.<br/>
I have also had letters from all the councils involved&#x2014;from, for instance, St. Ives town council, which was aghast at suggestions that the busy holiday town of St. Ives might lose its look-out, which keeps a weather eye on what is happening at sea and on what is happening to the holiday beaches of the town. There have been four fatalities in St. Ives this year alone. The holiday industry there is dismayed by the prospect of anything happening to the look-out or of its hours being reduced.<br/>
Others are also worried about the operation. As the weeks have gone by other hon. Members have become aware of it, I suspect partly because of representations from the auxiliary coastguards to the effect that such a move was afoot. I am delighted to see the hon. Member for Truro (Mr. Taylor) in his place. I hope that he wil be able to catch the Chair's eye later to voice the concerns of his constituency.<br/>
I am convinced that if I had not been granted my previous Adjournment debate or been given my pledge some years ago, much of this would have happened without people knowing it. I am sorry to say that even now we do not know the full details of what is being contemplated. In a series of written questions I asked the Minister if he would place in the Library a copy of the full document of the internal review. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will change his mind tonight and will make that document available to hon. Members in the Library.<br/>
I hope that, once the regional controllers put forward their detailed proposals on how to implement the review&#x2014;that is the task that they have been given&#x2014;hon. Members and others will be told exactly what is being proposed. I am sorry to say that my hon. Friend the Minister felt that he could not agree to that. He said, perfectly reasonably, that it is not usual for the advice of civil servants or officials to be made public and I understand that. However, my plea tonight is that he will change the Government's attitude toward the conduct of the review that he hopes to implement within a couple of months.<br/>
People must be told exactly what the Government have in mind. I do not mean simply the proposals in the intial document but what will be proposed by the regional controllers, what my hon. Friend the Minister decides as a result of those proposals, and what will happen to the structure of the auxiliary coastguard service. Some 4,400 auxiliaries, who are dedicated volunteers, are now stationed around the coastline of the United Kingdom. I do not know&#x2014;my hon. Friend the Minister says that he does not know either&#x2014;how many will be in place once the review has been implemented. I am sure that their number will be reduced, and I suspect that the reduction could be considerable.<br/>
According to the summary document, the review recommends that the deployment of auxiliaries should be changed. It rightly says that the present disposition is largely based on historical factors. In many areas, the position has probably changed but it is being suggested that, instead of companies of auxiliaries placed with some frequency around the coastline, a fast response team of two or four men would go out and assess emergencies. There would also be a back-up team that could be called out for serious emergencies. I suspect that there may be a very long coastline between one back-up team and the next, and that it may take some time to summon sufficient response to serious emergencies.<br/>
It is the job of regional controllers to make detailed proposals, and it is imperative that all interested and concerned organisations should know exactly what is being proposed before my hon. Friend the Minister makes his final decision. In statements earlier today, other Ministers said that they had consulted widely on matters of great importance to the country's future. I hope that there will be wide consultation on this matter so that people can give their expert judgment on the suggestions.<br/>
People should be consulted not just because it makes good sense but because my hon. Friend the Minister knows perfectly well that past reorganisation of the coastguard service has been highly emotive and controversial. I do not need to remind him, for example, of the recent controversy over the closure of the Hartland coastguard station. I am desperately afraid that, unless he adopts an open approach on this issue, people will be, and may have good grounds for being, suspicious about it. Therefore, it is in everyone's best interests for my hon. Friend the Minister to adopt the open approach that I am advocating tonight.<br/>
The auxiliaries are dedicated volunteers who are paid little money but care desperately and passionately about the service that they provide. They are in a difficult position because they rightly feel that they cannot speak out. It is to their credit that they have not gone rushing off to the papers to spread scare stories; they are highly responsible men and women. I have contacts with them and I know how responsible they are and how some of them feel about what might be in the air.<br/>
I do not think it is fair on the auxiliaries or their officers, particularly the regional controllers, to be the subject of unfair criticism over the review. Therefore, I plead with my hon. Friend the Minister to hide nothing and, once he has received the advice and recommendations of the regional controllers and made up his mind on how the review should be implemented, will tell not just Members of Parliament, but the public, certainly those who feel strongly about this issue, who should know exactly what is being proposed. My hon. Friend the Minister has been


kind enough to offer me, and no doubt other hon. Members, meetings to discuss the matter. I do not want us to be presented with a fait accompli through a written answer.<br/>
I know that my hon. Friend the Minister has listened carefully, and I hope, with confidence, that he will heed what I have said tonight. I believe that I am speaking for many people, many hon. Members and, more importantly, for all those people around the coastline who regard the coastguard service as an absolute necessity and believe that any changes made to its organisation and structure should be approached with the greatest care and completed in a totally open manner.</p>

<p>I thank the hon. Member for St. Ives (Mr. Harris) for giving me the opportunity to speak now and for raising the issue in the House, having won the opportunity to debate it. It is an important issue that, ultimately, boils down to life saving. I heartily endorse everything that the hon. Gentleman has said tonight and about which he has been campaigning for some time.<br/>
I have some direct experience of the situation in the hon. Gentleman's constituency because I was present and summoned the rescue services to a drowning on the other side of St. Ives bay some years ago when I was 16. The person was taken out of the water alive but, sadly, died later in hospital. That incident gave me a direct appreciation of exactly what goes on in such circumstances.<br/>
The essential point being put tonight relates to the three look-out posts. They are not in my constituency and I can simply support what the hon. Gentleman said. More generally, the debate deals with the nature of the review that is taking place. My concern relates partly to my constituency but also to national issues. It is not so long since the awful situation in north Devon raised considerable concern. People are worried whenever there is perceived to be a threat to the local service and the local knowledge that it provides in emergencies.<br/>
The case in the Mevagissey district which hit the headlines was precisely the same as that just described, but nothing was made public officially. Information began to come out in dribs and drabs about what was to be proposed. First, we were told that the look-out post would go. I now understand that it will remain at Mevagissey, but with a 50 per cent. cut in manning levels on that section of coast and a 50 per cent. extension of the area of coast to be covered. That naturally makes the coastguards concerned about the question of rapid response, particularly given their current aim for a 20-minute response time. They are now told that the target will be 30 minutes. I understand that Ministers hope to even up as well as down, so that the 30-minute response time will apply everywhere. Currently, it does not exist in every area, but naturally in a district where the response time is estimated to be 20 minutes an increase in that time is a matter of considerable concern.<br/>
I hope that the Minister will respond to the point that the hon. Member for St. Ives made that any proposals should be made openly so that people know what is going on and can express their concerns locally before finding out that an announcement has been made.</p>

<p>First and foremost, I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for St. Ives (Mr. Harris) on securing this Adjournment debate. I am aware of the deep feelings in his constituency about the coastguard service and of his great interest in the service.<br/>
My hon. Friend mentioned the Penlee lifeboat disaster, which had a tremendous effect on the nation and lives in its mind. In the few minutes remaining, I should like to answer as many points as possible that my hon. Friend made.<br/>
I was surprised by the hon. Member for Truro (Mr. Taylor) saying that information leaked out in dribs and drabs. The review was carried out, and when I released it to the trade unions I felt it right to answer a question in the House and place a summary of the recommendations in the Library. I thought that the summary went some way to answering some of the points, but I will deal with the specific point that my hon. Friend the Member for St. Ives made.<br/>
Before discussing the review's findings, it may be helpful to explain what the sector organisation is and how it relates to the rest of the coastguard service.<br/>
The primary function of the coastguard is to provide a maritime search and rescue co-ordination service by maintaining 24-hour radio distress and 999 emergency telephone watch at 21 centres around the United Kingdom. From those stations, the majority of emergency incidents are co-ordinated, using whatever rescue resources are available to the coastguard from a variety of sources. That is an important point. That aspect of the coastguard's role is not covered in the review.<br/>
The sector and auxiliary organisation represents another arm of the service that provides on-the-spot coastal support to operational centres, with about 100 full-time sector officers supported, as my hon. Friend said, by 4,500 auxiliary coastguard volunteers. That aspect of the service was under review.<br/>
The auxiliary coastguards are volunteers, but normally they are called out for only a few hours each month for exercises or training. They provide an ever-ready band of enthusiastic men and women who unstintingly give their time to assist the regular coastguard service. Although they are only one component of the United Kingdom's search and rescue organisation, they remain a valuable asset in providing an essential coastal response and local knowledge. I join my hon. Friend the Member for St. Ives in paying tribute to their unstinting and important work for our coastguard service.<br/>
The sector and auxiliary organisation was set up following the reorganisation of the coastguard, as recommended by the Lavers report of 1974. The number of sectors and the size and location of auxiliary companies, which were established mainly to man breeches buoy rescue equipment, undoubtedly met the requirements of the day, but the situation on the coastline has changed in the intervening years. There has been a marked decrease in the number of vessels that, formerly, were wrecked around our coasts, but an increase in the number of leisure-related incidents involving holidaymakers and pleasure craft. The requirement to rescue stranded mariners by breeches buoy has been replaced by the greater availability of all-weather helicopters and fast lifeboats. In some cases, it must be


accepted that the disposition, size and coverage provided by the coastguard coastal sector organisation is based on historical rather than current requirements.<br/>
I therefore consider that the review is timely and will give an opportunity to assess the efficiency and effectiveness of the coastguard's response in meeting current requirements. As my hon. Friend the Member for St. Ives said, there were several aspects of the review with which no one would argue, such as setting out the role of the coastguard and trying to achieve more regular response times.<br/>
The review is wide ranging in its scope. It considers the coastguard's coastal commitments, responsiveness, the sector organisation, the sector officer's tasks, the coastguard auxiliary service, transport, both ashore and afloat, equipment including communications equipment, training requirements, and associated administrative functions and methodology.<br/>
The coastal commitments of the coastguard have evolved over the years. Currently, they consist of an amalgam of statutory duties, non-statutory duties, habitual and traditional tasks. The role and objectives of the service need to be clarified and widely promulgated. Accordingly, the review addresses those issues.<br/>
Future requirements for manpower and equipment cannot be determined without target performance standards. The time from call-out to achieving a presence on scene depends on a variety of factors, including local geography, population density, potential for incidents and their frequency and the availability of other emergency resources. It will be appreciated that some of those factors are not necessarily quantifiable. I shall therefore be looking for a result that is realistic and practical. The review recommends certain response criteria which will provide a base line for assessing whether coverage is satisfactory in each area around the coastline.<br/>
Our coastline varies and different responses are needed. At some times of the year, a tremendous number of holidaymakers visit St. Ives and at other times of the year it is not so busy. We must get the balance right. I accept the importance of this issue to the constituents of my hon. Friend the Member for St. Ives and of the hon. Member for Truro.<br/>
The local knowledge of sector officers, coupled with their operational availability and expertise, is an essential part of the coastal response and will continue to be so. The review examines their job description and draws attention to the fact that, although some officers are fully stretched, others could accept a greater range of tasks with no detriment to the service. This is therefore one of the matters that regional controllers will assess.<br/>
Auxiliary coastguards form a vital part of the coastguard service. Auxiliary coastguards, both men and women, undertake a wide variety of tasks on a voluntary basis to serve the local community and the mariner at large. Some auxiliaries are trained to work as radio operators in operation centres, but with the demise of the breeches buoy, the majority are now organised into teams trained in cliff and mud rescue techniques and shoreline searches and trained to provide vital intelligence as well as providing on-the-spot co-ordination when necessary. In some cases, the size and location of these teams is still based on historical, rather than current, requirements, so

regional controllers are now examining where coverage needs to be improved to meet the response criteria and, conversely, where savings could be made.<br/>
The important issue of look-outs worries my hon. Friend the Member for St. Ives. The Lavers report concluded that a visual distress watch was not cost-effective, with only a very small percentage of incidents observed directly by coastguards from fixed look-outs. Since the end of the 1970s most of those look-outs have been phased out and the coastguard has maintained radio distress watch at its operations centres, the remainder of reports being received from the 999 emergency telephone system.<br/>
However, in casualty risk situations and in special circumstances, some form of visual watch may still be necessary. Rather than rely upon fixed look-outs with restricted areas of visibility, this need can perhaps best be satisfied by the use of fast response vehicles with appropriate radio communications and rescue equipment able to travel quickly to those parts of the coastline which a fixed look-out is unable to cover. The review therefore recommends reconsideration of the case for retaining the three fixed look-outs.<br/>
The review also considers whether the payment of out-of-pocket expenses to auxiliaries can be improved and simplified. It is also appreciated that there is need for auxiliary coastguards to be recognised by the public at large while performing their essential duties. An examination of the uniform requirements is therefore to be undertaken.<br/>
The review is a consultation document. No decision has been taken. I have insisted on full consultation at local level with interested parties before recommendations to implement the review are made. This process is under way nationwide. I am sorry that my hon. Friend the Member for St. Ives feels that there has been some secrecy. There should not have been any secrecy and I would deeply regret it if that had occurred. I intended to make the review as widely available as possible, which is why I published the summary.<br/>
Since the review was published in January, my officials have received a large number of contributions, most of which have been constructive. Understandably, many people wish to be assured that there will be no reduction in the coastguard's ability to provide an adequate response to emergencies along our coastline. It is also pleasing to note that, in general, the review has been welcomed by the coastguard service as a whole, which sees it as providing a sensible framework on which to build for the future.<br/>
I look forward to receiving the advice of coastguard regional controllers&#x2014;through the Chief Coastguard&#x2014;on how the review findings may be applied to their particular region. I have already agreed to meet my hon. Friend the Member for St. Ives and other hon. Members before I make a decision, which will probably be in June.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for St. Ives asked me to put a full copy of the review in the Library. I did not do so in the first place because it went into a lot of technical detail. Following my hon. Friend's strenuous representations, I shall certainly place a full copy in the Library.<br/>
I know that the House reaffirms its support for our coastguard system. We must all ask ourselves how to provide the best service and the best coastal rescue system for our entire coastline. There is a lot of it. It varies and different responses are needed in different areas. I hope that, with the commitment of my hon. Friend the Member


for St. Ives and other hon. Members, we will get it right so that we have the best possible coastguard service, meeting the needs of all the constituencies along our coastline and of all those constituents who use our coast and may need to use our coastguard service.<br/>
