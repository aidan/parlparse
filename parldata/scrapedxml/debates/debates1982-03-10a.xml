<p>Secretary of State for Transport what is his estimate of the likely reduction of fatal accidents on the road as a result of the forthcoming introduction of the compulsory wearing of seat belts.</p>

<p>While seat belts undoubtedly save lives, I do not believe that it is possible to estimate what the effect of compulsory wearing would be. Too much depends not only on the level of wearing but on other factors such as the relative propensity to accidents of wearers and non-wearers.</p>

<p>When does the Minister expect the lifesaving measure, which will make front seat belt wearing compulsory, to come into effect? Who will be exempted? Will she consider extending the protection and rules to rear seat passengers?</p>

<p>I believe that it will be possible to consider regulations later in the year, I hope as quickly as possible, but I do not wish to give an exact date. I hope that that will be shortly after Easter. The hon. and learned Gentleman asked about extending the use of belts to passengers in rear seats. Unbelted rear seat occupants can cause injury to those in the front. Therefore, the Government are keeping the question of rear seat belts under careful consideration. Most new cars are provided with rear seat anchorage points, and all cars manufactured after 1 October 1981 are required to provide them. Medical exemptions will be for the doctors to decide.</p>

<p>I congratulate my hon. Friend on her new appointment, but is she yet aware that the medical commission has recommended so few exemptions on medical grounds that the public in Britain will be so infuriated that it is highly probable that those against compulsion will win when this matter is reconsidered in 1984?

<p>I shall certainly consider my hon. and learned Friend's last point. I thank him for his kind remarks.

<p>I hope that my hon. Friend will not be a promoter of the extension of the nanny Stale. I congratulate her most warmly on her change of position. Can she say how many people will be killed as a result of the decision of the House that people should be compelled to wear seat belts when travelling in the front seats of a car? Many people have been involved in accidents in which, if they had been wearing a seat belt, they would have been killed.</p>

<p>I must tell my hon. Friend, despite his kind remarks, that I should not be here today but for the wearing of a seat belt. Only 18 per cent. of the fatalities are people wearing front seat belts. About 30 per cent. of passengers and drivers wear them voluntarily at the moment. I do not believe in nannying anyone, but measures taken in the futherance of safety and a reduction of accidents and deaths are, to me, an important preventive measure.</p>

<p>I am well aware of the pressure on some of our motorways, and particularly on sections of the M6 and Ml. My hon. Friend will know that plans are afoot to extend the M62 and the M40. We shall do as much as is feasible. It is important to note that we have done more work for less money and will have spent 15 per cent. more in 1981&#x2013;82 than we spent in 1980&#x2013;81.</p>

<p>I assure my hon. Friend that I give top priority to the completion of the M25. As my hon.

<p>No doubt the Secretary of State is aware that British Rail is very concerned that the lack of investment may be causing a deterioration in permanent way structures and track maintenance. Will the right hon. Gentleman ensure that an inquiry is conductd into the derailment of a freight train today at Leeds? That train was hauling a flask that usually contains nuclear waste, but which was, fortunately, empty. An inquiry must be held to ensure that no such accidents could arise from a deterioration in the standards of track maintenance due to lack of investment.</p>

<p>In the first case, such incidents are for British Rail to consider. Track renewal and maintenance has been put outside the investment ceiling to enable British Rail to spend the required amounts.

<p>Will my right hon. Friend bear in mind that the amount of investment in track and so on depends on the demand for the service?

<p>Does the right hon. Gentleman recall that over three months ago he agreed to the request

<p>If it is decided to have a fixed Channel link, the type of scheme decided upon will determine the promoting group that is best suited to providing such a scheme.

<p>In my right hon. Friend's timetable for the implementation of the White Paper, which will come first&#x2014;the heavier lorries, their safety requirements, the bypasses, the motorways, the route control or the weighing machines that will be required to keep a check on these vehicles?</p>

<p>The package of controls on lorries which I believe is necessary to prevent what is at present a bad situation from getting worse, must go hand in hand with any changes in maximum weights or, indeed, maximum heights&#x2014;where the proposal is that there should be a limit. All those things should go together as a package. At the same time, the Government have announced a substantial bypass programme, which has been speeded up, and that should also go forward. All in all, it is essential to tackle the environmental impact of what in many cases are extremely offensive vehicles. A competitive advantage can accrue to the freight industry if we combine that with a sensible package of lorry controls as a comprehensive whole. That is the Government's approach.</p>

<p>Does the right hon.

<p>The hon. Gentleman should accept the point I made earlier&#x2014;that the present situation is bad and getting worse. There is a strong case for a comprehensive package of controls on lorries, including safety, lorry routing and a number of other developments. Many people will be extremely concerned if these things are let slip yet again. That ought to go hand in hand with allowing a heavier maximum weight to allow the industry to compete and to find the cost of these extra controls. That is a sensible and balanced approach, which many people will appreciate.</p>

<p>I thank my hon. Friend for that answer.

<p>My hon. Friend makes an important point. About 850 lorry control schemes have been introduced on amenity grounds since my hon. Friend promoted the 1973 Act, known as the Dyke's Act.

<p>Does not the fact that there is scope for further controls indicate that there is already widespread apprehension about the use of lorries?

<p>Unfortunately, my hon. Friend is right. The figures show a slight decline in percentage terms over the years in the amount of freight carried by the railways.

<p>The Secretary of State cannot be allowed to get away with that. He has had British Rail's electrification proposals for more than two years.

<p>I suggest no such thing.

<p>I can confirm that substantial sums were involved in interest payments as a result of the non-collection of revenue arising out of last year's industrial dispute.

<p>With permission, Mr. Speaker, I should like to express the great sense of loss which the country and Parliament have sustained by the death of Lord Butler of Saffron Walden, and to extend our sympathy to his family, especially to my hon. Friend the Member for Bosworth (Mr. Butler).<br/>
Rab Butler was one of the greatest statesmen and most distinguished personalities of our time. He was, indeed, a giant of his generation. His long, busy, active life was dominated by one overriding purpose&#x2014;to serve his country and his fellow men.<br/>
He was determined to continue his family tradition of public service. His father had been Governor of the Central Provinces in India and Master of Pembroke College, Cambridge.<br/>
Rab's early years were a characteristically meticulous preparation for the path which he had chosen to follow. At Cambridge he won a double first and became President of the Union. At the age of 27 he was elected to this House and represented the same constituency without interruption for 36 years before he went to another place.<br/>
He was in office for 26 out of those 36 years, half of them as a member of the Cabinet. Within three years of his arrival in the House of Commons he became Under-Secretary at the India Office, and then at the Foreign Office, before becoming Minister of Education in 1941. It was in that capacity that I first heard him speak&#x2014;at Oxford.<br/>
His four years in that Department were among the most rewarding of his life. He regarded the Education Act of 1944 as a deep and abiding contribution to the future of his country. Then followed a brief spell as Minister of Labour.<br/>
After the defeat of his party in 1945, Rab was the major intellectual force in refashioning policy for the post-war world. Mr. Churchill appointed him as chairman of the research department and no chairman has ever exercised as powerful or as lasting an influence as Rab.<br/>
He became Chancellor of the Exchequer in the first post-war Conservative Government. His first Budget Statement, delivered 30 years ago tomorrow, concluded with these words:
<q>We must now set forth, braced and resolute, to show the world that we shall regain our solvency and, with it, our national greatness."&#x2014;[<i>Official Report,</i> 11 March 1952; Vol. 497, c. 1305.]</q>
Rab was a patriot, a scholar and a statesman. Whether at the Treasury or as Leader of the House, as Lord Privy Seal or Home Secretary, as First Secretary of State or Foreign Secretary, his patriotism, his scholarship, as well as his genius as a politician, shone through.<br/>
Twice during those years, in 1957 and in 1963, he suffered grievous disappointment. He allowed neither event to diminish his zeal or his work for the cause which he served throughout his life.<br/>
Although we remember him primarily as a statesman and politician, there were two other aspects of Rab's life which meant so much to him. He was devoted to the cause of learning. He was High Steward of Cambridge university for six years and Chancellor of Sheffield university and of the university of Essex. But nothing gave him greater pride

than his presidency of the Royal Society of Literature and his mastership of Trinity. It was singularly fitting that he, with so much experience at home and abroad, with a deep understanding of our constitution, should have been master when the heir to the throne became an undergraduate at Trinity.<br/>
Throughout his arduous life, Rab was supported by a loving family. His first wife died in 1954. He married again in 1959 and Lady Butler brought a new comfort and purpose into his life.<br/>
The last 17 years of Rab's life were spent out of office, but they, like the earlier years, were filled with achievement and the pride of a united family, and all the while the sometimes indiscreet but always lovable sense of humour kept coming through.<br/>
On the day that Winston Churchill resigned in 1955, Rab wrote to him saying:
<q>this time with you has given me &#x2026; the strength to face all things quietly.</q>
He ended with the words of St. Augustine:
<q>Let nothing disturb thee, Let nothing affright thee, All passeth away, God alone will stay, Patience obtaineth all things.</q>
Those words are also a fitting tribute to the man whom we honour today.</p>

<p>I am glad to respond to the Prime Minister's remarks and also to offer the Opposition's sympathies to Lady Butler and to the hon. Member for Bosworth (Mr. Butler).<br/>
I can remember Rab Butler in this House over many years. The Opposition regarded him not only as one who made a considerable contribution to the politics of the period but also as a formidable opponent. In the early period, it is natural enough that some of us regarded him in a different light. The Abb&#x00E9; Siey&#x00E9;s was once asked what he did in the French Revolution. He replied that he had survived. Lord Butler survived. He survived through the 1930s and the later period. Indeed, he survived so successfully that I believe that most of those on this side of the House who knew him best expected that he would become the Leader of the Conservative Party and Prime Minister.<br/>
I remember vividly, in 1957, in those far-off days of the inscrutable process by which the Conservative Party then chose its leader, the morning of the announcement that Mr. Harold Macmillan had been chosen to succeed. I remember my conversation on that occasion with Aneurin Bevan and the gasp of astonishment that he unloosed. He, I am sure, like many of us, believed that Rab Butler was likely to be chosen as Leader.<br/>
Rab went on to make many other contributions. Many of his writings, I believe, have added to the politics of the country. He wrote one of the best political autobiographies under the title "The Art of the Possible". I conversed with him a short while before the book had that title ascribed to it. I suggested that the title should be different, that it should be called "The Best Possible Prime Minister". He would not accept my suggestion. No doubt it was partly wisdom and partly modesty which led him to refuse that title.<br/>
Rab was the master of the compliment that kills, of the embrace that can suffocate; he could make a stab in the back seem like a caress and he carried his writings and


instruction right up to later days. Not only would I recommend "The Art of the Possible" to anyone who wishes to know how the Conservative Party has survived so long against all the odds, but I would also recommend the introduction to Disraeli's "Sybil" which I believe was one of Rab's last writings.<br/>
Contrary to any supposition that there might be, Lord Butler was not an admirer of Disraeli. I know that fashions change in these matters. Indeed, I suppose that in a sense, although he would never have used the term himself, Lord Butler might have been described as the original "wet".<br/>
Lord Butler approached his own politics in his own way, and although he was scornful of Disraeli in many respects, in his introduction to Disraeli's "Sybil", with the touch of irony that added to everything that he said, he wrote:
<q>Even today there is in Britain a 'one nation group' led by Lord Hailsham and Lord Hinchingbrooke which is dedicated to uniting the rich and the poor.</q>
As I believe the right hon. Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell) wrote in <i>The Times</i> this morning, the witticisms of Lord Butler were always deliberate and I think that they were deliberate in the sentence that I have quoted. I doubt whether Lord Hailsham and Lord Hinchingbrooke have exchanged a word in the past two decades. Moreover, I doubt whether Lord Butler, who was never a member of the "one nation" group, was as enthusiastic about it as that sentence might suggest.<br/>
Lord Butler presented politics to the nation in an original manner and tone and the Opposition are happy to join the Prime Minister in the tribute that she has paid.</p>

<p>The Liberal and Social Democratic Parties would like to be associated with the tributes that have been paid to Lord Butler and with the sympathy offered to his widow.<br/>
Together with Harcourt and Joseph Chamberlain, Rab was one of the trio of leading politicians of their time who never became Prime Minister. Yet he has left an imprint on our affairs greater than that left by many Prime Ministers. The background against which all parties have developed their policies on education and the Home Office derives not only from the reforms that he introduced but from his capacity to crystallise opinion and to generate consensus. Butskellism can be seen as the practical application of the doctrines of Keynes&#x2014;the patron saint of responsible capitalism and the mentor of those who try to manage the mixed economy.<br/>
Rab was at once a reforming and a unifying figure in a post-war world in which, without him, politics might have been much more abrasive. I personally regret that he did not become Prime Minister after Suez. I believe that Britain at that time was ready for wider reforms of the type at which he excelled and which, had they been carried out with the good will that he engendered, would greatly have improved the performance of our industry, our industrial relations and the well-being of our country.<br/>
His talents, his kindness and his taste are celebrated. Everyone was always glad to see Rab. People gravitated towards him and were often rewarded by the latest Rabism. His illuminating ambiguities said more than many straight answers, and the expected oblique was part of his charm. I once asked him to dinner on a certain

Wednesday. After consulting his diary long and earnestly, he looked up and said with an absolutely straight face, "If you had asked me on Tuesday, I could not have come."<br/>
We shall all always miss him, and our heartfelt wishes go out to his widow and family.</p>

<p>The Chancellor of the Exchequer in his speech yesterday remarked that there are few left in this House who heard R. A. Butler introduce his first Budget. Perhaps one who not only heard that speech but worked under and with R. A. Butler for six years before that may add a few words to what has been said.<br/>
In the many tributes, written and spoken, of the past 24 hours, one important trait has strangely and unduly been absent. There has not been adequate reference to the attention and respect which Rab Butler commanded in this House. No man can occupy any position in the politics of this country who has not learnt to deserve the respect and to govern the attention of the House of Commons. Schooled perhaps by his experiences in those difficult years of defending the sometimes scarcely defensible in the 1930s, he had learned that art and had gained that position as few others have done. Whether the occasion was a little one or a great one, the House looked forward to what Rab Butler would say, knowing that it would not be disappointed.<br/>
Reference has been made already to a certain peculiar turn of his wit&#x2014;the Rabism, as it was called&#x2014;of which those of us who loved him most were the most zealous collectors. It might perhaps be called the art of the backhander. I am certain, however, that it betokened no meanness or bitterness of spirit nor any desire to injure, but was a sign of the deep and humorous comprehension of his fellow men and of the world which sometimes took the form of that self-deprecatory expression&#x2014;for the Rabism was always in part directed against Rab himself.<br/>
It is more than 16 years since he sat in this House. When we go hence, our room is soon filled, and we are soon forgotten. Those who knew Rab Butler will be glad that the time and space were still not so long that those who knew and remembered him could not bring their tribute where he would most have wished it&#x2014;to the Floor of the House today.</p>

<p>As the current Member for the constituency that Lord Butler represented in this House for so long, I should like to add my tribute. That he was a great statesman requires no repetition from me. Nor do I need to enlarge on his skills and sensitivity as a politician. It is worth remarking, however, what a tremendous source of inspiration he was to many people of my generation in their formative political years. He has undoubtedly left his mark on the politics of this country&#x2014;a mark which many of us regard as indelible.<br/>
I venture to suggest that nowhere outside the family circle, to whose members I send my personal condolences. will he be more greatly mourned than among the people whom he represented and the communities that he served in the towns and villages of north-west Essex. For all that Rab held high office and moved in the highest circles during most of his 35 years' membership of this House, he was the most attentive of constituency Members. His devotion to the details of constituency life earned him an


enviable reputation. For as long as it exists, I doubt whether Saffron Walden will ever be thought of as other than Rab's seat.<br/>
In the past four-and-a-half years, I have been struck by the volume of tales, memories and anecdotes about what Mr. Butler did for people and their continuing affection and regard for him. Whenever I had the privilege of seeing him in these last years, he would always end by saying, "Give them my love." I can attest that that love is returned in the fullest measure by the people of Saffron Walden. The reputation of being at heart a good constituency man is an essential part of the statesman whom we honour today, and I suspect that it is the epitaph which Rab himself would most appreciate.</p>

He was to me not only a friend, a mentor, and a critic, but also an inspirer. He will be remembered long, not only in my constituency and in the House&#x2014;as the right hon.

I served in the House for 21 years when Rab Butler was a Member. His kindness to people who sat on the other side of the House from himself was something to be experienced and never forgotten.</p>

<speech hansard_id="96235" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1982-03-10a.850.1" hansard_membership_id="4250" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2716" speakername="The Secretary of State for Social Services (Mr. Norman Fowler)" colnum="850" time="15:51:00">
<p>I will, with permission, Mr. Speaker, make a statement required by the Social Security Act 1975 about the annual uprating of social security benefits which will come into operation in the week beginning 22 November. For the convenience of the House, a detailed schedule of the new rates of benefits, which forms part of this statement, has been placed in the Vote Office and will be included in the <i>Official Report</i>.<br/>
The new rates reflect the estimate that the general level of prices will increase by 9 per cent. between November 1981 and November 1982. Benefits generally will be uprated in line with that forecast, and in addition the 2 per cent. shortfall at the 1981 uprating will be made good&#x2014;not only for pensions and other related long-term benefits, as we had already promised, but for all other weekly benefits. This gives a total increase for most benefits of 11 per cent.<br/>
Turning first to the uprating of national insurance benefits, the standard rate of basic retirement pension for a single person will go up by &#x00A3;3&#x00B7;25 a week from &#x00A3;29&#x00B7;60 to &#x00A3;32&#x00B7;85. The rate for a married couple will go up by &#x00A3;5&#x00B7;20 from &#x00A3;47&#x00B7;35 to &#x00A3;52&#x00B7;55. The standard rate of sickness benefit and unemployment benefit will go up by &#x00A3;2&#x00B7;50 for a single person from &#x00A3;22&#x00B7;50 to &#x00A3;25&#x00B7;00, and by &#x00A3;4&#x00B7;05 from &#x00A3;36&#x00B7;40 to &#x00A3;40&#x00B7;45 for a married couple.<br/>
The same percentage increase of 11 per cent. will apply to the earnings-related additional component to national insurance pensions; to pensions payable under the old graduated pension scheme; to those who receive guaranteed minimum pensions from contracted-out occupational pension schemes; and to public service pensions. It will also apply to all other weekly national insurance benefits, including industrial injuries benefits, and to war pensions.<br/>
Child benefit will also be increased, by over 11 per cent., from &#x00A3;5&#x00B7;25 to &#x00A3;5&#x00B7;85, an increase of 60p per qualifying child. One-parent benefit will go up by the same percentage from &#x00A3;3&#x00B7;30 a week to &#x00A3;3&#x00B7;65. So a one-parent family with two children not in receipt of any other social security benefits will find the amount paid for the children rising from &#x00A3;13&#x00B7;80 a week to &#x00A3;15&#x00B7;35.<br/>
After taking the increases in child benefit into account, as has been the practice in previous years, the dependency additions for children paid with short-term national insurance benefits will be 30p a child compared with 80p at present. The child dependency additions payable with retirement, widow's or invalidity pensions will increase from &#x00A3;7&#x00B7;70 a child to &#x00A3;7&#x00B7;95.<br/>
Family income supplement is payable to people in work where the family's gross income, apart from child benefit and one-parent benefit, falls short of a prescribed level. The prescribed level of income for family income supplement will go up by &#x00A3;8&#x00B7;50 to &#x00A3;82&#x00B7;50 weekly for one-child families, and the additional amount for each further child will be raised from &#x00A3;8 to &#x00A3;9 a week. The maximum payment for a one-child family will rise from &#x00A3;18&#x00B7;50 to &#x00A3;21 a week, and the addition for each further child will go up by 50p to &#x00A3;2. This means that the increases will be particularly helpful to larger families with the lowest incomes.<br/>
I turn now to supplementary benefit. As the House will be aware from the proceedings last week in the Committee stage of the Social Security and Housing Benefits Bill, we propose to increase the scale rates of supplementary benefit from next November in line with the forecast increases in the general level of prices, after excluding housing costs. This is because both under the present scheme, and when housing benefit is introduced, the housing costs of supplementary benefit claimants are met separately. Supplementary benefit is different in this respect from all other benefits. The treatment of housing costs distinguishes those costs from all other day-to-day living expenses that are covered by the supplementary benefit scale rate.<br/>
The Government's approach recognises this, and, in effect, avoids double counting, while maintaining full price protection for all claimants. In addition, as with other benefits, we shall be making good the 2 per cent. shortfall. The effect of this will be that the increase in the scale rates will be 10&#x00B7;5 per cent, but housing costs will, of course, be paid on top of that.<br/>
The ordinary supplementary benefit scale rate will, therefore, rise from &#x00A3;23&#x00B7;25 to &#x00A3;25&#x00B7;70 for a single householder and from &#x00A3;37&#x00B7;75 to &#x00A3;41&#x00B7;70 for a married couple. The long-term scale rate will rise from &#x00A3;29&#x00B7;60 to &#x00A3;32&#x00B7;70 for a single householder and from &#x00A3;47&#x00B7;35 to &#x00A3;52&#x00B7;30 for a couple. The scale rates for children will rise from &#x00A3;7&#x00B7;90 to &#x00A3;8&#x00B7;75 for children aged 10 and under, and from &#x00A3;11&#x00B7;90 to &#x00A3;13&#x00B7;15 for children aged 11 to 15.<br/>
There has been a great deal of concern about the effects of the capital limit for supplementary benefit. This is the limit on the amount of capital a person can have and still get supplementary benefit. It has been argued that the current limit of &#x00A3;2,000 set in November 1980 is now too low. The Government recognise the force of the argument and propose to raise the limit by 25 per cent. to &#x00A3;2,500. This will fully restore the value the limit held when it was introduced.<br/>
We also propose a further small but worthwhile improvement in the supplementary benefit scheme. We are increasing the amount of occasional payments by way of a gift, for example at Christmas or for a birthday, which can be disregarded. At present, any excess over &#x00A3;20 is deducted from benefit. We propose to increase the amount that can be totally disregarded to &#x00A3;100.<br/>
Supplementary benefit heating additions are now paid to over 2 million families. In 1980 we boosted them with a record increase. The 1981 uprating turned out to be more than enough fully to protect this increase against rising fuel costs. For 1982 we propose to increase the heating additions from this higher base in line with the expected rise in fuel prices between November 1981 and November 1982. The standard amount will rise from &#x00A3;1&#x00B7;65 to &#x00A3;1&#x00B7;90 a week, and the higher rate from &#x00A3;4&#x00B7;05 to &#x00A3;4&#x00B7;65.<br/>
As the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced yesterday, mobility allowance will no longer be subject to tax. I am sure the whole House will welcome that change, which will benefit some 40,000 recipients who have other taxable income. In addition, the rate of mobility allowance will be increased in November from &#x00A3;16&#x00B7;50 to &#x00A3;18&#x00B7;30. This means that since coming to office we have increased the rate of mobility allowance by 83 per cent. These measures will help even more disabled people to take advantage of the motability scheme for leasing or buying cars on advantageous terms.<br/>
I have also decided to make an improvement in the rules affecting invalid care allowance. The weekly amount which can be earned by someone who is looking after a severely disabled person will be increased from &#x00A3;6 to &#x00A3;12. The disregard has been &#x00A3;6 since the benefit was introduced in 1976 and the increase will restore its original value.<br/>
A further improvement affects the therapeutic earnings limit, which helps people recovering from illness who want to get back into full-time work. The present earnings limit is &#x00A3;16&#x00B7;50. I intend to raise that by 21 per cent. to &#x00A3;20.<br/>
The Christmas bonus of &#x00A3;10 will be paid on the same basis as last year in the week commencing 29 November. I also propose to increase the earnings rule limit for retirement pensioners in November from &#x00A3;52 to &#x00A3;57, the first such increase in three years.<br/>
The total cost of the uprating will be close to &#x00A3;3 billion in a full year, of which about &#x00A3;2 billion will fall on the national insurance fund, the balance coming out of the Consolidated Fund. The House has already approved the changes in contribution levels in 1982&#x2013;83, set out in the Social Security (Contributions) Act 1982, and I shall, as usual, further review contribution rates in the autumn. Any necessary changes will take effect from April 1983.<br/>
The proposals mean that annual expenditure on social security benefits will rise to over &#x00A3;30 billion in 1982&#x2013;83, which represents about 26 per cent. of all public spending. The changes that I have announced mean: full price protection of all weekly benefits; the 2 per cent. shortfall in 1981 made good for all benefits; the supplementar,7 benefit capital limit increased to &#x00A3;2,500; supplementary benefit heating additions protected against rising fuel costs; the retirement pension earnings rule increased for the first time in three years; mobility allowance taken out of tax and fully price protected; a doubling of the earnings disregard for those receiving invalid care allowance ; and an increase of more than 20 per cent. in the therapeutic earnings limit for those receiving incapacity benefits.<br/>
The measures will particularly benefit the elderly and disabled people. They will also give valuable extra help to all families with children. They are designed to bring practical help to those who most need it.</p>

<p>The right hon. Gentleman has made an important statement which we shall want to debate more fully tomorrow. However, I start by welcoming the mobility allowances declaration and the capital increase. I am surprised that the right hon. Gentleman has not introduced a taper on the disregard after &#x00A3;2,500 and that he has not, in the rule changes, met the difficulties that occur over redundancy payments and insurance policies. Those difficulties have led to considerable hardship.<br/>
Those who must live on the benefits that he described will not greet the statement with enthusiasm; nor will the House. The statement deserves merely the politeness due to a minimum and uneven performance of the right hon. Gentleman's duty. For example, does he agree that the 1 per cent. increase in national insurance contribution&#x2014;that most regressive form of taxation&#x2014;which is payable next month will more than wipe out the income tax gains announced yesterday for single persons earning &#x00A3;120 a week and married couples, with or without children, earning over &#x00A3;180 per week?<br/>
Will the Minister tell us exactly how the supplementary benefit rises have been calculated? We know from what


he said that they have been calculated using yet another price index&#x2014;the "Rossi" price index&#x2014;which does not include housing costs, but, since it was casually and inadequately explained to a rather startled Standing Committee, will he tell us exactly how the housing costs have been removed and give the House his estimate of their expected rise by next November? By how much, therefore, will the base rate for supplementary benefit uprating have been lowered?<br/>
Will the right hon. Gentleman consider the greatest crime of the Budget? Does he share with the rest of the House the belief that our financial treatment of children is the greatest cause of poverty to the low-paid and those on social security? If so, how does he justify increasing child benefit by only 60p a week, thereby cutting its real value since 1979 by 40p a week? Does that not represent a fall in child benefit of 6&#x00BD; per cent. during the Government's reign?<br/>
Does the right hon. Gentleman agree that total child support for short-term beneficiaries, such as the unemployed who have children, will have fallen since November 1979 by 23 per cent. while support for longterm beneficiaries, such as widows with children, has fallen by nearly 12 per cent.? Is that not an absolute disgrace?<br/>
How does the right hon. Gentleman justify his decision not to make good the 1980 5 per cent. abatement on unemployment benefit? It was supposed to be an interim measure until taxation was introduced, as it will be in July. The House was assured that the abatement would then cease. It will not. Does that not amount to a gross breach of faith, and will the invalidity pensioner eventually be treated in the same shabby way as the recipients of unemployment benefit?<br/>
The Government have assumed a 9 per cent. increase in inflation, but is it not right to err on the high side, bearing in mind the bitter experience of the 2 per cent. shortfall and the incompetence of the Chancellor of the Exchequer? Is it not a fact that an underestimate now would not be put right until November 1983 and that in the meantime many helpless people would suffer cruelly?</p>

<p>I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman's introductory comments and I shall try to help him on some of the questions that he raised. The first concerned the supplementary benefit capital disregard, how much capital should be exempted, whether a taper should be introduced and whether the cut-off procedure was understood. We have had the matter examined by the supplementary benefit policy inspectorate, which seems emphatically to support our case that there has been no hardship as a result of the changes that we have introduced. I shall make the report available to the right hon. Gentleman so that he can check it.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman asked about the effect of the Budget measures. The net result of the Budget, plus the increased national insurance contributions and increased benefits that I propose, is that we are concentrating help on the lowest paid. I shall set out the details.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman referred to the housing element. He knows that my hon. Friend the Minister for Social Security has explained that supplementary benefit scale rates cover all the normal living expenses except housing costs. An amount to cover actual housing costs is added

to the scale rates and they are met in full. In that respect it is different from all other benefits, and we are proposing a 10&#x00BD; per cent. scale increase, plus full housing costs.<br/>
The cost of the child benefit increase is about &#x00A3;400 million this year. The total cost of the benefit and the one-parent benefit is about &#x00A3;4 billion a year. That shows the Government's commitment to bringing support to children.<br/>
The unemployed will obviously be helped by the decision on the shortfall. A heavy cost would be involved in restoring the 5 per cent. unemployment abatement, but clearly we shall continue to keep that under review.</p>

<p>I welcome the increases in pensions and other benefits, the making up of the 2 per cent. shortfall and the increase in child benefit, all of which show the Government's continued commitment to protect the most vulnerable sections of the community.<br/>
I welcome also the increase in the capital limit for supplementary benefit and ask my right hon. Friend whether, to encourage thrift, that can be indexed so that it does not fall behind in future years. In regard to the longterm unemployed, will my right hon. Friend give increasing attention in future plans to the mounting evidence that those who have been unemployed for a long time, particularly those who have dependent children, do not have arrangements that give them adequate support?</p>

<p>My hon. Friend knows that the Government have already improved the position for the over-60s and we shall continue to keep the matter under review. I am grateful for my hon. Friend's comments on the supplementary benefit capital disregard figure and on the other benefits that we are increasing. The present capital disregard is a disincentive to thrift. The cut-off level is too low, which is why we are improving it and increasing it. I cannot give a commitment on indexation, but we shall keep it under review.</p>

<p>The Secretary of State mentioned the Social Security and Housing Benefits Bill, which is in Committee.

Will he especially consider the fact that many people who have &#x00A3;2,500 may have that sum as a result of systematic saving over the years, sometimes through an endowment policy?

<p>Will the Secretary of State bear it in mind that the House is rather disappointed with his announcement that there will be a consultative document on the death allowance? The House is aware that the Government opposed a Private Member's Bill on the subject only a short time ago, and a consultative document will encourage no one. Does the Secretary of state accept that he should either place a document in the Library or come to the House and make a full statement about the impact of Government measures on poor arid lower-income families, having regard to the balance of the allowances that he has announced today and the insurance contributions that were announced last December and which are to be effective from April, so that we can see the real effect on families?</p>

<p>Is the Secretary of State aware that the new capital limit for receiving supplementary benefits remains much too low? Why is redundancy money included, as that obviously harms many people in their late fifties who have been made redundant and whose chances of getting another job are remote?

<p>With respect to my hon. Friend, who I know has a great interest in and knowledge of these matters, there should be no concern about what we are doing.

Does the right hon. Gentleman accept that the only way to combat the &#x00A3;2&#x00B7;50 and upwards rent increases, the 10 per cent. gas levy this year, and goodness knows how many other increases this year is to grant old-age pensioners an increase that is in line with the declaration of half average earnings for a married couple and one-third for a single pensioner?

<p>Is the Secretary of State really telling us today, on behalf of the Government, that supplementary benefit pensioners and others on supplementary benefit have been overpaid by &#x00A3;30 million because of the way that the index was working? Is he saying that those people, those in the safety net, the poorest in the land, received &#x00A3;30 million too much? Will he assure the House that there will be full publication of the way in which the calculation has been made and that there will be a regular publication of the index, excluding and including housing, so that the House and the country can see how the figures are moving?<br/>
My last question concerns the 5 per cent. abatement, which the right hon. Gentleman says he has reviewed and is reviewing. Is it still the case, as it was at the time when the Social Security (No. 2) Bill went through the House, that if unemployment benefit were taxed the Government would receive more in revenue than they received from the 5 per cent. abatement? Is that still true today? If so, why cannot the Government restore the 5 per cent. abatement before they start to tax the benefit in July?</p>

<p>My answer to the hon. Gentleman's last question about the social security cost, which also involves a tax revenue element, is that it would cost &#x00A3;60 million a year to make good the abatement although, as I said, we shall continue to keep the matter under review.<br/>
My answer to what the hon. Gentleman said about supplementary benefit and the housing element is that the old system double counts housing costs. Therefore, we are giving a 10&#x00BD; per cent. scale increase, plus the full cost of housing, I believe that that is fair. We shall of course publish the basis on which we make that assessment.</p>

<p>I beg to move,
<q>That leave be given to bring in a Bill to abolish local authority resolutions assuming parental rights and to make provision for the making of care orders in cases where a child is already in the voluntary care of a local authority; and for connected purposes.</q>
My reason for introducing the Bill stems from my meeting in Liverpool a young lady called Caroline Pritchard; she has a son aged five called Frank who is in care. She has come to London today with some 2,000 signatures of neighbours and friends asking for her child to be returned to her care. About 13 months ago the child's father walked out, leaving her in an emotional state. While she was in that state she agreed to put the child into voluntary care. The grandmother of the child would have been prepared, as would another relative, to have taken the child into her care, but no one from the social services department approached them to do that.<br/>
Caroline was allowed to see her son for one hour a month. In May a care order was applied for by the social services department and granted by the magistrates' court. In November Caroline went to court to appeal against that decision. Then the decision was made by the court that in some way Caroline was unfit to take care of her son. Innuendo was used and Caroline was told that she could not see her child again. She has no right of appeal and she cannot get legal aid.<br/>
In today's edition of <i>The Times,</i> Michael Horsnell has an article about an interview with a paediatrician who has dealt with the case. He says that Mrs. Pritchard
<q>is supported by Professor Ralph Hendricks, a consultant paediatrician at Alder Hey Children's Hospital, Liverpool, who has known mother and child for three years and treated Francis when he was ill.</q>
<q>He said: ' &#x2026; From all my observations Mrs. Pritchard has been a good mother. There is not a shred of evidence that he has ever suffered physical or emotional hardship from her, quite the reverse.</q>
<q>I should like to know why on earth they should have been separated. The mother is not a psychopath, nor has she any psychiatric illness. Some of the things said to this woman have been almost in the category of mental cruelty. The effect is something which I find quite appalling.'</q>
Since November Caroline has been barred from seeing her own child. She does not even know where he is. She has been told by the social services department that she may never see him again. She is in the very pits of despair, heartbroken and terribly upset.<br/>
This Bill would give mothers such as Caroline the chance, right from the start, to have the case dealt with in the juvenile courts to ensure that people such as she could be present at all stages of the proceedings. Instead of the onus being placed on her to prove her suitability to be a mother, the burden of responsibility would fall on the authority to prove her unsuitability.<br/>
My Bill seeks to remove from local authority social services committees the power to assume the rights of parents over children in voluntary care. The Bill gives these powers instead to juvenile courts and therefore allows parents to be heard and represented. The Bill also aims to ensure that all reasonable attempts are made to help keep families together and to uphold good social work practice. In addition, the Bill allows parents to apply for access to their child if a care order is made and it establishes a code of conduct.<br/>
The Bill is not for or against social workers. It is not even against bad social workers. The point is simply to achieve what is best for the child and the family. Sometimes that may be a care order and sometimes it will mean allowing the child to return to its parents. Decisions should be made in a manner which is fair and just. Unless a proper examination is made of the issue the best results cannot be guaranteed.<br/>
The system is inadequate in many ways. A social worker who has been advising the parent decides that the parent ought not to look after the child. A report is made to the social services committee; the social worker can do this at any time. He need not get the parent's consent first; he does not even have to inform a parent that the resolution is to be made. The committee considers the report of the social worker and generally accepts it without question. The resolution of the committee accepting the report is made without a hearing, behind closed doors, in the absence of the parent and the child. There are no representations and natural justice is ignored. What is so extraordinary is that it is only after that that the parent can object.<br/>
Supporters of the system claim that the single procedure is advantageous. They say that it saves time and money and that it requires a lower level of evidence. They claim that there is no need for the parent or the child to be represented, because the social worker has already taken their views into account. That may be true in some cases but it is not the cut-and-dried cases with which we are concerned in the Bill. This Bill is concerned with giving to a parent who wishes to contest the decision a fair opportunity to do so. We are concerned not with the vast majority of scrupulous, competent social workers but with the minority of bad ones, those who make mistakes and ruin lives.<br/>
The proposal in the Bill is straightforward. It would allow a parent a hearing at the first stage, before any decisions were taken. One of the arguments that may be advanced against the proposal&#x2014;I understand that the hon. Member for Bootle (Mr. Roberts), who has had considerable experience as a social worker, may put this forward later&#x2014;is that court procedures would deter social workers from seeking care orders. However, if the social worker is not sure enough of his case to be prepared to submit it to a court, he should not be seeking a care order in the first place. If the Bill has the effect of weeding out bad cases before they get started, so much the better.<br/>
Before I took the matter up I was concerned to see what other people felt about it. I was pleased to find that the argument for change was supported not only by Members of almost all parties in the House but by the National Council for One-Parent Families, the Child Poverty Action Group, the Family Rights Group, the Legal Action Group, Justice for Children, the Children's Legal Centre and the National Council for Civil Liberties.<br/>
I canvassed the views of lawyers who had extensive experience of the use by local authorities of powers to assume parental control. The reply from a firm in the south-east of London is of particular interest:
<q>We are particularly concerned as to the total lack of justice involved in the current rights of local authorities in these matters. The procedure places the burden to oppose the resolution on parents who are frequently not in a position to understand what they should do; especially as the persons who would otherwise advise them (social workers) are frequently the persons who are in fact on the opposite side of the fence in these matters.</q>

In essence, all that the Bill does is to require a local authority, if it believes that its case is right, to present the evidence upon which it bases that decision to a court for examination. Reluctance to do so can only be construed as an indication that frequently these resolutions are made when the evidence is not available to support them.<br/>
It might be argued that magistrates are not fit for the task set them by the Bill. That simply is not true. Magistrates are not a bunch of old fuddy-duddies living cloistered lives, detached from the real world. Juvenile magistrates are specially selected because of their interest in child care work. Indeed, many are teachers, child psychologists or even social workers. In addition, they now receive some, although not enough, training.<br/>
Of course, the juvenile court is not the optimum solution. Ideally, a family court should be set up to hear disputed cases between parents and social workers. But it is not realistic to aim for that in a private Member's Bill. The cost would be too high. The resources would not be made available. The House would be well advised to look at the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1972 which provides for an informal family hearing. Just because the best solution of a family court is too expensive that is no reason for avoiding progress towards it. This Bill would give the parents a hearing before the decision is taken. It would make the procedure seem fairer. Justice would manifestly be seen to be done.<br/>
Another argument that may be put against the Bill is that it might take a long time to get cases to court, with decisions being made only after a long and drawn-out process. That i s not and need not be true. Juvenile courts, although they do not advertise the fact, are not vastly overcrowded. Delays are reasonably short. Cases are dealt with efficiently. Care proceedings can and do get priority . Juvenile courts are not so formal as to frighten a parent away from contesting the matter. In any event, a parent has the option of not taking part in the proceedings.<br/>
The current procedure is rather like expecting the priest to whom one has just confessed one's crimes to turn round, put on his judge's robes and begin to pass sentence. It sounds absurd. One cannot expect people to be able to wear two hats at once, but we expect this of our social workers and social services committees, who must be witness, counsel, judge and jury, and will continue to be so until the Bill becomes law .<br/>
I should also like to see a requirement that a decision whether to seek a care order be made within the first year of voluntary care. That would be contained in the code of conduct.<br/>
The Bill will give the parent a hearing where none existed before. It will end the incestuous relationship between social services committees and social workers. It will provide for natural justice. Above all, it will ensure that young mothers such as Caroline Pritchard will have the chance from the outset to challenge those who decide to play God.</p>

<p>Yes, Mr. Speaker.<br/>
It is with some trepidation that I oppose the Bill, because many of the examples of bad practice under the present procedures are real and give rise to the need for action to alter the way in which local authorities may assume parental rights over children who are already in care. What I object to is not


the definition of some of the problems as outlined by the hon. Member for Liverpool, Edge Hill (Mr. Alton), but his proposed solution.<br/>
There is a great deal of misunderstanding, even in the hon. Gentleman's mind, about exactly what he is doing. I do not know the Liverpool case of Caroline Pritchard, which the hon. Gentleman quoted. I would not want to judge whether that child should be returned to the parent. But it is clear from what the hon. Gentleman said that he has not been returned to his mother because a decision has been taken on two occasions by a juvenile court&#x2014;not by a social services committee.<br/>
Last May the Liverpool social services committee successfully applied to the magistrates court for a care order. In November the parent applied for the revocation of that order. That application was turned down, not by a social services committee but by the court. At that hearing, not only could the parent be represented but, under the Children Act 1975&#x2014;originally sponsored by the right hon. Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Dr. Owen), who is now in alliance with the hon. Gentleman&#x2014;the child could be separately represented in an application for revocation. Therefore, the courts made mistakes, or the hon. Gentleman would not be critical of what they had done.<br/>
The Bill is not about care orders. It is about a child who is not committed to the local authority's care but has been received into its care on a voluntary basis. It is decided that it is in the child's interests to secure plans for his long-term future, and therefore a resolution needs to be made about his guardianship. Such a resolution could be made only if it could be shown that he had been abandoned or that the parents had permanent disabilities that prevented them from caring for him or had failed to discharge their obligations as parents.<br/>
The only other ground on which parental rights can be assumed are that the child has been in care for more than three years. That in itself is justification for the assumption of parental rights. It was a new provision in the 1975 Act to deal with the problem of children left languishing in care, with no parental contact. No long-term plan for them could be made because parental rights could not be assumed.<br/>
That provision was introduced as a result of the Maria Colwell case, a scandal which resulted directly from a juvenile court decision, which was wrong, to send the child home to the natural mother and stepfather. The stepfather beat the child to death.<br/>
It is true that hon. Members will make representations on behalf of constituents who come to see them. Such constituents represent their own interests and may or may not represent the interests of their children. Legislation now recognises that the child can be separately represented. No children turn up at law centres. No children in care turn up at advice bureaux to see Members of Parliament. Their views are often represented by social workers and by a guardian ad litem appointed by the court.<br/>
I believe that something needs to be done. What is wrong with the present system is that, as the hon. Gentleman said, when a social services committee and the social workers decide to assume parental rights over a child already in care, to determine its long-term future, they do not have to notify the parent until after the assumption of parental rights. Then

the parent has the right to go to court, but the notification after the assumption of parental rights can be in writing and the parent may not fully understand it.<br/>
I should like a code of conduct to come out of this debate and the Bill, a code that will make it clear that parents shall be informed before proceedings on the assumption of parental rights; that they may be represented and may appear before the committee; and that a guardian ad litem to represent the child and interview the parents may be appointed before the assumption of parental rights. If that goes through a social services committee against the wishes of the parent, he or she will have the right, as now, to go to the court to argue their case and seek to have the assumption changed or revoked.<br/>
The court should be a backstop for parents who object to what is happening. I do not think that in every instance, even when the parents consent or there are no parents, it should be a matter for the juvenile court to decide. Anyone who believes that magistrates are better able to take the decision than dedicated, elected councillors on social services committees is mistaken. Many people on social services committees, people of all parties, are dedicated&#x2014;that is why they are on the committees&#x2014;to the well-being of children and to wanting to see families united. They want to avoid the need for children to come into care. They should be able to take the decision, with the safeguards that I have said should be provided. Those safeguards, given statutory backing, together with the parents' present right of appeal to the courts, would be adequate. It would be misguided to fill up the magistrates courts with assumption of parental rights cases simply because one does not think that it is just to have a hearing before elected members of social services committees.<br/>
I hope that something positive will come out of the debate and the Bill. I hope that what is wrong with the present system will be put right and that there will be a code of guidance with statutory backing, one that the hon. Gentleman and I can support. But I hope that the House will not accept the Bill, which proposes to put every case into our already overcrowded courts, even when there is no need, or to do so is not necessarily in the interests of the parents or the children. Whether we like it or not, they see the courts as punitive instruments. Social services committees are nearer to the family courts, which may not be seen to be so punitive.</p>

<p>As the Chancellor resumed his seat after 5.30 yesterday, as his supporters waved their Order Papers and stamped their feet with approval, and as a flush of pleasure suffused the features of such wets as I was able to glimpse, I confessed to a sense of almost complete bewilderment, quickly followed by a recognition of the Chancellor's unexpected gift for sleight of hand and of the equally unexpected gullibility of his Back Benchers. Yesterday was an exercise in bluff and fraud; a skilful presentation that momentarily persuaded one half of the House of Commons that the Chancellor had presented, as he claimed, a Budget for industry, a Budget for jobs, a Budget for people, and tax cuts.<br/>
It is, however, invariably a mistake to deceive the House and country, for the truth will out and what is unpalatable becomes doubly so simply because of an attempt to conceal it. Yesterday's blooms are already dropping their petals. They will not survive this week's Budget debate.<br/>
My first duty is to tell the truth about the Budget&#x2014;the whole Budget, not only the half presented yesterday, but the other half that was revealed last December. This full Budget has not cut personal taxation&#x2014;it has increased it. This Budget will not reduce unemployment&#x2014;it will continue to rise. This Budget offers a sop to industry but will do virtually nothing to deal with its basic problems of loss of competitiveness and lack of demand.<br/>
It is not difficult to document these assertions. In the White Paper on the Government's expenditure plans which

was released yesterday we find confirmation of the Government Actuary's forecast of last December about unemployment. He said:
<q>the number of unemployed persons (excluding school leavers etc.) will average 2&#x00B7;6 million in 1981&#x2013;82 and 2&#x00B7;9 million in 1982&#x2013;83 and subsequent years.</q>
When school leavers, adult students and others are brought into the picture, an additional 225,000 people must be added to the unemployed figures. Unemployment is to rise by some 300,000 during this year and to stay there in the years that lie ahead. So much for the claim that this is a Budget for employment; it is a Budget for unemployment.<br/>
The tax burden will obviously vary according to the size and nature of the incomes that people receive. In my remarks I must exempt the highest incomes, the top people whom this alleged Budget for the people so noticeably serves. In a full year, they will gain no less than &#x00A3;196 million as a result of the further and major relaxation in capital gains tax and capital transfer tax that the Chancellor has announced. What a disgraceful contrast with the shabby treatment meted out, above all, to the poorest in the land and those who, through no fault of their own, have been forced into unemployment and who have had their unemployment benefit cut by 5 per cent. last year and by the abolition of earnings-related short-term benefit on 1 January.<br/>
What is the position for the ordinary taxpayer and the great mass of British people at work? The Government last night issued their document, one of many, entitled "Income Tax and Indirect Tax: The Main Proposals". It contains a number of tables showing how the tax burden in 1982&#x2013;83 compares with the tax burden of the year that has just ended, 1981&#x2013;82. The tables show reduction in tax payments next year, which have been widely publicised today in most newspapers, but make no allowance for inflation. Therefore, they are seriously misleading. However, the last table in the Government's clutch of tables shows the crucial figures&#x2014;the percentage of total income taken in income tax and national insurance contributions next year compared with this year. It does that on the very modest basis of a 7&#x00B7;5 per cent. increase in earnings.<br/>
Let us consider that table because it is that one that matters. For all single people within the range of income beginning at &#x00A3;3,000 a year and rising to &#x00A3;15,000 a year, the burdens of direct taxation will be higher in 1982&#x2013;83 than they were in 1981&#x2013;82. As for married couples, with the single exception of those on &#x00A3;3,000 a year, for whom there is a marginal improvement, all income earners from &#x00A3;4,000 a year to &#x00A3;15,000 will, as with single persons, pay more of their income in tax in this coming year than they did in the year that has just ended. The average family man on average earnings who paid, in income tax and national insurance, 27&#x00B7;5 per cent. in 1981&#x2013;82 will pay after April 28 per cent.<br/>
Therefore, only those earning more than &#x00A3;20,000 a year clearly gain from the changes in direct taxation announced yesterday. So much for the Budget for people, the tax cut Budget&#x2014;and I have not mentioned the impact of the Budget and public expenditure on the likely rate burden and the almost certain rent burden to be imposed within the next few weeks.<br/>
The Government have allowed local authority expenditure to increase in money terms by 6 per cent., bat they know that expenditure will increase by a great deal more. My guess is that rates will rise nationally by at least


15 per cent. in 1982&#x2013;83. The Secretary of State for the Environment has already decided that overall local authority rents must be raised generally by a minimum additional &#x00A3;2&#x00B7;50 a week. So much for the Budget for people, the tax cut Budget.<br/>
What shall we say about the claim that it is a Budget for industry? No one who has read the Budget submissions of the TUC or the CBI can fail to recognise how massively short, not just of the TUC's proposals, but of those made by the CBI, this Budget falls. The Chancellor will not contest this point made by the CBI:
<q>in 1981 the real pre-tax, pre-interest rate of return for non-North Sea and industrial commercial companies fell to just over 2 per cent. , the lowest ever recorded in this country and almost certainly much lower than in any of our main overseas competitors.</q>
On the real profits of industrial commercial companies, less payments of tax and interest, the CBI said:
<q>in 1980 for the first time on record this total was negative. And we estimate that it remained negative in 1981 and our central forecast will continue to be negative on unchanged policies this year.</q>
It was against that background that the CBI called for a cut of two points in the national insurance surcharge, a 15 per cent. business de-rating and, much more important, for action to ensure a competitive exchange rate, including cuts in interest rates.<br/>
The real problem is, of course, that we have lost, in international competitiveness, about 30 to 35 per cent. since the Government came to power about three years ago. The question that must, therefore, be considered is how far the one point cut in national insurance surcharge and the other minor measures that the Chancellor announced will go in helping to cut into that massive loss of competitivenes that we have already sustained. Perhaps the Chief Secretary will give us the information, but I should be surprised if as much as 3 per cent. were to be regained by the Budget against the 30 to 35 per cent. loss in competitiveness. So much for the so-called Budget for industry.<br/>
Of course, this Budget has not been launched in a vacuum, but follows three previous Budgets and three years of monetarist madness, which have together inflicted more damage on the economy, industry and people of Britain than anything since the great slump of 1929 to 1931. We know what has happened. In the year that has just ended, in 1981&#x2013;82 alone, investment in the future and in British industry has fallen by 5 per cent.&#x2014;fallen from the reduced levels of the previous year. The number of people registered as unemployed has risen from 2&#x00B7;4 million last March to just over 3 million today&#x2014;a rate of just over 50,000 a month. This year, taxes for the average family with two children, on average earnings, have taken 42&#x00B7;6 per cent. of personal income, compared with 39 per cent. in 1979&#x2013;80.<br/>
Public expenditure, particularly on capital projects, has once again been reduced, including an unprecedented and spectacular fall in the number of houses completed and a further fall in houses started by the construction industry. The Chancellor of the Exchequer's deliberate deflation of demand&#x2014;whether in the form of reduced public expenditure, increased taxation burdens, high interest rates or an uncompetitive exchange rate&#x2014;has been at the very centre and core of Government policy. As we all recall, the right hon. and learned Gentleman's justification

for his measures last year was that they were the only way to reduce inflation, lower interest rates for industry and thus to prepare the way for that long-awaited sound expansion of the economy and the creation of "real" jobs.<br/>
This time last year, interest rates were reduced to 12 per cent. Within three months they rose again to 14 per cent. and then to 16 per cent. They then fell back to 15 per cent. What can we now expect? Of course, we can expect a reduction&#x2014;surely at least to last March's figure of 12 per cent. But we do not know how long they will stay in that position. In March 1981 inflation stood at 12 per cent. Lo and behold, it is 12 per cent. in March 1982.<br/>
That was last year&#x2014;a year on which, with incredible complacency, the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Chief Secretary repeatedly congratulate themselves for their judgment and prescience. If they had really anticipated that unemployment would rise by an additional 600,000 between last year's Budget and this, and had foretold that interest rates would not fall below or even be sustained at last year's figure of 12 per cent.&#x2014;but would rise to the level of 16 per cent., reached last summer&#x2014;they were remarkably reticent in telling the House. Indeed, they were reticent not only at the time&#x2014;last March&#x2014;but in all our subsequent debates on the economy in the past year.<br/>
I have described only one year, but if I were to take the three-year period since the general election the record would be&#x2014;as the House knows&#x2014;still more appalling. Output is down. The gross national product has fallen by about 6&#x00B7;5 per cent. Industrial output is down still more dramatically, and manufacturing output has fallen by about 20 per cent. Worst of all, that has happened during a period when we have had the full benefit of self-sufficiency in North Sea oil.<br/>
That is the background against which the Budget proposals and the prospects must be judged. Only one component remains to complete the picture. I refer to that half of the Budget that the Chancellor of the Exchequer revealed in his statement on 2 December, some three months ago. The House will recall that he then announced an increase of 1 per cent. in the employee contribution to national insurance, to take effect on 1 April. At the same time, he announced the totals of public expenditure in the year 1982&#x2013;83, the details of which are set out, with minor modifications, in the White Paper published yesterday.<br/>
It is, of course, only when those measures are brought into the total picture that the reality of the right hon. and learned Gentleman's measures for 1982&#x2013;83 can be properly appraised. Here we find the simple answer to the myth of tax cuts in the Budget. It is the extra 1 per cent. increase in national insurance contributions, paid by the vast majority of our people at work, and which yields over &#x00A3;1,000 million, which negates that small relaxation in income tax and other tax payments, over and above the indexation of personal tax allowances that the right hon. and learned Gentleman announced yesterday. It was during our exchanges and debates last December that the apparent &#x00A3;5 billion increase in public expenditure that the right hon. and learned Gentleman had announced was found&#x2014;on the the Chancellor's admission&#x2014;to be in real terms no more than was necessary to maintain public expenditure in 1982&#x2013;83 at the 1981&#x2013;82 level. That was confirmed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer yesterday and by the contents of the Red Book.<br/>
The planning total for 1982&#x2013;83&#x2014;allowing for the figure of 9 per cent. for inflation&#x2014;will be the same as it was last year. Of the total, an extra &#x00A3;1 billion must be allowed for


the financing of additional unemployment, and an extra &#x00A3;1 billion to &#x00A3;2 billion must be allowed for the necessary increased support for nationalised industries faced with still deeper recession and enhanced costs. Of course, that will mean cuts in other public programmes of expenditure.<br/>
I shall sum up where the Budget and public expenditure White Paper have taken us to. The Budget is broadly neutral on taxation, but the Chancellor of the Exchequer has been forced to make cuts in public expenditure to accommodate the recession costs to which I have just referred. Therefore, unemployment will rise&#x2014;as the Government admit&#x2014;by at least another 300,000 during this year. To adapt a famous couplet, the best that could be claimed by the Chancellor for his Budget is:
<q>Across the wires the electric message came, the economy is no better, it is much the same.</q>
So much for the Government's direct contribution&#x2014;through tax policy and public expenditure programmes&#x2014;to the level of activity of the flattened British economy. In the right hon. and learned Gentleman's statement and the Red Book, the gross domestic product is expected to grow by 1&#x00B7;5 per cent. from 1981 to 1982 and, taking the first half of 1982 to the first half of 1983, by 2 per cent. Where does that growth come from?<br/>
Consumer expenditure will contribute virtually nothing. According to the Red Book, the main stimulus is to come&#x2014;surprisingly&#x2014;from a recovery in private investment and from that interesting category, which represents at least half the increase, "statistical adjustments." The contribution from an increase in exports is more than matched by the anticipated growth in imports. It looks like rather precarious figuring to me. However, let us assume that the right hon. and learned Gentleman achieves his anticipated growth in gross domestic product. By the summer of 1983&#x2014;four years after the Conservative party was elected to office&#x2014;gross domestic product will be about 3 per cent. lower than it was when it took over. On the same favourable assumptions, manufacturing output will be about 13&#x00B7;5 per cent. lower over the same period.<br/>
No doubt, in this new Thatcher era of modest expectations, the Government will claim and hail such an outcome as an achievement. However, to those of us who have not lost all touch with reality, it will be treated with derision and contempt. Again, this achievement conceals the contribution that the Government have received from North Sea oil in the past three years. There has been a &#x00A3;6 billion bonus in tax yields and an increase in the value of output&#x2014;between 1979 and 1981 alone&#x2014;of over &#x00A3;7 billion.<br/>
What are the implications for unemployment and of the anticipated growth of gross domestic product? The Chancellor of the Exchequer has told us that productivity is increasing and that productivity per capita has returned to the level that existed three years ago. That productivity is expected to continue to grow, although not at the pace experienced during the past year. Let us assume that productivity stays on the trend of the despised and lethargic 1960s and that there is an increase of between 2 per cent. and 3 per cent.<br/>
If that figure were sustained the implication for unemployment is surely obvious. There could be no fall in the number of unemployed. Indeed, the underlying rate would inevitably rise. The only new factors that might mitigate the effects and cosmetically reduce the size of the

unemployment register are the type of measures so murkily outlined at the opening of the right hon. and learned Gentleman's Budget speech, which will affect some 100,000 unemployed people, and the more extensive measures announced last December by the Secretary of State for Employment&#x2014;in other words, the creation on a more substantial scale of precisely those phoney jobs, as opposed to real jobs, that the right hon. Lady and her colleagues so contemptuously dismissed when in Opposition four years ago.<br/>
The Chancellor's forecasts for GDP, unemployment and other main aggregates are supported by virtually all the competent and independent forecasting bodies that assist us in these studies&#x2014;the National Institute, the Cambridge economists, the St. James' Group based on the Economist Intelligence Unit, the London Business School, Simon and Coates, Phillips and Drew and others. But there is a major and additional point. We must now not talk, just about the short term&#x2014;that is to say, the period up to mid-1983&#x2014;but we must look at the situation that lies beyond.<br/>
The view here is again broadly shared by forecasters as different as the broadly monetarist London Business School and the more Keynesian group based on the Economist Intelligence Unit, as well as by the Government's own forecasts built into the public expenditure White Paper. The message is one that the country and the House should most seriously consider and absorb. Unemployment is here to stay. On the Government's policies, 3 million registered unemployed is to be the new normality for the British people in the 1980s. Not only has this figure been brought about by Government economic and monetarist policy, but it is to be sustained by the continuation of those policies into the indefinite future. At no point and on no occasion have the Prime Minister, the Chancellor or any other member of the Cabinet spoken of even a medium-term commitment to the restoration of full employment.<br/>
Yesterday, the Chancellor paid tribute&#x2014;those tributes were re-emphasised and re-echoed at the beginning of our proceedings today&#x2014;to his most distinguished predecessor, Lord Butler. I could not help thinking and recalling that Rab was, in his many different roles, a member of the wartime coalition Government and a member of the Cabinet that published and accepted that great commitment enshrined in the 1944 White Paper on "Employment Policy" to sustain full employment in the post-war period.<br/>
I recall that statement:
<q>The Government accept as one of their primary aims and responsibilities the maintenance of a high and stable level of employment after the war &#x2026; A country will not suffer from mass unemployment so long as the total demand for its goods and services is maintained at a high level &#x2026; The Government are prepared to accept in future the responsibility for taking action at the earliest possible stage to arrest a threatened slump. This involves a new approach and a new responsibility for the Stale.</q>
That commitment, for the first time in the post-war years, has been abandoned by the Treasury Bench. I challenged the Chancellor to deny it.<br/>
Of course, the Chancellor will say that he does not want unemployment. Of course, he will repeat the ritual regrets that we heard from him yesterday. Of course, he will say that there is no contradiction between his professed aim of reducing inflation and reducing unemployment, to which my short riposte is
<q>Ye shall know them by their fruits".</q>
My longer riposte is to use words that will be familiar to the Chancellor and the Chief Secretary to the Treasury


in their professional capacity as members of the Bar. They will recall the many occasions when at the end of trials judges have addressed juries in broadly the following terms: "A man must be presumed to intend the natural and probable consequences of his conduct." In other words, it is no good for a villain to brandish a crow-bar, to bring it down on the skull of his victim and then to say that that was not what he meant to do at all, that the victim was an old friend and that he only wished him well.<br/>
No. People, including Prime Ministers and Treasury Ministers, must be judged and presumed to intend the natural and probable consequences of their conduct. Is it not a fact that mounting and high unemployment is the natural and probable consequence of throttling the economy with the medium-term financial strategy? Is not the inevitable result of a squeeze on the money supply that business is driven to bankruptcy and firms to liquidation as the cost of borrowing soars beyond their reach? Is it not a fact that, by cutting public expenditure regardless of whether resources of men and material are idle year in year out, the number of people employed, either directly by the public sector or in projects financed by public money, such as housing, will find themselves jobless? Is it not a natural and probable consequence that, regardless of circumstances, a Government pledged to reduce their borrowing requirement year by year will reduce demand in the economy and, therefore, the number of jobs available?</p>

<p>Surely the right hon. Gentleman's point is that unemployment is basically caused by a shortage in demand. Does he not agree that in many areas of industry there is no shortage of demand? For example, there is ample demand in the motor car industry; the problem is that British manufacturers are not building the right cars at the right price.</p>

<p>If the hon. Gentleman is willing to engage in that argument, I hope that the House will follow it up. Of course, in particular instances there may be a case for saying that there is not a shortage of demand, but what about the economy as a whole? There is more surplus capacity than ever before recorded. If Conservative Members think that that is peculiar to the people of Britain; if they think, as they undoubtedly do, that it is a kind of retribution for enjoying the benefits of full employment and the gradual amelioration of circumstances that come from a welfare State; if they think that over the years the British people have suddenly become corrupt and lazy; how do they explain the fact that unemployment throughout the whole Western world has risen from 8 million to more than 24 million in the last six or seven years?<br/>
The point is that there is a lack of demand, not only in Britain but in the world economy. That is the message we have been trying to get into the Conservatives' thick skulls, year in, year out, ever since the first oil shock hit Britain and had to be managed, in spite of all the difficulties&#x2014;when we did not have a spot of oil ourselves&#x2014;by my right hon. Friends from 1974 to 1979, and with far better results than we have had in the last two or three years.</p>

<p>I will not give way.<br/>
I shall make my concluding points about the natural consequences of the Government's actions. Whether it is the judgment of history or whether it is to be the judgment of the electorate within the next 18 months, there is only one possible verdict on the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer and his colleagues on the great crime of the wilful creation of unemployment. That is "Guilty".<br/>
What I have just said brings me to the heart of my difference with the Government. The Chancellor sees his task as essentially one of fine tuning a slump. If I thought that that was the task, I would adopt some of the right hon. and learned Gentleman's Budget proposals. I urged reductions in the national insurance surcharge and extra help for high energy users in my response to the Budget 12 months ago, but the right hon. and learned Gentleman rejected those proposals out of hand.<br/>
I see the task of the Chancellor of the Exchequer not in terms of accepting or fine tuning the slump, but in terms of overcoming it. The task on which we should embark is the restoration of output and employment in Britain with the objective of the earliest possible return to full employment in our land. That will require a major and fundamental change of direction and of economic policy. It is because I believe that that I set out a week ago an economic statement in which I put the key proposals and the main judgments of the extent of the economic stimulus required, which should have shaped yesterday's Budget.<br/>
I have no doubt that we must bury and abandon the medium term financial strategy, if it has not been buried


already. I noted what had happened to the various monetary targets that the right hon. and learned Gentleman put before us. They have changed every year, they have been overshot every year and they have been broadened every year. Frankly, I fail to understand the utility of preserving them.<br/>
It is essential for interest rates to be cut and for a realistic and competitive rate for sterling to be achieved. Those are necessary first steps to a sustained recovery of output. They must be backed by measures to increase domestic demand, both in the form of increased capital expenditure and increased current expenditure on major social and community services.</p>

<p>My judgment was that about &#x00A3;9 billion should be spent on increasing expenditure and on what I described as cost restraint measures, including reductions in the national insurance surcharge. On our calculations the public sector borrowing requirement would increase by some &#x00A3;5&#x00BD; billion. The predictable response of the Chancellor was, is, and will continue to be that any increase in the PSBR is bound to lead to an increase in interest rates and that any increase in demand is bound to lead not to an increase in output, but to an increase in inflation.<br/>
The idea that interest rates will be driven up seems to be based on the false notion that there is intense competition in the United Kingdom for capital funds. That is patently not so when British industry is in serious recession. That is true only to the extent that the Government have made it true by abolishing exchange controls and by allowing British capital&#x2014;much of it the savings of people at work in Britain&#x2014;to pour across the Channel and the Atlantic to wherever their managers believe the largest return is available.<br/>
Since exchange controls were abolished, the outflow of capital has been enormous. In 1978, the last full year of office of the Labour Government, about &#x00A3;4 billion was invested overseas, either in direct or portfolio investment. The total for 1981, based on the first three quarters' return, will be not less than &#x00A3;9 billion. That additional &#x00A3;5 billion could be and should be used to finance the restoration and revival of British industry and employment.<br/>
That is one reason why it is our intention to restore exchange controls the moment we have the opportunity to do so. But let me pursue the matter further. I can see no convincing reason, nor have I been presented with any past convincing evidence, to cause me to believe that the PSBR of the kind that I have in mind is something that can be achieved only at the cost of rising interest rates.<br/>
It is an obvious irony that the Chancellor's experience in office has been precisely contrary to what he expected and predicted. As he has sought to reduce the PSBR as a percentage of the gross domestic product, interest rates have not fallen, but risen. Interest rates are higher today than when he came to power three years ago, yet the PSBR in the last year of the Labour Government was 5&#x00BD; per cent. of GDP as opposed to 4&#x00BC; per cent. in 1981&#x2013;82 and the proposed 3&#x00BD; per cent. for 1982&#x2013;83.<br/>
Furthermore, as the Chancellor knows, and as the CBI stated in its Budget representations, when the British borrowing requirement is put on a comparable basis with that of other countries, it forms a smaller part of gross national product than in Japan, Germany, Italy and now

France. It is only because we, unlike other countries, classify and use the concept of PSBR to include the borrowing of publicly owned industries for capital investment and their future growth that we manage to push up PSBR towards the upper end of the international comparative table.<br/>
I do not pretend for a moment that the future for Britain is easy or that the achievement of economic success will not involve the greatest effort and utmost co-operation of the British people. That task has become immensely more difficult, given the hideous damage that the Chancellor and his colleagues have inflicted on our economy. What we shall invite our fellow countrymen to join with us in achieving is a programme that seeks to create new jobs, to increase the output and wealth of our society and, above all, to establish a more just distribution of what we have both between different income groups and between private and community needs.<br/>
In contrast, what the Chancellor offers, as his Budget confirmed, is a dead end: the continued and massive waste of human and material resources, the absence of hope and the encouragement of division and despair. It is a Budget that we must totally reject.</p>

<p>We have just heard from the right hon. Member for Stepney and Poplar (Mr. Shore) not just a somewhat distorted series of references to the Budget of my right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer, but a highly sanitised account of his prescriptions. If hon. Members had taken the trouble to look at the pre-Budget economic statement that the right hon. Gentleman published last week, they would have read a fuller account of what he has in mind.<br/>
To the right hon. Gentleman's colleagues, especially those who served with him in the Cabinet, the heat and passion that he brings to bear on these matters must revive old memories. My predecessor, the right hon. Member for Heywood and Royton (Mr. Barnett), has recorded what it used to be like in his book, "Inside the Treasury". He notes that the then Prime Minister
<q>was just not willing to push Peter, who could be so touchy and ill-tempered and ready to get passionate and thump the table &#x2026; that everybody was frightened to upset him.</q>
To continue the quotation, the right hon. Member's technique apparently was
<q>to behave in as prickly a manner as possible. Better still leave the impression that if you lose you might not only resign but become so convulsed with the strength of your case as to push your blood pressure right up and collapse on the Cabinet table.</q>
Having looked at the right hon. Gentleman's proposals, and having heard him put them forward in a somewhat sanitised form this afternoon, I cannot help feeling that I would fear not the right hon. Gentleman's collapse but that of the British economy if he were ever to come to office again.</p>

<p>While my right hon. Friend is talking about the sanitisation of the Labour Parry's budget proposals, will he say a word about the failure of the right hon. Member for Stepney and Poplar (Mr. Shore) to say anything about something called "the national economic assessment", which was supposed to be the central part of those proposals? We do not know whether that is a pay policy or something else.</p>

<p>I am grateful to my hon. Friend, who has foreshadowed a point on which I was to touch. I notice with interest that, apart from an attempt to throw a certain amount of dust in our eyes about the Chancellor's proposals, the right hon. Member for Stepney and Poplar was extremely reluctant to talk about the proposals in the Budget. I have not been in the House for as many years as the right hon. Member has, but I cannot remember another speech from an Opposition spokesman that had so little to say about the Budget proposals. That reflects the fact that the Budget proposals were so well received that the right hon. Gentleman felt that the only thing to do was to attempt to distort them slightly and then generally throw mud at the background against which they were presented.<br/>
Before the right hon. Member for Stepney and Poplar seeks to intervene, I must tell him that, in general, his assessment of the nature of our economic problem is one that he has put to the House and been debated on a number of occasions. We have often discussed and considered the fact that the present rise in unemployment is caused by historic factors that have been present for the best part of a generation. Labour Members who point the finger and say that the rise in unemployment that has gone on for a generation is caused by the present Government are showing an inadequate understanding of the magnitude of the problem.<br/>
The right hon. Member for Stepney and Poplar also fails to ascribe any responsibility for the increasing unemployment to the steady loss of competitiveness in the British economy, caused by the adoption, for the majority of the period in question, of policies on all fours with the one that he once again put to the House.</p>

<p>The right hon. Gentleman knows that there have been many occasions when both Britain and other industrial countries have lost out in competitiveness with, if he likes, more dynamic and go-ahead competitors, but the adjustment that has been made in the past has been through the exchange rate. It was the doctrinaire pursuit of monetarist policies that drove up the exchange rates and added to the loss of competitiveness of the British economy, as the Chancellor and the Chief Secretary well know. That is why we are 35 per cent. less competitive than we were in May 1979.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman made some allegations about my lack of comment on the Budget. I shall ask two essential questions, which I hope he will answer. First, is unemployment now to go up and stay up, as we suspect? Secondly, am I or am I not right in what I say about the weight of taxation on the broad mass of our people when we aggregate social security contributions with income tax?</p>

<speech hansard_id="96338" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1982-03-10a.881.2" hansard_membership_id="1643" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/11536" speakername="Mr. Brittan" colnum="881" time="17:28:00">
<p>I was coming to those points, and I shall now do so. The right hon. Gentleman is making a third point that is not correct. I do not accept that the increase in the value of the &#x00A3; sterling, which he so much deplores, was caused by the monetarist policies&#x2014;as he describes them&#x2014;of the Government. The increase in the value of the pound was due almost entirely to factors relating to North Sea oil and not to the monetary policies of the Government.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman has raised a number of points about the Budget, although he has touched on it fairly lightly. He has not examined the policies in the Budget, but has made allegations about it. He began by talking

about unemployment and the impact of the Budget on that problem. The statements that he has made about the Budget and unemployment are based on a complete misreading of what is said in this year's public expenditure White Paper. That makes it clear that the figures are not a forecast or a prediction of unemployment in any sense. It clearly says that if developments on pay and world economic recovery are favourable there is a reasonable prospect that unemployment levels will fall.<br/>
If the right hon. Gentleman will recall what my right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor said in answer to questions on 2 December after the public expenditure announcements, he will remember that he said that there had been no significant difference in these matters since then. My right hon. and learned Friend then said that those figures were consistent with the prospect of some fall in the total unemployment figure before the end of financial year 1982&#x2013;83.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman also ought to know that it is the long-standing practice to adopt as a convention, and no more, for the purpose of estimating public expenditure totals in the White Paper, the assumption in the first year carried over into subsequent years. That is exactly what was done in the last public expenditure White Paper issued by the right hon. Gentleman.<br/>
If the right hon. Gentleman is saying that the prospect of an immediate fall in unemployment is not before the House, he is saying no more than what my right hon. and learned Friend and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Employment have frequently said. There can be no doubt that if one is examining the impact of the Budget&#x2014;which is what we are talking about and about which the right hon. Gentleman is so reluctant to talk&#x2014;it is in the direction of bringing nearer the moment when unemployment will fall.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman looks askance, but it would be astonishing if a Budget that did the things announced by my right hon. and learned Friend yesterday to give assistance to industry by reducing the cost of employing people did not have an impact in the direction of reducing unemployment at an earlier stage than would otherwise be the case. It is not possible, as the right hon. Gentleman knows, from the practice followed by his Government, to give a forecast of the date on which unemployment will start to fall. That is not something that his Government did, and it was something that the Leader of the Opposition, when he was Secretary of State for Employment, steadily refused to do.<br/>
It is inconceivable that if the national insurance surcharge is reduced by 1 per cent. and if there is assistance to the construction industry by way of home improvement grants, that that will not help rather than hinder employment. Who will be carrying out the extra work that will be provided for by the money from the Exchequer for home improvement grants? Who will be assisted by the extra money in the energy package provided by my right hon. and learned Friend, except the firms that are at the moment experiencing difficulty and have had to lay off people? They will be materially assisted by the programme.</p>

<p>The estimating assumptions of 2&#x00B7;9 million unemployed people in Great Britain, excluding Northern Ireland, are for the


years 1982&#x2013;83 to 1984&#x2013;85, as the White Paper makes clear. This is what the White Paper is all about. Does the right hon. and learned Gentleman repudiate it?</p>

<p>I am sorry that the right hon. Gentleman was not able to listen when I explained that the reference to the later years follows exactly the convention in the public expenditure White Paper issued by the Labour Government. It is a conventional assumption carrying forward the unemployment figures assumed for this year. It does not indicate anything at all about future years. I am sorry that I was not able to keep the right hon. Gentleman's attention when I was explaining this matter.<br/>
There has been talk of the effect on employment. Only those who are blind to the facts can possibly deny that the measures introduced by my right hon. and learned Friend in relation to the national insurance surcharge and the construction industry, and the measures that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Industry will be amplifying to give assistance to the growth sectors of the British economy, which will lead to the jobs of tomorrow, point in the direction of increasing employment and not diminishing it. It is farcical and fantastic to present anything in a contrary sense.<br/>
The right hon. Member for Stepney and Poplar also made much of the tax position. Indeed, some Opposition spokesmen have even suggested that the Budget is, in some sense, deflationary. I find that a fantastic proposition. The tax cuts made by the Chancellor amount to &#x00A3;1,625 million in 1982&#x2013;83 and to &#x00A3;3,055 million in a full year. On top of that there are the expenditure plans of &#x00A3;350 million in 1982&#x2013;83 in addition to the &#x00A3;5 billion increase announced in December. Expressed in terms of the public sector borrowing requirement, the &#x00A3;1&#x00B7;3 billion addition that my right hon. and learned Friend announced over and above the level that would otherwise be the case speaks for itself. The percentage of gross domestic product taken in tax, if national insurance contribution and rates are included, will be reduced from 40 to 39&#x00B7;3 per cent.<br/>
If one looks at the impact on the individual, the net effect, including national insurance contributions, is beneficial&#x2014;</p>

Of course, the impact on individuals in particular circumstances will vary. My right hon. and learned Friend has not put forward the Budget primarily as a series of tax concessions to the individual. He has sought to present the Budget as one designed to sustain and nurture an economic recovery that has already commenced.</p>

<p>Every time Governments have tried to deal with the upward trend in unemployment, which has continued for so long, by spending and borrowing more, as the right hon. Gentleman advocates, the result has been higher inflation and a diminishing effect on jobs and output. The Labour Government saw the doubling of unemployment, yet the right hon. Gentleman now says that he can create at least 2&#x00BD; million jobs in five years.<br/>
It is all supposed to be different this time, but what has the Labour Party to offer now that makes it so different? The formula offered is not new. It has been tried and found wanting. The effects of higher spending and borrowing are to be checked by price and exchange controls and a deal with the unions. That was precisely the strategy of the Labour Government.<br/>
I remind the right hon. Gentleman of the result, as we have seen it in action. The result was 27 per cent. inflation, 30 per cent. wage increases, steadily rising unemployment and then the forced resort to the IMF to bail us out. There was then a cut in public spending of 8&#x00BD; per cent. in real terms between 1975&#x2013;76 and 1977&#x2013;78. That is what happened under the Labour Government.<br/>
The really significant feature of that period was the intervention of the IMF and the subsequent pursuit of policies which actually led both to lower inflation and to lower unemployment. Yet is is precisely the policies which were then successully pursued that the right hon. Gentleman now denounces. He tells us that it is possible safely to embark upon an inflationary policy of increasing public expenditure and reducing taxation by about &#x00A3;9 billion. He calculates that that would mean an increase in borrowing of about &#x00A3;5&#x00BD; billion. All experience shows that to suggest that that would lead to anything other than a massive rise in interest rates is a travesty of history. The right hon. Gentleman denies that.</p>

<p>No, I shall not give way.<br/>
We are told that some of the money borrowed by the Government would go back to the companies, which would then reduce their own borrowing. If that is so, there would be no beneficial impact on output and jobs. We are told that exchange controls would be reimposed to keep money in the country for the Government to borrow. As my right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor told the House on 11 February, it is clear that the effect upon interest rates of removing exchange controls is very small. The proposition that the reverse effect would be different is therefore unworthy of support.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman then says that there is no need to worry about interest rates because we can abandon the monetary targets, which can be relaxed and forgotten about altogether. If that is true at all, it is true only in the very short term. It is no accident that countries with low interest rates are those with low inflation rates and monetary targets.<br/>
In the years after the first oil shock, we enjoyed&#x2014;if that is the right word&#x2014;an inflation rate at least double that of Germany. Like the more successful countries, we must maintain monetary targets if we are to bring down inflation and interest rates. This is not some kind of aberration. Governments throughout the world now set such targets. In the United States, Germany, Canada, Switzerland and even in France, that is the position.</p>

<p>I am very grateful to the Chief Secretary for giving way. On the question of interest rates, now that I have the rare privilege of asking him a couple of questions, perhaps he will confirm what he has so far refused to confirm and what his right hon. Friend refused to confirm yesterday. It seems that the Government are unwilling to answer any questions put to them by the Opposition about personal taxation. Will the Minister confirm that for the average family man on average income the burden of direct taxation&#x2014;that is, national insurance and income tax&#x2014;will be a higher percentage of his income in 1982&#x2013;83 than it was in 1981&#x2013;82?</p>

<p>If the hon. Gentleman thinks that that is a question about interest rates, he has certainly lost me.<br/>
The right hon. Member for Stepney and Poplar does not like it, of course, but I am following through the


implications of the policy that he has put before the House and showing that the consequences of abandoning the monetary targets are bound to be highly inflationary. The risk of creating extra demand is that it will be spent on foreign goods. The right hon. Gentleman envisages that, to avoid the increase in money supply being spent on foreign goods, there must be a trade strategy to protect the plan from being frustrated by our propensity to attract imports. It is difficult to imagine what distinction there might be between a "trade strategy" and the more familiar "import controls". If we impose import controls, what is to prevent others from setting in place a trade strategy designed to prevent their plans from being frustrated by their own propensity to attract our exports? That would certainly not help British jobs.<br/>
Perhaps the proponents of this plan have in mind other inducements, in the form of subsidies or direction, to persuade people to buy British goods. The truth is that with vastly increased borrowing and import controls to prevent foreign competition, and with monetary control abandoned, the inflationary pressures that would build up would be enormous.<br/>
It is here that the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Bath (Mr. Patten) arises, because the only solution that is put forward by the Opposition is the so-called annual economic assessment&#x2014;the Government, employers and the unions will work out what is to go where and how. However, an incomes policy agreed with the unions appears to be struggling to get out from the deliberately anodyne and bashful proposal of an annual economic assessment.<br/>
No doubt we shall also be told how the share of national income going to profits, rents, social benefits and other incomes will be determined. The one thing that we can say with certainty is that an economic assessment of that kind&#x2014;however wrapped up, however bashful as an incomes policy&#x2014;will not work, because it is one of a long line of such attempts. There was the
<q>solemn and binding undertaking</q>
which&#x2014;I use the words of the right hon. Member for Leeds, East (Mr. Healey)&#x2014;
<q>melted away like butter in the sun.</q>
In addition, there was the social contract, of which the right hon. Member for Heywood and Royton has written:
<q>The only give and take in the contract was when the Government gave and the unions took.</q>
Therefore, the belief that it is possible to deal with the inflationary consequences of rampant monetary growth and of borrowing, on the scale that the right hon. Member for Stepney and Poplar suggests, by some kind of economic assessment is simply cloud-cuckoo-land. We have exchange controls, import controls, incomes policy, and control of profits, rents and so on. It is all very coyly expressed, but it is all there. Then we have a dash of commitment on all sides to industrial plannning to ensure that each major company plays its part in the national plan for recovery.<br/>
It is the same mixture of direction and control as before. As the right hon. Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell) has noted in a recent critique of the right hon. Gentleman's proposals&#x2014;[HON. MEMBERS: "He said 'Vote Labour' ."]. &#x2014;once there is borrowing on the scale put forward, the only consequence is inflation. The attempt to deal with inflation caused by interest rates soaring as a result of these irresponsible policies can only mean, in the words of the right hon. Member for Down, South, that

<q>there must be control&#x2014;comprehensive, thorough. rigorous control of every aspect of the economy".</q>
Therefore, let not the right hon. Member for Stepney and Poplar beguile the House or Britain into believing that there is a prospect of reaching prosperity and full employment under his proposals in a free economic society, because there is not. Once we embark on the road advocated by the right hon. Gentleman there is no alternative but the siege economy, which he is reluctant to endorse in full, but undoubtedly puts forward in his document.</p>

<p>The right hon. Gentleman really must show a little more sense of history and temperance than that. The whole Western world&#x2014;not only Britain&#x2014;had full employment without any undue inflationary pressures for three decades up to the great upheaval of the mid-1970s. Germany had less than 1 per cent. unemployment. Therefore, to say that we cannot have full employment and contain inflation without reverting to a kind of siege economy is to talk through one's hat. May I put a last point&#x2014;<i>[Interruption.]</i> I am sure that the right hon. and learned Gentleman heard the bugles of the fifth cavalry riding to his rescue. Will he answer that point and the one that was put to him a few moments ago?</p>

<p>The right hon. Gentleman knows perfectly well that I am not the one who says that inflation and unemployment cannot be dealt with without a siege economy. It is the right hon. Gentleman who is saying that. The references to economic management and economic assessment and all the matters that. I have put forward are from his programme. The inexorable logic of the siege economy emerges from an attempt to deal with the problem of unemployment by building more inflation in the system.<br/>
Of course it is possible to deal with unemployment and with the long-term ills of the economy. It is to deal with those problems by improving the competitiveness of the British economy that we have embarked on our policy, and the signs of success are beginning to be increasingly apparent.<br/>
My right hon. and learned Friend has put forward a series of measures which are designed to give assistance to the one area of the British economy which can furnish further advances on the road to success&#x2014;British industry and business.<br/>
For the right hon. Gentleman to seek to decry the assistance given to the construction industry&#x2014;an industry which the Opposition always have on their lips&#x2014;is a piece of arrant hypocrisy. For the right hon. Gentleman to say that the reduction in the national insurance surcharge will not help economic revival is another piece of arrant hypocrisy. For the right hon. Gentleman to ignore the impact of the measures to help the new technologically-based industries is a piece of blindness or hypocrisy. For him to ignore the changes in the tax system designed to assist enterprise is to ignore totally the measures that my right hon. and learned Friend has taken to assist the recovery of the British economy.<br/>
It is painful for the right hon. Gentleman to hear his massive reflationary policies exposed as failures in the past and doomed, if followed, to lead to hyper-inflation and economic collapse. It is painful for the right lion. Gentleman to hear the sustained policy put forward by my right hon. and learned Friend to increase the competitiveness of the British economy and assist recovery. It is


because the policy that my right hon. and learned Friend has put forward will assist in recovery, without leading to further inflation and massive problems with interest rates, that it has commended itself to my right hon. and hon. Friends, and to the House and the country.</p>

<p>George III. I accept correction more graciously than the Chief Secretary does.<br/>
Every so often, in the splendid township of Denby Dale, we have nostalgic pie bakings to remind us of those celebrations, and everyone says to everyone else how terrible it must have been for the people of Britain to know that the Head of State was eating his meals off the carpet and thought that cows could fly. They imagine how marvellous it must have been when people suddenly realised that the King was back to normal mental health.<br/>
That experience enables me to understand precisely the feelings of Tory wets when the Budget made it clear yesterday that monetary madness had been exorcised and that the whole nonsense of M3 had been virtually banished from the Chancellor's policies and calculations. It must have been a good moment and we cannot grudge Tory Members their temporary demonstration of immense relief.<br/>
My only complaint concerns the extremely undignified way in which the heresy was banished, not by a quiet burial or a modest requiem but by the cruel business of exposing it to a derisive caricature, for the Chancellor said that in future he would look at all the indicators and would act accordingly.<br/>
Imagine an episode in "Yes Minister" when the Chancellor is seated before a great number of dials and, as almost always happens&#x2014;and as the Red Book shows&#x2014;half the dials point to the monetary figures going backward, while the rest of them point to the monetary figures increasing rapidly and alarmingly. There is also the exchange rate, which the Chancellor says he will look at in the future&#x2014;a very big change&#x2014;and money GDP. Faced with all that mutually contradictory evidence, the Chancellor flees from the room clutching his forehead and saying that he cannot possibly make head or tail of it&#x2014;and he will be right. However, that is a rather undignified exit for the sheet anchor of the policy of the past three disastrous years.<br/>
Now we can breathe again, because undoubtedly monetary pragmatism now rules. The recommendations of the Select Committee on that subject have at last penetrated the skulls of Treasury Ministers.<br/>
It is interesting that regional comments on the Budget have been far more acidly critical than the comments of the moguls who do well out of pretending to represent

national industry from a desk in London. Indeed, the nearer to the miserable coal-face of our battered economy, the more pungent the criticism. I am not surprised. Taken with the December measures, which the Chancellor characteristically kept quiet about yesterday, the net effect of the Budget is depressive. No wonder that it gives rise to the official assumption that there will be a further 300,000 unemployed during the coming year.<br/>
A particularly impudent part of the Chancellor's speech was his priggish accusation that previous Governments, including those of his own party, had
<q>plundered the store of investment for the future."&#x2014;[<i>Official Report,</i> 9 March 1982; Vol. 19, c. 730.]</q>
How can that lie on the lips of a Government who yesterday published a White Paper on public expenditure showing that we are ruining our higher education? What could be more important as an investment store for the future than training students in the new technologies and educating our scholars and intellectuals of the future? How can a Government who are sabotaging universities such as Bradford, Salford and Aston criticise their predecessors in this way?<br/>
In neglecting urgent capital projects, the Government are doing the traditional work of the business shyster who takes on a business that urgently requires a lot of annual repairs but who fails to have them carried out and thus produces fictitious profit figures. He sells out the company when its assets have been virtually brought to ruin. It is therefore not acceptable to us for the Government to claim credit for a Budget which aids industry.<br/>
I turn to direct tax. By a mere token recovery of only 2 per cent. in the 17 per cent. rate of inflation, which the Chancellor ignored last year when dealing with personal tax thresholds and allowances, the Chancellor is once again condemning many poor people to paying direct taxation. The thresholds for direct taxation in this country are the lowest of any country in the free world, except Italy which levies a rate of only 18 per cent. on its low thresholds. Even after the Budget indexations, a single earner will start paying 38&#x00B7;75 per cent. direct tax on earnings of just over &#x00A3;30 a week. A man working, with a wife at home, earning only &#x00A3;47 a week will start paying direct tax at the punitive rate of 38&#x00B7;75 per cent. That is the highest rate for starting direct taxation anywhere in the free world except, perhaps, Australia. It is that fact which the Labour segment of the Opposition rightly brought to the attention of the House and which the Chief Secretary refuses to answer.<br/>
Table 9, published by the Treasury yesterday, which the Tory press for the most part unfortunately failed to print, makes it clear that after the indexing of pay by a modest 7&#x00BD; per cent., people on incomes right up to &#x00A3;16,000 will be paying a higher percentage of their incomes in direct taxation as a result of the Budget than they paid during the year 1981&#x2013;82. If the Chief Secretary wishes to contest the Treasury press release I shall be happy to give him the opportunity to do so.</p>

<p>The House is in difficulty. An important part of the Budget debate concerns whether overall tax rates have increased or diminished. Obviously that affects what we shall say to the country. We can argue about matters of opinion, but we want, as far as possible, an agreed basis of fact. What the hon. Gentleman has suggested either is the case or it is not.<br/>
The tables clearly show one thing, but the Chancellor and the Chief Secretary have asserted another. It is the duty of the Chief Secretary and the Treasury team to tell us what is the truth.</p>

<p>I shall be willing to leave off in mid-sentence&#x2014;I do not have Ministers' obsession with syntax&#x2014;if the Chief Secretary decides to reply. It may stimulate his efforts if I remind him that the present Prime Minister said in 1977:
<q>We pay the highest rate of income tax at the lowest level of income of any country in the EEC. That is the measure of Socialism&#x2014;the effect on the poorer people of this country."&#x2014;[<i>Official Report,</i> 29 March 1977; Vol. 929, c. 293.]</q>
Whether it is an effect of Socialism or Toryism, it is intolerable to Liberals that the whole basis of the Welfare State should be destroyed by making the poor pay for their own benefits. That is a principle which, given the opportunity by the British people, we shall reverse. It will undoubtedly be one of the first aims of an alliance Government to work towards a position where income tax would cease to be significant to anyone earning less than half national average earnings.<br/>
I do not say that as a proud boast, because when I was first elected to the House, which is not that long ago, people needed to bother about income tax only if they were earning more than the full average wage. All that I am saying is that we would struggle to get back to a position where those on half average national earnings would not be subject to income tax.</p>

<p>As the Chief Secretary has not accepted the hon. Gentleman's invitation to confirm or deny the figures that he quoted from table 9, does the hon.

<p>That appears to be the position, but I never give up hope and I shall carry on, with the bare tolerance of the House, in the hope that the Chief Secretary will intervene in the next few minutes.<br/>
The appalling thing is that all these miseries have been inflicted on the country when it is in an extraordinarily privileged economic position which no previous Government have had the good luck to enjoy. The Government do not have to worry about the traditional balance of payments crises that bedevilled the economic efforts of previous Governments of both parties.<br/>
The Government have the incredible gift from Providence of North Sea oil, but all that they are using it for is to maintain an army of 3 million or 4 million in enforced idleness. Meanwhile, the country's physical assets are, in many cases, going to rack and ruin.<br/>
Turning to other important matters, we had hoped that, in view of the appalling winter suffered by so many, the Chancellor would find it in his heart to reduce the gas tax. It is not widely known, but it is a fact, that the Government levy a tax of 5p on every therm extracted from the North Sea.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman was not listening carefully, nor has he read the briefing notes. The Government are reducing the gas levy by 1p a therm to ensure that industrial gas prices are kept down.</p>

<p>Perhaps I was rash to offer to be interrupted in mid-sentence, because I am referring specifically to domestic gas prices. I referred especially to those who live in the colder and wetter parts of Britain and, more than ever, to those who live in substandard accommodation where they suffer from cold and damp. That the Government's tax on North Sea gas should bring about&#x2014;there was no other cause&#x2014;an increase of 23 per cent. in domestic gas prices from April to October last year is a scandal. It is no good trying to palm it off on the British Gas Corporation. It is a direct result of Government taxation. We had hoped to see a reduction in the rise of domestic gas prices.<br/>
Another meanness in the Budget is the refusal adequately to uprate child benefit. Even if the Chancellor had been fair and considerate enough to increase child benefit by &#x00A3;1 , which was our proposal and that of many others, he would still not have returned child benefit to the purchasing power that it had when the right hon. Lady entered 10 Downing Street. To deny child allowances in that way seems peculiarly hard.<br/>
The sad fact is that all the pratings about monetarism and the new economic outlook and the policy are making no lasting structural improvement either to our industrial relations or to our capacity for output. There may be temporary boons for some privileged people. Unfortunately, there are benefits for some if 3 million or 4 million of their fellow countrymen are idle, but there is no permanent improvement. Ministers are well aware that if ever, by some miracle, the economy is stoked up again and is working properly, we shall find that there has been no improvement in methods of restraining or bargaining over pay and no improvement in basic industrial relations and we shall be struggling to do all that with manifestly decaying industrial assets.<br/>
This Budget will not benefit the real economy about which the Chancellor so often speaks. In desperation, many people who are over-taxed, with their real disposable income at 1978 levels, may be driven to the black economy. Only the black economy stands to benefit from this Budget, which we reject.</p>

<p>I wish to raise only two or three points with the Treasury Bench. However, it is a good opportunity for an independent Back Bencher on the Government side to express approval of some aspects of the Budget and at the same time to express criticism of other aspects that he believes will be damaging to some sectors in industry.<br/>
The hon. Member for Colne Valley (Mr. Wainwright), and the right hon. Member for Stepney and Poplar (Mr. Shore) who spoke for the official Opposition, were less than reasonable in their criticism of the Budget because, although I have described it as a modestly industry-oriented Budget, it has some extremely good features. My right hon. and learned Friend the Chief Secretary to the Treasury was correct to criticise the right hon. Member for Stepney and Poplar for failing to tackle the details of the Budget in his speech. I do not believe that the hon. Member for Colne Valley, who spoke on behalf of the Liberal-SDP alliance, reflected the views of many small business men and industrialists who have in the past 24 hours welcomed the Budget&#x2014;even if it be only lukewarm welcome&#x2014;because it is moving in the right direction. It would be wrong not to admit that much more ground must


be made up, but I hope that my right hon. and learned Friend does not accept all the criticism and believe that the Opposition feel that there is no good in what was announced yesterday.<br/>
A matter close to my heart is the caning that the beer industry has had from my right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer. I declare an interest as non-executive chairman of CAMRA (Real Ale) Investments PLC. The House should be aware of the savage increases that the brewing industry has had to take by way of extra tax since the Government came to office. In the 1981 Budget my right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor increased the tax on beer by almost 40 per cent., which was well ahead of inflation. That biggest ever Government increase added between 4p and 5p in Excise duty and VAT to the price of a pint of beer. Is my right hon. and learned Friend aware that the industry is a substantial employer? It employs tens of thousands of people not only in breweries but in pubs and off-licenses. In the past two years, as a result of increases in excise duty and VAT, the consumption of beer has gone down by 3 million pints a day. We have seen the effect of that on the revenue that the Government receive from the brewing industry.<br/>
The beer drinkers' tax burden has almost doubled since the Government came to power. I warn my right hon. and learned Friend that he is in danger of throttling the goose that laid the golden egg. I appreciate that the increase this year might have been larger and perhaps we should be thankful for small mercies. However, in the way that this sector of the economy is being caned, there is a limit to the burden that it can accept. I hope that that message is taken well and truly on board.<br/>
If we add to that the proposal that the licence fee for 5p and lop gaming machines will be increased in clubs and pubs, I assure my right hon. and learned Friend, sadly, that that will result in the closure of pubs in certain areas which currently operate only on a marginal profit. It will also create great problems for clubs. Perhaps again we should be grateful for small mercies in that the Government did not introduce an ad valorem tax on gaming machines. I am grateful for the attention that the Treasury paid to the representations that were made about that proposal.<br/>
However, many areas are served by pubs that operate on a touch and go profit margin. The additional burdens could well drive those establishments out of existence, thereby creating a vacuum of facilities both in urban and rural areas. I hope that my right hon. and learned Friend will take that message to my right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor so that he does not believe that this goose can continue to lay golden eggs. He will know from his returns that the amount of excise duty and VAT is down substantially and that his increase, although it may temporarily bring him additional resources, could well result in a fall in revenue from this sector of the economy.<br/>
Having got that hot potato off my chest, may I say that the overall package of proposals for small businesses is warmly to be welcomed. The extension of some schemes announced by my right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor last year, which have been promoted so brilliantly by the Under Secretary of State for Industry, my hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, South (Mr. MacGregor), will pay handsome dividends to the

Government. Perhaps many of the little trees that have started to sprout from those acorns will produce the upturn in employment that Britain so desperately requires.<br/>
It is interesting that the schemes announced by my right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor, which are an extension of the new training initiative, the community workshops and the work scheme that featured so prominently in the Budget yesterday, were not mentioned by the right hon. Member for Stepney and Poplar today. It would be helpful if we could reduce the dole queue by 100,000, even if those people will be only moderately remunerated, in order to carry out worthwhile community projects. I sincerely hope that we receive the support of the trade union movement for this scheme, because it will give a meaningful purpose to work for many people who are at present out of work and who want to contribute in some way to the community and the economy.<br/>
I want to raise one other point of substance, which was raised earlier. Would it not be possible for the Government to look again at the threshold at which those who are out of work through no fault of their own can draw supplementary benefit? It seems grossly unfair that people, particularly over the age of 50, who find themselves redundant&#x2014;I repeat, through no irresponsible action of their own, but because of the economic problems of the country and, no doubt, of the industry in which they were working&#x2014;should have to dig into their savings over &#x00A3;2,500 which they had put aside for retirement? It is a disincentive to thrift and saving, and it is an injustice which many Conservative Members hope will be rectified.<br/>
Would it not be possible for the threshold to be raised to a figure closer to &#x00A3;5,000? It could be triggered so that when a person over 50 was made redundant compulsorily, he would be entitled to social security if his savings were &#x00A3;5,000 and no more. The figure at which a younger person would qualify for supplementary benefit could be accordingly lower. I hope that this matter can be looked at, and that the trigger sum of &#x00A3;2,500 will be reconsidered. There is a severe injustice here, and I hope that my right hon. and learned Friend will take note of what I say.<br/>
I commiserate with my right hon. and learned Friend, because he has been caught slightly with his guard down in connection with the tax tables. Table 9 was mentioned by several Opposition Members. Since this Government came to power, let alone during the past 12 or 24 months, the average family man on the average wage has paid more tax, taking into account national insurance contributions. Perhaps I can help my right hon. and learned Friend. I have not raised the matter to be unhelpful. I hope that he will come clean in this connection, if that is the right expression to use, because the media are well aware of the situation, and certainly I, as a salary earner, am well aware of it. It would be wrong if the Government sought to mislead the House and the country in any way. This Government are committed during their term of office to reduce the overall burden of direct taxation.</p>

<p>The right hon. Gentleman is speaking through me to the Chief Secretary on the Treasury Bench, who has perhaps got the message that both tables 9 and 10 should receive attention in the Government's winding-up speech.<br/>
I welcome the Budget, with some reservations. It is perhaps the first Budget that is moving towards reflation. It has given modest confidence to industry and commerce. It will ensure that industry can maintain its current work force. In 12 months' time, I hope, the desperate unemployment figures will slowly begin to come down. The various measures announced for small businesses and the energy package are most welcome. They will bring benefits to industry and commerce. However, it is only a start.<br/>
I hope that the British work force, and particularly the trade union movement, will see a glimmer of hope for the future and continue to put in moderate wage demands, so that the economy which has begun to get off the ground can maintain the progress that it is making. Then, as the hon. Member for the Colne Valley said, all our people, whatever their position in life or salary, will benefit from the improvements in the country's economy.</p>

<p>By leave of the House, I wish to say a few words. Last night, in 15 seconds, I blurted out one sentence at 6.59 pm. In normal times, or at any time during the past 19 years that I have been a Member of the House, I would not make a narrow speech pertaining to the Budget. However, the situation is not normal&#x2014;at least, I hope that it is not normal&#x2014;in the constituency of West Lothian. Unemployment there is 24 per cent. Among young people, unemployment is now 40 per cent. in some areas.<br/>
That brings me to column. 747 in the Budget speech. My purpose is to engage the interest of Ministers, and particularly of their civil servants, because in my view Treasury civil servants can do something about the situation before it is too late. I wish to bring to the attention of Ministers the proposed closure of MOTEC at Livingston. It was visited by a Select Committee of the House, my hon. Friends the Members for Newcastle-under-Lyme (Mr. Golding), Glasgow, Maryhill (Mr. Craigen) and Thurrock (Dr. McDonald), and also I believe, by a number of Conservative Members, some time ago.<br/>
MOTEC of Livingston has a record of 1,500 apprentices, not one of whom has failed external City and Guilds examinations. In fact, it is the flagship of the road transport industry training board's training scheme. For a moment I shall address my remarks to Scottish Members of Parliament. I hope that the Scottish Whip, the hon. Member for Galloway (Mr. Lang), the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker) and all hon. Members representing the North of England realise that if Livingston is shut there will not be a skills testing centre north of Gainsborough. Livingston serves not only Scotland but the North of England.<br/>
I excuse myself for raising this matter in the Budget debate by saying that, unlike Plessey, British Leyland and the International Synthetic Rubber Company, this is a problem of the North. Apprentices come to Livingston for their training from the whole area north of the Humber.<br/>
Is it really value for money for the Chancellor to talk about help for small engineering firms? Is it sensible to spend money on the Services&#x2014;in fact, I do not dispute this&#x2014;for allowing youngsters to clamber over rocks, while at the same time closing a purpose-built centre which allows them to clamber over vehicles to considerable effect? I, as the constituency Member of Parliament, have

visited the facility on several occasions, most recently last week, and I have seen the purpose-built paint shop, the diesel fuel injection pump unit, again purpose-built, &#x00A3;4 million-worth of training machinery with special gadgets whereby faults can be picked out on special simulators, by apprentices. Moreover, there is &#x00A3;2 million-worth of land and buildings.<br/>
I particularly welcome the presence of my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Central (Mr. Cook) on the Opposition Front Bench, because he knows the situation in Livingston, and he knows exactly what I am talking about. Is it not a crying shame that the road transport board should apparently make proposals&#x2014;as it has done, because the letters of possible redundancy are actually going out&#x2014;without the Under-Secretary of State for Employment knowing about it? I think that the Under-Secretary of State for Employment did not know that this was the proposal until I put down a parliamentary question.<br/>
I am not scolding the Government. I am asking for help on behalf of the road transport committee at Livingston, the chairman of which is Alec Kitson. The local trade unions feel strongly on this issue. They are united with the management. The management has my admiration for having sweated for 10 years to build up this establishment to achieve something. The idea that it can be economically consolidated or merged with High Ercall on the Shropshire border is ridiculous. I have nothing against High Ercall&#x2014;it has my regard&#x2014;but it is a different kind of establishment from that at Livingston. Livingston is a craft engineering centre.<br/>
I listened hawk-like to the Chancellor and heard him say that there was to be special help for small engineering firms. Among small engineering firms are many garages. The problem is that the levy has been cut. The Scots should be careful, for reasons that each one of us knows. A 44 per cent. cut in the grant for the road transport board throughout Britain means a 90 per cent. cut in Scotland. They can draw their own political conclusions from that. I will not go into it further.<br/>
This is a valuable establishment which stands on its own merits. When the Government are getting into expenditure to help small employers, could not the Treasury consult the road transport board before it goes any further? Could it not ask its colleagues at the Department of Employment whether it is wise to go ahead with the sort of scheme outlined in column 747 with the right hand, and with the left hand pass by like a biblical Levite on the other side of the road and say that it is a matter for the road transport board, which must take its own decisions.<br/>
The purpose of my speech is to plead with Treasury officials and Treasury Ministers to get in contact with their colleagues at the Department of Employment. They should prepare the Prime Minister for Question No. 4 next Thursday which asks her to visit Livingston. I am writing a long background letter to her because I do not believe that civil servants should waste their time wondering what open questions are about. They should brief the Prime Minister before then.<br/>
The Government should consider the situation carefully before 13 April, when the transport board will be making a final decision. We do not want to see the closure of a firm which is precisely the kind of establishment which on their own definition the Government say they want to encourage, at the same time as other schemes which are


less satisfactory are set up in non-purpose-built premises. Ministers, particularly the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland who has come in to the House, presumably because he saw a Scottish MP's name on the screen, should interest himself in it. Action would be not just for me as a constituency MP but for every MP, regardless of party, north of the Humber.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for West Lothian (Mr. Dalyell) has just made a speech about a point obviously of great importance to his constituency. I hope he will not mind if I do not follow the detailed points he made. No doubt he will hear in due course from the Treasury about these matters.<br/>
I have been critical of the economic strategy of the Government, and I still am, but it would be churlish not to welcome, and indeed commend, certain features of the Chancellor's Budget. First, I should like in his absence to congratulate my right hon. and learned Friend on the manner in which he introduced his Budget. His was a confident parliamentary performance. Despite the lengh of his speech, which was understandable in the circumstances, he retained the attention of the House throughout. He may not consider that I am being quite so complimentary if I add that his speech was also a highly skilful political performance.<br/>
Several of the measures which were introduced deserve a particularly warm welcome. The increase in the retirement pension obviously comes to mind straight away, an increase which covers not only the projected rate of inflation but in addition the 2 per cent. shortfall in the past year. The Chancellor's decision to have second thoughts on the increase in other benefits should be warmly welcomed, as should his decision to exempt the mobility allowance from income tax.<br/>
Although I do not think that my right hon. and learned Friend went far enough, I was pleased about the reduction in the national insurance surcharge, which is a step in the right direction to reduce industrial costs, to increase profits and to help slow down the increase in unemployment.<br/>
The increase in personal tax thresholds is also to be welcomed. The failure to do so last year caused widespread resentment. The fact that the Chancellor has increased the thresholds by 2 per cent. more than the rate of inflation is all to the good.<br/>
Although I welcome these aspects of the Budget, like my right hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham (Sir I. Gilmour), I think that the parts are better than the whole. Of course it is a much better Budget than last year's. Despite what the Chancellor may say, last year's Budget was deflationary. Despite what the Opposition may say, this Budget is not deflationary. Neither is it reflationary; it is a neutral Budget. At a time when we have 3 million people out of work and when there is massive under-utilised capital capacity in the economy, this is a mistake.<br/>
This brings me to the central thrust of the economic policies of the Government over the last three years, about which I have the gravest doubts which remain unaffected by yesterday's Budget. I am not alone on these Benches in having these doubts. It would be surprising if I was, because the economic policies of this Conservative Government are very different from those of all the other

post-war Conservative Governments. We think of this particularly today following the tributes paid earlier to R. A. Butler, in my view by far the most successful Chancellor of the Exchequer since the end of the war.<br/>
When the Government came into office in 1979 they claimed that the cause of the country's economic problems had been a failure to control the money supply and that if that was done all would be well. It was suggested that when the supply of money increased, prices rose, and that if the supply of money was controlled inflation would be eliminated and somehow everything else would fall into place.<br/>
But that was always nonsense&#x2014;first, because no one knows which measure of money supply should be used; secondly, because no one knows whether, the measure having been chosen, the actual quantity can be accurately determined; and, thirdly, because in any event the velocity of circulation of money cannot be controlled. Monetarism is therefore a policy based on shifting and dangerous sands. I had the impression yesterday, I hope not wrongly, that my right hon. and learned Friend was himself beginning to think that.<br/>
Whether the money supply has been under control over the past three years, no one really knows. It will never be known, and it does not matter very much. What matters is that in the past three years the Government have pursued a policy of severe deflation. The results have not been tremendously successful. Unemployment has risen from 1&#x00B7;3 million to 3 million. We have permanently lost a great deal of industrial capacity through bankruptcies, many of them of firms that were very efficient. Manufacturing output has fallen by about 20 per cent. Despite all the claims about increased productivity, manufacturing output per head is up by only 1 per cent. since the Government came to office. Despite the fact that a reduction in the rate of inflation has been the principal aim of the Government's policy, it is today at about the same level as it was when they came to office, and projections suggest that it will remain for some time at a rate considerably above the post-war norm.<br/>
I believe that the reason for the lack of success has been a faulty analysis of our economic problems and in particular of the problem of inflation. There are two kinds of inflation&#x2014;demand-pull inflation and cost-push inflation. Unfortunately, the Government have not distinguished between the two, which call for different policies to right them. Indeed, in answer to an oral question of mine on 30 April last year, my right hon. and learned Friend said that it was not "elucidatory" to make such a distinction. I take a different view.<br/>
Demand-pull inflation occurs when total effective demand for goods and services in the economy as a whole is in excess of supply potential. As total effective demand has fallen short of supply potential since 1966, the British economy has not suffered from demand inflation for quite a long time, and it certainly is not suffering from it now, yet the deflationary policies of the present Government, and of the last Labour Government, have been geared to reducing demand inflation.<br/>
Cost inflation, on the other hand, takes place when income costs rise faster than output; when indirect taxes and excise duties are increased; or when import prices rise.<br/>
There is not much that we can do about increases in import prices. It is regrettable, and often politically unwise, when Governments add to cost inflation by increasing indirect taxation and excise duties. But the main


type of cost inflation that this country has suffered, not only during the past three years, but for a considerable time, is income cost inflation. This has been caused by wages and salaries rising faster than increases in output. In the battle against inflation it is this to which the Government should have directed their attention during the past three years and before, rather than the deflation of demand.<br/>
Some people argue that income cost inflation exists only in conditions of demand inflation, but that presupposes that we have a perfect market for labour. Clearly we do not, for a number of reasons. First, no one has a complete knowledge of the labour market or job opportunities, nor is there complete knowledge of availability of workers. Secondly, no one has sufficient skills to do all jobs. Thirdly, mobility of labour is hindered by factors such as housing and children's education. Fourthly, and far and away most important, the labour market is distorted by monopolistic forces of trade unions and professional bodies. That means that those monopolistic forces can demand and obtain wage and salary increases which are not necessarily related to the demand for labour, either in general or in specific areas.<br/>
That is the main cause of Britain's inflation problem over the past 15 years. How can it be tackled? There are three ways. First, we could deflate the economy to the point where unemployment reached such a level that overall wage and salary increases would be in line with increases in output. That would mean that members of strong unions would still secure increases and members of weak unions and non-unionists would have reductions in their wages. But the level of unemployment at which that would be achieved would certainly be higher than the present 3 million, and therefore would be totally unacceptable for economic and political reasons.<br/>
Secondly, we could tackle income cost inflation by attacking directly the monopoly power of trade unions and professional bodies. I would reject that course, as it clearly is not within the bounds of practical politics in the foreseeable future, and it would result in social unrest. In the longer term there may be something in that argument, but in the short term it will not be very helpful.<br/>
The third way would be to return to an incomes policy, which seems to me the most acceptable course&#x2014;or perhaps I should say the least unacceptable course. Of course, an incomes policy will not provide a perfect solution. Of course, it has severe disadvantages, but I know of no perfect solution to any problem, nor do I know of any policy that does not have disadvantages. I also know that the incomes policy of my right hon. Friend the Member for Sidcup (Mr. Heath) restrained income increases considerably during 1972&#x2013;73 and that the Labour Government's incomes policy had a similar effect from 1975 to 1978.<br/>
I readily accept that at present it would not be easy to introduce an incomes policy and obtain the necessary consensus, but the sooner we start to look for such a policy, the better for everyone. I am convinced that if it were put squarely to the people that an incomes policy that was universally accepted and observed would mean lower unemployment, they would embrace the concept with considerable enthusiasm.<br/>
I have no doubt that the principal problem facing the country today is the level of unemployment. We all know the devastating effect of unemployment on our society in the 1930s. Although unemployment today does not result

in the same economic deprivation, it is doing great social damage. The feeling of not being wanted or needed has undoubtedly embittered many people, especially young people. It has alienated them not only from the mixed economy, but in some cases from democracy itself.<br/>
As in the 1930s, today's unemployment has already adversely affected the quality of the lives of many of those concerned. The effect will stay with them all their days. Today's unemployment has undoubtedly damaged the cohesion and stability of our society. Immediate action is required to halt the increase and then reduce the level.<br/>
Although in my view a neutral Budget&#x2014;I think this is a neutral Budget&#x2014;will stop the rise in unemployment after a certain time lag, it will do nothing to reduce unemployment. That is why the Budget should have been reflationary. That is why it should have aimed to increase the demand for goods and services and so in turn increase the demand for labour<br/>
The degree of reflation should have been of the order suggested by my right hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham&#x2014;&#x00A3;5 billion to &#x00A3;6 billion. Of course, this sounds a lot but it is really a very moderate amount. We have spare capacity in the economy today of about &#x00A3;40 billion. Trying to take up &#x00A3;5 billion to &#x00A3;6 billion of that in the coming year is scarcely irresponsible. Indeed, it would take seven years of expansion at this rate to use up all the spare capacity and, of course, by then there would have been a further increase in capacity.<br/>
I have no desire to be dogmatic about the nature of the reflation I would have liked to see, except that I would have preferred to see it in the form of tax cuts rather than increases in Government expenditure. There is a strong case for a larger reduction in the national insurance surcharge. If it had been reduced further, it could have made a greater contribution than the Chancellor will make to the reduction of industrial costs, increase of profits and reduction in unemployment. In addition, I should have liked to see a reduction in VAT, which would have had a beneficial effect on the retail price index and in turn, one would hope, on wage and salary increases. It would have helped to increase the demand for consumer goods and so increase living standards and reduce unemployment.<br/>
Some people argue that British industry is too inefficient to cope with such a rise in demand and that it would merely lead to an increase in imports. I am surprised to find that those who use that argument often in the next breath say that British industry is leaner and fitter than it has been for years. That apart, while accepting that there may be some risk in such a policy, the longer we put off the expansion of consumer demand, the greater will be the risk. If we cannot take risks of this sort now, when we have North Sea oil, we will never be able to do so.<br/>
If a reflation of about &#x00A3;5 billion to &#x00A3;6 billion had been introduced in this Budget, as I have implied already, it would have had to be accompanied by some form of incomes policy. We are told today that there is a mew atmosphere and new attitudes in industry. Therefore, presumably, the time is right for the start of talks between Government and all interested parties with a view to getting some sort of consensus on income increases. After all, that was suggested in the manifesto we produced at the last general election.<br/>
Even if we do not have reflation, there is surely a case for pursuing such a policy which can only be in the


interests of Britain; if we have a greater understanding of these issues and if there is a new atmosphere in industry, surely now is the time to cash in on this.</p>

<p>I congratulate the hon. Member for Leek (Mr. Knox) on what was undoubtedly a very brave speech. I substantially agreed with his analysis, although I felt that his conclusions, on the scale of the increase, level of demand recommended and the direction to which it should be applied, were inadequate. I agree that it is possible to eliminate the waste in our economy, in unemployed people and resources and to engage all these capacities for the benefit of the entire society. However, concentrating it on reductions in taxation rather than public expenditure is not the right way.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman said that this was a neutral Budget, but I ask him to look at the public expenditure White Paper. The Government have changed their manner of presentation of figures from a presentation in real terms at constant prices to a presentation in cash terms. When one considers the last page of the second volume of the White Paper, one discovers that in order to convert figures in the 1981 White Paper into the figures appearing in the current White Paper, one must add on 41 per cent. The hon. Gentleman will discover that a great many of those things presented as being increases and improvements in the contribution to particular industries turn out to be reductions in overall expenditure. He is wrong in thinking that this is a neutral Budget. He will find, in practice, that the Budget will increase unemployment and is a deflationary rather than a neutral Budget.<br/>
I was anxious to speak to express my vehement disagreement with the economic strategy being pursued by the Government, and also to explain why I found it necessary to leave the Labour Party. I relate my remarks particularly to the speech of the right hon. Member for Stepney and Poplar (Mr. Shore) today, to his speech on 28 January and to the economic package he recently presented. I listened with great interest and enjoyment to the right hon. Gentleman's analysis of the Government's policy and I also had little sympathy for the Chief Secretary to the Treasury when he was wriggling and blustering on the hooks of the shafts which the right hon. Gentleman had directed at him in his analysis of the dishonesty and incompetence of the Government's approach to management of the economy.<br/>
I had, however, sought something more constructive in the right hon. Gentleman's speech; to indicate how, were a Labour Government to be returned to office, they would be able to deal with the problems of unemployment and restore the economy to a state of which I believe it is capable. This country should be a leader rather than a follower&#x2014;a provider rather than a supplicant in world economic circles. However, I found little or nothing. He has said practically nothing today on that subject but we have the benefit of the economic package that he presented last week, and of his speech on 28 January.<br/>
I left the Labour Party because of my commitment to a rapid reduction in unemployment, to a large increase in public spending in order to restore public services to their former levels and then to a continuing improvement from

that base. My commitment on such matters is too great for me to remain in a party whose economic policies have a guarantee of failure built into them.<br/>
I agree, of course, that the Government's policies are built on the assumption of a level of unemployment that I regard as degrading for those affected, destructive of our economic future, inhumane and totally unnecessary. They also deprive everyone in Britain, apart from the very rich, of adequate health, housing, education and other services that we all need. They prevent us from playing the part we should be playing in alleviating world poverty.</p>

Doctors plead with me to use my influence in the House&#x2014;little as it is&#x2014;to prevent the destruction of the more valuable aspects of our Health Service and to ensure that we sustain the standards of education and higher education in the health service. Everybody that I speak to says that the situation is deteriorating, is dangerous and is alarming.<br/>
I return to the main thrust of my speech, which concerns the Labour Party's economic policies and the prescription that we are invited to believe will be presented if the Labour Party is returned to power. The Labour Party's economic policy is based on a massive injection of demand into the economy. I certainly agree with that. However, I do not pretend to be capable of as fine an economic judgment as to know whether the sum should be the &#x00A3;9,000 million mentioned by the right hon. Member for Stepney


and Poplar in his economic package, the &#x00A3;8,300 million advocated by the TUC in its programme for recovery, or the &#x00A3;6,000 million referred to by the right hon. Member for Crosby (Mrs. Williams) in her speech in the House on 27 February. However, I suspect that the figure mentioned by the hon. Member for Leek and recommended by the right hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham (Sir I. Gilmour) is inadequate to cope with the problems, for the reasons that the hon. Member for Leek suggested: it will take seven years to absorb the wasted resources.</p>

<p>I accept that. It is a question of fine economic tuning rather than fundamental judgments about the direction in which the economy will move. However, all of those whom I have mentioned agree that we should move towards a substantial reflation of demand. I agree with the hon. Member for Leek that our problems have stemmed from income cost inflation rather than demand inflation. I believe that we need a substantial increase in demand.<br/>
Suggested figures for the level of increase have been given from several quarters, and most of them have been fed, on various assumptions, through the Treasury model. On certain assumptions, the larger figure mentioned by the right hon. Member for Stepney and Poplar and by the TUC would not necessarily involve massive inflation. However, a prediction from the Treasury model about the effect on the economy of an additional &#x00A3;1,000 million cannot necessarily be multiplied by eight to ascertain the effect of a &#x00A3;8,000 million injection. Therefore, I am inclined to keep within the lower rather than the upper band of the scale, at least in the early years.<br/>
The Labour Party's strategy is based on assumptions that are incapable of realisation. The last Labour Party conference reaffirmed its commitment to free collective bargaining, and to the rejection of any form of incomes policy by an overwhelming vote of acclamation. A minority no doubt dissented, but none of those who disagreed dared to demand a vote, because they knew well that their support in such a vote would be derisory.<br/>
In a speech on 28 January, the right hon. Member for Stepney and Poplar said:
<q>I fully understand the danger of inflation which will then be created. It is a challenge that we must meet and overcome with the aid of a tax policy, a price policy, and a national understanding, to which reference has been made, with the trade unions."&#x2014;[<i>Official Report</i>, 28 January 1982; Vol. 16, c. 1022.]</q>
The right hon. Gentleman knows as well as I do that if demand is rapidly increased, with no control over money incomes, in the period before our industries can increase their output of goods and services to satisfy that demand, the money will be spent in two ways. First, it will force up the prices of goods and services and, secondly, it will suck in additional imports.<br/>
The Labour Party's answer to the second point is import controls, coupled with a commitment to cut ourselves off from the EEC, which provides a market for about 45 per cent. of our exports. The Labour Party has no answer to domestic inflation other than price controls. I have no objection to controls on profiteering, but price controls, with growth in money incomes unchecked, will inevitably lead to rationing and to black markets that are enforceable only in a rigidly controlled economy.<br/>
Of course, I recognise that the right hon. Member for Stepney and Poplar would like to reach some new form of social contact with the unions and to establish a voluntary incomes policy. Indeed, he implied as much on 28 January. However, even if the union leaders wished, in those circumstances, to deliver&#x2014;understanding, as most of the more informed of them do, that only an incomes policy will make possible the expansion of the economy that their members so badly need&#x2014;they will be unable to deliver. It must be remembered that control of much of the middle hierarchy of the trade unions has been seized by unrepresentative militant activists, in much the same way as control of many constituency Labour Parties has been seized.<br/>
I opposed the Government's Employment Bill and disagreeed with many of my hon. Friends in the Social Democratic Party in doing so. I concluded that on balance the harm that that Bill would do outweighed its benefits. However, I would support legislation that made the trade union structure more democratically representative, but, I very much doubt whether we shall see such legislation before the next general election. Such a change will certainly not take place if the Labour Party wins that election.<br/>
If the Labour Party won the next election and the right hon. Member for Stepney and Poplar became the Chancellor of the Exchequer, he would face a trade union movement, the bulk of whose branch and district officials were implacably opposed to co-operating in any form of voluntary incomes policy. Even if the right hon. Gentleman, in desperation, and with a majority in the House, were to turn to the threat of a statutory incomes policy&#x2014;whether in the form of an inflation tax, as I would favour, or any other&#x2014;he would find that his hon Friends would be unwilling to carry it through.<br/>
If the Labour Party were to gain a majority in the House in the next Parliament, the political complexion of the Parliamentary Labour Party would scarcely bear contemplation. The candidates being selected now for seats that the Labour Party will have to hold or win if it is to succeed at the next election are, on balance, much more likely to support the views of the right hon. Member for Bristol, South-East (Mr. Benn) than those of the right hon. Member for Stepney and Poplar.</p>

<p>We are discussing the Government's policies and those presented by the Opposition. We are also discussing whether the Opposition would be able to carry into effect any of its policies. As I have said, their policies have a built-in guarantee of failure. It is perfectly in order for me to elaborate on whether proposals put by the Opposition are likely to succeed. Whether the Opposition have a credible alternative is directly relevant to the Budget and to the economic situation. If the official Opposition have no credible alternative, we must search for other policies. The policies that I advocate will, I hope, provide a solution. We must consider what is happening within the various parties. Indeed, the press has told us today that the wets have been defused as a result of the smokescreen that the Chancellor of the Exchequer put up yesterday. However, I was pleased to note that the hon. Member for Leek was not completely satisfied.<br/>
I fear that the Parliamentary Labour Party&#x2014;which has, until now, been the bulwark against the unthought out extremism of the resolutions hurriedly passed through Labour Party conferences&#x2014;would find that that bulwark had disappeared if the Labour Party were to return to power.<br/>
Whether the right hon. Members for Ebbw Vale (Mr. Foot), Stepney and Poplar, Birmingham, Sparkbrook (Mr. Hattersley), Manchester, Ardwick (Mr. Kaufman) or other hon. Members on the Opposition Front Bench wish to remain as nominal leaders of a Parliamentary Labour Party which fairly accurately reflected the current attitudes of recent Labour Party conferences is a matter for them to judge. I am glad to be out of their dilemma.<br/>
They are also committed to policies on import controls which must have extremely damaging effects not only on world trade and on our export markets but on the economies of Third world countries. They are committed to leaving the European Economic Community, which will cut off the market for a large part of our exports and destroy our farming industry, because at present Britain is 75 per cent. self-sufficient in food. The Labour Party's own research group concluded that if we are to avoid having crippling subsidies to our farming on leaving Europe&#x2014;</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Anglesey (Mr. Best) has made the point that I was hoping to make. If the Labour Party no longer considers itself to be a credible alternative Government, perhaps my points are irrelevant.<br/>
We must work on the assumption that the case presented by the official Opposition would be presented to the country and carried into effect if enough Labour Members of Parliament were elected. If the Labour Party were to take Britain out of the European Community it is acknowledged within its own discussion groups that it would be necessary to reduce the output of food from

British farms by a third. Instead of being 75 per cent. self-sufficient in food, Britain would then be 50 per cent. self-sufficient. That means that we would be competing in world markets in a hungry world for food that we could be producing ourselves.</p>

They are right. Under the Labour Party as it stands, and is likely to stand at the general election, revolution is the only way to keep out of the hands of the International Monetary Fund and another bout of deflation and unemployment.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Ince is trying to intervene, but my points are directly relevant to the alternative economic policy presented by the Labour Party. If that policy is not capable of being carried into effect without either running the country into enormous inflation and the effects Britain experienced in 1976 or the breakdown of parliamentary democracy, it is properly debatable in the House in the context of the economic policy that Britain is to pursue.<br/>

<p>With respect, Mr. Deputy Speaker, there are figures in the public expenditure White Paper for the overseas aid contribution that Britain makes to the rest of the world. That forms part of the Budget. The contribution that we can make to the finances of the Third world, and to trade within the Third world, is relevant to the state of the British economy.<br/>
As has been repeatedly pointed out, the state of the British economy cannot be isolated from the state of the world economy. In the interests of both Britain and world peace, it is important that the entire world economy should be stimulated. It is unlikely that we shall get such a stimulus either from the present Conservative Government, who have completely ignored the recommendations of Brandt, which are central to economic policy generally, or from the bulk of the Labour Party, which seeks to replace them.<br/>
There is a very much better way than that presented by either the Conservative Party or the Labour Party. As the hon. Member for Leek (Mr. Knox) said, we need a substantial expansion of the economy. I wish to see the bulk of that go on public expenditure in our social services,


particularly housing, construction, education, the restoration of our industrial infrastructure and the generation of new investment funds.<br/>
Incidentally, among more radical measures, I should like to see the use of the ideas promoted by the hon. Member for Surrey, North-West (Mr. Grylls). But these must be coupled with a policy to ensure that the additional funds released use assets that are presently being wasted&#x2014;the 3 million people unemployed, the empty factories and the disused quarries and brickworks. All those resources are going to waste as a consequence of the Government's deliberate action.<br/>
There is a desperate need for a vastly increased programme of public expenditure. Housing is only one example, and it is one on which I shall be happy to accept a challenge from Conservative Members. It is an issue on which the Secretary of State for the Environment has repeatedly refused to make any assessment of the extent of the need. Day after day in my constituency I see the extent to which the Government are failing to meet the housing needs of ordinary people.<br/>
Only the other day, I met a constituent who is a single parent with two children, one aged 2&#x00BD; and the other two weeks. All three share one bedroom, with no bathroom, no hot water, and an outside lavatory in a flat that is damp and smelling of mould. That constituent complained of slugs in both the lavatory and the kitchen. She has 32 points on the housing list, but requires 42 points to have any prospect of being rehoused. She will accumulate one point a year, and would have to wait ten years for the chance of rehousing were it not for the fact that the children are of opposite sex and that after a certain period there will be additional points for overcrowding.<br/>
It is an utter disgrace that a country such as ours, with relative wealth, should condemn people to such living conditions, with little prospect of their emerging from them. Such a problem is unlikely to be remedied as a result of the housing figures contained in the public expenditure White Paper, nor will this disgrace be alleviated by the changes announced in the Budget.<br/>
If one analyses the public expenditure White Paper and relates it to the figures issued by the Select Committee on the Environment as to likely housing output as a consequence of the figures published last year, and adjusts the figures to take account of the inflationary changes that have taken place, one will find that the probable output will be down rather than up.<br/>
Every hon. Member could add his own details to the catalogue of defects and deterioration in our public services. The Government and the Labour Party alike are crippling themselves from solving those problems. That is why the only hope lies in the Social Democratic and Liberal alliance.</p>

<p>I hope that the hon. Member for Mitcham and Morden (Mr. Douglas-Mann) will forgive me if I do not follow his mea culpa or if I refrain from joining in the fratricidal battle. We must be grateful for one thing. The hon. Gentleman does not appear to think himself capable of entering into the economic battle and argument that is likely to take place in his party and between the two parties of the alliance. After his contribution tonight, I look forward with renewed confidence to the by-election that will take place shortly in his constituency.<br/>
Yesterday we witnessed the first political Budget that my right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer has introduced. I welcome that. I do not criticise it. We were elected to exercise political judgments, not to take part in economic experiments. Sometimes I feel that we have forgotten that.<br/>
I notice from the national press today that my right hon. and learned Friend has succeeded in pleasing most of my hon. Friends. We can all pick out certain proposals in the Budget that give us great pleasure. I notice also that neither the wets nor the dries, in popular press parlance, are able to claim a great victory. There is not enough reflation for one group, and the other group has not fully realised that the medium-term financial strategy is destined for oblivion.<br/>
I welcome the Budget because of the broad way in which it has approached the problem. I shall pinpoint four detailed measures that I particularly welcome. The first is the continuation of 100 per cent. capital allowances for teletext television sets. That will be of help to the indigenous television manufacturing industry, particularly to Thorn, which is a major employer in my constituency.<br/>
Secondly, I welcome the increase in mobility allowance. We have a fine record in that area. I welcome the decision to make mobility allowance non-taxable for disabled people in work. That is the sort of incentive and help that we should give to these unfortunate people.<br/>
Thirdly, I welcome the changes in the North Sea oil taxation system. The House has probably underestimated the damage that the Government have done to the level of North Sea exploration and development as a direct result of their taxation policies. I shall look carefully at the detailed proposals to see whether the changes that have been announced give enough assistance to companies that are trying to develop marginal and satellite fields.<br/>
Finally, I welcome the closing of the tax avoidance loopholes that can arise through the leasing of various sorts of items. I declare my interest as a banker. I regret having to say that I believe that the major United Kingdom banks have seriously abused the leasing system over the past year. I can only comment in their defence&#x2014;if defence is needed&#x2014;that the decision of my right hon. and learned Friend to impose the windfall profits tax last year was unacceptable and un-conservative in its origins. However, I trust that my right hon. and learned Friend and the banks will come to a reasonable agreement about the level of taxation that banks should pay next year, because I recognise that they cannot go on making the profits that they have been making without making a higher contribution to the national Exchequer.<br/>
As welcome as those four measures are&#x2014;and there are others that I support&#x2014;they are insignificant when compared with the broader macroeconomic picture. As my right hon. and learned Friend made clear yesterday, Britain is unable to isolate herself from world economic forces. We must accept that. Our industries' output, productivity and so on are inextricably linked to the level of world trade. I feel strongly that the level of world trade will be influenced more by factors such as the level of oil prices than by any action that the Government might take. Equally, I feel that the level of interest rates in this country, despite all that has been said, will be influenced more by the level of world interest rates, particularly United States interest rates, than by any action that we may take internally on the PSBR or in any other way.<br/>
The day after the Budget it is perhaps all too easy to overestimate our ability to control our economic destiny. We must always remember that in this country we are completely at the mercy of world economic forces. We can only temper those forces. We cannot divert them in any way.<br/>
My right hon. and learned Friend's speech contained two major decisions. I beg to differ from the first, but I generally welcome the second. My right hon. and learned Friend would have been fully justified in aiming at a higher PSBR than the one that he chose. I should have gone for a figure between &#x00A3;10&#x00B7;5 billion and &#x00A3;11 billion. I say that in full knowledge that, if we compare this coming year's PSBR on a similar basis to last year's, the true level of the PSBR is more like &#x00A3;11 billion than &#x00A3;9&#x00B7;5 billion. That &#x00A3;1&#x00B7;5 billion difference arises, first, because of the &#x00A3;1 billion worth of taxes that should have been collected last year, but will go to reduce the PSBR next year, and, secondly, through what I believe to be a deliberate underestimate of the amount of money that the Government will receive from asset sales.<br/>
To a certain extent I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Leek (Mr. Knox). We cannot deny that we are suffering from a lack of demand in the economy. There are many successful firms in my constituency which have invested and have done everything that we say they should, but which are still operating at 70 to 80 per cent. of capacity. That is for one reason only&#x2014;a lack of demand.<br/>
An increase in the PSBR of a further &#x00A3;1 billion to &#x00A3;1&#x00BD; billion would help. That should have been done through a further reduction in the national insurance surcharge, through higher personal tax allowances and additional help to the construction industry. That &#x00A3;1 billion to &#x00A3;1&#x00BD; billion would have had a beneficial effect on the level of demand and output without leading directly to inflation. I noticed with interest this morning that Dr. Alan Budd, who is recognised by many as one of the leading advocates of monetarism, supported my broad line of argument and admitted that he would have liked a higher PSBR.<br/>
I make my argument with some reservation and concern, because I recognise that the economic growth that my right hon. and learned Friend predicts at 1&#x00BD; per cent. is, to say the least, fragile. It is based almost entirely on the assumption that there will be an end to destocking and an increase in restocking. The decision on stocking levels is taken by many business men at different levels throughout the economy. Their decision on whether to restock will depend crucially on the level of confidence. A slightly more expansionary budget would have increased confidence. However, I must admit that a higher PSBR might mean higher interest rates, which might increase the cost of carrying stocks and decrease confidence.<br/>
It is worth spending a little time on the argument about the inter-relationship between the PSBR and interest rates, because it is crucial. If all things were equal, clearly a higher PSBR must inevitably lead to higher interest rates, but there is only one certain thing in economics, and that is that all things are never equal for more than about a second at a time. So, to say the least, the correlation is not exact. The empirical evidence points out clearly that our interest rates are influenced far more by the level of world interest rates than by the level of the PSBR.<br/>
I recognise that this is a matter of fine judgment. There is no absolute right and there is no absolute wrong. The Chancellor has access to many more details and information than I have, and in the last analysis one has to bow to his judgment in this matter, although I state my preference clearly.<br/>
A second and more welcome decision that my right hon. and learned Friend took yesterday was much more important, and much more surprising. It can be expressed in seven letters, RIP MTFS&#x2014;rest in peace the medium-term financial strategy. It was given a courteous but rather brief funeral yesterday. There is no doubt that the funeral oration was lacking. We have to remember that it was my right hon. and learned Friend's sacred belief in the importance of controlling sterling M3 that led to many of the decisions on interest rates and exchange rates that gave us so much difficulty in the past couple of years.<br/>
It may have escaped the notice of the House that monetary policy was given less time in the Chancellor's speech yesterday than the section that he devoted to tax havens and company residence. He glossed over it and consigned it to the realms of technicality. It is worth quoting what he said:
<q>I propose next to describe to the House how monetary policy will operate in the year ahead. I shall, nevertheless, do so as briefly as I can. The technically-minded will find ample solace in the lapidary prose of the Red Book."&#x2014;[<i>Official Report</i>, 9 March 1982; Vol. 19, c. 732.]</q>
That is rather extraordinary when we remember that this time last year monetary policy was the cornerstone of the Government's economic policy.</p>

<q>The target for 1982&#x2013;83 implies a significant reduction in recent rates of growth of the wide aggregates. It has been set above the illustrative range for &#x00A3;M3 shown last year"&#x2014;</q>
because they could not reach it&#x2014;
<q>to reflect the changes to savings behaviour and the institutional developments discussed above. The ranges for 1983&#x2013;84 and 1984&#x2013;85 will be reconsidered nearer the time.</q>
In other words, this is now a moveable feast and the Government will decide what measures they want, when they want them and when it happens to suit them. I do not regret that, but it is a significant change.<br/>
Later on, in paragraph 2.16 the Red Book says:
<q>Interpretation of monetary conditions will continue to take account of all the available evidence, including the behaviour of the exchange rate.</q>
In other words, we have seen in the Chancellor's speech&#x2014;and this has not been adequately picked out by the press this morning&#x2014;a dramatic and significant change of policy.</p>

<p>I welcome that change, in answer to the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton), because sterling M3 is regulated in importance, pragmatism has won the day and yesterday we saw the triumph of experience over expectation.<br/>
The control of the monetary aggregate is no more important than it ever should have been. It is a necessary but not a sufficient tool of economic management. I recognise, as do many hon. Members on both sides of the House, that a modern economy cannot be run without using both monetary and fiscal measures. They have to go together. To put one up as of overriding importance, as we did with sterling M3, is a mistake and I welcome that this has been admitted.<br/>
Despite everything that has been said in the Budget, and everything that I have said, the most pressing problem that our country faces is that of the level of unemployment. Some of the measures announced yesterday, when combined with the new training initiatives, will help. They put the lie to the accusation from Labour Members that we do not care about unemployment. We have done more for the unemployed than they ever did. We should be happy and proud to admit that.<br/>
Having said that, we should not rest on our achievements. We should constantly be looking for new ways to help. Above all, we must not deceive people into thinking that there is any real hope of a significant reduction in unemployment over the next 18 months. Whatever the economic policies put forward by either the Labour Party or the Conservative Party, if any of us pretend that we can, from this place, significantly reduce unemployment in the short term, we are exercising a cruel and vicious deception on the British people.<br/>
Nothing that the right hon. Member for Stepney and Poplar (Mr. Shore) says can surprise me. There are no depths to which he is not prepared to sink. But I find it surprising when I listen to the arguments from the other Opposition parties, particularly the SDP, that there are those who find the economic policies suggested by the right hon. Member for Crosby (Mrs. Williams) rather beguiling. She is absolutely economically illiterate. Anyone who can claim that she can create 1 million more jobs in two years for an extra expenditure of &#x00A3;5 billion a year is more of a magician than an economist. I cannot believe that the British people will be foolish enough to fall for that line.<br/>
I am sorry that the hon. Member for Gateshead, West (Mr. Horam) is not here, because I feel rather sorry for him. He has tried valiantly to put forward a coherent economic policy on behalf of his party and he has been bounced, for that is the word, by the populism and the economic illiteracy of the right hon. Member for Crosby.<br/>
I suspect that in a few weeks, or even months, the Budget will have disappointed the hopes of some of its most vocal supporters. I suspect that it may improve output marginally and have some impact on slowing down the growth in unemployment, but the fundamentals will not have changed. That is not because of the content of the Budget. They would not be any different, whatever the economic policies in the Budget. The fundamentals will not have changed because the lessons of the last 20 years are clear. Government economic policies can do very little in the short to medium term to achieve those ultimate aims that we so much want&#x2014;full employment and higher output. Those must be our aims. We should not deceive ourselves that the Government can really influence them.</p>

<p>The acceptance and almost delight of the hon. Member for Enfield, North (Mr. Eggar) in seeing the medium-term

economic strategy of the Government deserted is remarkable considering that he has never voted as far as I am aware against a previous Budget presented by his right hon. and learned Friend. I do not see why he welcomes it so grandly when he might have shown his opposition in the past by voting in the Lobbies against the monetarist policies that he now condemns. The hon. Gentleman told the hon. Member for Mitcham and Morden (Mr. Douglas-Mann) that he was awaiting with some delight the by-election in that constituency. I should like to say that following the result of the by-election in Glasgow, Hillhead on 23 March it is unlikely that there will be a by-election in Mitcham and Morden.</p>

<p>I am glad to have that assurance. I am glad to know that within a short period the hon. Gentleman will not be representing that constituency.<br/>
What we have heard today of the Social Democratic Party's economic policies shows that it attacks the Government for their policies and attacks the Labour Party and the proposal of my right hon. Friend the Member for Stepney and Poplar (Mr. Shore) as a mish-mash of all the things that the hon. Gentleman believes to be wrong with the Labour Party. I have heard nothing of SDP plans if it came to power except a cobbling together of different parts of machines to be put together into one machine to be driven down the middle of the road. The best way to start an accident is to drive an unsafe car cobbled together from different machines down the middle of the road. It is a recipe for disaster. That is what the SDP is all about.<br/>
Those hon. Members who represent Scottish constituencies perhaps felt some warmth from the Budget speech because there can be few Budgets this century in which so many references have been made to Scotland. I do not know whether most hon. Members noticed these references. Those hon. Members representing Scottish constituencies certainly did. Every so often, when the Chancellor was talking about Britain, there would appear references to Scotland and to Glasgow. Apart from the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker) and myself there are probably no Members present in the House who read the <i>Glasgow Herald.</i> It has a headline today saying "The Hillhead Budget". It has a cartoon with the Chancellor of the Exchequer holding a bottle of whisky on which it says "Old Tory Vote Catcher&#x2014;Scotch whisky".<br/>
If, however, vote catching was the intention of the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Government, I have to say that the by-election is either too late or too early. If the by-election was tomorrow the smokescreen put up by the Chancellor in the Budget might have been just sufficient to allow the Conservative candidate in Hillhead to win. In a fortnight's time, when the smokescreen has cleared, most people will be able to make a proper assessment of what the Budget means to them and to the voters in Hillhead.<br/>
By that time they will also be paying more for their cigarettes, for their petrol and for their whisky. The increase may not have been as big in percentage terms as


that on claret, but people buying a bottle of whisky are not concerned whether the increase is 20p, 30p or 50p. They are concerned that it is an increase and that this week they are paying more than they paid last week. This is what matters to them. The small tax benefits that they may receive from the Budget will not appear in their pockets by the time that the by-election takes place. The Chancellor has badly misjudged matters if he thinks he can win the by-election with this Budget.<br/>
Far too many people in Glasgow are unemployed. In my constituency, unemployment among those living in the Castlemilk housing scheme amounts to 25 per cent. of the total population. In certain areas of the housing scheme, the figure is over 50 per cent. Anyone who knows Glasgow will be aware that most Glaswegians like a smoke. I am a recent convert against smoking. I succeeded eight weeks ago in stopping smoking. For the first time ever, I am therefore not adverse personally to the Chancellor putting up the price of cigarettes.</p>

<p>That is right. I took my hon. Friend's advice. However, many of my constituents and many constituents in Hillhead, especially those who are unemployed, enjoy a packet of cigarettes.

<p>Will my hon. Friend accept that the Budget is an interesting demonstration of the Government's view of market forces? They always purport to support market forces and want them to have more play.

<p>Yes. Anyone who listened to the Chancellor's speech will know that this is exactly what the right hon. and learned Gentleman said. My hon. Friend is right. His view is that 9p on a gallon of petrol makes no difference because it has come down by that amount in the last few weeks anyway. However, many people had come to like the lower price. It was having an effect on the cost of living, so the Chancellor has put the price back up.<br/>
The Chancellor's excuse for putting up Excise duties was that they would be kept in line with the rise in the cost of living. That is not what he says to public sector workers. They cannot have an increase in their earnings to keep pace with the cost of living. They are kept to 4 per cent.</p>

<p>Yes. I did not catch that point as fully as my hon. Friend. He has a copy of the Chancellor's speech. It makes nonsense of what the hon. Member for Enfield, North said about increasing demand. There is an

anomaly in terms of increasing Excise duties in line with the cost of living while not being prepared to take the same attitude to people's incomes.<br/>
The Government have made great play of the importance of the construction industry in Scotland, which is linked to housing. Both the Chief Secretary and the Chancellor have made great play with what they are doing for the construction industry. Somehow or other, the Budget is supposed to be a big deal, which will create jobs in that industry and solve the housing problem. I shall examine that first in the light of what the Treasury said in its statement.<br/>
The beginning of that statement says:
<q>In his Budget Statement, the Chancellor announced measures aimed particularly at helping the construction industry. Last year's Budget included similar measures.</q>
I do not know whether anyone in the construction industry would say that he has seen the impact of last year's similar measures. I do not believe that the construction industry in Glasgow or Western Scotland would think that it had benefited from those measures. One must ask, therefore, if the new measures are similar to those introduced last year, whether they will have any more impact.<br/>
The Government's White Paper on expenditure plans for Scotland says that between 1982&#x2013;83&#x2014;they are now talking in cash terms; they no longer take account of inflation&#x2014;capital expenditure on housing in Scotland will be &#x00A3;167 million. The figure for last year was &#x00A3;180 million. That is a reduction of &#x00A3;13 million. Is that &#x00A3;13 million reduction arrived at after taking account, as it must, of the &#x00A3;10 million? I am making a rough estimate&#x2014;&#x00A3;100 million for the Government's energy and renovation proposals, and estimating &#x00A3;100 million for the United Kingdom. Roughly 10 per cent. is allocated to Scotland and that becomes &#x00A3;10 million. If my calculations are correct and if Scotland does not receive that sum, capital expenditure on public sector housing in Scotland will be reduced by &#x00A3;23 million.<br/>
Under the scheme set out by the Chancellor for expenditure on improvements in housing, applications had to be received by the end of 1982 to gain any benefit, presumably so that expenditure could be taken up by the end of the coming financial year. Does that mean that next year there will be the same reduction in capital expenditure in Scotland and that it will be &#x00A3;23 million or more, rather than &#x00A3;13 million as it is this year?<br/>
If there is to be a net loss in capital expenditure on housing in Scotland of &#x00A3;13 million, Glasgow's share would be reduced by about &#x00A3;3 million or &#x00A3;4 million or more. That must be added to the &#x00A3;13 million reduction on current expenditure on housing. If those figures are correct, there will be no boost for the construction industry in Scotland or the United Kingdom. Instead of extra money being given, so that more work has to be taken into account and more workers will come off the unemployment register, the proposals will prevent a few people from going on the unemployment register. We shall stop people going on the register, rather than bring them off it. More construction workers will go on the dole if &#x00A3;13 million less than this year is spent on housing in Scotland next year.<br/>
Will the Minister confirm that that will be the effect? The housing situation in Glasgow is desperate. We have a chronic housing need. Many people are living in damp houses. There is a long-term dampness problem. Constituents have come to my surgery week in and week out for the past month. Five weeks after the freeze they


still have no water and are still not back in their own homes because ceilings have not been repaired. The enormous damage done during the severe frost has not been repaired. Those people are living in misery. Also, a gale in Scotland, rising to a force of 105 miles per hour, caused further damage to housing.<br/>
Those are short-term problems. If housing authorities in Scotland, especially in Glasgow, must find extra money to pay for that damage out of their own expenditure, any extra money that they receive from the Government will be completely absorbed in carrying out those short-term repairs. No new building will take place. It is extremely unlikely that the long-term problems will be solved.<br/>
Conservative Members constantly mention improvements in the Health Service. They make great play about how we have more, presumably qualified, nurses and doctors in the Health Service than ever before. That means, they argue, that there are shorter waiting lists. That is true, but it takes at least three years to train a nurse and five or six years to train a doctor. Therefore, the new qualified nurses and doctors that have come into the Health Service during the past 18 months to two years started their training under the Labour Government, not the present Government. It is hypocritical for the Government to claim the credit for those extra nurses and doctors when they were recruited under the Labour Government.</p>

<p>Surely the hon. Gentleman will admit that the present Government have provided money to employ those nurses. Surely he will admit also that waiting lists have been reduced during the present Government's term of office. Although I might accept that training was started during the Labour Government, it is unfair and ungenerous to complain that the Government have reduced the level of the Health Service.</p>

<p>For a start, some nurses cannot find a job. The Government have not employed all the nurses that the Labour Government intended should be employed. Of course, if there are more doctors and nurses the waiting lists will be reduced, but the waiting lists have been re-written a little so we must be wary of the figures.<br/>
I do not believe that the Government have changed their major strategy. Examining the public expenditure White Paper from a Scottish point of view, one sees that the basic theme of the Government's economic policy is that somehow public expenditure must be cut and money put back into the pockets of those who are likely to invest it in industry to solve all our economic problems. That seems to be the main strand of the Government's economic policy, but it will not solve our economic problems.<br/>
Under the Budget, those who make large capital gains will benefit again. There is not much mention of that in the press. Again, it is the rich who benefit from capital transfer tax rather than, as the Government claim, those at the bottom end of the scale. In cash terms, the real benefit is going to the top end. The Government have consistently done that since they came to power. They have given to their rich friends and taken from the poor on the principle that their friends will then pour extra money into the British economy by investing it and the economy will improve as a result.<br/>
That is absolute nonsense. It has not worked. There has been no increase in investment&#x2014;it is falling. The Government have given money away to the rich and there has been no benefit or return for the economy. Their

friends have benefited but the economy has not. The more public expenditure is cut, the more private industry is damaged. I wish that the Government would learn that lesson.<br/>
I should have thought that in the construction industry, if nowhere else, that lesson should have been learned. How many building companies have gone out of business as a result of the cuts in housing expenditure of the past three years? The answer must be many thousands. Nowadays, even big companies rely increasingly upon Government expenditure and Government contracts to survive. Some are Government contracts from abroad, but it is still public expenditure, whether it is our own or someone else's. The lesson must be learned that nowadays one cannot divorce public and private expenditure as the Government would like because they depend upon each other. If anything, private expenditure depends more upon the public purse for survival than the other way round. The Budget shows that the Government have failed to learn that lesson, and it is time that they went, so that my right hon. Friend the Member for Stepney and Poplar may become Chancellor of the Exchequer and begin to solve our economic problems.</p>

<p>I am grateful for the opportunity to make what I hope will a brief contribution to the debate.<br/>
First, I should say that, in the round, I very much appreciate and applaud the Budget. I believe that it was last year's much-reviled Budget that made this one possible. My right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor has begun to create a proper basis upon which we can build.<br/>
There are those who ask the very important question, which the Government seem to find difficult to answer: are people earning &#x00A3;15,000 a year or less better or worse off as a result of the Budget? I believe that indexing levels of income and tax puts people exactly where they were a year ago. It would be illusory to pretend that they will be better off. Nevertheless, I believe that in the main the people of this country will be substantially better off, provided that our industries manage to become more productive, which in turn will lead to increased prosperity and further job security for employees. I believe that my right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor has created a climate in which this will be possible.<br/>
I applaud the comment of my hon. Friend the Member for Enfield, North (Mr. Eggar) that it would be a cruel deception to pretend that the Government can somehow reduce unemployment. I believe that we shall go into the next general election with at least 2&#x00BE; million or 3 million unemployed, because we are going through an industrial revolution. I do not know whether we are perhaps too close to events to realise what is happening, but I firmly believe that we are going through an industrial revolution, and no Government of any complexion can do very much about that.<br/>
Over the past 15 years, with predictable steps, unemployment has risen. To pretend to our constituents and to the electorate that somehow we can wave a magic wand and solve the problem simply by feeling more compassionate and caring more is the most illusory primrose path down which we can march and it serves our constituents ill. I also believe that our constituents are well aware of that. Politicians have often patronised the


electorate, believing it to be more stupid than it is. I believe that our constituents understand the truth when they hear it, and telling them that we can wave a wand and reduce unemployment will be of no help at all to them.<br/>
Many of those who, tragically, are unemployed have been so for many years&#x2014;hidden within our overmanned industries&#x2014;and it has taken a world recession, which no Government can possibly buck, to make that clear. There is no way in which we can isolate Britain or its unemployment problems just because we care more, when the problems are similar in Australia and New Zealand, on the Continent and in America. We cannot wave a magic wand and reduce unemployment overnight.<br/>
I commend to the House an idea put to me by my hon. Friend the Member for Peterborough (Dr. Mawhinney), which I know some of my colleagues have also taken up. My hon. Friend took this step to try to reduce unemployment in his constituency and I have copied it in mine. It is the creation of a small, local enterprise area. I asked the National Westminster Bank whether it would be prepared to lend money to people with good business ideas&#x2014;several of them unemployed as the unemployed should not be precluded from such a scheme&#x2014;unsecured, but for charges over the assets of the small businesses thus created. I then asked a firm of lawyers and accountants whether they would give free advice for one year to people wishing to start such businesses. I also asked my local chamber of commerce whether it was prepared to give free advice, and the local college of further education whether it would provide a free administrative course. The package was wrapped up and called "Enterprise Abingdon and Didcot 1982", and I am pleased to say that it worked well.<br/>
My theory was that many people with excellent ideas are frightened of going to banks. They do not understand how to put a package together. They do not know whether they should form a limited company, trade as sole traders or form a partnership. They do not know what the building requirements or local authority restrictions on starting a new workshop might be. They need a great deal of help. In Abingdon we had 42 replies, many of which are still being processed by people who put civic duties before profits, and in Didcot last week I had the privilege of handing over the first cheque, for &#x00A3;3,000, to Mr. Ivan Gibbs to start a model aeroplane shop in the High Street. I take this opportunity to wish him very well.<br/>
My knowledge of economics is very thin, but when I heard the speech of the right hon. Member for Ebbw Vale (Mr. Foot) yesterday my confidence in my skills as an economist were enhanced. I find the Opposition's approach singularly depressing and arid, when the Chancellor has produced a Budget which, in the main, has met with balanced criticism from many commentators, but is regarded overall as good.</p>

<p>The operation began last month, and out of the 42 inquiries many are still being processed. Until last week, Mr. Ivan Gibbs was unemployed. This is the first job that he has had in more than two years, so that is

one job that I have created in my constituency. I shall be happy to give way if the right hon. Gentleman wishes to tell me how many jobs he has created in his constituency.<br/>
When I hear the speeches of the Opposition, my courage and confidence in my own economic performance is enhanced. I find it depressing when charges are made against the Government which are patently and simply not true. The idea put forward is that if we pump &#x00A3;9 billion into the economy&#x2014;or &#x00A3;8 billion or &#x00A3;7 billion&#x2014;that will create more jobs. I ask people who think that that is possible whether they have considered that investment in plant can lead to less employment, because new plant often means fewer jobs.<br/>
I have never heard an argument which would convince me that if &#x00A3;6 billion were poured into the economy it would necessarily go into new jobs. I believe that Sir Terence Beckett is a superior economist to the right hon. Member for Ebbw Vale and that he is right when he says that as our businesses have been reduced in capacity because of the world recession&#x2014;the economic holocaust that has hit us during the past two and half years&#x2014;if extra money were put into the economy much of it would probably go into imports and rising prices, as has happened in the past. Therefore, I have yet to be convinced that we could do what has been suggested without its leading to further high levels of inflation.<br/>
Our complex social security and tax systems have been built piecemeal and are now in serious disarray. I commend to the House an excellent article written by the hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) on 5 March 1982, in which he said that
<q>the Chancellor will make little mention of the hundred or so tax reliefs&#x2014;or tax benefits, to describe them more accurately&#x2014;which exempt more than 50 per cent. of the nation's personal income from tax.</q>
<q>Here is an issue on which MPs across the parties should be able to find some agreement. A radical reform of all the tax benefits offers the chance to increase personal freedom. Tax benefits are granted only if taxpayers spend their money in a way which the Government thinks is desirable. Reform offers the chance of cutting the rates of tax&#x2014;so increasing the taxpayer's freedom of choice&#x2014;while increasing expenditure on social security benefits.</q>
<q>Means-tested benefits build a ceiling over the heads of the poor, thereby cementing them into poverty. Others, like child benefit, act as a floor on which people can build by their own efforts without being penalised. Additional expenditure here allows claimants to spring themselves from poverty. The individual and collective gains on the freedom front should be clear to most taxpayers.</q>
I agree with that article without any exception. I hope that the Chancellor and his team will be able to make some strides and try to unpick some of the enormous complications from both our tax and social security system. Only in that way will we get a more sensible system. Lower levels of tax are still too high, and that is one way which will enable us to reduce them.<br/>
The complexities of the social security and the tax systems confound experts. Most of our supporters and the well over 1 million small business owners know that the State is still alive and well, still on their backs and in their pockets. We were expected to simplify both those systems and to make tax cuts, which we have not done.<br/>
Can we do it? Are we powerless to act? Is the enormous system that we have created so vast that we simply cannot change it? Are we too close to the current systems to see how absurd they are? Is the machinery of government so


vast that we cannot make the necessary changes, or have we been "Yes Ministered" out of the intentions that we had before we came into power?<br/>
The tax and the social security systems infuriate our supporters, because it is there that the machinery of officialdom is at its most potent. At the moment the scheme is a hotch-potch of anomalies, expensive to run, complex, ambiguous, and regarded with trepidation and hostility by the taxpayer and those on social security benefits. In its application it operates a series of traps to catch the wary and the unwary alike.<br/>
I commend the Chancellor for the simplifications that he announced yesterday in the capital gains tax legislation by starting to abolish that tax. I quote from a book entitled "The British Tax System", second edition, at page 239:
<q>There is a maze of taxes on different kinds of income, each tax with its own rules for determining taxable income and liability. The interaction between these taxes is difficult to comprehend, and, because of this, is rarely brought out into the open when tax changes are discussed. To take one obvious example of the general problem, in addition to income tax there are distinct and separately administered surcharges on each of employment incomes, investment incomes, and income from self-employment. The first of these is levied non-cumulatively on current earnings of less than a stated amount, the second cumulatively on current earnings of more than a stated amount, and the third cumulatively on preceding year earnings in excess of one amount and less that another amount.</q>
Nobody could possibly design such a system on purpose, and nobody did. Only a historical explanation of how it came about can be offered as justification. However, that is not a justification, but a demonstration of how seemingly individually rational decisions can have absurd effects in aggregate. One hopes that the Chancellor will make it an urgent priority to start cutting away some of the thickets which confound many people in Britain, who simply do not understand.<br/>
At the other end of the scale, many needy families who rely on benefits do not claim, either because they are too proud or because they do not know their rights. To police this complex system is very difficult and expensive. Many benefits go into the pockets of people who do not need them, but, far more commonly, many needy families do not get the benefits that they need.<br/>
I was distressed yesterday by the fact that the Chancellor did not see his way forward to put right the invalidity trap. There are many invalidity pensioners whose incomes are too high for them to qualify for the ordinary rate of supplementary benefit but whose incomes fall below the amount they would receive if they were eligible for the long-term rate of supplementary benefit. As they do not qualify for the former, they can never qualify for the latter. Even though their situation is one of long-term sickness and disability, they are condemned to try to subsist on benefit rates which are below the minimum long-term rate of supplementary benefit set by the Government.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman has picked on two areas in the Budget. One is capital transfer tax and the other is the specific area of benefits for those who do not have many assets. May I remind the hon. Gentleman that the Chancellor, while not doing what the hon. Gentleman is now demanding, has allocated almost &#x00A3;170 million additional money to cover capital transfer tax and capital gains tax concessions to the better-off in society? In the light of what the hon. Gentleman was saying, does he think that the Chancellor has the balance right?</p>

<p>I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for raising that point. I am all for simplifying the tax system. That must be done. I am distressed by the fact that the Chancellor did not put right the anomaly to which I referred, although, as I said earlier, I believe that he has done a considerable amount for the worse-off, but I do not think that the Chancellor got the balance right in regard to the invalidity trap.<br/>
About 100,000 invalidity pensioners are caught in the trap, and because they happen to be on particular rates of invalidity benefit they can never get on to the high rate of supplementary benefit, which is one of the passport benefits enabling people to get free transport and other forms of assistance which cannot be obtained by people on invalidity benefit. As the costs involved are about &#x00A3;50 million, one hoped that the Chancellor would have felt able to bring it within his orbit and make the necessary concession. I hope that he will see fit to do so as soon as he possibly can.<br/>
I believe that the entire crazy system of tax rates and benefits must be changed. We must continue what we had started to do. If we do not do it, who will? If we do not do it now, when shall we do it? The system is complex, unfair, expensive, disliked and misunderstood. I hope that the Chancellor will feel able to do what is necessary at the earliest possible time. It will take a long time to put the system right. I am not saying that it can be done overnight, but, unless we are looking at the problem and facing in the right direction with a plan, it will take 10 years to put it right. If we do not make a start soon, we shall never get there.</p>

<p>Having sat through most of the debate, I want first to apologise to you. Mr. Deputy Speaker, because&#x2014;uncharacteristically for me&#x2014;I was forced to intervene a couple of times and I probably taxed your patience. As some people might say, I took advice. My objection about the broad nature of this debate on the Budget&#x2014;I think it was shared by one or two Conservative Members&#x2014;was to some of the comments made by the hon. Member for Mitcham and Morden (Mr. Douglas-Mann). I shall take up the remarks of the hon. Member for Abingdon (Mr. Benyon) because this is a debating Chamber, although we sometimes tend to forget that. He appeared to suggest, when the Opposition and some of his hon. Friends questioned whether the Government had done enough to tackle unemployment, that there is not a great deal that the Government can do to reduce the 3 million unemployed.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman quoted figures and I know that they were a riposte to the right hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham (Sir I. Gilmour), a former Cabinet Minister and Lord Privy Seal, who is identified as leading the "wets". The hon. Gentleman said that if &#x00A3;5 billion&#x2014;the amount suggested by the right hon. Gentleman&#x2014;will reduce unemployment by a certain amount, why not pump in &#x00A3;10 billion or even &#x00A3;15 billion? The hon. Gentleman appeared to pour scorn on anyone who advocates positive action by the Government.<br/>
What will the Government do if unemployment doubles? Will they then say that if there is nothing they can do when 3 million are unemployed there is nothing they can do when 6 million are unemployed? It would be electoral suicide to do nothing to reduce unemployment if it reached such a level. The main thrust of the Budget


should have been substantially to reduce unemployment. For that reason alone the Budget is a failure. It is not addressed to the main problem facing the country of more than 3 million unemployed&#x2014;a figure which is likely to grow.</p>

<p>I was right to give way to the hon. Gentleman. It was fair to give him the opportunity to make that correction. I did not make it clear that my remarks were directed to the hon. Member for Abingdon who questioned whether &#x00A3;X billion would do the job.<br/>
I intend to be brief. Some hon. Members took a long time to say relatively little. I hope that that accusation will not be hurled at me. I recognise that others want to speak.<br/>
The main thrust of the Budget should have been directed towards tackling the cancer of unemployment, which is eating away the heart of the nation, and is frightening people. At one time unemployment was considered to be a visitation on what I call my class of people&#x2014;the unskilled and labouring class. It is now affecting all classes, including the professions. The tragedy is that fear is stalking the land. Those with high qualifications and highly skilled people are terrified of losing their jobs. Confidence has gone. It was the duty of the Government in the Budget to find a way to restore that confidence, but they did not do so.<br/>
I do not believe in the class warfare theory. We devalue politics, perhaps more on our side, by introducing arguments about classes. However, the Budget can be fairly described as a middle-class Budget. If it benefits any group it will benefit the higher paid. It ought to have benefited the poor.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) gave details of the unemployment in his constituency and said that it ws 25 per cent. in one part. The tragedy of our present plight is that many of us can match those figures and some of us can beat them. Hon. Members who have been here for a few years will remember that Skelmersdale new town suffered some bad blows when the Labour Government were in power. We lost jobs galore, including about 3,500 in only a few months. The best guess that one can make of our male

unemployment rate is that it must be about 35 per cent. We cannot get the exact figures. The percentage is diluted because we are linked with a neighbouring town with a lower unemployment rate. Of course, it would not make the unemployed feel any better if we had the exact percentage rate, but we guess that it is in excess of the terrible figures given by my hon. Friend the Member for Cathcart.<br/>
I do not believe that the public were much concerned about whether 4p or 5p was put o the price of a pint of beer. Of course they grumbled, and no politician would say that it does not matter how much tax is put on cigarettes, beer, whisky or petrol, but if people had seen that the revenue drawn from them in that way was to be used to reduce unemployment substantially they would have said that at least it would be well spent. That has not happened and, for that reason alone, the Government stand condemned.<br/>
I do not say that Tory Governments welcome unemployment. No one likes taking actions that are electorally unpopular, but I believe that because Tory Governments have a fixation about increased public expenditure, which would be one of the quickest ways of reducing unemployment, they sometimes cannot see the wood for the trees and they make fundamental errors.<br/>
In the North-West, the birthplace of the industrial revolution, we have an old industrial system and an overwhelming need for public investment. That would profit the nation. There would be no question of paying one to dig holes and another to fill them in. Imaginative investment in public works would quickly and substantially reduce the terrible level of unemployment.<br/>
My hon. Friends and I meet Tory Members as friends and colleagues and no one claims that they deliberately want to put people on the dole. However, although they may not be indifferent or callous, their fixation about public investment stops them implementing the remedies that they know are needed.<br/>
If unemployment rose and the cancer got even worse, would Treasury Ministers say that because there was nothing that they could do when the jobless total stood at 3 million there was nothing that they could do when faced with levels of 5 million or 6 million? They would not remain indifferent. Why, then, do they do little more than tinker with the problem when unemployment stands at 3 million? The Government are behaving as the equivalent of the captain of the "Titanic" rearranging the deck furniture while the ship is taking on water after hitting the iceberg. They have not addressed themselves to the real problem but are simply tinkering with it.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend makes an interesting point. Is there not evidence to suggest that the whole free market machine cannot fund the social wage and that what we used to argue in the Labour Party 10 or 20 years ago must change to comply with the new reality? What we were saying philosophically and ideologically is now becoming practical, and increasing numbers of British people, even those who do not vote for the Labour Party, recognise that the system cannot provide for the social requirements of the people. That is perhaps our biggest weapon.</p>

<p>If my hon. Friend the Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours), by that intellectual intervention, means that we cannot have unbridled capitalism and that we must tune finely a mixed economy to bring about that happy result, I agree with him.<br/>
If one is honest, one admits that even in this Budget there are welcome proposals. I especially welcome the modest increase in the cut-off figure for supplementary benefit to &#x00A3;2,500. However, it must be considered carefully, because we have found that even at that figure the measure will create unnecessary hardship and will rob some people who have been given a reasonable amount of redundancy pay and who have lost their job prospects for life. The proposal is not a panacea but a start. I hope that the Government will work on it.<br/>
I hoped that the Government would do something about the death grant. I believe that they have offered to do so. It is now a mockery and it must be increased substantially. I take on board the fact that the Labour Party had the chance to increase it, but we did not and we stand to be condemned for that. However, I remember that when Conservative Members were in Opposition they used to attack us for such matters as not increasing the death benefit.<br/>
I especially welcome the decision on the mobility allowance, which was long overdue. The 40,000 people who benefit from it will also be grateful.<br/>
A point in the tax system that has never been given sufficient consideration is the age allowance. I address that remark to the Financial Secretary to the Treasury, who is sitting on the Treasury Bench. The age allowance has a long history. Contrary to what many people believe, it does not expressly help retirement pensioners. One does not need to be a retirement pensioner to benefit from it. From answers that I have received to questions that I have put down, the age allowance seems to cost Britain about &#x00A3;400 million a year net. I suggest that there are better ways in which one can use that money.<br/>
For example, if I am not fully retired at the age of 65, my personal allowances will be increased per se simply because I am in that age bracket and in a certain income band, even if my wife is many years younger. There are better ways of helping people in that group. If it is designed to help pensioners&#x2014;which it is not&#x2014;one could probably increase the retirement pension by about &#x00A3;2 a week for a married couple and about &#x00A3;1&#x00B7;20 for a single person. There are other ways of using that money, but I shall not take any more of the House's time in suggesting them. I merely say that the allowance should be looked at to see whether it is relevant and necessary in today's circumstances. I hope that the Government will provide the answers.<br/>
This Budget does not even pretend to deal with the serious problem of unemployment and the poverty that springs from it. However, no doubt it will receive the approval of the Conservative Party. I hope that the people will soon be given a chance to pass judgment, not only on this Budget but on all the other Budgets that have been introduced by the Conservative Party during its three calamitous years of office.</p>

<p>The House will be grateful to the hon. Member for Ince (Mr. McGuire), because, although he was critical of the Government, he advanced his arguments in a fair manner and complimented certain aspects of the Budget with which he agreed. Sadly, that cannot be said of all his right hon. and hon. Friends. We are therefore all grateful to him for the manner in which he approached this debate.<br/>
This is a cautious Budget, and I suspect that its effects will be cautious, too. As my right hon. and learned Friend said yesterday, it is part of a step in a long-term approach and one that will involve more than one Parliament. In this House we tend to concentrate on immediate issues arid seek solutions to those issues in the short term, without contemplating any matter beyond the next election. This is the first Government in my memory to look beyond the next election. They decided that the problems affecting our economy need a longer-term solution than has been sought by previous Governments.<br/>
I did not have the privilege of knowing the late Lord Butler when he was a Member of the House, but his political philosophy has shaped the way in which I think about politics. When I was beginning to show an interest in politics, Butskellism became part of the political vocabulary of this country. Of course, the situation then was quite different&#x2014;something that is conveniently forgotten by some hon. Members who criticise the Government for what they are doing today. At that time we had an expanding economy and we were building 300,000 houses a year. The situation was thus quite different from that which exists under this Government&#x2014;or, indeed, which existed under the Labour Government&#x2014;as a result of external factors.<br/>
Sadly, Butskellism is a dead concept. Many of us would like a greater convergence of policies on major issues between the two major parties, but, unfortunately that is not possible today because of the way that the Labour Party has veered to the Left. When the right hon. Member for Stepney and Poplar (Mr. Shore) delivers his catechism of what he might do, one realises that he would probably not be admitted as a member of the party of Gaitskell. That shows the way in which politics have polarised in this country.<br/>
The Government are on extremely dangerous ground. My right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor can be certain that, unfortunately, even the more sensible aspects of his Budget will not receive universal support from the Labour Party, as might have happened 25 years ago.<br/>
Even though Butskellism may be dead, I hope that the ideals of the late Lord Butler are not dead. I should like to examine whether this Budget will enhance those ideals. I ask myself what is needed in a Budget. The Budget should deal with unemployment. Those hon. Members who watch Brian Walden's programme will realise that if the Government are to be re-elected and put their policies into effect in the long term, they must capture the 19 per cent. target vote, 45 per cent. of whom believe that unemployment is the greatest problem confronting, us. In my constituency the rate of male unemployment is approaching 25 per cent.<br/>
There is also a need to ensure that those least able to look after themselves as a result of the recession are not made to suffer because of the recession. I investigate in my brief remarks whether the Budget has achieved that. First, I ask about unemployment. The whole House will want to know where the growth is to come from in the period of recession that we are experiencing.<br/>
It will not come in the older manufacturing industries. That is why I was glad that there was no more than a 1 per cent. reduction in the national insurance surcharge. There had to be some reduction, because this was a matter on which industry had concentrated. It had become a talisman for industry, so it was right to propose a reduction of 1 per


cent., but no more, because it will benefit only older manufacturing industries. Indeed, one-third will go to the public sector, which has almost the worst record.<br/>
In Anglesey and in most other parts of the country we need a stimulus for small businesses. I know that my hon. Friend the Member for Luton, East (Mr. Bright) will concentrate upon this. His record in this respect is particularly fine. We need more small workshops, and small business men need more access to loan capital. Without specifying or reiterating what is in the Budget, I believe that it will lead to an improvement in these areas. Perhaps it is not doing as much as some people would like, but, nevertheless, it is making a substantial contribution.<br/>
The Manpower Services Commission, along with other bodies, reckons that the number of long-term unemployed is in excess of 1 million. Obviously that problem needs to be tackled quickly. I am glad that a scheme is to be worked out by the Manpower Services Commission to bring the long-term unemployed into doing useful community work.<br/>
One of the greatest problems of unemployment is the absence of pride that it can create. There is the feeling of being superfluous to the society in which one lives and therefore a meaningless contributor to that society. This scheme should help to overcome that. Of course, it is not creating real jobs. I sometimes wonder what the rhetoric is about real or unreal jobs. It is necessary to involve people in doing something for the community so that they can feel part of it.<br/>
The young workers' scheme has been criticised but Labour Members should acknowledge that there has been a heavy initial demand for application forms. By the second week of December more than 15,000 forms had been sent out in response to requests. That is another matter which should be dealt with carefully, because it will help young people. In Wales we are seeing the largest programme of capital investment ever, which I welcome. It is also right that the Budget should concentrate on housing. In Wales there are 100,000 houses lacking one or more of the standard amenities. There should be more concentration on improvement grants.<br/>
The increased capital allocations to local authorities are also welcome, but there is a need for further expenditure on the construction industry, not least because the beneficial effects on employment are disproportionately good when one spends money on the construction industry. It is not necessary to draw up grandiose schemes. The Government should consider such things as grants for improving substandard properties for letting as well as for home improvement. I welcome what is being done there.<br/>
I end by saying something about those least able to look after themselves. The whole House will be glad that my right hon. and learned Friend agreed to make good the 2 per cent. shortfall. I suspect that he realised that had he not done so he would not have got his Budget through the House. Quite a number of us on the Conservative Benches would have contributed to that.<br/>
However, I am concerned that the 5 per cent. shortfall in unemployment and sickness benefit has not been made good. I am glad that in his statement today my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Social Services said that he would reconsider the matter. It comes down to a fundamental question of fairness and whether the House will feel that it has been misled. My right hon. Friend the former Secretary of State said on 30 April 1980 that

<q>as the employment benefit comes into tax so the rationale for the 5 per cent. abatement ends. It is an interim scheme in lieu of taxation. One will give way to the other."&#x2014;[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee B</i>, 30 April 1980; c. 526.]</q>
I can construe that statement in only one way. I hope that the Government will reconsider the matter and make sure that it is remedied.<br/>
I also hope that there will be no haggling over the &#x00A3;2,000&#x2014;now to be &#x00A3;2,500&#x2014;income disregard for the purposes of supplementary benefit. That matter must be reviewed constantly to ensure that there is no unfairness.<br/>
Politics is not about reality&#x2014;I suspect that Opposition Members are glad about that&#x2014;but is about people's perception of reality, even if the two are completely different. If we on the Conservative Benches are perceived as belonging to an uncaring party, we shall be so labelled and we shall not have the support of the electorate. I believe that the Budget and today's statement by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Social Services have ensured that any possible myth about that will be dispelled. The idea that the Government will not succour those in the greatest need will be seen to be a myth which cannot be given credence.<br/>
My right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor perhaps gave the greatest tribute to the late Lord Butler when he presented his Budget yesterday, because in it he was able to satisfy many of us on the Conservative Benches, who were beginning to have doubts, that the ideals of the late Lord Butler are not dead.</p>

<p>I thank my right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer for putting forward a package that I believe will substantially help to reduce inflation and taxation and assist industry to revitalise our economy. It has taken tremendous courage to pursue consistent policies during the world's worst recession for 50 years.<br/>
I particularly welcome the special assistance that my right hon. and learned Friend has given to disabled people by exempting the mobility allowance from income tax. That has been particularly welcomed by many people in my constituency.<br/>
I thank my right hon. and learned Friend also for the changes that he is introducing to help charities, but I hope that my hon. Friends will forgive me if I make a special plea to exempt them altogether from VAT. The Conservative Party must support that, because it helps people to help themselves.<br/>
The Budget's main purpose is to help industry. The expansion of the economy, which every hon. Member wishes to see, is possible on a sound basis only if industry is free to improve its profitability and productivity, to attract more investment and provide long-term employment. That is clearly the objective of us all. It is right to help industry along that path by cutting the national insurance surcharge. All levels of business, both large and small, will benefit.<br/>
I hope that this is the first step towards further reductions of this surcharge. I hasten to add, of course, that this is a tax on jobs and that it was introduced by the Opposition when they were the Government. Therefore, I hope that they will genuinely join us in wishing that this tax is further reduced.<br/>
I am even more pleased that the Government have maintained and strengthened their support for small


businesses. There is no doubt that the Government have done more than any other in this respect. They have transformed the whole area in which small businesses operate, and raising the threshold for VAT and allowing for deregistration will ensure that very small traders will be kept out of that net.<br/>
Small companies will gain extra benefit from the lifting of profit limits on corporation tax. However, I hope that the Chancellor will not rule out the possibility of eventually having a graduated scheme of corporation tax, which will help small businesses still more and, hopefully, iron out the hump that comes in the middle, which discourages the medium-sized company from moving forward.<br/>
I know from personal experience the difficulties often faced by small companies in attracting new equity. They will be eased now that unquoted trading companies are to be less exposed to tax on the sell-back to them of shares held by United Kingdom residents. It will be easier in future for full-time directors to get relief on interest due on loans for investment in their companies.<br/>
It is important to encourage working directors in small companies to invest in them. I also welcome proposals to increase the annual value of shares that employees can receive and to make it less onerous for employees or directors to take up share options. Conservatives believe that a property-owning democracy is more than an empty phrase and are determined to see real ownership more widely distributed among all those working in industry.<br/>
The success of the business start-up and the loan guarantee schemes introduced in last year's Budget has come as no surprise to those of us who pushed hard for them. New funds from outside investors have been tapped by the income tax relief provided for the start-up scheme and the Chancellor's proposals to carry forward any unused balances from this financial year and to double the limit to &#x00A3;20,000 will make this imaginative scheme even more attractive. It could have been still further enhanced by a relaxation of the rigorous conditions imposed by the Inland Revenue under which it operates. If that could be expanded a little more during debate in Committee upstairs, it would help immensely.<br/>
The expansion of funds available for the loan guarantee scheme by a further &#x00A3;50 million to &#x00A3;150 million this year and another &#x00A3;150 million next year is a testimony not only to its success in meeting a long-standing need, but to the Government's good sense in backing a proven measure. However, the limit of &#x00A3;75,000 on each loan is too low and excludes too many worthwhile schemes. It would be much more appropriate if we raised that level to help the medium-sized firms, which probably have more potential to expand and certainly more potential to provide employment, to a limit of about &#x00A3;250,000.<br/>
The prospects of small companies seeking to generate internal funding and attract external equity or loans have been transformed in the past three years. I hope that my right hon. Friends on the Treasury Bench will give long and careful consideration to the Grylls report, which I commend to the House. It has the potential to help small businesses. It will help all businesses to borrow money and will assist many smaller firms who are paying the extra penalty of corporation tax.<br/>
Encouraging production at lower costs with higher productivity is the target at which my right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor aimed yesterday. The simple solutions of printing money and reckless borrowing

have often been tried and they have always failed. Inflation must be defeated to enable us to improve employment prospects.<br/>
It is in industry that the battle is being fought, and to industry that every help possible must be given. Small businesses have a large part to play in the campaign. The emphasis placed on both by my right hon. and learned Friend yesterday is the reason why his Budget will be welcomed in the House and in the country. We are on the way to winning not only the battle against inflation, but the war to revitalise the economy.<br/>
As a result of my right hon. and learned Friend's tactics and those of the Government, Britain has a great future. I am sorry that I have been unable to say more about small businesses, but this year's package is the third that the Chancellor of the Exchequer has presented for small businesses. As I have said, the area in which small businesses operate has been transformed. We have changed the climate, so that small businesses have much better opportunities than ever before. Indeed, small businesses probably have better opportunities than big businesses. That, I believe, is a step in the right direction.</p>

<p>The twill themes of the Government's record on unemployment and of the tax burden have run throughout the debate and I shall address myself mainly to them. Before I go through the issues involved, I shall refer to the speeches that do not fall conveniently under those two headings.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for West Lothian (Mr. Dalyell) raised a subject of acute interest to his constituents and to all youngsters north of the Humber. which provides the catchment area for the MOTEC at Livingston. That MOTEC&#x2014;which I know well&#x2014;was set up by the Road Transport Industry Training Board and since its construction has been a showpiece for what can usefully be done by the public sector for training in the private sector. In addition, it caters for an industry that is notorious for containing a major proportion of small firms which are unlikely, or perhaps unable, to organise an in-house training programme.<br/>
Not only would closure or reduction in the use of the facilities further reduce employment opportunities in, tragically, one of the worst unemployment black spots in Scotland, but it would also remove a valuable training facility, where 70 per cent. of the trainees come from outside Scotland and from the area of England that is north of the Humber.<br/>
I hope that the Financial Secretary will answer the detailed questions asked by my hon. Friend the Member for West Lothian, particularly as I understand that he has been given advance notice of them.<br/>
My former hon. Friend, the hon. Member for Mitcham and Morden (Mr. Douglas-Mann), spoke at length. I am sorry that he is not in the Chamber, because I should like to put it on record that I was saddened by his contribution. In the past, he and I have collaborated closely on several issues connected with housing policy. We have sat on many Committees dealing with housing legislation. Through the medium of <i>Hansard</i> I should tell him that in the years since then it is not I who has changed, but he. I do not propose to say any more about his speech tonight. On reflection, he will probably agree that that is the kindest thing that I can do.<br/>
The hon. Member for Enfield, North (Mr. Eggar) was here a moment ago, but has apparently disappeared with meteoric speed. He suggested that the Budget showed the triumph of experience over expectations. As the hon. Gentleman described it as the Chancellor of the Exchequer's first political Budget, it might have been more fitting to say that it was the triumph of expediency over expectations. I regret to have to say in his absence that his exchange with my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) went to the heart of his contribution. It is bizarre that after three years of Conservative Government one of the most regular attenders at our economic debates should speak from the Conservative Back Benches and should welcome the fact that the Government have abandoned the central part of their economic policy. After all, the hon. Member for Enfield, North has been supporting that very same Government for the past three years. If they were so profoundly mistaken in thir central economic plank, the hon. Gentleman surely owed it to the House, to his constituents and to the country to say so more loudly than he has done in the past three years.<br/>
The hon. Member for Luton, East (Mr. Bright) could not have expressed my attitude more succinctly or aptly when he said that the Government had transformed the climate in which small businesses operate. Indeed they have. The most notable feature of the change in climate is that small businesses are going out of business at a record rate, topping any level since records began.<br/>
I found it curiously fitting that the night before the Chancellor brought his Budget Statement to the House the nation should be treated to the former Paymaster General appearing on television and advising his audience that, while Paymaster General and responsible for Government propaganda, he had been accustomed to writing out set phrases which he then passed to his colleagues in Government in order that they might mouth them together at the weekend, on the engaging principle that what is said often enough must be true.<br/>
The right hon. Member for Stratford-on-Avon (Sir A. Maude) may have departed from the present Administration, but plainly his maxim lives on in the Treasury. In the past nine months, the Treasury has given every sign that it is trying to achieve economic recovery by the simple device of telling us every week that it has commenced. It is a process that started with the Chancellor at the end of last July, when, in reply to my supplementary question, he stated:
<q>we are now at the end of the recession."&#x2014;[<i>Official Report,</i> 30 July 1981; Vol. 9, c. 1148.]</q>
My colleagues will recollect that when we challenged him on that point in correspondence we received a letter justifying that statement on the basis that, although things were still getting worse, they were not getting worse at quite the same appalling rate that they had been before.<br/>
By December, the Chief Secretary had redefined the process of emerging from the recession. He stated to the House during the debate on the December measures that the recovery that the Government were hoping to achieve was
<q>a continued gradual emergence from the low point." &#x2014; [<i>Official Report,</i> 8 December 1981; Vol. 14, c. 805.]</q>
That was possibly the most cautious definiton of recovery that could be advanced by a Minister until I heard

the Chief Secretary today. Today, if I understood him correctly&#x2014;and I wrote down the words as they fell from his lips&#x2014;the Chief Secretary further redefined recovery as "bringing the moment nearer when unemployment will stop rising."<br/>
Recovery is not a process of bringing the moment nearer when unemployment stops rising, nor is recovery when unemployment stops rising. Recovery is the point at which unemployment substantially reduces. Recovery is when the Government succeed, at the very minimum, in getting unemployment back to the level which they inherited. We must set in context all the statements about recovery by examining what has happened to unemployment. What exposes the patter about recovery as the irrelevant rhetoric that it is is the daunting and awesome increase in unemployment over the past year.<br/>
Over the past year&#x2014;a year in which the Chancellor has talked incessantly about recovery&#x2014;we have seen the numbers of unemployed swell by a figure that is equivalent to the total population of Edinburgh plus the total population of the city represented by my hon. Friend the Member for Blackburn (Mr. Straw). Against that background, any talk of recovery is an offensive complacency. Against that background the House can ask only one question of the Budget: will it raise or cut the level of unemployment?<br/>
The Chancellor handsomely padded out his Budget Statement with piddling little measures designed to give the appearance of tackling unemployment. My favourite among those is the change in the tax law that will permit school leavers to start up their own busineses. I would not deny that a few dozen teenagers in Britain may be assisted by that change in the law. We would not wish to stand in the way of that change in the law, but to urge that measure as a serious contribution to tackling a level of unemployment among school leavers which in many areas exceeds 50 per cent. is a sick joke. Morever, it is a sick joke at the expense of some of the most vulnerable and weak sections of our community.<br/>
The Chief Secretary criticised the Opposition for being less than enthusiastic about the measures that he had brought in to help the construction industry. I would tell the Chief Secretary, if he were able to be with us now, that the reason why we withhold our wholehearted enthusiastic support for what he has done for the construction industry is that when the modest tinkering that is proposed in the Budget is set against the background of what has happened to the construction industry in the past three years it becomes almost invisible to the naked eye.<br/>
Ironically&#x2014;unfortunately for the Chief Secretary&#x2014;on the day on which the Chancellor made his Budget Statement, the Department of the Environment unveiled figures for construction output last year. It is the kind of mistake that the right hon. Member for Stratford-on-Avon would have avoided when he was Paymaster General in charge of propaganda. In the past three years, construction output in Britain has declined in real terms by &#x00A3;2 billion.<br/>
For the Chief Secretary to invite us to be grateful because he is putting &#x00A3;170 million back after that massive cut is to take a neck of brass to urge the House to endorse what he has proposed. In particular among those cuts is the collapse in the council house building programme, which now runs at a rate lower than at any time in peace during the past 50 years.<br/>
I therefore return to the question that I posed. Will unemployment rise or will it fall? The answer is provided


in the public expenditure White Paper. Unemployment will rise. Page 50 tells us that this coming financial year unemployment, excluding school leavers, will be 2&#x00B7;9 million in Britain compared with 2&#x00B7;6 million last year.<br/>
I did not understand the Chief Secretary's response to the intervention of one of my hon. Friends. He said that those figures were working assumptions, not forecasts. We understand that. We appreciate that they are provided by the Government Actuary as working assumptions. Nevertheless, we are entitled to ask whether the Chief Secretary thinks that those working assumptions are reasonable, or whether he thinks that they are wrong. If they are wrong, why has he connived in the publication of a public expenditure White Paper that is based on those working assumptions? If they are not wrong&#x2014;if they are a reasonable working assumption&#x2014;the House is entitled to take the message from the White Paper that we shall witness a further increase in unemployment in the coming year of between 250,000 and 300,000.<br/>
In a powerful speech, my hon. Friend the Member for Ince (Mr. McGuire) posed a pertinent question to the Treasury Bench. I hope that the Minister will answer it when he replies to the debate. If they believe that we can tolerate a level of unemployment of 3 million, at what level do they believe that we can no longer tolerate unemployment? What rise in unemployment is necessary to oblige them to change their reluctance to act to reduce the level of unemployment over which they have presided?<br/>
Let the House be under no illusion. One of the reasons why the unemployment figure has gone up is the deliberate action of the Government in operating a tight fiscal judgment over the last three years. Indeed, alone among the major countries that belong to the OECD, this Government have responded to recession by sharply tightening their fiscal judgment. In each of the last three years, they have operated a fiscal judgment three times more restrictive than the average for the other seven largest members of OECD.<br/>
This year, we witness a further turning of the screw with a provision that the PSBR will fall by a full 1 per cent. over the next year. As we go along that path, accelerate and put on steam towards the rocks, we hear the dulcet tones of the Prime Minister congratulating herself that she has paid no attention to what she described as the "siren voices" of those who warn us that she is heading straight for those rocks.<br/>
We are entitled to say something about those siren voices, which in the past have sounded from the Conservative Benches&#x2014;those Conservative Members who have not been wholly enamoured of the strategy on which the Government have embarked. Last year, after the Budget, member after member of the Conservative Party summoned up his courage, took it in both hands and, cupping those hands to his mouth, whispered in various ears in the Lobby that he disagreed with the Budget. Some Conservative Members went further. They threatened to do terrible things. They said that they would not stand for it and that they should be consulted. They said that if they had been consulted, the Budget would have been different.<br/>
This year the Cabinet had that consultation. Those of the sirens that survived were able to be present at the consultation. After that process of consultation and after the markers that were put down last year, what has happened? The House is faced with a fiscal judgment that is tighter than the one about which Conservative Members complained last year. What will they do about that? On

the basis of the debate and on the basis of the press comments this morning, the answer is "Nothing". The evidence of tonight suggests that those who were only too anxious to condemn the Budget judgment last year will aquiesce in silence to the Budget judgment this year, worse though it is than last year.<br/>
It must be put on record that no term ever invented by a politician for his or her opponents has turned out to be more accurate than the term "wets" which the Prime Minister used to criticise her critics in the Conservative Party. The term aptly sums up their response to the way in which she has ignored criticism that has been made by Conservative Members.<br/>
I turn from one of the main aspects of the Budget debate, which is unemployment, to the other aspect that has concerned hon. Members who have taken part. That is the impact of the Budget on the nation's tax burden. That point was raised by a number of hon. Members, including the hon. Members for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton) and Colne Valley (Mr. Wainwright) and some of my colleagues.<br/>
In the first three years of the Government the tax burden on the nation increased from 35 per cent. to 40 per cent. of the national income. I noticed that when the Chief Secretary addressed the House he invited us again to congratulate him on reducing the total burden from 40 per cent. to 39 per cent. this year. It is now only four percentage points higher than when the Government embarked on office. No doubt next year we will be treated to one of the delightful bar charts that the Chancellor of the Exchequer used to illustrate his party political broadcast yesterday. He will use those charts to show how successful he has been in reducing the burden of taxation from the high level to which he hoisted it in the first place, as he did with inflation last night.<br/>
The Chief Secretary got himself into a lot of trouble in. trying to estimate what had happened to personal taxation as a result of the Budget. [Hon. Members: "Where is he?"] I can understand that the Chief Secretary has possibly been mugged in the course of the last three hours and is concealed in a closet in the building across the road in case he feels tempted to intervene in the closing stages of the debate. However, we are encouraged to have the Financial Secretary with us because some of us noticed that he took considerable interest in that passage of the Chief Secretary's speech. He not only retired to consult those in the Chamber but retired without the Chamber to consult them in further detail.<br/>
While we understand that during a set speech from which the Chief Secretary could not depart he could not respond to the questions that were put to him, I warn the Financial Secretary that the House will not understand if he fails to respond in detail to those questions when he replies to the debate a full five hours later.<br/>
The Chief Secretary was invited to confirm or deny no more than a press notice that was issued by the Treasury yesterday. That press notice includes a table that states clearly and unequivocally that for every household with a couple on an income of less than &#x00A3;20,000 the effect of the increase in the national insurance contribution is to more than wipe out the benefit from the cut in income tax. Similarly, for every single household with an income of less than &#x00A3;10,000, the effect of the increase in the national insurance contribution is to more than wipe out the effect of the tax cut.<br/>
I can go further. I have today consulted the Institute of Fiscal Studies, which has applied the Budget changes to its own models. The intriguing result is that one requires an income of &#x00A3;30,000 before one comes out well off as a result of the Budget. Anyone earning less than &#x00A3;30,000, which I am bound to say means the great bulk of my constituents, is worse off as a result of the Budget. It is instructive to note that once again the relative distribution of the burden protects those who are most wealthy.<br/>
The household on average pay is 1&#x00B7;33 per cent. worse off as a result of the Budget, whereas the household hovering around the &#x00A3;30,000 mark&#x2014;highly paid but presumably, in the context of the Treasury's examination, not exorbitantly paid&#x2014;is only 0&#x00B7;23 per cent. worse off. If we extrapolate the comparison back over the four full Budgets of the Chancellor, we find that the household on average pay is worse off as a result of those Budgets. The household on super pay is 18 per cent. better off as a result of the measures brought before the House by the Government to change the tax regime.<br/>
I do not accept that it was necessary for the nation to sacrifice as much as it is invited to sacrifice to pay the tax burden to the Treasury. Even if it was necessary, it is morally and socially repugnant that those who earn most should be most relieved from the additional sacrifice that the low paid are called upon to pay. Nowhere is that additional sacrifice more marked than in the case of the unemployed who are dependent on unemployment benefit.<br/>
The hon. Member for Anglesey (Mr. Best) referred to the 5 per cent. abatement brought in by the Government two years ago. The hon. Gentleman will reflect that the 5 per cent. abatement was explicitly justified on the grounds that it was in lieu of taxation. The implication left was that when taxation of unemployment benefit was introduced the 5 per cent. would be restored. From July this year unemployment benefit will be subject to taxation but the 5 per cent. cut remains. I put it to the Treasury Bench that even if, in the interests of the unemployed, Ministers are not prepared to restore the 5 per cent., they should nevertheless do so in the interests of their own reputation.<br/>
If they are in any doubt about the importance of this issue to their reputation, I should like to refer to the submission by the Bow Group before the Budget which stated that the 5 per cent. abatement should be restored
<q>on the grounds of fairness towards those in most need and"&#x2014;</q>
I pay tribute to the political candour of the Bow Group&#x2014;
<q>political self-interest.&#x2026; with the additional plea that the Conservative Party should not be seen to cheat.</q>
The unemployment benefit is taxed and the 5 per cent. is not restored. The Government have chosen to set aside the advice of the Bow Group and have chosen to cheat the unemployed of that 5 per cent. Only three months ago Mr. David Luxton, an officer of the Society of Civil and Public Servants which has been preparing for the taxation of unemployment benefits, stated:
<q>The procedures are so complicated and the time so short to learn the new system that it is inevitable that gigantic blunders will be made".</q>
The people who will suffer from these gigantic blunders are those living on the lowest incomes of any household in the country. They are the people facing hardship. I invite the House to contemplate what would be the reaction if it was suggested that those who pay capital transfer tax might be subjected to a gigantic series of

blunders in the application of the tax regime. What riots we could expects from those who qualify for capital transfer tax. What letters to <i>The Times</i> we would have to endure. What block bookings of the Dining Room and the Terrace would have to be made as we were lobbied on the need to remedy these gigantic blunders. Yet exactly that fate now lies in wait for the 3 million men and women of Great Britain who are currently unemployed and struggling to survive on unemployment benefit.<br/>
Last month, in a parliamentary question, the Secretary of State for Employment was invited to name those travel-to-work areas in which unemployment exceeded 12 per cent. He listed 150, one in 10 of which had an unemployment rate in excess of 20 per cent. &#x2014;Corby 21 per cent., Ormskirk 22 per cent., Consett 25 per cent., and even the constituency of the Chief Secretary, Whitby 24 per cent.<br/>
Those figures referred only to England. If the figures for Scotland and Wales had been included, the total would have been even greater. For the whole of Glasgow, unemployment is now 20 per cent. The unenviable record for Scotland as a whole is held by Bathgate, in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for West Lothian, where unemployment now stands at a shaming and scandalous 37&#x00B7;4 per cent. for both men and women.<br/>
When I was a youth, my parents lived for a while in Galloway. Across the border in South Ayrshire there is a small town called Patna. By the roadside as one leaves the town there is a large boulder on which the figure "22" is inscribed in large characters. I must confess that I passed the boulder many times before it occurred to me to stop and find out what that figure represented. I found underneath an inscription dated 1933, put there by the men of Patna to record that the highest level of unemployment reached in Patna during the great slump was 22 per cent. The men of Patna were so moved by the humiliation and hardship represented by that figure that they immortalised it for all time on that stone.<br/>
I can think of no more accurate measure of the Government's failure to act as stewards of the nation's economy than that they have created so many cases in which unemployment now exceeds 22 per cent. that that figure is now approaching a commonplace and likely to be accepted as such.<br/>
Fifty years later, we look back upon what happened to that town in South Ayrshire as a tragedy because we know that it need not have happened. We know that with different Government policies and a different economic strategy that level of unemployment and that social outrage could have been avoided. I predict that 50 years hence, when historians and economists come to reflect upon the present period, they will regard with equal incomprehension the levels of unemployment that we are now invited to tolerate and their incomprehension will be the greater because they will know that the second major slump of the century coincided with exploitation of the rich and precious resource of North Sea oil which should have brought a period of unparalleled prosperity.<br/>
The calamity that has been visited upon the British nation need not have happened, and it need not continue. There are alternatives to the policies being pursued by the Government. If they do not yet understand that, it is high time that they quit office and made way for those who do.</p>

<p>Perhaps it would be for the convenience of the House if I dealt with the matter which the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central (Mr. Cook) raised about halfway through his speech and which was the subject of some excitement when my right hon. and learned Friend the Chief Secretary was speaking&#x2014;the figures that my right hon. and learned Friend gave for the increase in the cash available to the personal sector after the Budget and after the increase in national insurance contributions last year.<br/>
The figures that my right hon. and learned Friend the Chief Secretary to the Treasury gave were absolutely right. I will not go through them again because they will be published in <i>Hansard.</i> They did not mislead the House in any respect. They are the global total of extra cash resources which, without enormous accuracy but, give or take a margin, will be available to the private sector in the coming financial year. There is no conflict between those figures and the figures that were quoted from the press release.<br/>
The figures from table 9, and the other tables in the Inland Revenue press release, attempt to show the effect on various sample types of taxpayers based on a number of hypotheses as to what will happen in the future. May I go through the range of hypotheses? Their combinations are almost legion. First, what increase of earnings will the family have from last year to next year? Obviously, the higher the increase in their earnings the better off they will be, and vice versa. Secondly, what inflation will there be between last year and next year? Inflation obviously affects whether people are better off or not. Do they pay mortgage interest, much of it or little of it? Will the mortgage interest rate rise or fall in years to come? The greatest question of all is how many children they have. If they have a large number of children, clearly the tax burden will be lighter than if they do not, because of the effect of child benefit. There is also the period of time over which comparisons are made. I agree that there are some families where the tax burden in percentage terms might be greater. &#x2014;<i>[Interruption.]</i>&#x2014;Yes&#x2014;will be greater. However, it also depends on all the factors that I have mentioned. It is easy to gloss over the fact that we are talking about the future and about hypotheses. As I say, both statements are equally sustainable alongside each other.</p>

<p>I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way. The courtesy of the Financial Secretary in these matters never fails to make a pleasing contrast to the Chief Secretary. I have difficulty in relating the qualifications that he is elucidating to the House to table 9, which is attached to the press notice issued by the Treasury yesterday. The hon. Gentleman referred to matters such as mortgage interest, tax relief and children. Child benefit has nothing to do with this table. Child benefit does not appear anywhere on it. The whole point about child benefit is that it brought to an end tax allowances for children. As for mortgage tax, there is presumably no reason&#x2014;</p>

<p>Are they? National insurance contributions go towards paying for the benefit. It is well known that the House has asked the Government and the Government have pledged to maintain the real value of national insurance benefits, both long-term and short-term, and they have done so. Of course, it costs more to finance that, and at a time when living standards have in some cases been going down it is not surprising that the national insurance contribution is taking a greater proportion of some incomes.<br/>
I should like to deal with some of the shorter points that were raised. The hon. Member for West Lothian (Mr. Dalyell) will not expect me to go at length into the matter of the Livingston MOTEC, but I gather that it is a responsibility of the training board. As far as I know, the board is greatly concerned about rumours that the Livingston MOTEC might close. I do not have any final knowledge as to the truth of the matter, but I hardly think the hon. Gentleman will want me to go further into that point in a Budget debate.<br/>
With regard to the question of the capital disregard for supplementary benefit&#x2014;raised by my hon. Friends the Members for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton) and Anglesey (Mr. Best), and by the hon. Members for Ince (Mr. McGuire) and Colne Valley (Mr. Wainwright) &#x2014;I think that the House is grateful and recognises that it is a very big step to increase the disregard from &#x00A3;2,000 to &#x00A3;2,500. We have done it in a genuine attempt to make a generous gesture. I feel that we cannot be expected to go further, having already made a 25 per cent. increase. However, what hon. Members have said about this important disregard has obviously been noted.<br/>
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) seemed to suggest that, much as my hon. and learned Friend loves the Scots, one of the points of his Budget was designed to affect a certain by-election. The hon. Gentleman thought that the whisky price was connected with that.</p>

<p>Even after the Budget, the real price of whisky is only 55 per cent. of what it was 20 years ago. Many people do not realise that. It will not be that which secures the victory for the Conservative candidate at Hillhead as much as my right hon. and learned Friend's Budget in the round.<br/>
The hon. Member for Ince and my hon. Friend the Member for Abingdon (Mr. Benyon) both intriguingly invited us to go along routes of major reform of taxation. The hon. Member for Ince was interested in the age allowance. Although it is valuable to have the point raised, it illustrates that immediately we come up against the difficulty that in redistributing the age allowance among pensioners in general we should inevitably be taking some of it away from the aged.<br/>
That is the difficulty with all tax reform. There is always someone who will be a loser, and that person very quickly makes himself vocal. That, in a way, is the difficulty with the whole question of income tax and national insurance contribution, which my hon. Friend the Member for Abingdon raised. It is an extremely important matter and we are studying it carefully. I am grateful to him for what he said on that subject.<br/>
The hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central repeated a point made earlier about the unemployment assumptions for the Government Actuary. I refer to the sentences in the public expenditure White Paper which cover this:
<q>It has also been assumed provisionally that unemployment (Great Britain, excluding school leavers, etc.) would average 2&#x00B7;6 million in 1981&#x2013;82, and 2&#x00B7;9 million a year thereafter. This is not a forecast or a prediction. If the developments on pay and the world economic recovery are favourable, there is a reasonable prospect that unemployment levels in the later years may turn out to be somewhat lower than has been assumed.</q>
That is exactly what the Labour Government did. They assumed that the dynamism of any figure continued into the next year. That was merely in order to have a basis for making estimates. If something is rising, it is likely to rise in future. It is no more of an assumption than that. The hon. Gentleman should not read any view of the Government into those figures.<br/>
We watched carefully the effect of the Budget on interest rates, both in general and for industry. The markets have received the Budget well. My hon. Friend the Member for Enfield, North (Mr. Eggar) spoke about the judgment that my right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor had to make. That could be instantly confirmed or denied by the markets and they have been remarkedly steady today. That was also the case with the foreign exchange market.<br/>
I know that these are early days and that it takes time fully to appreciate all these things, but, in terms of confirming the judgment, interest rates tended, if anything to edge down, but they are waiting for a move from another quarter. In effect, we have two interest rates for industry&#x2014;investment incentives for plant and equipment and the much higher effective interest rate in most other cases, both for tax-paying and tax-exhausted companies.<br/>
Investment incentives are available directly to a company that pays tax. In practice, finance leasing has also made them available to the tax-exhausted company. In 1981, leasing accounted for &#x00A3;2,100 million worth of business, which is a very high proportion of investment.<br/>
The problem of high interest rates for business remains. My hon. Friend the Member for Surrey, North-West (Mr. Grylls) did a splendid job in drawing the attention of the House and the country to that issue and to the search for solutions to the problems of interest rate burdens on companies.<br/>
My right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor thought long and hard about my hon. Friend's proposals. However, as he said yesterday, we have not been persuaded that they offer the best way forward to our common objective. We had some doubt about certain aspects of the proposals and were particularly worried about their selective nature and their effect on the efficient allocation of resources. The proposals are selective in their emphasis on bank lending, as opposed to other sources of finance. There is room for debate about whether British industry is under-borrowed from the banks, but I am not convinced that bank lending is a superior form of finance. Higher bank lending is no substitute for proper long-term funding.<br/>
The scheme also favours tax-exhausted companies. It would not merely put them on the same basis as other companies, but would, in many cases, give them a positive fiscal advantage over companies earning profits and paying tax. I am not happy about creating such distortions, particularly when consultations are just starting on the corporation tax Green Paper, which raises big issues concerning investment incentives.<br/>
There would also be selectivity in favour of certain businesses, such as manufacturing, and against others, such as some in the service sector. There is also the question of costs. The proposal is that tax-exhausted borrowers should pay interest net of corporation tax and that the Exchequer should eventually make up the difference by an annual cash payment to the banks. The cost to the Exchequer could be substantial, restricting the scope for the other forms of help to industry that my right hon. and learned Friend eventually chose instead.<br/>
The fundamental problem is the low level of profitability of British industry, combined with high bank interest rates in the past. Our economic strategy is aimed at putting right those fundamental problems and creating the conditions in which businesses, whether tax paying or tax exhausted, will be encouraged to invest.<br/>
For those reasons we are attacking the problem in other ways. We see the way forward as lying along two roads. The first is the use of more equity capital. Greater use of equity finance and less borrowing from banks would reduce short-term interest rates. The measures that my right hon. and learned Friend introduced yesterday are directed to encouraging the provision of equity capital, notably by the future indexation of capital gains tax.<br/>
I wonder whether the significance of the future indexation of capital gains tax has been fully realised. Although we were unable to apply the relaxation to past gains, for the future no one who merely maintains the value of his investment will pay tax except in relation to his first year of holding the asset. Removing this distortion will undoubtedly make equities more attractive and equally index linked stock. Index linked gilts would not have been liable to capital gains tax anyway, but now any discrimination between them and index linked company debentures has been virtually removed. As the <i>Financial Times</i> says today,
<q>These measures are likely to be remembered long after the details of the 1982 Budget are forgotten".</q></p>

<p>Although one recognises all those measures, do they not mean in total that it will be much more difficult for companies to issue fixed rate debenture stock?</p>

<p>I believe not. I was just coming to that point. It is the second way forward that long-term loans should be made easier for businesses, whether at indexed or fixed rates. I recognise that many business men consider that the cost of borrowing at present is too expensive and many are concerned about the immediate cash flow costs of paying the present nominal rates of interest. We are helping, in the way that we fund our deficit. By increasing the inflow into national savings and by issuing the index linked gilts, the Government have reduced their reliance on the long-term fixed interest market.<br/>
For example, during the past year we have issued only &#x00A3;750 million of stock maturing in the next century, compared with over &#x00A3;3 billion in the year before. In that way we clear room for companies at this end of the market and long-term interest rates will also, I hope, be brought down.<br/>
We are moving in the right direction. The long-term interest rate has fallen since last September. I hope to see many more companies coming forward with debentures. A way of avoiding heavy immediate costs would be for them to issue immediately indexed stock. The Government have demonstrated that there is a market for such debt. I appreciate that it could result in a higher cash flow cost in later years. A company would need to be satisfied that indexation matched its prospects. Lenders would also need to consider the risks. I would not suggest that indexation is an easy or simple answer, but it merits more consideration. No doubt the City will be thinking about the possibilities&#x2014;there are many&#x2014;after the important changes that my right hon. and learned Friend's Budget has made.<br/>
Finally, I turn to the question that many right hon. and hon. Members have asked&#x2014;the hon. Member for Mitcham and Morden (Mr. Douglas-Mann) more than most&#x2014;which is how reflationary is this Budget? The pre-Budget advice that we received in the Treasury was conducted almost solely in terms of rival bids for the amount of reflation that hon. Members believe to be desirable. They varied from a modest &#x00A3;2 billion or &#x00A3;3 billion from some of my hon. Friends to the absurd &#x00A3;9 billion from the right hon. Member for Stepney and Poplar (Mr. Shore). The bids from SDP members were somewhere in the middle.<br/>
I have an interesting quote from a speech made in 1973
<q>There has been a lot of talk about the formation of a new centre party. Some have been kind enough to suggest that I might lead it. I find this idea profoundly unattractive".</q>
Later it says:
<q>I therefore have no desire to seek new combinations. I remember an old piece of doggeral about someone 'Playing on his fuddled fiddle, Somewhere in the muddled middle'. I have no fuddled fiddle and I do not propose to get one.</q>
That was the SDP candidate for Hillhead. Now, with a reflationary bid of about &#x00A3;4 billion, he is in the "muddled middle" himself.<br/>
I am not entirely sure what the term "reflation" means. The first time that I heard it was in 1963, when the late Reginald Maudling reflated. In those days we were on a fixed exchange rate and the consequences of reflation surfaced in the form of the famous &#x00A3;800 million deficit on the trade balance. At that time the Labour Party went for that &#x00A3;800 million trade deficit with a truly militant tendency. It said that that reflation was reckless. The Labour Party tried to snatch from us the mantle of being a party of financial responsibility, but it gave up any pretence of doing that a long time ago.<br/>
Since then there have been three further reflations. The City University Annual Review for 1981 catalogued the results of those three further reflations of 1966&#x2013;67, 1973&#x2013;74 and 1978&#x2013;79. Within a year or two of each of those reflations, inflation had, naturally, risen considerably. No one would have expected otherwise. Even more interesting, unemployment rose on average by about 50 per cent. after each reflation. In 1966&#x2013;67 unemployment rose from 1&#x00B7;4 to 2&#x00B7;4 per cent. In 1973&#x2013;74 it rose from 3&#x00B7;6 to 4&#x00B7;6 per cent. In 1978&#x2013;79, when the right hon. Member for Stepney and Poplar had something to do with our affairs, unemployment rose from 5&#x00B7;5 to 8&#x00B7;7 per cent<br/>
In each case the money supply eventually had to be brought back under control. In the 1973&#x2013;74 reflation, the International Monetary Fund had to do it. In the right hon. Gentleman's reflation we had to do it. That is what caused people to complain of "stop-go"&#x2014;something which perhaps hon. Gentlemen recently elected to the House will not remember. I believe that it was not "stop-go", but "go-stop", "reflation-deflation". It is not in the economic vocabulary now, and I am sure that no one wants to bring it back. In each of those reflations the money supply was deliberately expanded and then, a year or two later, it had to be contracted. In other words, they were not reflations but inflations.<br/>
In this connection one is again asked "Is this Budget reflationary?" One cannot answer that question with a direct answer. It is a well-judged Budget which continues our progress in reducing the size of the public sector borrowing requirement and enables us to reduce taxation. We estimate that there was a PSBR of about &#x00A3;10&#x00BD; billion in 1981&#x2013;82. We now expect it to come down to &#x00A3;9&#x00BD; billion in 1982&#x2013;83, and that includes the &#x00A3;1&#x00B7;3 billion PSBR effect in 1982&#x2013;83 of my right hon. and learned Friend's Budget proposals.<br/>
In some ways that understates the effect of our tax reductions, which, net of NIS clawback, are worth over &#x00A3;2 billion, on an indexed basis, in a full year. As my right hon. and learned Friend said yesterday, they are worth over &#x00A3;3 billion if indexation is not assumed. So where the question of reflation comes in is difficult to see.<br/>
Those are the figures. To say that the Budget is neutral, deflationary or inflationary seems to me to miss the real point, which is that the judgment on the Budget is by how much interest rates will be increased if taxes are cut and the borrowing requirement is increased. Just as many jobs can be lost by interest rates going up&#x2014;</p>

<p>Just a year ago Lancashire played host to a lengthy criminal trial which became known, for the manner in which the murderers sought to conceal the identity of their victim, as the "handless corpse" trial. It was held at Lancaster, amid strict security, and it is the cost of that security operation, and the burden of that cost upon those who are obliged to bear it, that prompts me to raise the matter though the mechanism of an Adjournment debate. I am indebted to county councillor Tom Sharratt for the detailed information that I wish to submit to the Minister, who will no doubt recognise the concern which exists among ratepayers in the Lancashire area.<br/>
The total cost of the trial, which lasted more than six months, cannot be calculated with any great precision. But it is certainly possible to make a fair estimate of the cost to the public purse: proceedings in court, &#x00A3;1&#x00B7;3 million; high-security conversion of cells at Lancaster prison, &#x00A3;8,450; courtroom alterations, including construction of a special dock, &#x00A3;50,000; police security, &#x00A3;820,000. The total estimated cost so far&#x2014;and appeals have yet to be heard&#x2014;is &#x00A3;2,178,450.<br/>
I am concerned with the &#x00A3;820,000 for the police security operation. Half of that sum will qualify, I understand, for Government grant, but the rest must come from the pockets of Lancashire's ratepayers, and I believe that is wrong. It is wrong because the crime which gave rise to the "handless corpse" trial arose from a vast international conspiracy and the murder itself occurred in Lancashire largely by chance.<br/>
The victim, Martin Christopher Johnson, a New Zealander said to have been a major figure in an international drug syndicate, could have been killed in any one of half-a-dozen places&#x2014;Australia, New Zealand, Thailand, Singapore, or other countries to which the syndicate had extended its operations. Indeed, had his killers deferred his execution for 20 minutes more as they drove north on the A6 beyond Lancaster the murder would probably have taken place in Cumbria, and if they had waited another hour or so the scene of the killing might well have been in Scotland. The fact that it happened in Lancashire, and that the body was dumped in a Lancashire quarry, was, I believe, largely fortuitous. Nevertheless, as a result of that circumstance, and in consequence of the national policy that each area must bear the cost of its own policing, Lancashire's ratepayers find themselves saddled with this enormous bill.<br/>
It is not the first time that this sort of thing has happened. In 1975 the trial of the Birmingham pub bombers was held at Lancaster, because it was felt that no unbiased jury could be found in the Midlands. That trial, too, was for obvious reasons surrounded by tight security, and the cost of that operation, too, fell on Lancashire, It came to about &#x00A3;200,000, and Lancashire alone was obliged to pay up, even though the proceedings had nothing at all to do with Lancashire.<br/>
A similar burden has been thrust upon the county of Hampshire. There have been a number of top-security trials at Winchester, involving offences committed far beyond the boundaries of that county, but Winchester


Crown court is apparently well suited to the needs of tight security, and for that reason these trials have been held there. And, like Lancashire, Hampshire has been obliged to pay the costs of the security operations surrounding those trials.<br/>
Is it just and right that this should be so? When travel was difficult and crime generally local, it was obviously reasonable that the local community should bear the cost of bringing the malefactor to justice: hence the medieval concept of hue-and-cry, whereby every able-bodied person was required to join in the pursuit of the offender. But can such outdated ideas be maintained in an age when motorways criss-cross the land and villains from the capital can raid a town in the provinces and be back home in time for tea, when foreign capitals are only hours away by air and international communications make business of any kind as easy as picking up the phone? Crime, like any other big business today, is multinational, and I believe that the costs of fighting massive international crime&#x2014;and that is what the "handless corpse" trial brought to light&#x2014;should fall on the international community.<br/>
But I realise that that is some time away. What I will say for the present is that the costs of prosecuting major crime in this country should be borne at national level and not by the relatively small section of the community in which a crime may by chance happen to occur. I believe that there is a strong argument for establishing a national top security court where cases of this nature can be tried, the costs being borne out of the national Exchequer. So long as terrorism flourishes, both domestic and international, the need for such a court will remain, and I regret to say that I see no prospect of an end to it yet.<br/>
If I may digress for a moment from the Lancaster trial and security surrounding similar proceedings, let me point out that the county of Essex will presumably have to bear the costs of the huge security operation surrounding the hijacked Tanzanian airliner which landed, largely by chance, at Stansted the other week. Possibly even greater security costs will have to be met by those police authorities whose areas will be graced this summer by the presence of the Pope&#x2014;a visit which, by any standard, must rank as a national and not a local event.<br/>
Let me return now to the particular question of who should pay the costs of the security operation at Lancaster last year. At the conclusion of the trial, Mrs. Justice Heilbron ordered that &#x00A3;1 million should be paid towards the costs of the prosecution by the man said to have been the "Mr. Big" of the international drug syndicate, in which the murdered Martin Christopher Johnson played such a significant part. He was Alexander James Sinclair, formerly known as Terry Clark, and by many other names, and was one of the five men convicted of Mr. Johnstone's murder. He will now remain a guest of Her Majesty for the next 20 years unless his current appeal is successful.<br/>
Mr. Sinclair is said to be a man of considerable substance, having amassed a fortune estimated at &#x00A3;25 million from drug racketeering within the space of four years. As I understand it, efforts are being made by the Government to secure the &#x00A3;1 million he was ordered to pay from his assets in Australia, believed to amount to &#x00A3;2 million, In New Zealand, too, Mr. Sinclair owns a partly completed house in the Bay of Islands which is said to be worth a quarter of a million pounds and he may have other assets there as well. There have been reports that he

possesses further assets in Hong Kong, Singapore and Switzerland, but it has not so far, as I understand it, been possible to identify them.<br/>
If the Government manage to secure &#x00A3;1 million from Mr. Sinclair's overseas assets to go towards the costs of his prosecution, why should they not simultaneously secure from the same source whatever sum may be appropriate to cover the cost of security surrounding his trial? The Government of New South Wales are considering legislation to ensure that the illicit fortunes of drug racketeers are confiscated on conviction. It must be a matter of regret that there is, apparently, no similar provision under British law, but it is an idea that could profitably be borne in mind by the Minister and may be translated into the Criminal Justice Bill before the House. That legislation might also include provision for diligent scrutiny of those defendants of considerable means who apply for legal aid. There is no reason at all why a man who has accumulated vast wealth from crime should expect the British taxpayer to foot the bill for his defence. Let him pay it himself, he is better able to afford it than we are.<br/>
What I have said will not help the ratepayers of Lancashire in the short run. As things stand, they must dig deep in their pockets to find &#x00A3;410,000, and &#x00A3;50,000 for alterations to the court. I suggest that in these exceptional circumstances the Government should acknowledge some special responsibility. I am sure that the Minister is familiar with the Police Act 1964 and that he will bear it in mind. An ex gratia payment to the Lancashire police authority would be appropriate in this case. I commend that suggestion to the Minister and I hope that he will respond to it.</p>

<p>I am grateful to the hon. Member for Preston, South (Mr. Thorne) for having raised an important matter for Lancashire and for the manner in which he has done so. He has given us an opportunity to discuss and, hope, clarify the arrangements for meeting the costs arising from major court trials.<br/>
It is appropriate to recall the facts relating to the discovery of the murder and the inquiry into what became known as the "handless corpse" case. On Sunday 14 October 1979, the body of a man was found submerged in water in a quarry near Chorley in Lancashire. Inquiries revealed that the body was that of Martin Christopher Johnson, a native of New Zealand who had been a member of an international drug smuggling syndicate. As a result of extensive police investigations into the syndicate's activities, raids were carried out on premises in London, Scotland and Lancashire. A number of persons were arrested and the extent of the syndicate's operation then became clear.<br/>
It was subsequently necessary for officers from Lancashire to visit Singapore and America; and they also went to Australia at the invitation and the expense of the Australian Government. As a result of those extensive investigations, 12 persons were committed for trial at Lancaster Crown court on charges of murder, conspiracy to import drugs, and conspiracy to supply drugs. Two witnesses were kept under close police protection while the murder inquiry was being conducted and six witnesses in all were afforded police protection until the trial had been completed.<br/>
The trial was a long one. It began on 6 January 1981, and concluded on 15 July. High security had to be provided throughout that period within the precincts of the court and for the trial judge, Mrs. Justice Heilbron, and, as I have mentioned, for witnesses. Without that high level of security it is probable that attempts would have been made either on the lives of witnesses or to effect the release of some of the accused from the court.<br/>
The trial proved to be the most expensive hearing on record and almost the longest for a murder case. At the end of the trial, three of the defendants were acquitted. Sinclair, the ringleader, and four other defendants received life sentences, and in all the convicted defendants received between them a total of 175 years imprisonment. Sinclair was ordered to pay &#x00A3;1 million in costs; Maher &#x00A3;10,000; and Russell &#x00A3;20,000.<br/>
The murder of Johnson was a horrible crime committed by ruthless men engaged in an international criminal operation, as the hon. Gentleman rightly said. Through the work of the Lancashire force we have demonstrated again that in this country we devote every effort to bringing to justice those responsible for such serious crimes. The police give this work the highest priority, and that is right. It is what the people of Lancashire, and the country at large would expect. The press give a good deal of attention to lurid crime, but less publicity to the successful conclusion of a case. Our clear-up rate for homicide in this country is high, well over 90 per cent. We would all agree that the fundamental point which we should welcome is that the criminal law has been enforced properly and rigorously in this difficult case.<br/>
Clearly the police must devote considerable resources to such serious crime investigations. The costs of the police operation&#x2014;the investigation and security for the trial&#x2014;were heavy and the Lancashire police authority incurred additional expenditure estimated at about &#x00A3;820,000. Responsibility for footing the bill rests with the police authority, under our constitutional arrangements for the control of police forces. Under the Police Act 1964, the duty for providing and maintaining an efficient police force for the area rests with the police autority. The Home Secretary has a general statutory responsibility under the Act to promote efficiency and must approve various actions of the police authority, for example the most senior appointments.<br/>
The 1964 Act provides for a partnership between central and local government on policing, which is reflected in the arrangements for financing the police service. Police expenditure qualifies for a 50 per cent. specific grant from the Government, and is taken into account for the rate support grant settlement. So the Government, by one means or another, are meeting about 59 per cent. of the additional costs incurred by the Lancashire police authority. Beyond that the Government cannot go. It is fundamental to our philosophy of policing in this country that the police are closely linked with their own community. They are not the paid agents of central Government, and, because responsibility for providing an efficient police force rests on the police authority, under our arrangements that authority must also be responsibe for police finance. That is what the existing grant arrangements seek to achieve.<br/>
Central Government pay 50 per cent. directly and a bit more on top by way of rate support grant. This is part of the Government's general responsibility for the maintenance of law and order in the country as a whole.<br/>
The Lancashire police authority, for reasons I wholly understand and with which I sympathise&#x2014;they could not have been put more persuasively or fairly than by the hon. Gentleman on behalf of his constituents and the county that he helps to represent&#x2014;asked for special treatment. It said that the Johnson murder was part of an international inquiry, as the hon. Gentleman has emphasised, and that is true. It said that the force was involved in an expenditure that would not normally be expected. That is true as well. It said that exceptionally strict security was necessary for the trial. That is also true. These unusual aspects, argues the police authority, put the costs of the case outside its control. I accept that they were not to be anticipated.<br/>
I also know that Lancashire had to carry the burden of some IRA terrorist trials in the mid-1970s, because Lancaster can offer perhaps the most secure court facilities in the country, but we cannot escape the fact that it is the duty of the police to maintain and enforce the criminal law, and from time to time police authorities may find themselves picking up the bill in their areas for policing commitments that are out of the ordinary.<br/>
There is some scope within mutual aid arrangements for police forces to assist others that have to bear the burden of investigations or security arrangements begun by another force. Indeed, Merseyside police provided Lancashire with free mutual aid for one of the IRA trials in 1975. But the Home Secretary has no power, nor would he think it right in policy, to pay an additional contribution to police costs in investigating the case or providing security arrangements. We cannot go beyond the grant arrangements that have been approved by Parliament.<br/>
Any proposal for 100 per cent. funding of an extraordinary commitment in the line of normal police duties would carry with it the implication that the Home Secretary should have some direct control of the police operation in question. That is a serious consequence, and not one that this House or the police authorities would or should welcome. This is something that neither the Home Secretary, the police authority nor the chief constable would find acceptable. Furthermore, there would be a very practical difficulty of defining which operations should attract special funding arrangements. Where should we draw the line?<br/>
As the hon. Gentleman has said, Lancashire's problem is not unique. Other forces have had to carry the burden of exceptionally long and complex criminal investigations. The Yorkshire Ripper investigation, the Panther case and Operation Julie are some examples. It is nothing new for the police investigation of an offence to develop into a case with nationwide or even international ramifications. The Johnson murder was a crime committed in Lancashire&#x2014;unfortunately for Lancashire. It was the duty of the Lancashire force to investigate it and to try to bring the culprits to justice, which to its great credit it did most effectively. The trial of those responsible fell in the ordinary course to be held in Lancashire.<br/>
The investigation was a great credit to the force and to the people of Lancashire who sustained that force. It is no coincidence that that efficient force is locally administered. The corollary to local organisation and accountability is local financial responsibility, which must mean taking the rough with the smooth.<br/>
I regret, therefore, that there is little comfort that I can offer. If&#x2014;and it is a big "if'&#x2014;any of the &#x00A3;1 million costs that Sinclair has been ordered to pay is recovered, it will be for consideration whether the police authority has some claim on that sum. However, we must recognise that that is a long shot. Sinclair has no assets in the United Kingdom. The order must be enforced against his assets abroad. The order was made, but it is one thing to make an order and another to enforce it so that real cash comes to hand. First, Sinclair's assets must be traced and, secondly, a way must be found of realising them within the law of the country concerned. That is a complex legal exercise, which is fraught with difficulty.<br/>
I see that local authorities would be attracted to the idea of a central court where cases requiring exceptional security could be tried. They would be paid for out of public funds so that the burden did not fall on local ratepayers. However, that would run against the spirit of the Beeching report recommendation that justice must be locally available to the people and that the courts must therefore be locally based. There would also be the difficult question of who would be eligible for jury service in a central court. Cases requiring security at such a level are extremely rare and could not justify the establishment of such a court.<br/>
Characteristically, the hon. Member for Preston, South has introduced the matter in a fair and reasonable way. He has brought before Parliament the concern in Lancashire about the exceptional police costs connected with the Johnson case. I wish that I could go further towards meeting Lancashire's requests, but, taking account of specific grant and rate support grant, the Government meet

about 59 per cent. of the additional costs falling on the police authority. I do not think that we could do more without upsetting the delicate balance between the Government and local authorities on the control and administration of policing in much more than purely financial terms. I have listened to what the hon. Gentleman said about recovering the costs from Sinclair. However, I regret that the prospects of that are not good. I should not say otherwise.<br/>
In the long run it would not be to the advantage of Lancashire or of the hon. Gentleman's constituents were we so to alter the balance that exists at present by virtue of Parliament's arrangements for the administration of policing in the country that greater control of police operations by consequence rested with the Home Secretary. That would not be to the advantage of Lancashire in particular or to the advantage of our country as a whole.<br/>
Therefore, although no one could have expressed his constituents' or his country's concern with greater fairness, objectivity or eloquence than the hon Gentleman, I regret that I must tell him that we cannot go beyond the arrangements that I have outlined. I wish that it were possible to do so. The speech that I have had to make tonight does not derive from any lack of sympathy with the problem or the burden that Lancashire has had to bear.</p>
