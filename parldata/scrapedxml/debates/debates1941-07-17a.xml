<p>According to my information, there was on 14th July one dispute involving interruption of work in Scotland. This dispute, in which 400 workers were concerned, began on 14th July, following a decision by the employer to stop Sunday work. Work was resumed on the following day.</p>

<p>A Civil Defence volunteer


going to and from duty is covered by the Personal Injuries (Civilians) Scheme for injuries caused to him by enemy action. For other injuries the Personal Injuries (Emergency Provisions) Act, 1939, requires that the injury shall have arisen "out of and in the course of" duty, a requirement similar to that laid down by the Workmen's Compensation Acts. This requirement would not be satisfied during the periods in question under the Personal Injuries (Emergency Provisions) Act any more than under the Workmen's Compensation Acts.

<p>asked the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Food whether he will consider instituting some method of procedure to avoid food queues which should, in general practice, be unnecessary; and whether he is aware that queues are encouraging a few householders to obtain an unfair advantage and additional supplies over the general public who cannot afford either the waste of time to themselves, or obtain various members of their household to queue up for multiple supplies?</p>

<p>asked the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Food whether he is aware that certain local food officers are issuing notices in forming individual shopkeepers with less than 25 customers that rationed goods will not be distributed to them; whether this is the correct method of notification; whether the customers are to be told; and whether any official announcement has been made?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1941-07-17a.730.7" speakerid="unknown" speakername="Major Lloyd George" colnum="730" time="">
<p>Yes, Sir, whenever a retailer does not secure a minimum of 25 registrations for any rationed food the appropriate food executive officer, after notification to the retailer, has been instructed to invite the consumers concerned to register with another retailer. In rural districts the food executive officer has, however, authority in exceptional cases to accept less than 25 registrations if he is satisfied that only by this means will, certain members of the public be able to obtain supplies. In reply to the last


part of my hon. Friend's Question, a general Press announcement on the foregoing lines was issued on 4th July.</p>

<p>The Government much appreciates the contribution which Mr. Justice Uthwatt's Committee makes towards the solution of difficult problems. It is of great value.</p>

<p>The committee recommends that the compensation payable in public acquisition or control of land should not exceed sums based on the standard of values at 31st March, 1939. The Government accepts this principle, and legislation to give effect to it will be introduced in due course. The detailed application of the principle; requires consideration. Adjustments may be needed to meet particular cases, and the principle must be open to review if circumstances arise which make its application inequitable. It is contemplated that the principle will remain in force for a limited period during which long-term policy for the reconstruction of town and country after the war is being settled.</p>

<p>A subject on which the committee's advice was urgently needed was action to be taken now or before the end of the war to secure the orderly planning of areas, which include areas of substantial devastation and such other areas, developed or undeveloped, as are likely to be involved in consequent schemes of redevelopment. The Government agrees with the committee that these "reconstruction areas" must be planned as a whole. The committee advises that provision should be made for defining these areas

and that planning authorities should have adequate powers to acquire land in order to secure that planning schemes for them shall be effectively carried out. These recommendations are also accepted. Their application is being worked out and legislation to put them into effect will be introduced as soon as war circumstances permit.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1941-07-17a.734.0" colnum="734" time="">
<p>The Government is anxious to prevent bad development while broad lines of reconstruction are being settled by planning authorities. The committee recommends that the control of building operations imposed for war purposes should be reinforced by controls specifically designed to prevent work being undertaken prejudicial to reconstruction, and that a central authority be set up to control building developments by licence. Emergency powers over building are already stringent, and have recently been reinforced by the War Damage Commission's control of the application of payments under the War Damage Act. The Government thinks that any further safeguards necessary for the time being can be provided by strengthening the provisions of the Planning Acts, and it is proposed, in the legislation to be introduced to deal with reconstruction areas, to make provision for this purpose. The Government accepts the committee's view that all necessary preliminary steps towards the working out of a national plan should be taken as soon as possible, to secure that local development and redevelopment may proceed in conformity with national requirements with the least possible delay after the war, and that, as to works or developments sought to be carried out meantime, clear guidance should be available whether or not they will be in accord with national interests.</p>

These statutory powers will, however, be exercised in conformity with long-term planning policy as it is progressively developed; and it will be the function of the new Council of Ministers to ensure that no action is taken under existing powers which would tend to prejudice the course of future reconstruction.</p>

<p>As I gather that questions of wage rates and overtime may be discussed on the 3rd Sitting Day, will the Lord Privy Seal arrange for a Member of the War Cabinet to be present?</p>

<p>I desire to ask you, Mr. Speaker, whether, upon the 2nd Sitting Day, when the Business will include a

proposal for some extension of the Emergency Powers (Defence) Act, 1939, the matter will be debatable, and whether it will be possible to raise certain matters contained in a Motion now upon the Paper? I very much regret that I have been unable to give you notice beforehand, but I did not know that this Business was to be taken.</p>

<p>I am not quite sure on what the hon. Member wishes to have my reply.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1941-07-17a.746.1" hansard_membership_id="463" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/11699" speakername="Sir I. Albery" colnum="746" time="">
<p>Perhaps I might make my meaning a little clearer. I believe it is a question of a Humble Address to His Majesty, in pursuance of Section II (1) of the Emergency Powers (Defence) Act, 1939, praying that the said Act, as amended by any subsequent enactment, be continued in force for a further period of one year, etc. If that is so, I want to ask you, Sir, whether that is a subject for debate and whether, in that Debate, we can raise the question of certain Amendments which are desired by certain Members of this House.</p>

<p>The matter to which the hon. Member refers is debatable, but as to the Amendments he mentions, I should like to see them before I could say whether they would be in Order.</p>

<p>In view of that reply, and in view of the fact that the Motion which has been tabled bears the names of many Members of all parties, may I ask the Lord Privy Seal whether the Motion for the Humble Address will be moved at such a time as will enable it to be adequately debated?</p>

<p>In view of the fact that in the last Debate on Propaganda only a quarter of the number of people who wished to speak had an opportunity to do so, and in view of the dissatisfaction there was at the announcement of the Lord President of the Council, may I ask whether there will be an opportunity in the near future for a further Debate on Propaganda?</p>
