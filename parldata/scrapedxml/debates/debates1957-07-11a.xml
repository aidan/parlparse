<p>Her Majesty's Government are anxious to improve the standard of social services in any way that is possible in accordance with the economic conditions of the territories, but, as I am sure the hon.

<p>Does the hon.

<p>Does the Parliamentary Secretary realise how much the health of school children depends upon the milk-in-schools scheme?

<p>No, Sir, but I am told that at some of the fifteen schools using tablets pupils who have previously refused to drink reconstituted milk now seem quite to enjoy sucking their tablets.

<p>asked the President of the Board of Trade why, despite the monetary quota for imports of apples from the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation countries having been set at &#x00A3;3 million in both 1954 and in 1956, the volume of such imports has increased by nearly 25 per cent. in both the January to June and the July to December periods; and what action he proposes taking to safeguard the British grower, bearing in mind that the official wholesaler-to-retailer prices for 1956 show that the value of Italian apples alone exceeded &#x00A3;4 million on the home market.</p>

<p>The volume of imports appears to have increased because the quota has been more fully used and there has been a bigger proportion of cheaper apples. I do not think that the published wholesale prices for 1956 justify the conclusion which my hon. and gallant Friend draws from them, and I have no reason to believe that the value limit of &#x00A3;3 million under the quota was exceeded.</p>

<p>asked the President of the Board of Trade whether he is aware that the value and quantity of imported apples has risen from 143,350 tons at a cost of &#x00A3;10,997,662 in 1954 to 189,037 tons at a cost of &#x00A3;14,240,962 in 1956; and whether, in view of the fact that United Kingdom growers have, with Government encouragement, recently increased their production, he will state what is now his policy on this matter.</p>

<p>Yes, Sir. Nearly a third of the increase was due to higher imports under the open general licence from sterling Commonwealth countries and the balance mainly to imports from Canada and the United States of America which were not resumed until late in 1954. It remains the Government's policy to place no restrictions on imports of apples from Commonwealth countries in the sterling area. Those from other areas continue to be restricted by quotas.</p>

<p>Will my right hon. Friend bear in mind that as a result of encouragement given by Government after Government since the war, and particularly by the Government of 1945&#x2013;50, home growers increased their production and a great many trees were planted in that period which are now coming into full fruit?

<p>On a point of order. Might I ask for your guidance in this matter, Mr. Speaker? I understand that the Government claim that their power to give these warrants and permissions and exercise this power is derived from a prerogative, and one assumes that that is a Royal prerogative, now exercised according to our constitutional practice on the advice of Ministers. The Ministers are responsible Ministers, responsible to this House for the advice which they give to the Crown. Is it, therefore, proper for a Minister exercising a prerogative power, when he is asked by a Member of the House what he has done, to refuse to say what he has done?</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 2, line 4, at the end, to insert:
<q>(4) The maximum amount of the annual salary authorised by subsection (4) of section one of the Ministerial Salaries Act, 1946, to be paid to the Vice-Chamberlain of Her Majesty's Household is hereby increased to two thousand two hundred and fifty pounds.</q>
I do not propose to detain the Committee very long. My hon. Friend the Member for Fulham (Mr. M. Stewart) and I tabled this Amendment because we thought we should draw attention to the work carried out by the Vice-Chamberlain of the Household. This


appointment is always considered most unimportant and I do not think the Committee generally realises the amount of work that has to be done. The compilation every day of a report to Her Majesty, which has to include personal impressions and a lot of thought, is done by the Vice-Chamberlain, who has certain other duties to which I need not refer here.<br/>
I understand that the view is held that other duties of the Vice-Chamberlain in connection with the Whips' Office is a matter for different party practice. Nevertheless, the fact remains that because he has to do this work in the afternoon, he therefore is not able to apply himself to other responsibilities which fall to his lot as a Member of Parliament.<br/>
There are in this Chamber at the moment, I believe, four hon. Members who have held this position. I should like to think that they agree with me that although the Amendment comes from the Opposition, the present holder of the office is carrying out his job in the best tradition of the Vice-Chamberlain's office and that, apart from personalities, the position as such should receive some recognition from the House.</p>

<p>If I may add a word in support of the Amendment, it is only to say this. In the whole arrangement of salaries, from those paid to the most eminent Members of the House to those paid to the back bencher, there is always a gradation. The steps are so arranged to fit the different degrees of responsibility. There are the salaries of the Prime Minister, of senior Ministers, of junior Ministers, and of various types of intermediate Minister.<br/>
The Amendment relates to a Member of the House whose main duties are those of being a Government Whip, but who has, in addition, the other duties referred to by my hon. Friend the Member for Lichfield and Tamworth (Mr. Snow). Those other duties carry a certain amount of responsibility and consume a considerable amount of time. There is, therefore, a substantial difference in that respect between him and the other Household officials, and it seems to be in conformity with our general plan of salaries that that difference should be reflected in a moderate difference of salary. This is a matter to which the

Government might reasonably give attention while the Bill is under discussion.</p>

<p>I must advise the Committee that for the very reasons of gradation which the hon. Member for Fulham (Mr. M. Stewart) has mentioned, it would be quite impracticable to make this alteration within the scope of the Bill. The Amendment proposes to give to the Vice-Chamberlain of the Household a salary of &#x00A3;2,250, but the Bill, taken in conjunction with the Ministerial Salaries Act, 1946, provides for one of the Ministers who are commonly referred to as Whips the salary of &#x00A3;2,200 while applying a salary of &#x00A3;2,000 to the rest.<br/>
The effect of this Amendment would, therefore, be to give the Vice-Chamberlain of the Household a larger salary than that which is payable to the person who is, in effect, by practice the deputy Chief Whip. Thus a much more extensive regrading than is involved in the Bill would be necessary if anything of the sort which the hon. Member is arguing were to be done. I would, therefore, suggest to the Committee that this alteration lies outside the scope of what the Bill seeks to do.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1957-07-11a.554.1" hansard_membership_id="8309" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/22134" speakername="Mr. W. A. Wilkins" colnum="554" time="">
<p>Even if, as the Financial Secretary says, this Amendment is outside the scope of what the Bill seeks to do, the Committee nevertheless should consider some other aspects of the responsibilities which devolve upon the Vice-Chamberlain of the Household. Those who have served in the Whips' Office&#x2014;Government Whips' or the Opposition Whips' for that matter &#x2014;know quite well that the responsibilities of the Vice-Chamberlain are probably much in excess of those which devolve upon other Whips.<br/>
One of my hon. Friends dissents, I understand, but I hold firmly to the view that the Vice-Chamberlain has many additional responsibilities. As my hon. Friend the Member for Lichfield and Tamworth (Mr. Snow) has pointed out, the Vice-Chamberlain is specially closely tied to service in this Chamber. If we cannot remunerate the Vice-Chamberlain in accordance with the work he is called upon to do we can still make a clear and justifiable case, even though it may not be possible to implement it through the Bill, to improve his lot. I should like


to have the attention of the deputy Chief Whip for this, for it may be possible for him to make representations about it.<br/>
What I suggest is that the duties which reside in the Vice-Chamberlain should be reconsidered. Surely we have reached a time when they could be. Is it really necessary now to have to send every evening a message to the Palace detailing the work of the House of Commons up to a comparatively early hour? It can be a record of only a very limited amount of work done up to, say, half-past six or seven o'clock. I wonder whether, instead of a daily report, there could not be a weekly statement. It would not be so arduous a job to produce a weekly statement, and it would contain a report of the main work of the House of Commons during that week.</p>

<p>I associate myself with the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, South (Mr. Wilkins). Is it really necessary that the Vice-Chamberlain should have the enormous responsibility of sending a communication to Her Majesty which Her Majesty probably will not read? [HON. MEMBERS: "Oh"] I am only saying "probably" I would not be dogmatic about that. If Her Majesty reads this document my sympathy extends to Her Majesty as well as to the Vice-Chamberlain. The responsibilities of the Vice-Chamberlain could easily be lightened by sending a marked copy of HANSARD to Her Majesty instead of the daily message.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman the Member for Lichfield and Tamworth (Mr. Snow) has raised this matter with the very best of intentions, but I think it is unfortunate that the remarks of the hon. Gentleman the Member for Bristol, South (Mr. Wilkins) should have been made. I fully expected the hon. Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Emrys Hughes) to make such remarks as he did.<br/>
This work which the Vice-Chamberlain does is traditional, and it has gone on for a great many years. It is quite wrong for anybody in the Committee&#x2014;and I include myself&#x2014;to suggest that the practice should be altered. It is not for us to say that it should be. I am sorry that my hon. Friend the Vice-Chamberlain is himself unable to speak on the matter,

because I know quite well what he would say on the whole subject if he did speak upon it. I think we should be well advised to leave the matter as it is.</p>

<p>I did not raise this matter in any frivolous spirit. I emphasised what I myself noted when I saw hon. Friends of mine at work, and that is the arduous character of the work involved in the office of the Vice-Chamberlain. My suggestion was a very serious one. If we cannot adequately remunerate the Vice-Chamberlain through this Bill for the work he is called upon to do, I think that we ought to try to relieve him of some of his responsibilities.</p>

<p>I had not intended to intervene in this discussion, and I should not have done so had it not been for the remarks of the hon. Gentleman the Member for Macclesfield (Sir A. V. Harvey). What he is asking the Committee to do is to come to a decision on the basis of what he, apparently, knows the Vice-Chamberlain of Her Majesty's Household would say if he were to speak, when, so far, he has not spoken. If the Committee is asked to come to a decision on that basis, then, in all fairness to the Committee, the Vice-Chamberlain ought to tell us what it is that his hon. Friend the Member for Macclesfield thinks he would tell us, or, failing that, the hon. Gentleman the Member for Macclesfield, since he knows what is in the mind of that silent functionary, himself should inform the Committee what that is.</p>

<p>I am sorry that we are having this debate. The Amendment is about the remuneration of the Vice-Chamberlain, not his duties, and I do not understand how the duties have come into the discussion. I should think that the answer to the complaint, if complaint there really is, that these duties are so arduous&#x2014;and I am sure they are arduous&#x2014;is that a sensible Whips' Office would so arrange the duties of the Whips, including those of the Vice-Chamberlain, that the Vice-Chamberlain would be relieved of some of his duties other than that duty which has been specifically mentioned&#x2014;some whipping duties, perhaps.<br/>
I have never been a Whip, I am thankful to say. I do not think I have the temperament to be a Whip. I would


never dare to speak disrespectfully of any Whip. I think that a Whip must be of a rather curious temperament. Still, a Whip's life must be a very arduous one. I am sure it is a very arduous one, and I do not believe that the labours of the Vice-Chamberlain of Her Majesty's Household need be any more arduous than those of other Whips. I was joking when I said I never dare to speak disrespectfully of the Whips. I often do, but I do not believe that the Vice-Chamberlain need be overworked if the duties of the Whips are properly arranged.</p>

<p>Like my hon. Friends, I also wonder why it is necessary that a manuscript recording the proceedings of the House of Commons up to a certain time of day should have to be sent to the Palace when a copy of the accurate record which is kept could he made available instead. I am told by those who have held this office that the message which is sent to the Palace is not merely an objective account of what has happened in the House, but contains a number of personal comments upon what has happened, and the names of personalities to whom things have happened or remarks have been addressed, and from whom they have emanated. If we are asked to vote a higher remuneration to the Vice-Chamberlain, I see no reason why the Members concerned should not know exactly what is contained in these messages when they are compiled and sent.</p>

<p>I was trying to suggest that if we are to be asked to increase the salary or emoluments of the Vice-Chamberlain the extra work for which it is suggested that he should be remunerated should be made available to us here in Parliament.

<p>I hope it will not be believed that those messages to Her Majesty are not read. Those of us who have held the position of Vice-Chamberlain of Her Majesty's Household have

the best of all possible reasons for knowing that, in fact, they are read.<br/>
This tradition of sending these messages is of very ancient historical origins. The job was at one time a personal responsibility of the Prime Minister, and it was given to the Vice-Chamberlain because of the pressure of work on the Prime Minister. My hon. Friend the Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Emrys Hughes) introduced his characteristic humour into the debate, but I would point out to him that the Vice-Chamberlain has the personal responsibility of giving to Her Majesty his impressions of what goes on in this Chamber.</p>

<p>I sincerely hope not. I understood that the function of the Vice-Chamberlain, and I hope that I shall be supported by those who have held the position, was to give certain impressions to Her Majesty which might enable Her to paint a mental picture of what went on. The job might we well or badly done, but until it is abolished the Vice-Chamberlain ought to be paid the rate for the job. I ask the Committee to consider this matter a little seriously.<br/>
I rather deplored the line of argument put forward by the Financial Secretary, who appeared to rule the Amendment out of order because it would make the Vice-Chamberlain &#x00A3;50 better off than the deputy Chief Whip. Assuming that that is a valid argument, surely the Financial Secretary could have suggested that he would consider the matter and formulate a Government Amendment to regularise that position. I do not think that the Financial Secretary's argument was a very pleasant one, and I hope that the Government will think again.</p>

<p>I beg to move, That this House doth agree with the Lords in the said Amendment.<br/>
I suggest that with this Amendment we should also consider the Amendment in line 25.<br/>
It has been urged by the Opposition, both in this House and in another place, that special provision should be made in the composition of the Electricity Council for a representative of the trade unions. That is a claim to which the Government have felt unable to agree, because we think that it is necessary to have the maximum flexibility in the appointment of people to the Council and that if we appoint a person to represent one interest we shall find ourselves committed to agreeing to the appointment of persons to represent other interests as well.<br/>
The Amendment from another place proposes that in appointing a maximum of three independent members of the Electricity Council, the qualifications to which the Minister should have regard shall be the qualifications set out in Clause 2 (3) for the Generating Board, which refers to people who have experience of, and have shown capacity in
<q>the generation or supply of electricity, industrial, commercial or financial matters, applied science, administration, or the organisation of workers.</q>
Therefore, it is made quite clear that in considering these three independent appointments, or as many of them as he decides to make, the Minister shall have regard to candidates having experience of many things, including the organisation of workers. I suggest that the record of this and of the previous Government has shown, and continues to show, that we have a proper appreciation of the service that trade union leaders can render to the country in these matters.</p>

<p>We on this side of the House certainly welcome the change which the Minister proposes, so far as it goes. In giving the reasons for not going the whole length that the Opposition wish to go, the right hon. Gentleman said that if he went that length the Measure would not have sufficient flexibility. The term "flexibility" is flexible in itself and does not mean very much. Whilst we would not oppose the change now suggested, I should be grateful if the right hon. Gentleman would elaborate what he means by flexibility.<br/>
Putting the question bluntly and squarely, why cannot we have a person who is a trade union member, experienced in trade union affairs and in Labour relationships? Why, if there were to be provision for such a member, is the measure of flexibility required not sufficient? It seems to me that the Minister has taken refuge in a somewhat woolly term not infrequently employed on both sides of the House and by Ministers of both political persuasions. I should be grateful if he would elaborate the matter a little more, if he now has the necessary information.</p>

I once referred to the Bank Rate as a flexible weapon, and I was reprimanded by the hon. Member for Reading (Mr. Mikardo), who said that it was like knocking in a nail with a rubber hammer, which probably was quite true. If we specify that one member of the Electricity Council should represent a particular interest, there are a number of other particular interests, possibly not, in the view of hon. Members opposite, as important as the trade union movement but also important in themselves, which would be able to claim that they should be represented.<br/>
We feel it right that in setting up this very important body for the future of the industry, the Minister should not be inhibited in having to allocate seats on the Council to represent particular interests. By "flexibility" I meant that if we allocated a position on the Council to one particular interest we should almost certainly find ourselves compelled to allocate other seats for other particular


interests, organisations representing industry or the consumers and a number of others. That would inhibit the Minister in appointing the best Council, and that is why we do not feel able to go further than the Amendment.</p>

<p>I beg to move, That this House doth agree with the Lords in the said Amendment.<br/>
I understand that, once again, this Amendment was inserted in the Bill in response to promptings from Opposition Members in the other place. It is concerned with the extent to which membership of the Generating Board, the Electricity Council and, indeed, the area boards shall be whole-time appointments. As the Bill was passed by this House, it left the matter very much to the discretion of the Minister, but this Amendment would limit his discretion to the extent of providing in subsection (1) that the chairmen of the Generating Board and the Electricity Council shall be whole-time members. Subsection (2) requires, in that appointing people to the Generating Board, to the Council and to the area boards, the Minister shall secure that he has on each of these bodies enough full-time members to ensure that the functions of the body to which they belong are efficiently carried out.<br/>
I suggest to the House that this reaches a proper balance between the importance of having enough whole-time members on each board whilst, on the other hand, ensuring that we do not fetter the Minister in his discretion as to the exact proportion of members of the boards who are whole time and those who are part time.</p>

<p>We on this side of the House welcome the change proposed by the other place, particularly in relation to the Generating Board. The general effect of the change is to strengthen the tendency towards whole time membership of the boards. That is excellent as regards the Generating Board, and certainly in regard to the more important leadership of the Electricity Council.<br/>
There is, however, a point which I hope the right hon. Gentleman will take into account, namely, that a differentiation should be made in nature between the Generating Board, which is a production body concerned with making electricity, transmitting electricity, having a big functional, technical job to do, and the area boards, which again of their nature are more of a public service and closer to the consumer.<br/>
For myself, I think that the case for having more whole-time members on the Generating Board is infinitely stronger than the case for having too many whole-time members on the area boards. Therefore, I think that the emphasis should be on the representation of those interests which are natural to the locality, and which have some bearing on the interests of the local consumers, and are seen to have some bearing.<br/>
I hope, therefore, that in making these appointments, in respect of which the Minister now has flexibility, he will take into account the natural difference between the Generating Board on the production side and the area boards on the distribution side.</p>

This is a drafting Amendment, consequential on a change which was made in Clause 11 on Report in this House. Hon.

Both Amendments are consequential on one which was moved in another place by an Opposition peer and accepted, to the effect that the area boards, when fixing retail tariffs, as they have a responsibility to do, shall consult not only the Electricity Council but also the consultative council for each area. It is already the existing and well-established practice in each of the areas that this should be done, and if these two Amendments are accepted the existing practice will have been given statutory effect. I hope that this is a proposition which commends itself to both sides of the House.</p>

<p>There is a point which arises here. As I understood the 1947 Act, the area boards were obliged to consult the consultative bodies on tariffs and rates. Is it now suggested that if this Amendment is accepted they will have to do it prior to making the change? I think that that is probably the issue, because under the 1947 Act they were obliged to consult.</p>

<p>With the leave of the House, I will reply to the hon. Gentleman. As I understand, under the 1947 Act the area boards were obliged to consult the consultative councils as to their general plans and arrangements, and there was no statutory obligation to consult them before fixing the retail tariff. In practice they did consult them, but there was no obligation to do so. If these two Amendments are accepted there will be an obligation to consult the consultative councils not only as to general plans and arrangements but, as the hon. Gentleman has put it, before fixing retail tariffs.</p>

<p>I beg to move, That this House doth agree with the Lords in the said Amendment.<br/>
I suggest that this Amendment and the Lords Amendment in page 42, line 46, go together. The second is consequential upon the first.<br/>
Under Section 54 (5) of the 1947 Act it was provided that, subject to any pension regulations made by the Minister, any "customary obligations," to use the statutory phrase, which were observed by the former owners of electricity undertakings with regard to pension schemes should be transferred to the electricity boards. That meant that when the various rights, liabilities, duties and obligations of electricity boards were made the subject of transferred provisions, these so-called customary obligations were included with them. It is necessary to make sure that obligations of that kind, inherited from the pre-nationalisation regime by the Central Electricity Authority, should also be transferred respectively to the Generating Board and the Electricity Council.<br/>
The Amendments are necessary for that purpose and achieve it by giving a definition of the word "obligation" at the end of Clause 24, the one which deals with the transfer of assets and liabilities of the Central Electricity Authority, and, secondly, by ensuring that any proceedings in respect of a customary obligation which happen to be pending at the time the transfer takes place are continued under the provisions of the Second Schedule. That will be the effect of the second Amendment.</p>

<p>I beg to move, That this House doth agree with the Lords in the said Amendment.<br/>
This is a more substantial Amendment which introduces a new idea which I want to explain in some detail. This new Clause concerns all applications for overhead electric lines&#x2014;excluding service lines to the consumer&#x2014;which are lines for which the Minister's consent has to be obtained under Section 10 (<i>b</i>) of the Schedule of 1899, to which reference is made in the first subsection.<br/>
The first subsection specifies the way in which these applications for consent shall be made&#x2014;they shall be in writing, there shall be a map, and they shall state whether the necessary wayleaves have been agreed with the owners and occupiers of the land which it is proposed the line should cross. The next two subsections are designed to meet a grievance

which has been expressed from time to time. The grievance is to the effect that when the electricity authorities come to ask for a wayleave&#x2014;to negotiate a way-leave, or, if necessary, to apply for a compulsory wayleave&#x2014;the owner's position is prejudiced if the Minister has already given planning consent to the line.<br/>
It is said that if the Minister has already agreed that the line shall go from A to B, crossing over a certain number of properties, then the position of the owners or occupiers of those properties is prejudiced when it comes to deciding whether the Authority shall have a way-leave to put pylons on the land, or whether a transmission cable shall be allowed to cross that land.<br/>
The Clause tries, I think successfully, to meet that objection in two ways. In the first place, in subsection (2) it says that when an application for planning consent to lines of this kind is made to him, the Minister may insist that before he deals with it all the necessary way-leaves shall have been obtained, or, if the wayleaves have not been obtained, that the objections shall have been stated. Under subsection (2) the Minister will be able to say, when an area board applies for planning consent to run a line from A to B, that it must, at the same time, ask him to deal with compulsory way-leaves, if objections have been raised by the people occupying the premises along the route of the line. Therefore, he will be able to deal simultaneously with both planning consents for the line and with any question of compulsory wayleaves which may have to be granted for sections of that line.<br/>
It should be an administrative improvement to conflate the two processes and it will be an advantage to the owner or occupier, because his objection will be heard simultaneously with any objections to planning consent to the erection of the lines. I should make it perfectly clear that this procedure can apply only in fairly limited circumstances. Clearly, it would not apply to very long transmission lines, because so many people might be involved.<br/>
When one is considering planning consent for a considerable length of line, so many routes may be involved that it may be impossible to say in the planning consent how many people may be asked


to grant wayleaves, or how many applications may be made for wayleaves over individual properties on the possible routes over which the line may travel. This procedure of conflating a wayleave consideration with planning consent will probably apply most of all to short transmission lines from power stations, feeding into the grid, and possibly also to distribution lines of the area boards.<br/>
Provision for the longer main transmission lines is made in subsection (3). In those circumstances, if all the necessary wayleaves have not been obtained, the Minister need not say that planning consent must await the wayleaves. He can give planning consent, but not permit a particular section of line to go ahead until he is satisfied that wayleaves can be granted. The effect of that will be that the Minister will be able to insist that approval for the necessary way leaves will proceed some way ahead of the actual construction of the line.<br/>
4.30 p.m.<br/>
The thought behind that is that people say&#x2014;with some justice&#x2014;that if the line is run absolutely up to their properties and they then say, "We do not want the line to run over our property," their position is a little prejudiced by reason of the fact that the line is already on their border and the cost of diverting it will probably be considerable. We want to see that people who object to wayleaves being granted are able to object before the line has advanced to the point at which their objections will be prejudiced.<br/>
The purpose of subsection (3) is to enable the Minister to phase the physical progress of the transmission line with the legal process of obtaining the wayleaves, so that the electricity authorities have a few miles in hand, and so that nobody is faced with the position where the line is right up against his land and his objection is thereby prejudiced. That is the purpose of the Clause, which is basically intended to deal with the fairly general feeling that individual owners and occupiers may be prejudiced in their objections to the granting of wayleaves, either because the Minister's planning consent has already been given or because the line has advanced so near to their property that a diversion around it will be too expensive for the authorities to contemplate or for the Minister to feel able to give his permission to it.<br/>
I believe that the Clause meets the point which these people have in mind. I do not think that the new procedure will lay any burden upon the authorities or the Department which will hinder or slow down the progress or development of these overhead lines.</p>

<p>We could hardly complain about the Clause in view of the fact that its principle at least was suggested by a Member of this party in the other place. It seems generally sensible and, as the right hon. Gentleman suggests, it certainly goes quite a long way towards meeting a substantial grievance on the part of property owners when electricity authorities propose to extend their lines. We therefore support the Clause in general.<br/>
But I would like to put one point to the right hon. Gentleman. Does this mean that the Minister or his representatives are now open to be questioned in this House on every such proposal, where their responsibility is involved? It may be that I should not put that question to the right hon. Gentleman, but he may have some views upon it. There is also one further point. We are all in favour of greater protection being given to owners of property, in the interests of amenity&#x2014;and that point of view has been widely expressed by hon. Members on both sides of the House and in the other place but we now run the risk of the pendulum swinging a little too far in the other direction. We must be a little careful about the matter.<br/>
When we discussed the question in Committee upstairs, where the question of consent to electricity works was first raised, I understood that it was the intention&#x2014;I give the Government credit for it to speed up power station and transmission line projects. It may be that the net effect of these changes will be rather in the opposite direction, and will slow these projects down. I just put that thought to the right hon. Gentleman. I hope that he is satisfied on the point.<br/>
Only the other day my hon. Friend the Member for Barking (Mr. Hastings) put a question to the right hon. Gentleman, drawing attention to the loss of electricity supply in many parts of the country due to the recent thunderstorms and lightening disturbances. The point


which my hon. Friend very reasonably made was that the electricity authorities should provide more alternative sources of supply. If the authorities are to do that kind of thing, and extend their lines to give a greater reliability of supply, it is not much good having a procedure which is so cumbersome and is likely to stand in the way of their doing something on these lines.</p>

<p>We must be careful before we accept this proposal, despite the fact that it was moved by a member of my party in another place. I say that particularly in view of the fact that there is a further Amendment on the Notice Paper which I shall vote against later on, namely, the new Clause C.<br/>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Cleveland (Mr. Palmer) has said, the Clause now under discussion changes the whole question of the Minister's responsibility. As I see it, as a result of the insertion of the Clause it will be quite in order for the Minister to be questioned here, and for the Minister of Power to be questioned in another place, in connection with every single wayleave to which objection is taken and to which hon. Members may be referred by their constituents. I do not think that we can run an industry of this character if that procedure is followed.<br/>
Unless assurances are given by the Minister in this respect, in view of the necessity for a practical and efficient working of the electricity supply I shall certainly vote against the Clause. I am reinforced in my view by the foolish and inane later Clause to which I have already referred, and which it would be out of order to discuss now. We must have assurances from the Minister before we accept the Clause.</p>

<p>Two very important points have been raised by hon. Members opposite. First, I do not think that the Clause will make any difference to the degree to which the decisions of the Minister are open to question in this House or in another place. Application already has to be made to the Minister under Section 10 (<i>b</i>) of the Schedule to the 1899 Act, and the Clause in no way affects the authority and responsibility of the Minister for giving or withholding

planning consent. The Clause makes him no more and no less accountable to this House than he was under the 1899 Act. The Clause, in effect, is concerned not with the decisions which the Minister makes but the procedure adopted before he makes those decisions, and the circumstances in which he makes them.</p>

<p>It is all very well for the Minister to say that, but the position is not quite so simple. In view of what he says, if we are not satisfied with the ways and means in which these wayleaves have been asked for, and our constituents complain to us about them, in view of the Minister's statement at the Box just now it will be quite in order for us to question him. Therefore, the logic of my argument follows, namely, that we shall be able to raise the question of every single objection to a wayleave that is put forward.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1957-07-11a.572.1" hansard_membership_id="9029" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/18045" speakername="Mr. Maudling" colnum="572" time="">
<p>If that will be true in the future it was equally true of the past. My point is that the Minister has to decide whether to grant these wayleaves in every case in which his consent has to be asked, and if he were subject to challenge in Parliament in the past over his decision in regard to any wayleave he will be no more and no less responsible to Parliament in future. The Clause does not affect the liability of ministerial decisions being challenged in this House.<br/>
My own impression&#x2014;speaking rather off the cuff&#x2014;is that if the Minister gives a planning decision he is always liable to be questioned in this House as to why he made that decision. That has always been so, I would have thought, and it is probably only a matter of practice that he has not so been asked. But there is nothing in the Clause which will make Ministers' decisions upon wayleave procedure any more subject to challenge in this House in the future than they were in the past.<br/>
I very much share the fears of both hon. Members opposite about the possible delay. I am very worried about this. Half way through the Committee proceedings we started trying to speed up the procedure, and everyone was in favour of that in principle. Having produced some ideas, however, we found that no one liked the ideas. It is rather like Government economy; everyone is


in favour of economy in general, but nobody likes it in particular. In the Bill as it left this House we introduced certain improvements to speed up the procedure. Too often however, people think that this matter is very simple, and that we can have electricity supplies without the erection of power stations and of transmission lines. It is bunkum to think that. It is an attitude which colours the minds of too many people.<br/>
Much of the opposition to the erection of power stations and transmission lines comes from people who already have an electricity supply. They should remember that if we are to be able to supply electricity to every part of the country, we must be able to produce it and carry it. I am, therefore, grateful to both hon. Members for underlining what should be underlined more often, namely, that although we are anxious to preserve the amenities of this island&#x2014;and I know how anxious and how sensible the electricity authorities are in this matter&#x2014;we cannot have electricity distributed without pylons and transmission lines. I am grateful to hon. Members for pointing that out.<br/>
With that background, and having looked at the proposed new Clause, I am satisfied that it will not slow down procedures. I hope that, in practice, it may speed them up a little. By putting together two stages, planning consent and the granting of wayleaves, subsection (2) may enable us to speed up a little. The Clause is designed to meet a legitimate cause of grievance by owners and occupiers of property. After some consideration, I am satisfied that it will not hold up the development of the electricity supply system. For those reasons, I hope that the House will be prepared to agree to the Lords Amendment.</p>

<p>I beg to move, That this House doth agree with the Lords in the said Amendment.<br/>
This is a fairly small Amendment which will have no great practical effect. It gives statutory authority to an accepted practice. Where application is made for the construction or extension of a generating station under the Act of 1909 it provides that notice shall be given, not only to the local authority, but to the local planning authority. That will bring the provision for generating stations into line with the provisions for transmission lines which are, I believe, set out in the Act of 1919. At any rate, it has always been the practice, where a generating station is to be built or extended, to let the local planning authority know as well as the local authority. The Clause will give statutory authority to a general and sensible practice.</p>

<p>I beg to move, as an Amendment to the Lords Amendment, in subsection (1), line 5, to leave out from the beginning to "not" in line 11, and to insert:
<q>have notified the Minister that they object to the application, and that objection of the local planning authority has".</q>
I think it would be for the convenience of the House if all the Amendments to the proposed Lords Amendments were taken together. That would include the proposed new Second Schedule, which is described as a "consequential Amendment to the Bill".<br/>
This matter is a little complicated. I will try to explain it, in the hope that I shall explain it also to myself in the process. The proposed Lords Amendment arises from an undertaking given by my noble Friend that where the local planning authority maintained an objection either to the building or the extension of a power station, or to the provision of an overhead line, my noble Friend would cause a public inquiry to be held. That is the principal purpose of the proposed new Clause D. It is backed by a series of subsidiary provisions which are concerned with the notice that shall be given, where notices shall be placed, further publicity, if the Minister should re

quire it, and machinery designed to carry out the primary purpose.<br/>
4.45 p.m.<br/>
I believe it was also felt that local planning authorities, excellent as they are, are primarily local and therefore have a limited purview of these matters. It was put to us that there might he objections on planning grounds to power stations or transmission lines which would not necessarily come within the field of operation of planning authorities and that provision should therefore be made for the consideration of objections, not only from the local planning authority, but from any other body, for example, the Council for the Preservation of Rural England. In those circumstances, a public inquiry should be held at the instance of the Minister. As the result, the proposed new Clause D now provides for a public inquiry not only if the local planning authority should object, but if that authority should inform the Minister that other persons are aggrieved by the application. The effect would be that if any two people objected to any particular application the Minister would be bound to hold a public inquiry.<br/>
There are a number of reasons why the Government do not feel that the proposed new Clause is acceptable. The


Minister has to deal with about 9,000 or 10,000 applications for overhead lines annually, and if we had to have a public inquiry any time two people objected to one of these applications, the effect on the power programme would be insupportable.<br/>
The effect of the Amendment which I have moved to the proposed Lords Amendment would be that where application has been made to the Minister, and the local planning authority has informed the Minister that it objects to the application and its objection has not been withdrawn, the Minister shall hold a public inquiry. Subsection (1) would say that where the local planning authority objects, there shall be a public inquiry. This is in accordance with the undertaking given by my noble Friend. I hope that that proposal will commend itself to the House. If the planning authority maintained an objection, there would be a very strong case for a public inquiry.<br/>
We then endeavour to meet the further point, that the local planning authority may not be the only people with a reasonable objection and that the Minister should be able and obliged to listen to objections from other quarters. The purpose of subsection (2) as amended would roughly be that, in the case of high voltage lines, which are to be defined as lines for conveying electricity at or above 132,000 volts, if anyone other than the local planning authority has an objection to make he will send the objection to the local planning authority and simultaneously to the Minister. Then the Minister will have the whole picture of the objections to the line and will be able, if he thinks it right, to hold a public inquiry in regard to objections from sources other than the local planning authority.<br/>
This has happened in other cases, one of which was the Bradwell Power Station. No objection was raised locally, but the Minister thought it right to have a public inquiry because of the importance of the project. If the local planning authority says that there are other substantial objectors, like the Council for the Preservation of Rural England, the Minister will have discretion to order a public inquiry. He will not be compelled to do so unless he thinks that the substance of the objections is such as to make that the right course to pursue.<br/>
This is a very tangled problem, and the Amendments which I am proposing to the Amendment from another place are, I regret to say, complicated, but I have endeavoured to explain to the House the main purpose. I think that what underlies the whole provision is the feeling that, first of all, if the local planning authority objects, there should be a public inquiry; secondly, we cannot assume that because the local planning authority has no objection, there are no other objections from other sources which are worthy of a public inquiry; and that, in the case of objections other than from the local planning authority, it must be for the Minister&#x2014;it cannot be for anyone else&#x2014;to decide in his discretion whether these other objections should be dealt with by private hearing or whether they are adequate to merit the full machinery of a public inquiry on the lines set out in the subsequent subsections of the new Clause.<br/>
I hope very much that our Amendments will commend themselves to the House. I think the point raised in another place is a valid one, and represents a feeling which is fairly widespread but, as I explained earlier, I also feel very strongly that we must not do anything which will, in fact, impede or hold up the expansion of the electricity supply industry. I think that by our proposed Amendments to the new Clause we have, with some difficulty and with some ingenuity on the part of the Parliamentary draftsmen, succeeded in obtaining the best of both worlds.</p>

<p>I think this is a step in the right direction, because the original Amendment would have been thoroughly impracticable. I am no lawyer, but it seems to me that it would have meant having to consult the Society for the Preservation of Rural England before erecting a power station in Scotland, and I do not know what the Secretary of State for Scotland would think about that. The whole thing would have been thoroughly impracticable, and would have impeded the programme.<br/>
I should like to ask one question. Why has it been found necessary, according to the right hon. Gentleman's statement, to have a datum line for high voltage lines of 132,000 volts?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1957-07-11a.581.0" hansard_membership_id="9029" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/18045" speakername="Mr. Maudling" colnum="581" time="">
<p>The answer is that we felt that it was quite impossible to apply this procedure to every application for an overhead line. The thing that causes most controversy and discontent to people is the large overhead lines carried on big pylons, and the datum line of 132,000 volts is intended to include the big pylons, hut to exclude the normal overhead distribution lines.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1957-07-11a.581.1" hansard_membership_id="12667" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/20826" speakername="Sir F. Soskice" colnum="581" time="">
<p>I think the Minister has found what is a reasonable compromise in order to allay a number of conflicting anxieties. The Clause started out with a provision that there should be an inquiry when there was an objection by the planning authority. When that was examined, it was thought that possibly the planning authority might take too narrow and sectarian a view in some sets of circumstances.<br/>
That quite naturally gave rise to the suggestion that the Clause should be considerably enlarged and that the Minister should be required to hold an inquiry in the event of objections from other sources which, it was thought, might take a more general view of the circumstances. But, as the right hon. Gentleman has pointed out, the Clause in the form in which it left another place would have put very serious obstacles in the way of the direct implementation of large-scale schemes. It was under these circumstances that the right hon. Gentleman and his advisers set to work to try to find a middle way between these opposing points of view.<br/>
The course which he has adopted in order to achieve that objective seems to us on this side of the House to be wholly reasonable. What he has said, in effect, is that there must be an inquiry when there is an objection by a planning authority, and that there should be an inquiry when an objection is voiced from other quarters. At any rate, in the case of these very high voltage cables, it seems to us that, faced with that difficult situation, and trying to meet the point of view of those who wished objections to be fully aired and fully considered and those who felt more strongly the practical need for pressing on with urgent programmes, that the right hon. Gentleman has found a sensible middle way and a reasonable compromise, which I hope, when it is considered, will seem to be satisfactory to all those who have felt very much concern in this matter.<br/>
Speaking for myself, I would certainly hope that the House would agree with the Paymaster-General in the changes which he proposes, which certainly seem to me to meet the situation, and I therefore hope 'hat the House will agree to them.</p>

<p>I beg to move, That this House doth agree with the Lords in the said Amendment.<br/>
5.0 p.m.<br/>
During the discussions in another place their Lordships showed themselves to have a passionate interest in beauty and physiography and especially flora and, of course, fauna. [<i>Laughter</i>] I do not know why hon. Gentlemen are laughing. There is no question of three guineas in this. The new Clause is a very valuable addition by their Lordships and I commend it to the House.<br/>
The Clause is fairly wide in its application. It states that not only when formulating proposals, but when considering proposals, the electricity boards, the Electricity Council and the Minister shall have regard to the various matters which are specified. Those matters cover a wide range of subjects&#x2014;the preservation of natural beauty:
<q>&#x2026; the conserving of flora, fauna and ecological or physiographical features of special interest &#x2026;</q>
In regard to geological features, for example, that means that if there were known to be or thought to be a certain bed of interesting fossils and excavations had to be made, then those fossils could not be disturbed until the matter had been carefully considered. Also, buildings and other objects of architectural or historical interest have to be protected. I think it might be in order for me to point out that this is in line with a similar provision which was made in the Coal-Mining (Subsidence) Bill the other day. We are anxious to protect our irreplaceable national heritage. whether of ancient things or of beautiful ones.<br/>
Considering the way in which this very broad obligation is likely to work out in practice, I would point out that, first and foremost, the various electricity boards would have to bear these factors in mind when considering their duty under Clause 7 (4) to produce a general programme of development for consideration by the Minister. Then the Electricity Council and, in turn, the Minister would also have to bear these factors in mind when considering their general programme. But the obligation would apply to matters of a more particularised kind. For example, when proposals are being formulated for a new power station and an application is being made by the Generating Board to the Minister for consent, both the Board and the Minister will have to bear these proposals in mind.<br/>
I hope that the House will not think that this is imposing upon the Generating Board a big new obligation which is not already borne voluntarily by the Central Electricity Authority. I have been looking closely into these procedures lately, and I find that the Central Electricity Authority goes into these matters with very great care. I think it would be a matter of public assurance that these excellent practices should be recognised by Parliament and written into this Bill while we have the opportunity to do it. I feel that their Lordships have done a public service by drawing attention to these matters and giving us the opportunity to ensure that they become part of the law of the land.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1957-07-11a.586.0" hansard_membership_id="6152" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/16189" speakername="Mr. C. R. Hobson" colnum="586" time="">
<p>I am against the proposed new Clause. It is far too restrictive. I do not see any reason for its insertion. Indeed, we have already been told that it covers precisely what the electricity boards already do. It may appear from that that I put myself in a contradictory position when I say that I am against the inclusion of the Clause, but there is all the difference in the world between having a common-sense and practical approach to the problem&#x2014;which I am sure those connected with the Generating Board have&#x2014;and having this very closely drawn Clause inserted into an Act of Parliament.<br/>
What is meant by "fauna"? Can it be stated where we shall site atomic power stations without affecting some fauna, such as deer in Scotland, or rabbits? Does "fauna" cover badgers? It is all a question of definition. The whole thing is stupid. Provision has already been made for siting projected atomic power stations. The proposal to have one at Bradwell raised a flurry about whether or not a Georgian mansion was an ancient building. The same sort of thing will happen all over the country.<br/>
I do not see why the House, to please another place, should insert a Clause containing such categorical language when we have got on very well in the past without one. I have known the industry for many years and I have never heard of the building of a power station leading to the destruction of fauna and flora or to the pulling down of historic monuments. I cannot understand the readiness of any Government to have a Clause of this character, for I am sure it will be the subject of objections and a tremendous number of legal actions. After all,


the British people have a certain tradition, and we are not likely readily to destroy any of our heritage. I do not think the Clause is necessary. I would on no account vote for it, because I think it is just plain stupid.</p>

<p>I support what has been said by the hon. Member for Keighley (Mr. C. R. Hobson). If we add such a Clause to the Bill, we may look forward to lawyers' field days, because we shall be putting into the Bill many words with vague definitions. We are, in fact, calling upon the boards to carry out obligations which they have voluntarily accepted over a number of years. Unless we are to have a long interpretation Clause dealing with the points covered by the new Clause, I feel that we should do well not to accept it.</p>

<p>Many of us understand and sympathise with the doubts concerning difficulties in the operation of the Clause which have been expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Keighley (Mr. C. R. Hobson) and the hon. Member for Totnes (Mr. Mawby). Nevertheless, it cannot be doubted that on both sides in this House and in another place there has been a strong expression of feeling that when our power station programme is extended in the future&#x2014;we are to have a tremendous extension&#x2014;it is the business of all the authorities concerned, including the boards, to take account of amenity considerations. I believe that I speak for the great majority of my right hon. and hon. Friends when I say that, for that reason, we feel that the Clause should be given general support.<br/>
The difficulty seems to be on the aesthetic side. What is to be the standard of taste in these matters, and how is it to be determined? Will the electricity boards appoint flora and fauna officers?</p>

<p>Unkind critics of the boards&#x2014;I am sure without any warrant&#x2014;have occasionally talked about a "bereavement officer," quite a mythical figure. If, in addition, there is to be a "flora and fauna officer," there would be scope for more jokes for the comedians on the music hall stage.<br/>
There are such difficulties, but the real problem is to determine what we really<br/>
mean by the natural beauty of the countryside. It so happened that my memory from reading Macaulay's History of England took me to Volume I. Macaulay is not a much quoted historian these days. He is a Whig historian, but none the worse for that, if I may say so as a good Socialist. I remembered words which I found in page 280, where he says:
<q>Under the benignant influence of peace and liberty, science has flourished, and has been applied to practical purposes on a scale never before known. The consequence is that a change to which the history of the old world furnishes no parallel has taken place in our country. Could the England of 1685"&#x2014;</q>
and Macaulay was writing in the early years of the nineteenth century&#x2014;
<q>be, by some magical process, set before our eyes, we should not know one landscape in a hundred or one building in ten thousand. The country gentleman would not recognise his own fields. The inhabitant of the town would not recognise his own street. Everything has been changed, but the great features of nature, and a few massive and durable works of human art. We might find out Snowdon and Windermere, the Chedder Cliffs and Beachy Head. We might find out here and there a Norman minster or a castle which witnessed the wars of the Roses. But, with such rare exceptions, everything would be strange to us.</q>
That is my difficulty when noble Lords and others talk about the natural beauties of the countryside. I am all in favour of protecting beauty on every occasion, but my difficulty is to define natural beauty.</p>

<p>That may be so, but I submit that it is irrelevant. It is quite competent during the Committee stage of a Bill to submit manuscript Amendments, subject to the discretion of the


Chairman of the Committee, and I see no reason why the procedure in this House should be any different in this respect, particularly in view of the fact that these Amendments come from another place. Hon. Members have a lot of other things to do and if notice has not been taken of this it only means that hon. Members have had their minds devoted to day-to-day problems.

<p>I feel it necessary to support the Minister in this matter. We are all agreed that we have the loveliest country in the world, especially in good weather. We also have some of the noblest and most distinguished buildings and some perfect gems of rural architecture in our English villages. I am not referring so much to Scottish villages. A few years ago this lovely countryside was disfigured by ribbon development. Fortunately, owing to the quick and successful action of the then Conservative Government, this horror was largely stopped.<br/>
Now we are being subjected to a new menace. Pylons of strange design, and erections of a Heath Robinson character, are going up all over the countryside, destroying the skyline&#x2014;</p>

<p>If I may speak again with the leave of the House, I should like to reassure those hon. Members who have expressed anxiety about this matter. My hon. Friend the Member for Totnes (Mr. Mawby) said that this proposed Clause might result in a lawyers' paradise. I

hope that I can assure him that is not so. All that requires to be done by the various parties concerned, the Electricity Council, the boards and the Minister, is to take into account these various things and to consider them having regard to
<q>&#x2026; the desirability of preserving natural beauty, of conserving flora, fauna and geological or physiographical features of special interest, and of protecting buildings and other objects of architectural or historic interest &#x2026;</q>
It is not every sparrow which has to be protected. It is not every stone. It is when these features are of special interest that they have to be taken into account. There is no question of this becoming an overriding factor which will decide every case. I hope that my attempt at clarification will allay the anxiety of the hon. Member for Keighley (Mr. C. R. Hobson). He made the point that this Amendment is unnecessary because what the Clause proposes is already being done. It is already being done by the Central Electricity Authority, but we must remember that a new public authority is being created, the Generating Board.<br/>
The Electricity Council is being set up with new responsibilities and I think it right that while we are making this general change in the structure of the industry we should remind those accountable for the future administration of the industry and the making of these decisions of their responsibilities. It is right to bear in mind the public anxiety which has been expressed, although it has sometimes been misplaced. I think that we should write these responsibilities into this Bill.<br/>
The hon. Member for Cleveland (Mr. Palmer) expressed the hope&#x2014;if I may put it this way, paraphrasing the words of the hon. Gentleman&#x2014;that there would not be a "flora and fauna officer"&#x2014;</p>

<p>That comes back to a very great extent to the responsibility of the Minister in this matter. He is obliged to take these matters into account when exercising his powers and duties under the Act. There is no question of an appeal of any kind except to the Minister, but I think that one must realise that this has got to be regarded in the light of the various procedures under this Measure and previous statutes. If one regards it in the light of those procedures, one finds that the whole thing is channelled upwards to the Minister and he is responsible to Parliament That is the sanction which underlies the working of this Clause.</p>

<p>I beg to move, That this House doth agree with the Lords in the said Amendment.<br/>
This is an Amendment which makes various adaptations and amendments, including some to the Electricity Act, 1947. Section 3 (4) of that Act disqualifies Members of Parliament from being members of the Central Electricity Authority or its area boards. The House of Commons Disqualification Act has recently repealed Section 3 (4) of the Electricity Act, 1947. It is, therefore, right that we should also repeal it here.<br/>
However, in this connection I should invite the attention of hon. Members to page 50 of the Bill as it went to the House of Lords on 9th April, in which we find that the House of Commons Disqualification Act, 1957, is also amended, and amended in such a way as to substitute for "the Central Authority" "the Central Electricity Generating Board" and the Electricity Council". So we

now arrive at the position at which it will be impossible for Members of this House to be members of the Electricity Council or any of its electricity boards.</p>

<p>I hope that this is an instance in which the effect of the House of Commons Disqualification Act, 1957, will be salutary in clearing up various ambiguities in the law relating to disqualification with which that Act set out to deal. I am a little dismayed, however, to find that, while the provision we seek to remove is rendered unnecessary because of the House of Commons Disqualification Act, the Bill itself amends that Act. I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman proposes to remove from the Bill, or has already removed, the provision in which it amends the House of Commons Disqualification Act. I do not think he told the House that, but presumably he has done so.</p>

<p>I speak again by leave of the House. The House of Commons Disqualification Act, 1957, is amended in the Third Schedule and on page 50 of the Bill. I think it was right for the House of Commons Disqualification Act to be passed irrespective of what might be enacted by Parliament in this Bill, which had not been enacted by the time that Act was passed, and for the Bill, now it is to be passed, to amend the House of Commons Disqualification Act. I understand that the usual procedure which pertains when we have two Bills going through the House in one Session and to some very minor extent they overlap has, in fact, been followed in this case. Nothing unusual is being done, but the whole thing is being tidied up in this way.</p>

<p>I beg to move, That this House doth agree with the Lords in the said Amendment.<br/>
This is a tidying up Amendment which deals with two matters which, I can assure the hon. Member for Keighley (Mr. C. R. Hobson), were considered in Committee. The two Sections of the principal Act which we propose to amend are Sections 21 and 33. Section 21 appointed stockholders' representatives at the time of nationalisation to represent stockholders entitled to compensation, and provided that they should be paid by the Crown and that the money should be recovered from the Central Authority. It appears to be true, although rather surprising, that all possible claims under the nationalisation Act have not yet been exhausted, and it is possible that further money will have to be provided by the Crown to meet the expenses of stockholders' representatives. This money will clearly have to be reimbursed to the Crown in the future by the Electricity Council, which will be in existence after the vesting date in the Bill, when the Central Authority has ceased to exist.<br/>
Section 33 is similar in that subsection (4) provides for the payment of allowances, pay and expenses to the Electricity Arbitration Tribunal which was set up under the nationalisation Act to determine disputes arising from the nationalisation of undertakings. I understand that some matters are still outstanding between the Central Authority

and the local authorities for which arbitration may be necessary, and if the arbitration tribunal is to be reconvened, which is possible, the Electricity Council will be the proper body to reimburse the Minister for the tribunal's expenses, since the Central Authority will not be in a position to do so after the passage of the Bill.</p>

<p>This is a shocking business. On two occasions this afternoon privileges of the Commons have been broken by another place. I cannot understand why Government spokesmen in the other place are so badly briefed, or are not informed by those responsible for informing them that the Money Resolution is not adequate&#x2014;because I take it from the Minister's statement that this is precisely what is meant here. I hope that we shall not have many repetitions of this sort of thing.<br/>
It is true that one is present when Lords Amendments are being considered only if one is particularly interested in the Measure; that is the general way in which hon. Members conduct themselves. Nevertheless, I speak with over twelve years' membership of the House, and I think this is the only occasion which I can remember on which the privileges of the Commons have been broken by the Lords twice in one series of Amendments. I am not blaming them, for they are trying to get their own way, but I am complaining somewhat bitterly that there is not sufficient co-ordination between the Minister and right hon. and hon. Members opposite in pointing out that there is not enough money in the Money Resolution to cover the point under consideration.<br/>
If certain concessions are to be made, we shall have Bills put up to a sort of Dutch auction and the highest bidder will get what he wants. Are we to have a state of affairs on the Budget in which, when he has a surplus, the Chancellor of the Exchequer says, "All right boys. I shall be distributing largesse to the tune of &#x00A3;50 million"?<br/>
This is a case in which the Money Resolution has not been adequate. I think it points to very bad co-ordination, and I make my protest.</p>

The Third Schedule of the principal Act, with which we are concerned here, deals with the issue of compensation stock at nationalisation. Once again, rather surprisingly, it is true that there is still a small amount of compensation stock which has not been allocated, the reason being that people entitled to it have not been identified. Adaptations are required in the Schedule to transfer to the Electricity Council certain functions of the Central Authority about compensation stock. This is in line with what has already been decided in principle by the House.</p>

<p>These two Amendments are consequential to Clause 28 (5) of the Bill, which deals with the fixing of maximum charges for reselling electricity, and the need for the Amendments arises in this way: Section 18 of the Gasworks Clauses Act, 1847 provides penalties for

misusing gas supplied by gas undertakings. That Section of the 1847 Act was applied to the misuse of electricity by Section 12 of the Electric Lighting Act, 1882, but with the adaptations that "gas" meant "electricity" and that "gas pipe" meant "electric lines". The two Acts between them are among the legislative fossils with which we have to contend from time to time, but of which we have to take notice because, although they seem to be fossils, they are still alive.<br/>
The 1882 Act, as read with the 1847 Act, made it illegal to resell electricity, whereas in the Bill we are making it legal to resell electricity subject to certain conditions. We therefore have to remove the legislative provisions which make it illegal to do so.<br/>
The first of these Amendments, to line 40, deletes the obsolete words from Section 18 of the 1847 Act and the second Amendment, in line 43, which can be understood only by referring to the Bill as well as to the Lords Amendments, if I may respectfully say so, deletes the now superfluous words from the Appendix to the Electric Lighting Act, 1882. I should point out that we have a most extraordinary legislative position in that provisions of the Gasworks Clauses Act,1847, as amended and amplified by the Electric Lighting Act, 1882, are embodied in the Electric Lighting (Clauses) Act. 1899, so that we have double legislation.<br/>
Therefore, by these Amendments we have to correct the same piece of legislation, which occurs in two different places, and to do it twice. I have been into this, and I can assure the right hon. and learned Gentleman that the object has been achieved.</p>

<p>I beg to move, That this House cloth agree with the Lords in the said Amendment.<br/>
The purpose of the Amendment is to give to employees of Scottish electricity boards rights of appeal similar to those conferred by this Bill on employees of the Central Authority and the area boards. Clause 26 empowers the Minister to make regulations to compensate officers of the Central Authority and of area boards who suffer loss as a result of the operation of the Bill.<br/>
In accordance with Section 55 (5) (<i>b</i>) of the 1947 Act, where an appeal about such compensation is taken to a referee or board of referees there is no appeal from the decision of such a referee or board of referees, but, as the result of a proposal of the hon. Member for Cleveland (Mr. Palmer), Clause 26 (4) of the Bill now provides that in England and Wales there may be an appeal, on a point of law, to the High Court from the decision of a referee or board of referees.<br/>
It seems right, therefore, that a similar right should be conferred on officers of electricity boards who have suffered loss through the operation of the Electricity Reorganisation (Scotland) Act, 1954. Section 12 of that Act provides machinery for compensating such persons, hut makes no provision for an appeal, and this Amendment is designed to give a similar right of appeal on a question of law to the Court of Session.<br/>
Since the reorganisation provisions of this Bill do not affect Scotland, they will not give rise to compensation claims in Scotland, but this Scottish Amendment concerns only claims that may arise as a consequence of the Scottish reorganisation brought about by the Act of 1954. It is considered proper that we should give the same right of appeal under that Act.</p>

<p>I am sure that employees of the electricity supply industry in the South of Scotland will be grateful to the Government for bringing forward this Amendment in another place; and that we are grateful to the Joint Under-Secretary for his explanation. As he says, the Bill does not concern Scotland, as Scottish electricity now runs more or less on its own.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman has referred to the Electricity Reorganisation (Scotland) Act. I think that it is true that the compensation provisions in that Act run for a 10-year period, but there is, of course, another very important part of Scotland&#x2014;so I am told&#x2014;in the Highlands, which is looked after for electricity supply purposes by the Hydro-Electric Board. Perhaps I should have given the hon. Gentleman some notice of this, but I think that those compensation provisions are still in force. I do not think that they have run out, though I speak from memory.<br/>
If this advantage is to be extended, very properly and very generously, to electricity employees who may be adversely affected by the working out of the Electricity Reorganisation (Scotland) Act, 1954&#x2014;a Measure given approval, perhaps, before the present Bill was thought of&#x2014;is there not some logic in the suggestion that a similar opportunity should be given to electricity employees in the North of Scotland. I shall be very grateful if the Joint Under-Secretary would promise, at least, to look at that point, if there is time.</p>

These payments are made half-yearly, in July and in December, so that, so far as this financial year is concerned, we have no need to worry; it is all perfectly well arranged already.<br/>
We must, however, amend Section 2 of the Rating and Valuation Act, 1957, in order to include references to the Electricity Council so as to straighten the matter out for future years, and also in order to make it clear that the references in the 1957 Rating and Valuation Act to the Local Government Act, 1948, are references to that Act as amended, that is to say, by this Bill. That is done by this Amendment, which will be an Amendment to the Third Schedule, in page 50, and the insertion will come before the House of Commons Disqualification Act.</p>

<p>I beg to move,
<q>That the Draft Cinematograph Films (Collection of Levy) Regulations, 1957, a copy of which was laid before this House on 26th June, be approved.</q>
It might be for the convenience of the House, Mr. Deputy-Speaker, if we discussed these and the following Regulations together.<br/>
Where appropriate, we have followed the pattern of the voluntary levy both as regards collection and distribution, and I am glad to be able to tell the House that we have been able to secure agreement on nearly all matters. Numerous methods of collecting the levy were considered, but, in the end, the scale given in the Schedule to the first of the two sets of Regulations was found to be the one most acceptable to the trade, and I hope, therefore, that it will meet with the approval of the House.<br/>
The Regulations provide also for payments for admission to cinema entertainments which are exempt from Entertainments Duty to be exempt also from levy. This follows the existing scheme and, in addition, any exhibitor taking less than &#x00A3;150 for admission in any one week, excluding Entertainments Duty on those takings, will be exempt from levy on that. There are arrangements for appropriate marginal relief also. These arrangements for exemption are rather more generous than those under the existing trade operated arrangements.<br/>
As to the Regulations relating to distribution, I should like to point out that claimants will now have a definite legal right to payments, which they did not have before. We are continuing the principle of distributing the levy in proportion to the box office success of all eligible films. This meets with general approval and follows the present practice which rewards merit and does not subsidise inefficiency.<br/>
There is one point to which I should like to refer, namely, that, to deal with possible abuses, whereby the earnings of films might be unfairly inflated in order to attract a larger share of the Fund&#x2014;</p>

<p>As I was saying, we have, to avoid the possibility of abuse, given a fairly wide measure of discretionary power to the Agency rather than attempted to frame complicated and detailed Regulations which would be unlikely to stop up all possible loopholes and might be somewhat inflexible. I am glad to be able to tell the House that these discretionary powers have received an unqualified welcome from all quarters consulted.<br/>
The Agency has power to make provisional payments, but this power is permissive and not obligatory. I do not think that this need cause any anxiety, and I understand that the Agency is already taking the necessary practical steps to make provisional payments on much the same lines as at present. The Agency was set up on 1st July, and is getting ready to come into operation fully on 20th October.<br/>
I hope, therefore, that the House will see its way to approving these draft Regulations today.</p>

<p>We are very glad to have the Parliamentary Secretary's brief explanation of these Regulations, but I think that there are one or two points which are causing some disquiet in the trade, on which it would be only proper to have a further disquisition from the hon. Gentleman.<br/>
Turning, first, to the Regulations dealing with the collection of the levy, it is true that the provisions for exemption are somewhat more generous than those under the private scheme, in so far as cinemas are now to be exempted if their net takings, instead of their gross takings as before, are &#x00A3;150 per week.<br/>
Of course, we all recognise that this does not really help the rather larger cinema which may, nevertheless, be in a very difficult position because, although its takings may be more than &#x00A3;150 and, therefore, not exempt, it may be running at a loss, or hardly breaking even. Under the private scheme there has been an arrangement with the renters whereby any cinema which was not exempt but

which was in considerable difficulties over payment of the levy could approach the renter and the renter agreed to make some adjustment in the hire charge.<br/>
My understanding of the present situation is that because these Regulations provide for a statutory levy, instead of a voluntary one, the renters appear not to be willing to continue with this practice and that may mean that we shall find a certain number of cinemas which may be in considerable difficulty and which will not be helped by the renters under what I call their shorn lamb policy. We should like to know whether the Government have any idea at all in their mind as to the way in which, if need be, such cinemas may be helped.<br/>
The Cinema Exhibitors' Association has put forward a suggestion that the President of the Board of Trade might require the Cinematograph Films Council to consider such cases and make recommendations for exemption from payment of the levy. That, perhaps, may be going rather too far in this first year before we see how things go, but I think it right to say to the House that there is fairly considerable disquiet in the trade on this point, because it does not look as though the informal arrangement which has made this work under the voluntary system is likely to be continued. That is the main concern that we have about the collection of the levy.<br/>
When we turn to the Regulations dealing with the distribution of the levy, there is one point which, I think, should be mentioned to the House before we approve the Regulations. It has been decided to take 20th October as the starting day for the first distribution period. That means that the distribution period is in effect settled for the next ten years and must always begin on the 20th October. Although we realise that the levy and the entertainments tax are theoretically completely separate subjects, nevertheless it will, I think, possibly be awkward in the future if we have the levy regulations beginning on the 20th October whereas any changes that there may be in entertainments tax would presumably take place fairly soon after a Budget which was introduced in April.<br/>
There may be a very long gap&#x2014;as, in fact, there is this year&#x2014;between changes in tax and possible changes in the levy. I mention that because it is


something which may prove awkward in the future, although I fully recognise that there were good reasons this year for going on to October instead of starting the payment period at, for example, the end of July.<br/>
The Parliamentary Secretary has assured us, I am happy to say, that under paragraph 5 provisional payments will he made as they have been made under the voluntary scheme. I am sure that the film producers will be very glad to have this assurance, because I know that there has been some anxiety about this matter of provisional payments, and I think that they will be glad to know that the Agency proposes to carry on making the usual very substantial provisional payments, even before they can come to the final computation of what any particular firm has earned. We are very glad to have that assurance.<br/>
On the other hand, when we come to paragraph 6, concerning the computation of earnings of films, once again there is considerable anxiety in the trade, and I am rather surprised that the Parliamentary Secretary has not even referred to it, because under paragraph 6 provision is made in the first subsection that a long film shall receive one unit and a short film two and a half times the rate.<br/>
Considerable representations have been made, by the film producers, the Association of Cinematograph and Television Technicians and the Association of Specialised Film Producers, that the President of the Board of Trade ought to have included a special provision for second feature films. They formally asked, I understand, that for such features the unit should be twice the basic unit. So it is rather surprising that the Parliamentary Secertary, having received formal representations from three important associations in the trade, has not even mentioned today the reasons why the President of the Board of Trade has felt himself unable to accede to this request. I do not want to go into all the details about the difficulties which the makers of second feature films are now experimenting, because I think that they are well known to anyone familiar with conditions in the trade.<br/>
I have no doubt that the Parliamentary Secretary is aware that, among other things, the National Film Finance Corporation makes very much more stringent

conditions for second feature films than it does for other types of films in offering assistance with finance. In general terms, I think that it is right to say that of all the groups of British films now being made they are suffering most at the present time, so I think that we are at least entitled to some explanation why, with such strong pressure, the President of the Board of Trade has not felt himself able to accede to the request.<br/>
When we come to the later provisions concerning what one might call the tightening up of procedure, particularly in cases where two or more films are being shown in the same programme, and where there may be some little adjustment between the earnings of one and another, I assure the Parliamentary Secretary that we very much welcome the proposals in the Regulations, because it is most important that everyone should feel that there is no possibility of any dishonest juggling with the money which, after all, is collected from other people in the trade.<br/>
We are, therefore, glad to see that proper discretion has been given to the Agency. I quite agree with the Parliamentary Secretary that that is the best way to do it. So far as I can judge, the Agency is being given adequate powers to deal with the kind of difficulty which it has been suggested may have arisen in one or two cases under the voluntary scheme. That seems to us a very proper provision in the Regulations.<br/>
Most of the other provisions in the Regulations are solely of technical interest. Before we conclude this brief debate, however, I should like to draw attention to one rather important point. It is something new so far as Parliament is concerned, although the voluntary scheme had some provision for the same thing. It is the position of films made for television. The Parliamentary Secretary might be more explicit, because this is important in view of the increase in the number of television films now made. The general principle is that if a film is made primarily for television it does not seem fair that it should receive part of the money which was intended really to support the production of films shown in commercial cinemas. As this is the first time that such a distinction between one type of film and another has been made in statutory form, I think that we


might have had a few words of explanation, because it is a matter of considerable public interest and of some interest in the trade.<br/>
There is one other small point which interests me personally and to which I should like to draw the attention of the House. Paragraph 13, sub-paragraph 3, provides that the maker of a film may assign his responsibility to claim on the fund to some other person and that if he does so the assignee shall
<q>&#x2026; be deemed for all purposes of these Regulations to be the maker of the film to the exclusion of the actual maker thereof &#x2026;</q>
While, of course, one wants completely to safeguard the financial rights of any person to whom an assignment of this sort has been made, nevertheless it seems to me that the Agency should at least be permitted&#x2014;it may not necessarily be obliged&#x2014;to give to the actual maker of the film information as to the amount of levy which has been earned by any film of his.<br/>
It does not seem right that when we are dealing with a quasi-public fund&#x2014;this is not a matter simply of private agreement between individuals&#x2014;a maker who applies to the Board of Trade should not be given that information. I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to say that whereas there may not necessarily be any statutory obligation upon the Agency to give that information, there is nothing to prevent it giving the information to the actual maker of the film even though he may have assigned his financial rights to somebody else.<br/>
After all, the person who actually made the film has a great interest in what happens to it. It might strengthen his hand in any future negotiations if he could say, "My last film made such and such an amount and received so much from the fund". I hope very much that we can have this assurance.<br/>
That may seem to be a small point, but it is one which I believe to be of considerable importance to certain individuals. The whole purpose of these Regulations is to assist the makers of British films. I hope, therefore, that on that small point we may have a satisfactory reply from the Parliamentary Secretary. Apart from these relatively minor matters, we on this side support the Regulations.</p>

<p>I should like briefly to support the earlier remarks made by the hon. Lady the Member for Flint, East (Mrs. White). While we all welcome the general agreement on the levy, there are some cinemas which are above the &#x00A3;150 limit which were previously exempt from the levy, but which now will have to pay it and will be considerably affected. As there are so few cases, I wonder whether my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary will look sympathetically at them.<br/>
There is one such cinema which serves part of my constituency. It has a seating capacity of 2,000 and runs the "second run" films. Previously, this cinema was exempt from the levy, but it will now have to pay the statutory levy. There are very few such cinemas. If the Minister will consider them and help them if possible, I shall be grateful, along with those others who are similarly affected.</p>

<p>I shall detain the House for only a few moments in elaborating the point concerning the larger cinema whose takings, although they may be a little above &#x00A3;150 a week, are still insufficient to sustain the standing charges. Those cinemas may, by reason of wages to staff, rent and rates and the usual outgoings, require to take more than &#x00A3;150 before they can break even. Under the old voluntary scheme, the renters made concessions by reducing the film hire for this type of cinema, but if a reduction in film hire was inadequate and the cinema was still unable to pay its way under the voluntary scheme, no action was taken to collect the film levy.<br/>
It is quite apparent that the producers and renters together have an interest in keeping the cinema alive. If they waive a certain part of the film hire, the cinema is able to make sufficient money to keep going and a certain amount of the takings eventually flows back into the production end of the trade. If we look at the problem in the inflexible way that the Regulations treat it, there will be no ground for concession; the full levy has to be exacted from the cinema irrespective of its standing charges and, at the


same time, there is not the encouragement to the renter to make a concession.<br/>
I hope that my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary will reconsider this matter. He might possibly suggest that one body, either the B.F.P.A. or some other body, could examine the accounts of the cinemas and if it appears that the payment of the levy is causing a cinema to lose money every week, possibly concessions could be made by waiving the levy. At the same time, a certain responsibility rests upon the trade itself in the intervening period. The end of the trade of which I am thinking is the production end and the renters. They could continue to make some form of concession in film hire to these cinemas in the hope that my hon. Friend might come to their rescue later.</p>

<p>The hon. Lady the Member for Flint, East (Mrs. White) remarked upon the brevity of my opening remarks. She will, I am sure, appreciate that I intended no discourtesy to the House. I wished to refer particularly to the points contained in the Regulations, knowing full well that there might he matters lying to one side of the Regulations which might be raised by hon. Members and that in my opening remarks I could not exactly anticipate which points might be raised.<br/>
I should like to deal, first, with the question of exemptions for individual larger cinemas. We examined very carefully the possibilities of providing some sort of an exemption scheme for the special case of the larger cinema which is faring badly at the present time. We received conflicting views on the matter and we came to the conclusion that the disadvantages of such a scheme as was outlined, for example, by the hon. Lady would outweigh the advantages.<br/>
We feel that while in the future there may still be cases of individual difficulty, they should be substantially reduced for the reasons which I shall give. First, the exemption limit has been raised from &#x00A3;150 gross to approximately &#x00A3;190 gross. Then, there has been a reduction in the levy on the cheaper seats and also a reduction in Entertainments Duty. The new levy and duty scales are so designed to enable cinemas to retain a larger proportion of the increase in seat prices than was formerly the case in a great many instances.

There are signs, if one is to judge by the trade Press, that there may well be increases in the prices of seats in the coming months which will enable those cinemas which are particularly hard hit to take advantage of a general advance, small though it may be, in seat prices.<br/>
We feel, therefore, that those cinemas which, in the past have been hard hit and those which have had some measure of relief from the special scheme operated under the voluntary scheme should think not only on the basis of past earnings and outgoings, but should make a reassessment of the likely trend of events in the coming months based on the considerations which I have just given. I would only add that we fully understand the difficulties which the cinemas have been experiencing, but after thinking the matter over carefully we feel that for the time being at least we should wait to see how the Regulations work out in practice.<br/>
The hon. Lady referred to the fact that the levy changes will in future years take place in October, whereas Budget changes arise in April, and that this might cause difficulty. We have to remember that the starting date of 20th October was chosen because the trade-operated scheme was due to come to an end in that month. By choosing any other date, we should have had to accept the consequences either of a hiatus between the end of one scheme and the beginning of another or of overlapping. So that it was surely worth while to make the new scheme start where the old scheme left off. In any case, it is surely desirable to avoid linking the levy with Entertainments Duty.</p>

<p>I thought that the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Battersea, North (Mr. Jay) would not be able to resist making a crack like that, but he was well answered by the Economic Secretary earlier today. The eventuality that the right hon. Gentleman describes is not likely to occur.<br/>
The next matter the hon. Lady mentioned was that of payment for second feature films. As hon. Members will know those films, like short films, are let for a fixed sum instead of on the basis of a percentage of the box office takings, as are first feature films. It was suggested in some quarters that the earnings


of second feature films should be multiplied by two, and their share of the levy should be calculated in much the same way as is that of short films, whose earnings are multiplied by two and a half.<br/>
I will admit straight away that the arguments for and against are fairly finely balanced. The arguments in favour of special consideration for second feature films are that there is a great demand by cinema patrons and exhibitors for the long supporting films and that their production has become uneconomic owing to increased costs of production at a time when there is less money available for supporting programme features. This, in turn, has led to a serious drop in second feature film production so that second feature films are simply not available in sufficient quantity. A larger levy for second feature films would assist such production. That is how the arguments run.<br/>
I will now put the arguments on the other side. On the other side we feel that the solution of the problem is best left to the economic forces in the trade. If second feature films are really in great public demand we think the public will be willing to pay a little more for the longer programmes these films make possible, and this, in turn, will enable higher rents to be obtained for second feature films. Alternatively, if the public tends to stay away because of the absence or poor quality of the supporting programmes it must be in the interest of the exhibitor and supplier to ensure that the production of second feature films becomes a paying proposition and that second feature films get a proper economic rental.<br/>
It is questionable whether a multiplier of two would have the effect the hon. Lady has suggested, because it is quite likely that in present conditions of financial stringency rents for second feature films would be forced down by exhibitors on the ground that those films were now getting substantially increased contributions from the levy. That would mean that the producers of second feature films could not get so much by way of letting. Indeed, the experience of the producers of short films would seem to bear that out. So, after considering the pros and cons very carefully, we have come to the conclusion that it will be better to provide no special payment for this class of film.<br/>
As for television films, we did take very carefully into account the views put forward most strongly by the trade that the levy on cinemas should not be used to assist the production of television films. We realise, however, that this may well be a growing market, and we feel that the regulations as framed are probably right for the time being. We are keeping very closely in touch with the development of television film production and of films suitable for showing on television, and we shall make quite certain that we are not left behind in this important matter.<br/>
Another matter which was raised was that of the publication of details of levy payments. I should make it plain that the Board of Trade has no power to compel the Agency to publish details of payments, but we appreciate that the problem is a difficult one. I would only say that the Agency has been in operation for only a very short time, and that I am sure that it will be guided by the views of the House and of other interested parties in deciding in its discretion whether it should make any publication of individual figures.</p>

<p>There are really two separate issues. One is that of the figures for all recipients should be made public. The other is that the individual maker of a film should be given information if he personally asks for it though it need not necessarily be made available to the general public.</p>

<p>I am grateful to the hon. Lady. I had been thinking of the general question. I appreciate that her suggestion is a different one.

<q>That the Draft Wool Textile Industry (Export Promotion Levy) Order, 1957, a copy of which was laid before this House on 24th May, be approved.</q>
I think. Mr. Speaker, that it would be convenient to consider this and the following Order together.</p>

<p>The purpose of the latter Order is to increase the yield of the Research Levy from about &#x00A3;155,000 to about &#x00A3;200,000 and to make some minor alterations in the range of persons liable to pay the levy so as to bring it more into accord with the present conditions and current developments in the industry. We are also taking the opportunity of making this a consolidation Order, and it will replace earlier Orders on this levy.<br/>
The money is required to provide for additional capital expenditure by the Wool Industry Research Association and to meet increased costs since the levy was introduced. The Wool Textile Research Council also wishes to increase its grants to other bodies carrying out research. As hon. Members will know, the Board of Trade has to satisfy itself about the case submitted by the Wool Textile Delegation, which represents about 85 per cent. of the industry, and which has in this case asked for the increase in the rates of levy. We are so satisfied. We know that it is also supported by the great majority of the firms in the industry, and, I would add, by the organisations of employees in the industry, although I think it would be only fair to mention that the support is not completely unanimous and that a very small number of firms and organisations expressed objections. However, in our opinion there was not sufficient objection to justify refusal of the request made by the Wool Textile Delegation.<br/>
The first of the two Orders increases the yield of the parallel Export Promotion Levy from about &#x00A3;115,000 a year to about &#x00A3;200,000 a year. This is to meet increased costs and to build up the promotion of sales in North America. It is

also proposed to introduce sales promotion campaigns in the other export markets and to exhibit at certain important trade fairs and exhibitions.<br/>
As a result of statutory consultations, as with the other Order, we have found a large majority of firms in favour of the increase. It was also supported by organisations of employees in the industry. As with the other Order, there were a very small number of objections, but we do not feel that they were sufficiently serious to refuse the request of the Wool Textile Delegation. Accordingly, I hope that the House will see its way to approve the Orders.</p>

<p>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak about these two Orders because we in the Opposition have a high regard for the wool textile industry which is so important to our exports. As I am personally engaged in the industry and have been so engaged all my life, I am proud to have this opportunity. The Order dealing with the export promotion levy is designed to increase the amount of promotion that we want to do. We want to do more in the North American countries, the United States and Canada, because it is there that we earn our dollars. We who are engaged in this industry convert a sterling area commodity into dollars and last year we exported to Canada and the United States &#x00A3;42 million worth of goads.<br/>
We have the highest record in exports of any manufacturing industry, and anything that is introduced in the House which has to do with expanding our exports is of great importance to us. This is a good industry and one well worth while looking after. We do not come to the Board of Trade on any slight pretext. It is only when we have something serious to say, as the Parliamentary Secretary will have found in his experience, that we ever come to any Government Department to ask for assistance. We have asked for the good offices of the Board of Trade in collecting this levy for us so that we can use it as we think best.<br/>
I have the greatest faith in those who operate the National Wool Textile Export Corporation. They are a first-class body of business men who are selfless in their desire to see an expansion of worsted and


wool exports for the whole of the trade. Throughout the years that I have had experience with them I have always found them keen and energetic and never neglecting to further the interests of the trade.<br/>
We in the trade also want to do a little more in terms of taking part in various fairs and exhibitions. We have not done quite enough in the last year or two. As the Parliamentary Secretary has said, there has been some division of opinion about the importance of fairs and exhibitions in the promotion of overseas trade. Our industry is composed of firms which are small in comparison with large-scale industry elsewhere. The majority of the firms employ from 10 to 500 employees and the specialities produced by these small firms are peculiar to their own individual traditions.<br/>
Naturally, therefore, there is some contention as to whether exhibitions are of use or not but I would remind sections of our industry which may not be as enthusiastic about the promotion of our goods as are some others that if it were left to individual firms to do it, in all probability very little would be done. It is only by securing a levy of this kind that the money can be guaranteed, because this promotion is a heavy responsibility.<br/>
We in the industry are proud that the Board of Trade has chosen the wool industry along with the aeronautic industry, the atomic energy industry, and the tourist trade to represent Britain in the exhibition of world trade in New York in April next year. We are also proud that we have the backing of the Board of Trade for a curtain-raiser in Brussels next year for anything that there may be in the future by way of a European Common Market. We are proposing to spend about &#x00A3;50,000 on one exhibition there in furtherance of our trade. The Parliamentary Secretary will be aware of the success that we had in Frankfurt last year and this year, and how, as a result, we have expanded our sales, despite increasing competition in Germany from elsewhere during the last two years.<br/>
I should like to stress at this juncture that the Board of Trade, and the economists who advise it, should not pay too much attention to those who think that

the old-established industries in this country can be jeopardised or be expended in favour of the newer, more fashionable industries which are in the news today. It may interest the House to know that when the Parliamentary and Scientific Committee paid a recent visit to the National Physical Laboratory and we saw there "Deuce" and "Ace", the great new electronic computers and we asked the head of the department how long it would be before other countries could imitate and make computers of the same size and be ready to put them on the market, he said that our lead was about three years. If that is the case, in view of how good imitators such people as the Japanese are, it can be assumed that in a few years' time what are considered today to be new and exciting industries may be in a position similar to that of some of our old-established industries in having to resist competition. I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to convey to everybody in the Government who has anything to do with the problems we are confronting in the older industries, that we must fight for every bit of trade we have got, and that it does not matter whether we are old industries or new. On that basis we in the wool textile industry are playing our part.<br/>
There is another activity supported by the levy, that is, the protection of our trade in countries where our interests may be threatened by tariffs or quotas. Nowadays the way in which we export our woollens and our worsteds means that we cannot accompany every consignment ourselves, as was done in the days of my great-great grandfather. Then they used to take their woollens from our district on the deck of a sailing ship and they slept on top of the bale, with their heads sticking out from the tarpaulin which covered them. And they had a way with them, because I understand that many complaints were made in New York about the way in which folks from our district used to look after their own interests.<br/>
We can no longer do it as individuals because the trade is on far too big a scale, so somebody has to do it for us, and that is the Wool Textile Corporation for which this levy is required. If it were not for the Wool Textile Corporation there perhaps would not be as energetic an opposition as there is to the present imposition that the United States has inflicted on our trade.<br/>
The services of people overseas, which cost money, have been brought in during the last year or two on account of the American quota. We regret that quota very much. As soon as there is 5 per cent. of the domestic manufacture imported the tariff goes up from 25 per cent, to 45 per cent., which puts our fine products at a disadvantage. The Japanese, who have imitated our more plain manufactures, find it easier than we do to get their cloths into the United States market because they are more straight-forward to make and the finer and more craftsmanlike cloths we produce are longer in the making. Thus the quota is filled, and cancellations of our orders takes place.<br/>
Another thing I want to mention is that many people in the industry have been trying to persuade the wool technicians and the Export Corporation that it might be a good thing if we started promotion for home sales. If the Parliamentary Secretary has been in on any of these negotiations or talks with the industry, I dare say he will have found that this has been mentioned. Personally I am against it. I think we ought to concentrate all our activities in promotion for some years ahead on the export market. It will take us all our time and it will take all the money we have to do that, and to do it properly. The disadvantage we happen to be in is that ours is the only textile which is subject to a 10 per cent. Purchase Tax on the piece. It would be a pity if the money we are raising for this promotion scheme were diverted at some future time to the promotion of home sales, because we suffer a disadvantage through that taxation.<br/>
The levy is straightforward, we welcome it, it is needed. I think that we shall need more, and perhaps it would have been as well if the levy had been cast a little higher for this job, bearing in mind the way in which the value of the &#x00A3; seems to be declining over the years.<br/>
I have not a great deal to say on the research side. I wish I could be as complimentary as I have been on export promotion but, unfortunately, I cannot. I have had experience of this business for a long time now and my interests in the textile industry have spread beyond the narrow confines of the wool textile industry itself. I believe that the time has come when there should be a recasting of the methods employed in

research into the textile industry. For instance, there is too much duplication of effort. We find that research associations are spending small amounts on the same jobs, because there is not enough liaison. The original conception of research, as outlined at the time when the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research was set up, may need a new fillip and an altogether new idea.<br/>
I believe that complacency has set in and that it is likely to become even more pronounced. I shall not oppose the Order because the money is needed if this is the course on which we are set, but I do not think it is the right one, so I appeal to the Government to look at it again. There could be more liaison, the money could be used better if one job common to the whole range of the textile industry could be done in one place, backed by adequate money, and the research stations could carry on with the day-to-day work they do for the firms they serve. As I say, we do not oppose the Order, but I have taken the opportunity to draw attention to something which is likely to be an urgent need in the future.</p>

<p>I beg to move,
<q>That the Channel Islands (Church Legislation) Measure, 1931 (Amendment) Measure, 1957, passed by the National Assembly of the Church of England, be presented to Her Majesty for Her Royal Assent in the form in which the said Measure was laid before Parliament.</q>
As hon. Members know, the Channel Islands are for ecclesiastical purposes in the Diocese of Winchester, but constitutionally they have a position peculiar to themselves. In consequence, Church Assembly Measures would not affect them unless special machinery existed for applying them to the Islands. Such machinery was set up by a Measure passed in 1931. However, this Measure contained certain limitations on the time within which the machinery which is set up could be used.<br/>
These time limits are now thought to be generally unnecessary, and the object of this short Measure is to remove them. There is also a particular reason for their removal. It is necessary to form

a new parish in the Island of Jersey. The obvious way of doing it would be under the provisions of the New Parishes Measure, 1943, if that Measure had applied to the Islands. Unfortunately, throughout the period when it could have been applied, the Islands were in German occupation. If the time limits are removed, it will be possible to take the necessary steps to apply the Measure and so allow the new parish to be formed.<br/>
The Measure has been approved by the States of Deliberation of the Islands and by the Decanal Conferences of the Islands. It passed through all its stages in the Assembly without a division and no amendment was made or proposed. I hope that the House will feel that this is a Measure to which it can give its assent.</p>

<p>I acknowledge with appreciation the presence of the right hon. Gentleman the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. The issue I want to raise is that of the methods of disposal by his Ministry of 19,000 tons, or 167 million tins, of full cream, unsweetened milk, declared surplus to requirements after the end of control in March, 1954, and, in particular, the totally inadequate provisions which were adopted to ensure the enforcement of the conditions for the protection of the public which the right hon. Gentleman and his Ministry thought necessary at the time.<br/>
This milk was sold under covenant which declared that it should not be sold through the retail trade and that it should be sold only for manufacturing purposes, for animal feeding, or for export. Only too late it was discovered that the covenant was valueless, that it did not run with the goods, and, therefore, could not be passed further than the person with whom the covenant was made. It has been found that perhaps millions of these tins have got into the hands of third parties over whom the Minister has no control.<br/>
This has caused considerable embarrassment to the manufacturers concerned and has allowed a flood of this sort of commodity on to the market purporting to be fresh milk. The public has been invited to buy the milk, not realising that some of it may be three or four years old. I want to ask the right hon. Gentleman why it was not foreseen that the covenant would be completely valueless and unenforceable over third parties, where it required to be enforceable, and why the tins were not marked, or the milk not bulked, as was finally necessary with the remainder of the milk, when it was put on the market.<br/>
I admit that since I and other hon. Members raised the matter the appalling complexity of the position has been made clear. In a supplementary question on 4th April, I said that a firm, Messrs. George Mence Smith, Ltd., was involved

in this sort of transaction. The firm has now told me that it has never purchased from the Ministry of Food or from any other Government Department or any agency stocks of tinned milk of doubtful age or unfit for human consumption, and it has said most emphatically that it would never even contemplate retailing such goods to the public for consumption. I am very happy to have that assurance and glad to pass it on to the House.<br/>
However, it is common ground and acknowledged by the right hon. Gentleman that this milk is on the market and at this very moment is on sale to the public and still purporting to be fresh milk when it may be very old. From my constituency have come reports of cases of such milk produced in 1953 on sale as milk which the manufacturers would not regard as fresh milk. Analysis has shown it to be discoloured and the tins etched with rust, a fairly clear indication, apart from the manufacturers' views, of age.<br/>
Since the matter was first raised, with all the difficulties of proof, a case has been determined in the Queen's Bench Division of the High Court where Mr. Justice Stable in the case of the <i>United Dairies v. Thomas Robinson, Sons &amp;amp; Co. Ltd.</i> declared that it was a misrepresentation to sell as fresh milk, milk which was older than six months.<br/>
In reply to a series of Questions in April the Minister undertook to make inquiries and to consider what action could be taken for the enforcement of the covenants and the protection of the public at that time and in the future. He said that it was possible that some of these firms would be barred from receiving future supplies from his Ministry. I should like to know what steps, if any, the right hon. Gentleman has taken to enforce this covenant in any case, if there are any cases, and what firms have been barred from receiving supplies of this sort, either of milk or of other commodities.<br/>
I know that in my constituency, apart from the supplies from the Ministry, there are fairly substantial quantities of defective canned foods available in the shops. Quite recently a local authority in northwest Kent applied to the magistrates for, and got, an order for the destruction of


some of those foods. It is suspected by some of those authorities that, although most of these foods are not from the Ministry, some of them are. I would ask the right hon. Gentleman what other foods of this kind have been disposed of to firms under covenants similar to those in respect of the tinned milk to which I have been referring.<br/>
It is extremely unfortunate that when this House has spent such a long time discussing pure and clean food the Government, through the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, should allow these quantities of food to be placed on the market and so make it much more difficult for local authorities, at least morally, to enforce the regulations for clean food and the protection of the public.<br/>
I would ask the Minister if he has taken any steps to protect the public in this way, and especially if he will notify local authorities of the precise details of all foods which have been supplied and which were defective in this way&#x2014;not necessarily unfit for human consumption but in any way defective, in the sense that they were at least stale. I should like him particularly to notify local authorities of the makes, the brands and the code numbers of such supplies, so that the public health inspectors may be alerted to the dangers that exist and keep a careful watch upon public protection. It is a very serious matter that this vast quantity of food should be on the market and that the degree of protection of the public to be expected from a Government Department should not be properly provided.</p>

<p>The matter which the hon. Member for Dartford (Mr. Sydney Irving) has raised is a perfectly legitimate and proper one for examination. I am glad of this opportunity to say a few words about the disposal of this tinned milk, so that I may correct one or two misconceptions which have crept in, and also, perhaps, allay certain of the fears that have been expressed about this milk not being fit for human consumption.<br/>
In 1954 the Government decided to free the condensed milk trade and at that time my Department was left with very con-

siderable stocks. Since then it has disposed, as the hon. Member said, of 167 million tins. I thought that the hon. Member said "tons" but it is "tins."</p>

<p>I said 19,000 tons&#x2014;or 167 million tins.</p>

<p>I misunderstood the hon. Member. That is a very considerable quantity, but I think that we have disposed of it in a sensible and proper manner. The first thing we did at the time of decontrol was to offer this milk back to the original manufacturers, on the ground that we thought that the original manufacturers would be in the best position to dispose of it with the minimum disturbance to the trade, and also, as they would have their pride in the quality of their brand and their label, that that would be the best and most effective way of safeguarding the consumers' interest. More than half the stocks of 167 million tins were disposed of in this way. As far as that part of the condensed milk goes probably everything was all right.</p>

<p>Can the Minister give us some indication of the price at which these stocks were disposed of?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1957-07-11a.628.3" speakerid="unknown" speakername="Mr. Amory" colnum="628" time="">
<p>As I have said before, it has never been the practice to disclose the price at which commercial stocks have been disposed of individually. For commercial reasons, only aggregate figures are given. So I am not in a position to give the precise prices at which the various lots of this milk were disposed of.<br/>
The quantity that remained, which was less than half the total quantity, represented entirely condensed milk manufactured between 1952 and 1954, and not the old wartime supplies. At that time the Department told the manufacturers that it proposed to dispose of this milk with as little loss to the taxpayers as possible but that, at the same time, it did not want to do anything to disrupt the trade to such an extent that the interruption would interfere with the trade taking fresh condensed milk made from the surplus milk at the time of the annual spring flush.<br/>
It was, therefore, agreed that any sales from the Department's stocks would be subject to a condition excluding sales through retail channels on the home market. So, as the hon. Member has said, these stocks were sold either for


export or for use in manufacture, or for stockfeed. In each case my Department required its customers to give an undertaking that the milk would be used in one of those ways.<br/>
That was quite a normal and not an exceptional procedure for the disposal of stocks, the quality of which we could not warrant absolutely. We tried stripping the tins of their labels, but we found that this was an extremely costly business, which would be justified only if it were necessary in order to safeguard public health.<br/>
It has been said that in spite of these undertakings some of this milk has, in fact, found its way on to the retail market. I have no evidence as to the precise quantities, but I should be extremely surprised if the quantity that has found its way on to the retail market was anything like as considerable as the hon. Member implied, although there is some circumstantial evidence that some may have done.</p>

<p>I would ask the right hon. Gentleman if he denies the evidence given in the High Court, which led to a successful application by United Dairies in the case of <i>United Dairies v. Thomas Robinson, Sons &amp;amp; Co. Ltd.,</i> which was concerned with the issue of that sort of milk. The evidence is available.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1957-07-11a.629.1" speakerid="unknown" speakername="Mr. Amory" colnum="629" time="">
<p>I should be glad to look into that point, but my information is that, while there is circumstantial evidence that some of the milk has got on to the market, there is no evidence that the quantity is at all considerable. However, many people, including hon. Members, have been rightly concerned lest the public should buy this tinned milk in the belief that it is freshly made.<br/>
When the matter was last raised in the House I gave assurances that I would have inquiries made, and I should like to explain to the House the legal position as revealed by those inquiries. The manufacturers of this milk gave a warranty of six months in respect of sweetened milk and twelve months for unsweetened&#x2014;evaporated&#x2014;milk when they sold it to the Ministry. After that they took no responsibility for the condition of the milk. This is not tantamount to saying that the milk is unfit for human consumption after the period of the warranty has expired. It is in fact normally

quite wholesome for a number of years&#x2014;so I am advised&#x2014;the period depending upon the original type and quality of the milk and how it was stored. After a time, however, it can undoubtedly develop what might be called minor defects.<br/>
These minor defects would not, however, render the milk unfit for human consumption. They would render it unattractive by, for example, discolouration. It tends to turn a rather darker colour, and, in the case of sweetened milk, some of the sugar may sink to the bottom of the tin. In some cases small particles of the milk fat can separate and spoil the appearance of the milk. If storage has not been good, the tins show signs of rusting. It would obviously be wrong for the Government to sell milk which may be of that nature for the counter trade, not because of any risk to health, but because of the harm that might unwittingly be done to the good name of the original manufacturer who would normally sell the milk before it reached that condition.<br/>
I am advised that a trader who sold milk to the public, despite the undertaking he had entered into, would be acting illegally if the milk proved upon analysis to be unfit for human consumption when it was sold by him, or if the sale could be shown to be to the prejudice of the purchaser because the milk was not of the nature, substance or quality demanded by the purchaser. The latter might be the case if the trader had altered or re-labelled the tins in such a way as to misrepresent the contents. Those are the circumstances in which the breaking of the undertaking would be illegal. Of course, someone believed to have broken his undertaking could be proceeded against by civil action, but in that case damages would have to be proved.<br/>
To safeguard the public against danger in the first case we made a practice&#x2014;this answers the question asked by the hon. Gentleman&#x2014;of notifying local health and food and drug authorities in all the districts in which sales were made for animal feeding purposes. As a result, many samples were taken from the tins, but in no case that I have heard of was the milk found to be unfit for human consumption. Local authorities have,


therefore, found no grounds for proceeding against the sellers on that account. The second offence, that of re-labelling deliberately, leading to misrepresentation, is one of a criminal nature, and the law for dealing with it already exists. Indeed, a prosecution was successfully brought by the police against certain persons found to have forged fascimiles of well-known labels and to have affixed them to tins of milk bought from my Department. The offence consisted not of selling the milk, but of forging the labels.<br/>
I believe that in this matter we have proceeded sensibly and reasonably. Though we have taken all the steps open to us to trace deliberate breaking of the undertakings, in the cases that we have investigated we have not found anything that could amount to proof of a deliberate breaking of it. We have gone into this question thoroughly, as indeed we ought to do. So far as we can discover, there has never been any question of danger to public health at all. My Department took what I believe were reasonable steps to ensure that the milk should not be offered for ordinary retail sale, and if,

in fact, some tins have found their way into the retail trade, as I think there is circumstantial evidence for believing, they can have amounted to only an extremely small proportion of the very large quantities involved and no risk to public health has resulted.</p>
