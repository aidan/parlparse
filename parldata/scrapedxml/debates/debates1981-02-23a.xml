<p>It is not my place, especially after recent events, to comment on press speculation. I accept the point that my hon. Friend has made about price being a key factor in energy conservaton, but we have no immediate plans to introduce an energy conservation agency. The possibility of establishing an energy conservation agency has been considered in the Department, but only as one possible option for developing the Government's conservation strategy. I agree with the importance of ensuring effective co-ordination of energy conservation policy. My Department already carries out that function. Establishing an energy conservation agency is not the only or necessarily the best way forward.</p>

<p>The Government have made that clear by their large programme of help to those in need. There is a major &#x00A3;200 million-plus programme of help to those in need. That shows the Government's keen concern for those aspects of social, as opposed to energy, policy.</p>

<p>I understand my hon.

<p>It was agreed at the NEDC meeting in January that British industry generally was not at a disadvantage compared with its international competitors over energy costs. The Government have made clear their concern that certain energy-intensive industries are having to pay more for their energy than some of their counterparts overseas. If the pound continued to strengthen against European currencies, it could lead to increasing disparities in energy prices in sterling terms. The NEDC task force will shortly be reporting on the current situation for large users.</p>

<p>Will my right hon. Friend ensure that it becomes better known than it is at present that industrial energy prices on the Continent have risen at least as fast as they have in this country? That is not generally realised. When considering special measures to assist high energy users, will he take into account the fact that those include not only industries such as steel, but certain parts of the textile industry, even though they do not have the same pull as the steel industry?</p>

<p>The concern of the NEDC task force is with the high load and large users, where it seems to be agreed that disparities may exist, but I understand my hon. Friend's question. The first part of his question is correct. All over the world, and indeed in many European countries, energy prices have been rising at a faster rate than they have here. We have had a huge oil price explosion, the shock waves of which are going through all industrial systems throughout the world.</p>

<p>Does the right hon. Gentleman accept that the weight of evidence being produced by several industries, including those mentioned by the hon. Member for Brighouse and Spenborough (Mr. Waller), is overwhelmingly in support of the view that our industry is being unfairly discriminated against on energy pricing? Why are the Government continuously prevaricating on the matter? When may we have a definitive statement on their policies?</p>

<p>The NEDC task force was set up to identify the precise areas where allegations and beliefs proved to be more than just feelings and were facts. As was recognised by the Government a considerable time ago, there are disparities for bulk users. As I mentioned in my original answer, the continual movement of the pound makes the disparities even harder and greater in some cases. That has been recognised. That is why the task force was set up, and the Government have said that they will respond when they see the exact nature of the problem.</p>

<p>Does my right hon. Friend agree that, among our international competitors, the French are making great progress in keeping down the rise in electricity prices by the use of nuclear power? Will he take this early opportunity to rebut the findings of our Select Committee in that respect?</p>

<speech hansard_id="1803012" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1981-02-23a.637.2" hansard_membership_id="6027" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/29046" speakername="Mr. Howell" colnum="637" time="">
<p>I do not want to take this opportunity to comment on the Select Committee's report, which is being studied closely by the Government. My hon. Friend makes a valid point. The cost structure of an electricity industry with a growing nuclear component and a large hydroelectric component is bound to be increasingly favourable in future. That is why the Government believe that we should have a modest, but expanding, nuclear programme.</p>

<p>The Secretary of State should not come to the Dispatch Box and be so bland and complacent on issues that are of serious importance to the whole of our industry. When will the NEDC report emerge? With each week that goes by, companies lose vital export orders as a result of energy prices. Will the right hon. Gentleman confess not only that he forced up gas prices to domestic consumers by more than the British Gas Corporation wanted last year, but that he insisted that it should impose higher increases on industrial consumers? Will he take on board the arguments from both sides of the House that industry is seriously affected by the Government's energy policy?</p>

<p>The answer to the hon. Gentleman's first question is that the report is expected on about 4 March. On the second question, the BGC's industrial energy policy is determined by economic pricing principles, which the Government adhere to and which are in accordance with the corporation's own policy and aims in industrial energy. Domestic energy prices are about half those in France and Germany. That is generally recognised by industry, which has urged that those prices should rise even faster. I have resisted that, because I believe that the proposed rate of increase is substantial. However, industry was pressing me to do even more.</p>

<p>The undertaking that I gave in a recent Scottish Television programme related to statements made about the Universal Services International. My officials have taken these up with the company, which has now

<p>Does the hon.

<p>The hon. Gentleman has a weakness for overstating his case. To put the matter in perspective, it is worth pointing out that of all those employed on the United Kingdom continental shelf, 92 per cent. are United Kingdom nationals. The company in question has a very good record on procurement. It buys practically all its supplies within the Aberdeen area. In addition, 65 per cent. of its personnel operating out of Aberdeen are United Kingdom nationals. I have no comment to make about those who have been taken on by the company away from the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>Is the right hon.

Will he bear that in mind when he has the investment talks&#x2014;I read in the papers that there is to be a meeting on Wednesday&#x2014;and seek to introduce legislation immediately to amend the Coal Industry Act 1980 and to deal with the importing of coal?

<p>There is no need for legislation. I should make it clear that there is no question of having a general system of import controls. I do not like import controls. What is being proposed is that the NCB should have the resources to price more of its coal competitively with the imports being brought in by the CEGB and the BSC and thus help to reduce imports towards the irreducible minimum. That is what the Government have said that they will discuss with an open mind towards movement next Wednesday.<br/>
The undertaking at the Venice agreement was that there should be a doubling of coal production in the next 10


years. The vast bulk of that will come from the United States, Canada and Australia. Britain is by far the best performer, almost in the world, in terms of coal burn in electricity and coal use for electricity generation. We are well ahead on that.</p>

<p>Is my right hon. Friend aware that funds for highly profitable, low-cost pits will not be available if money goes to some of the uneconomic pits'?

<p>The implication of my hon. Friend's question is correct. The long-term interests of the industry, which has a great future, lie in investment in modern pits and effective investment in new faces in existing pits. As it is an extractive industry, that inevitably involves a degree of closures as well. That has always been recognised by both sides of the industry and it is the basis on which we shall plan a common sense future together.</p>

<p>Is the right hon. Gentleman aware that during the past 10 years, pits have closed on the basis of having no further reserves, and not on the basis of being uneconomic at a particular time? Pits that are uneconomic at one time could become economic later. Will he confirm that the irreducible minimum of imports will be 1 million tonnes, as suggested by Sir Derek Ezra on the night of the concession made by the Government' Will the right hon. Gentleman explain how long it will take to reach that figure? That is very important for the miners.

<p>The reduction of imports by the CEGB and the BSC will be discussed with the industry next Wednesday. It is right that that matter should be discussed in the tripartite forum in a common sense atmosphere.

The Government are waiting for the conclusions of the NEDC task force, which will be available on about 4 March. They will then formulate their response. The hon. Gentleman referred to feedstock.

<p>The hon. Gentleman is not right. Many matters have to be clarified. The hon. Gentleman referred to the case made by the steel industry. One point that emerged from the evidence of the steel industry on energy prices was that the utilities in this country had, over two years, put up their prices by rather less than the


Continental countries had done. When the exchange rate factor was taken into account, a different picture emerged. It is not so simple as the hon. Gentleman says. We recognise that industry has problems when there are bulk buyers. We have asked the utilities to prepare proposals, to which the Government have referred on previous occasions.</p>

The hon. Gentleman is quite right in what he says about the general public. The container weighs about 241b, it has a diameter of 7 in, it is painted bright orange and it is marked with the words "radioactive material". I am informed that with the unit closed and at a metre range, the dosage rate is insignificant. The danger could arise if the inner container holding the radioactive material were to get out.

<p>I thank my hon. Friend for his questions. Both the Ministry of Defence CID and the Fife CID are very much involved in looking for the container. They are being assisted by staff of the health physics department and staff of HMS "Revenge", which is in the dockyard, as well as by other people in the dockyard itself. A major effort

is going on to try to track down the whereabouts of the container. The board of inquiry itself is making official inquiries. I am satisfied about the effort being made.<br/>
As for whether the breaking of the seal would help detection, the radioactive source would be exposed. Therefore, special equipment is being used so that if the seal is broken the radioactivity can be detected.<br/>
As for immersion in sea water, I am informed that a stainless steel inner shield, which protects the radioactive source itself, would not corrode for many years. Therefore, there would be no dispersion of radioactivity in the sea water and no danger to animal or marine life.</p>

I am sure that the hon. Gentleman, who is normally fair in these matters, will not wish to anticipate its findings either. I was informed last week.<br/>
Coming back to the earlier question, we do not yet know; it is true that it was on 5 February, on a routine muster as part of the security arrangements, that the container was first found to be missing. I would not wish to go any further at this stage, because we must see what the board of inquiry, which will be pursuing the matter with considerable vigour, has found out for itself.</p>

<p>I cannot tell my hon. Friend what the strength is in curies specifically. There are various amounts of radiation, depending on whether the radioactive source is touched directly on the inner stainless steel container within which it is sealed or whether it is touched on the outer lead container.<br/>
For example, contact with the surface of the closed container&#x2014;the closed container would have to be opened with a special tool to get at the inside stainless steel container&#x2014;would give a dosage of 20 to 30 millirems per hour. If the container were actually held, it would take 16 hours for the legal dosage for one year to be reached. On the other hand, if the container were opened, the dosage rate would be 1,200 millirems per hour, and it would take about three hours to reach the legal dosage for a year. So my answer depends very much on the circumstances. That is why it is important that anyone finding the container should not interfere with it but should leave it well inside so that the appropriate arrangements can be made for it to be rendered safe.</p>

<p>There has been some suggestion in the press that there was considerable delay in informing the local police on this matter. Will the Minister comment on that? If it is true, it is of course worrying. Secondly, even if this container may not be particularly dangerous&#x2014;unless it is opened, of course&#x2014;its disappearance raises considerable questions about security at the dockyard. May we be assured,


therefore, that the board of inquiry is looking into the widest question of security there and not just this disappearance?</p>

I am not aware of any great delay in informing the civilian police. However, in the first instance the Ministry of Defence CID was informed. It started its inquiries and then extended them to bring in civilian police. All those matters will be covered by the board of inquiry.</p>

On Friday last, 20 February, the hon. Member for Liverpool, Toxteth (Mr. Crawshaw) submitted to me his resignation as Second Deputy Chairman of Ways and Means, and also as Deputy Speaker. I believe that the whole House would like me to express sincere gratitude to the hon. Gentleman for the distinguished and honourable way in which he has served the House as Deputy Speaker. He maintained the historic traditions of the Chair with complete impartiality. On behalf of the Deputy Speakers and myself, I wish to place on record our personal gratitude.</p>

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. On previous occasions I have complained that the House appears to be the last place where information is given. Yesterday the Secretary of State for Trade made some quite extraordinary and frank admissions about changes in Government policy. If the House is not to be treated with contempt, a Minister, or one of his ministerial colleagues, should make a statement about such important matters. Why should such statements be made simply on television? Why should not Ministers come to the House and say what is intended&#x2014;</p>

<p>I beg to ask leave to move the Adjournment of the House, under Standing Order No. 9, for the purpose of discussing a specific and important matter that should have urgent consideration, namely,
<q>the threatened closure of the Courtaulds factory at Aintree, with the loss of 1,550 jobs.</q>
It is clearly a specific matter. It concerns one factory, which is to be closed not because it has a poor industrial relations record, not because it is producing an inferior product, not even because it is uncompetitive, but simply because it is being crippled by the criminally insane and callous economic policies pursued by probably the most bigoted and callous Government of the past few decades.<br/>
The closure of the factory and the ending of Courtaulds' Celon production in Britain are extremely important matters, not only because of the impact that that will have on the textile industry in Britain generally&#x2014;which in itself is crucial and important&#x2014;but because of the serious impact on my constituents, who live in an area that already suffers from an intolerably high level of unemployment. More than 15 per cent. of people in Merseyside are unemployed. In some estates in my constituency and in inner Liverpool, 40 per cent. of work-people are unemployed. In the county of Merseyside 153,000 people are chasing a mere 2,500 jobs. There have already been 7,000 job losses in only two months this year. This threatened closure follows that of Bowaters and Tate and Lyle.<br/>
It is clearly an urgent matter. Given my brief outline of the facts, we cannot afford to lose those jobs or, indeed, any others on Merseyside. It is important also because that factory&#x2014;and similarly Bowaters and, to some extent, Tate and Lyle&#x2014;would not have to close if only the Government would see sense and alter their economic policies. Like so many other companies, especially in the textile industry, Courtaulds' problems have been induced by the Government. It has not created the problems for itself. Its problems are those of an artificially high and damaging exchange rate, an arbitrary Government diktat, a lunatic energy policy, and ridiculous and cripplingly high interest rates. The Government are acting complacently in the face of a flood of subsidised imports. Those are matters that neither the work force nor the company can overcome. The problems are directly attributable to the Government, and only the Government can overcome them.<br/>
The matter is specific, important and urgent. It should be debated now, so that the Government can be told at first hand about the sort of problems that they are encouraging, and the problems that they are causing my constituents and many thousands of others on Merseyside. They should be told clearly and openly the way in which their dogmatic and bigoted economic policies are destroying both the future of my constituents and the industrial base of Britain. It is an appropriate issue for the House to debate, for which the Government should be held responsible and to which they must answer.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Ormskirk (Mr. Kilroy-Silk) gave me notice this morning before 12 o'clock that he would seek leave to move the Adjournment of the House for the purpose of discussing a specific and important matter that he believes should have urgent consideration, namely,
<q>the threatened closure of the Courtaulds factory at Aintree, with the loss of 1,550 jobs.</q>
The House listens with anxious care to such applications when they are made. I listened with great care to what the hon. Gentleman said this afternoon. The House knows that it has instructed me to give no reasons for my decisions when I rule on such applications. It knows also that I do not decide whether the matter should be debated. I simply decide whether it should be debated tonight or tomorrow. I have to rule that the hon. Gentleman's submission does not fall within the provisions of the Standing Order and, therefore, I cannot submit his application to the House.</p>

<p>One is always grateful for the opportunity to ventilate an issue in this Chamber, and I am doubly grateful to the Minister for his courtesy in being present. I hope, not too precociously, that I may look forward to a sympathetic and meaningful reply.<br/>
Briefly, the issue which I raise concerns what was referred to in the June 1980 White Paper, "Policy for Roads", as the Martlesham bypass in Suffolk. It features on page 49 under the heading "Reserve List 1984 onwards" at an end-1978 cost of &#x00A3;3 million. Its projected length is 1&#x00B7;9 miles.<br/>
Both the cost and the length are timely when measured against any current road project, and this is the central point which I wish to make in the debate. We are now witnessing the reconstruction of the Ipswich southern bypass and the Orwell bridge. The total cost of this scheme will almost certainly top &#x00A3;70 million on current updated estimates. Yet the access to and egress from this &#x00A3;70 million scheme at the north-eastern corner at Martlesham will, without implementing the June 1980 White Paper proposal, merely link this magnificent new network to the existing A12 which, through both Kesgrave and Martlesham, is little more than a passable country single carriageway.<br/>
Clearly this would be wrong. The new Ipswich southern bypass will carry traffic from London to East Norfolk round Ipswich and out at Martlesham. Likewise, this junction will funnel in the reverse flow. There is also the ever-mounting container traffic generated by the Haven Ports of Felixstowe, Ipswich and Harwich deriving from the East Midlands and the North-East.<br/>
What must also be understood and appreciated is that the traffic flows in this vicinity are in any event already dangerously high. The most recent figures that I have been able to obtain from the Suffolk county surveyor show about 22,000 vehicles per 16-hour day on a yearly average, and that is a yearly average which diminishes the high seasonal flow in the summer. In the vicinity, the position is being aggravated by the happy relocation and expansion of the Post Office research station at Martlesham and the new county police headquarters and general development in the Martlesham area.<br/>
Without the Martlesham bypass, for which I am arguing tonight, the hazards, delays and tail-backs are certain to become intolerable at this point. It is in this context that I make my plea to the Minister.<br/>
Inevitably, there has been slippage with the Ipswich southern bypass itself. This gives us breathing space, I urge my hon. and learned Friend to use this to accommodate the Martlesham bypass with some certainty as part of the overall Ipswich southern bypass programme.<br/>
It is somewhat distressing that in a letter which I have received from the Suffolk county surveyor I am told that the necessary representations in this matter were made to the director of the Eastern Road Construction Unit of the Department of Transport on 18 September 1979. He says:
<q>Despite repeated reminders, no response was received, except that in July 1980 a letter was received, stating that the


Department had been made subject to cash limits and that they were unable to devote any further resources to the joint study and that their work on Martlesham bypass had stopped.</q>
It is my understanding from the consulting engineers, Messrs William Dobbie, that that is precisely the situation and that the possibility of the Kesgrave wing itself has become a county project upon which, happily, the county is still conducting its own survey for improvements.<br/>
I should not like, as a result of my reference to the delay in the reply from the Eastern Road Construction Unit to the representations from the county surveyor, to imply friction. Throughout very lengthy exchanges with both the Suffolk county council and the much and properly concerned Martlesham parish council, the Eastern Road Construction Unit at Bedford has shown co-operation and understanding. I should like that to be recorded and transmitted, I hope with a firm date from the Minister, so that when he or the Secretary of State cuts the tape for the official opening of the Ipswich southern bypass he will not finish up in a traffic jam or something worse as he emerges on a single carriageway at Martlesham Hill no doubt en route to visit the other numerous attributes of my constituency of Sudbury and Woodbridge.<br/>
Adjournment debates usually come on late, and the prospect of them is known to engender remote and dangerous thoughts in the minds of certain Ministers. Tonight we have been fortunate. It is still only 7.59 pm. Let us hope that this is a happy omen for a firm and early commitment to this small but critical finish to the bold new road schemes around Ipswich which were authorised ministerially under the previous Conservative Administration.</p>

<p>I begin by congratulating my hon. Friend the Member for Sudbury and Woodbridge (Mr. Stainton) on his good fortune in being able to initiate a debate on the Martlesham bypass and also on his wisdom in choosing an evening when we could have a debate at a civilised hour. I know that this is a matter of considerable importance to him and his constituents.<br/>
My hon. Friend began by pointing out the fairly important strategic position that Martlesham has on the very busy A12 trunk road. The A12 is of great strategic importance nationally. It is the main route from London and the South-East to the ports of Ipswich, Felixstowe, Lowestoft and Great Yarmouth. I am glad to say that for most of its length, from London to Ipswich, it is already a high quality road.<br/>
Two stretches between London and Ipswich, however, need improvement. The first is the length from Gallows Corner in Havering to the Brentwood bypass. The second is where the A12 at present goes through the middle of Chelmsford. I am glad to report that we expect to begin work on those two gaps in the not too distant future. We expect to begin work on the Gallows Comer scheme early in 1982. Having announced last year the preferred route for the Chelmsford bypass, we hope to publish the draft orders for a southern bypass in June this; year. There will no doubt be controversy about that bypass, and inevitably there will be a public inquiry. Nevertheless, we intend to proceed with its preparation, and it is in the main programme for 1984 onwards. If all goes well with the

statutory procedures, and if funds are available, a start early in the period 1984 onwards should be possible for the Chelmsford bypass.<br/>
North of my hon. Friend's village of Martlesham we have a scheme for a western bypass of Great Yarmouth, including a second crossing of the river Yare. I am giving great priority to that bypass because of earnest requests, not least from my hon. Friend the Member for Yarmouth (Mr. Fell). I announced the preferred route in June last year and we hope to be able to publish draft orders for that road in May this year. Again, therefore, much has been achieved for Great Yarmouth.<br/>
There is also the important Ipswich bypass on which work has already begun, and I am glad to say that the Orwell bridge is making very good progress. We still have to take decisions, following a public inquiry, about the route of the southern and eastern sections of the bypass, but my right hon. Friend and I hope to announce decisions to finalise the route very soon indeed.<br/>
That activity up and down the A12 no doubt makes people in Martlesham particularly resentful at having to wait so long for their schemes to begin. My hon. Friend, with his local knowledge, has described better than I could the present traffic conditions on the A12 as they affect the village. I accept that the present road conditions are inadequate and that the village plainly needs a bypass as soon as it is feasible and practicable to finance, design and construct one. I am not sure that the opening of the Ipswich bypasss will bring more traffic on to the road than is there already, but I am sure that it will create an even greater contrast between conditions on the new stretches of the road and those in Martlesham from which my hon. Friend's constituents at present suffer.<br/>
My hon. Friend has asked when there will be tangible signs of progress, because this bypass has unfortunately had a long and chequered history. It appears to have begun life as part of a longer bypass through both Kesgrave and Martlesham. A scheme was included in draft orders published in 1970. Unfortunately, those draft orders for the longer bypass attracted much opposition. In the light of that opposition, the orders were withdrawn in 1971. I have to concede that in the intervening 10 years not very much appears to have occurred. It was apparently decided to await the results of the Ipswich transportation study, which was put in hand to seek a solution to the traffic problems of Ipswich.<br/>
With the decision to provide a bypass of Ipswich, it was decided that the original Kesgrave-Martlesham proposals should be shortened to bypass Martlesham only. It therefore became the Department's policy that the A12 through Kesgrave should cease to be a trunk road when the Ipswich bypass had been constructed. That decision, taken before the present Government came to office, means that it is now for Suffolk county council to decide whether to make any improvement to the road in order to benefit Kesgrave. By the time the Government came to office, therefore, a bypass was envisaged for Martlesham alone. It was not, however, very well advanced when we came to office.<br/>
My hon. Friend asked a parliamentary question of my predecessor in February 1979. The hon. Member for Gateshead, West (Mr. Horam), who then held the post which I now hold, made the position clear. He said:
<q>We are continuing work on a bypass of Martlesham and subject to the outcome of the statutory procedures and the availability of funds, construction of this bypass is more likely


to start in 1985&#x2013;86. It is too early to give dates for the intermediate processes.""&#x2014;<i>[Official Report,</i> 23 February 1979; Vol. 963, c. 383.]</q>
That was the position of the Martlesham bypass when we came to office. One of our first duties was to reorganise the priorities in the national trunk road programme, which we did in preparing the White Paper, published last year, to which my hon. Friend referred. In that White Paper the Martlesham bypass appears in the reserve list for 1984 onwards. My hon. Friend and his constituents feel some disappointment at that not very exciting description of where the Martlesham bypass stands in the national order of priorities.<br/>
Unfortunately, we faced some difficult choices in drawing up that national trunk road programme. The main thing that we had to do was bring some realism into the programme to match the timetable that had been given for progress on various schemes with the resources that were likely to be available. We did not make any significant change in the overall level of resources, and we tried as far as possible to protect the trunk roads construction programme from the effects of the present financial crisis and to avoid unnecessary cuts.<br/>
However, maintaining roughly the same level of spend as our predecessors, it would still have been impossible to complete many road schemes by the dates that our predecessors had given to many people waiting for them. We found that roads in the trunk road programme had been given target dates which were utterly unrealistic and could not be met. The result was that expectations had been created in many towns and villages which stood no chance of being fulfilled. We therefore looked at the likely resources and produced a timetable which made sense in the light of those resources.<br/>
The first call on those resources was intended to be the schemes in the main programme, which include the Great Yarmouth scheme and others to which I have referred. Reserve list status means that such a scheme will not have first call on resources available, including resources available for preparatory and design work. The main programme schemes will have first priority for all resources. But reserve list status means that work will be continued as far as practicable. It is a way of ensuring that, if main programme schemes slip, desirable schemes are sufficiently prepared to be slotted in to take their place. That was the category of road schemes into which we put the Martlesham bypass.<br/>
At the moment, as my hon. Friend has said, there is not a great deal of work being done on the Martlesham bypass. The preparation work is not being given very high priority. Nevertheless, some work is planned for next year, and I assure my hon. Friend that we shall continue the design work and that the consultants will be given the necessary instructions to keep up progress and to get nearer to having a road designed and ready. But we have to be careful in allocating resources for preparation work on trunk roads.<br/>
Our inheritance was that, at least in theory, preparation work was being continued on all 400 roads in the trunk road programme. If resources were to be devoted to preparation costs on that scale, it would merely mean that money would be spent over the next two or three years on preparation work for roads which could not conceivably be built for many years. The money spent on preparation

work of that kind would reduce the amount available for getting on with construction now on vitally needed roads which are ready to be built.<br/>
We are therefore trying to match the extent of preparation work to likely construction dates and we are giving the highest priority to preparation work on roads likely to be built in the next two or three years. The result is that we are fitting in preparation schemes such as Martlesham as far as possible. As I have said, I hope that it will be possible to spend a significant sum on this scheme next year.<br/>
My hon. Friend's main point, then, is whether sufficient money could be spent and higher priority given to ensure that the Martlesham bypass is opened at the same time as the Ipswich bypass or shortly thereafter. The Ipswich bypass, however, is well advanced. We are making as much speed as possible in building that road, and I hope that the full length of the bypass will be open in the not too distant future.<br/>
Unfortunately, with Martlesham we are at a comparatively early stage of the preparation. The scheme was published in 1970 but excited so much opposition that it was withdrawn. The next step now will be to examine possible alternative routes for taking the traffic around the village and for submitting them to the public for their reactions.<br/>
I realise that my hon. Friend will be more familiar with the village than I and will know this better than I do, but I expect that there will be some controversy in Martlesham whichever route we choose. For example, should we stick to a route on the lines of that indicated in the original 1970 plan, which passed to the west and north of Martlesham? My understanding is that people who live in Great Bealings and Little Bealings would not be very pleased with that choice.<br/>
On the other hand, should we go for an improvement along the lines of the existing road? That would be rather difficult in this case. One can also expect that such an improvement would be fairly unpopular in the village because it would keep the traffic in the centre of the built-up area. One could also examine the possibility of an eastern bypass, but the problem there is that difficult ground conditions could significantly increase the cost.<br/>
I pose those questions not to answer any of them but to show that there is genuinely a need in this case for public consultation and that it will be almost impossible to produce a line which will please everyone. Therefore, we have to have a public exhibition, leaflets, and so on, to try to find out which route will achieve the broadest consensus of the local inhabitants.<br/>
I am glad to say that we expect to reach that stage in the spring of 1982. We shall then come to conclusions about the route, to be worked up as soon as possible after that. Once we have reached the stage of choosing a preferred route, at least that will remove some of the uncertainty which no doubt exists in the village and affects planning decisions and matters of that kind.<br/>
However, even after the choice of preferred route has been made, there will then have to be the detailed design work to produce the drawings upon which the draft orders are founded. If there continue to be objections, there will need to be a public inquiry. I am afraid that the timetable for trunk road works of this kind is such that a great deal of good luck and smooth progress would be required if we were to be ready to start work some time in 1986, assuming that the funds were available.<br/>
I realise that that time scale will disappoint my hon. Friend and his constituents, but there is keen competition for resources. The decisions which we had to take in drawing up our priorities were often hard and involved difficult choices between similar villages in different parts of the country. Many villages like this now find heavy lorry traffic through the built-up area unacceptable. There is a greater demand for bypasses than can conceivably be served in the near future, and some deserving schemes have had to take low places in the queue. But the programme is not immutable, and we intend to review it year by year, taking things a little further as we get roads completed and into use. The time will come in this calendar year when my right hon. Friend and I will have to review the road programme once more and reassess the priorities that we put on roads last year and decide which schemes now appear to be in urgent need and which might be given greater priority.<br/>
As I said, even with greater priority, Martlesham will take some years to prepare, but no doubt the time scale that I have described could be somewhat shortened if we devoted greater resources earlier on to preparation and design work.<br/>
I can make no promises about the outcome tonight, but I am impressed by my hon. Friend's strength of feeling. He has gone to the extent not only of writing to me but of raising the matter on the Adjournment. I can certainly promise him that, when we review the programme and reconsider our priorities when updating the programme and looking at how we will spend our resources next year, we shall specifically consider the case of the Martlesham bypass to see whether we can do something better for it.<br/>
However, there is great competition for resources. Higher priority for the Martlesham bypass will almost inevitably mean a lower priority for some other township which is expecting to have a bypass in the not-too-distant future. However, I shall not deal with the difficulties. I appreciate the urgency of this matter and the sense of frustration in his constituency. Therefore, I promise that we shall give this matter our particular attention when we next review the programme and our priorities within it.</p>

<p>I wish to raise the problem of the acquisition of police houses by Gateshead metropolitan borough council. A total of 31 police houses were declared surplus to the police authority's requirements. Because of the problems of housing being left empty and of vandalism, the council and the Northumbrian police authority agreed that Gateshead should acquire them. To combat vandalism, it was also agreed that tenants would be put into the houses as quickly as possible and that the transfer value would be the value ascribed to the houses by the district valuer.<br/>
Nineteen of those houses were satisfactorily transferred to the council and are fully occupied. A further 12 were applied for, of which three are still vacant, five have temporary occupation and four are occupied. There is no permission to transfer any of those 12 to the council. The problem is with the four which are currently occupied in order to combat vandalism. The district valuer took so long to come up with a valuation for those houses that the Government moratorium on housing intervened. Those four houses are now occupied by people who would have to be evicted if the Government did not agree to the transfer of the houses at valuation.<br/>
Two of those four houses are occupied by people with medical priority for council housing and one was even slightly modified by the borough council to enable its disabled occupant to use it as effectively as possible. It seems that the civil servants in the Department have not fully appreciated the effects of a simple transfer being stopped. A little flexibility would have allowed those four houses to be accepted. In present circumstances, those four families could become homeless almost overnight&#x2014;and two of them are the families of disabled people.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cowans) was the chairman of the Gateshead district housing authority at the time of the decision to acquire the 31 houses and I am sure that he will supplement the historical reasons why we felt it important to bring them into local government ownership.<br/>
The object of the exercise was, first, to relieve the police authority of the responsiblity for empty houses, for which it had no further use, and, secondly, to guard against vandalism.<br/>
I respectfully ask the Minister to consider fully the implications of the decision not to allow the transfer of those four houses to Gateshead at valuation. I ask him to think carefully about the consequences of that decision on the four families involved. I ask my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central to enlighten the House about the historical reasons for the houses being acquired by the local authority.</p>

<p>I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Blaydon (Mr. McWilliam) for raising this matter. I have the honour to represent Newcastle upon Tyne, Central, but for many years I was chairman of the Gateshead metropolitan district council housing committee. We have listened to many debates about vacant properties and have heard


many remarks about local authorities in that respect. I could argue that case, but it is not the matter now before the House.<br/>
The historic position is that certain houses were unoccupied, overgrown with weeds, and radically vandalised at a time when there were long housing waiting lists. As chairman of the housing committee, I visited many of the houses. There was great justification for what was being said about them. The local authority took the view that it should open negotiations with the Tyne and Wear county council, the police authority for Northumbria. It agreed to take over all 31 houses. That presented some difficulties, because a small number were still occupied. However, it was informed that they would soon become unoccupied. The local authority thought it best to deal with the problem by phasing the taking over of the houses by first taking over those that had been vandalised, were unoccupied, or were unkempt. By that time the remainder would have become vacant. It carried out that programme succesfully in respect of about 18 or 19 houses. But Gateshead being what it is, and with the time that it takes the district valuer to assess a situation, it was inevitable&#x2014;although this was not known at that time&#x2014;that it would be caught in the moratorium on housing.<br/>
To save money, the local authority reached an agreement with the Tyne and Wear county council to move in tenants prior to the actual taking over of the houses. That policy prevented further vandalism because people were looking after the premises. By the time the houses were taken over the programme would cost the district council less money because people had occupied the houses and looked after them. That arrangement worked well until the local authority was caught in the moratorium.<br/>
The local authority could grant only temporary tenancies to those moving into the properties in advance of it actually taking over the houses. That was acceptable, provided that the houses were eventually taken over. Due to the delay of the district valuer&#x2014;I am not placing blame on him as such matters take time&#x2014;the subsequent moratorium and the delay of the Department of the Environment, the local authority had granted temporary tenancies for houses that it did not own. If nothing is done about that, and the previous decision is not now honoured, two problems will arise. The local authority is in a dilemma because it has tenants for houses that it does not own. If the police authority now says that the local authority cannot buy those houses, what will happen to the tenants? The local authority gave an undertaking and fully expected the full transaction to take place. It will have to rehouse those tenants. With the greatest humility, I suggest to the Minister that those houses will become vacant again, will be vandalised and will become unkempt. While the decision-making process is taking place, the amount of money subsequently involved in making the houses habitable again will be out of the question.<br/>
I plead with the Minister to consider the matter sympathetically. The decisions taken were caught up by subsequent decisions. Unfortunate people are involved, even though they were not parties to those decisions. The matter does not involve millions of pounds, but it does involve ordinary people. If the Minister looks favourably

on the matter, he will not only help the local authority but will ease the minds of the tenants temporarily accommodated. He will also save a great deal of money by usefully utilising the houses rather than returning them to their unoccupied state.</p>

<p>I congratulate the hon. Member for Blaydon (Mr. McWilliam) on his good fortune in obtaining an additional Adjournment debate. That happens from time to time. It has one snag. As someone who has raised such a debate, I am fully aware of it. If the Minister does not know about the subject until six o'clock at night, he does not have much information at his disposal. He does not have a detailed brief to study, and he must take a judgment and act on his initiative. That does not upset me in the least. All I hope is that I can give the hon. Gentleman enough information to make him feel that it has been a worthwhile exercise. I am grateful also to the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cowans) for filling in those historical points.<br/>
From the limited amount of information that I have been able to obtain, I believe that the case is not as straightforward as the two hon. Gentlemen suggested. I accept the remarks of the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central in his historical analysis of the events that took place, and the reason why Gateshead followed a certain practice with the Tyne and Wear county council, the police authority for Northumbria. There is, perhaps, only one matter that divides us tonight on his historical analysis, and that is the fact that time has moved on. A new Government are now in power with a new policy on municipalisation. The days when it was simple to acquire scores of properties&#x2014;I am not necessarily referring to the hon. Gentleman's authority, but to authorities in many parts of the country&#x2014;frequently unsurveyed and without proper financial consideration, are over. They ended in June 1979. The facts in this case were known fully to the Gateshead council because the ban on municipalisation took effect from June 1979.<br/>
Gateshead, like all local authorities, was told of this fact, and it was reaffirmed in the HIP allocation letter issued on 21 February 1980&#x2014;more than a year ago. I repeat that all these facts were known to Gateshead. It has, however, proceeded as though the situation had not changed. I can only say that the local authority has either been naive or has wilfully chosen to disregard the fact that we specified when we sent out the HIP allocations, the categories of municipalisation that were to be permitted.</p>

<p>I accept what the Minister says. One fact stands between us, however. The information to which he refers was not known when the original decision was taken. That is the crucial point. Had it all been available before the decision was made I would agree with him, but it was not.</p>
</speech>
<speech hansard_id="1803313" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1981-02-23a.722.2" hansard_membership_id="9928" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/14877" speakername="Mr Finsberg" colnum="722" time="20:26:00">
<p>I was coming to that point in the course of my reply, which I stress is based on the limited information that I have. I strongly believe that municipalisation adds nothing to the housing stock. It merely transfers from one public body, or, sometimes, from a private individual, to a public authority, an existing house or flat. It does not add to the total stock of housing. The Government are strong believers that what matters is


not the division but the totality of that stock. Our policy is clearly to advise all public authorities which own accommodation that is surplus to their requirements, that they should dispose of it.<br/>
Both hon. Members made a very fair point about the difficulties caused when properties remain empty and become vandalised. I have seen some of the vandalism in Gateshead because until I was transferred to my present position I visited Gateshead about every second month. I therefore know the problems. I have seen them elsewhere. Leaving aside local authority property, there should be no reason, when a public authority is disposing of its property, for it not to do pre-planning so that it will know that in, say, five months' time it will be ready to dispose of a property. At that stage it should start the process of valuation through the district valuer, getting a price, instructing an agent or getting ready for auction so that people can view the property while it is still occupied and the transaction can take place almost the moment the property is vacated.<br/>
That is what the two hon. Gentlemen and I would do if we were contemplating getting rid of the homes we might be fortunate enough to own. We would not wait until we had moved out before starting the process. But that is what happens in the case of too many public authorities. I leave aside the local authorities, which are in a separate category.<br/>
Again, with my responsibility as a Minister for the Property Services Agency I am trying to impress upon all Government Departments that if they have properties that are surplus to their requirements they should let us know well in advance so that we may be ready to dispose of them and avoid what the hon. Gentleman rightly says are the problems caused by empty properties&#x2014;broken windows and vandalism.<br/>
I have not seen the properties in question, but I know this part of the world. I am told that they are good quality inter-war houses which are highly marketable. There should, therefore, be little or no difficulty in disposing of them. The hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central said that much of what he has recounted happened before the rules changed. I hope that I have the right dates, because a photocopy of some pencilled figures is difficult to read. My information, however, is that of the four properties we are discussing, which are tenanted properties, the property in Southend Road, Beacon Lough, was not tenanted until October 1979, after the June ban on municipalisation. Crawley Gardens, Whickham was tenanted in February 1980 and Duckpool Lane, Whickham in November 1979.<br/>
They all occurred after the ban on municipalisation. The house in Lobley Hill Road, Gateshead, was acquired in December 1978, under the previous Administration.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman makes a fair point. However, I am sure that he will accept that it is also fair to say that, permission having previously been given to this agreement&#x2014;and in the case of Whickham modifications having been made to accommodate a disabled person&#x2014;there is the likelihood that there may have been an overrun. I should stress that permission had previously been given. Although the circular had withdrawn that permission, the local authority in the meantime had reviewed the housing stock. The housing allocation machinery had taken its course and people were allocated accordingly.</p>

<p>I am trying to be helpful. June 1979 was the time when local authorities were told that municipalisation as it had been known had come to an end, and no local authority should have assumed that properties would still be available to it. However, it was after that date that the houses were tenanted and that is the important point.<br/>
The local authority knew full well that it would not qualify for municipalisation permission as a result of the change of rules. Yet it put in the tenants in the full knowledge that different rules were now operating. I must go by the dates which I have been given, even though I have only had a chance of studying them for an hour-and-a-half, and they are written in pencil.<br/>
However, the Lobley Hill Road tenants were put in by the local authority in December 1978. In that case, provided that the transaction does not take place in this financial year, I am prepared to agree exceptionally that, because there was a hangover and because it was tenanted before the change, that property can be acquired out of Gateshead's HIP allocation for the next financial year.</p>

<p>I am grateful to the Minister, and I know that he is trying hard to be helpful. I accept the date of the circular. However, he will recall a phrase in the speech relating to the phasing-in of tenants as property became available and as there was agreement. I accept the validity of the argument that if a circular emerges from Government subsequent to that date, one should not do other than what the Government document says. I am grateful to him for accepting my argument in relation to the 1978 acquisition. However, our reasonable point is that we had already obtained agreement for these houses prior to the putting in of tenants. No other houses were acquired following the June 1979 circular. The properties had already been acquired. The tenancies were part of the phasing-in operation. I would fully accept what the Minister is saying had we acquired houses following the June 1979 circular.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman and I must remain somewhat apart on this one. I can only try to put myself in the position of the chairman of the Gateshead housing committee. Like the hon. Gentleman, I spent a long period in local government. I would like to think that I would have seen the circular in June 1979 and I would have asked my chief officer "What effect will this have on the outline agreement that we obtained with the police authority?" He would have said "Well, sir, I think that this is now going to stop us acquiring but I shall find out." That was not done. If it had not been done, I should have said "We had better play safe. We shall put people in on a temporary basis, but we shall not asume that they will be there permanently." I am not speaking only as a Minister. I spent a quarter of a century in local government and I dealt with housing for a long time in a stress area&#x2014;namely, the London borough of Camden. I do not believe that I would have acted as Gateshead acted.<br/>
However, I am prepared exceptionally to agree to the one property being acquired in the next financial year out of Gateshead's HIP allocation. My Department will write to Gateshead to confirm the decision that I have reached. I do not think that I can go any further with the other properties.</p>

<p>The Minister is being very fair. However, will he accept that the accident of a delay in a


decision by the district valuer that caused three families to become homeless is not one which he and I, as officials in housing administrations in the past, can accept as inescapable? I suggest that if the hon. Gentleman or I were officials in the same housing administration, we would in fairness grant tenancies to the other three tenants in the circumstances. We are worried not about the 12 houses but four houses, two of which are occupied by disabled tenants.</p>

<p>I hope that I have demonstrated that I am prepared to be flexible in considering the rules. However, there has to be some limit. To proceed until 1980 and to put in tenants at that stage demonstrated a total disregard and disbelief in the Government's policy. I do not know about the delays of the district valuer.</p>

<p>The district valuer does not come under my Department. If there were substantial delays, I am sure that my right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer will want to hear about them. Even if there had

not been delays that caused the properties, or some of them, to be caught in the moratorium, permission would not have been given because the situation differed once the June 1979 position had been adopted.<br/>
I think that responsibility must rest squarely on the shoulders of Gateshead and certainly not on my Department. I can only suggest that urgent negotiations take place between Gateshead and the police authority to ascertain how quickly Gateshead can rehouse the tenants in the three properties for which I do not find it possible to give permission. Gateshead will have to accept that they are a priority upon their housing resource allocations. They will have to be rehoused by Gateshead.<br/>
I am extremely upset that this has to happen to individual tenants. However, it is an inescapable consequence of Gateshead not accepting that there was a policy change and proceeding to implement policy that was perfectly acceptable under the previous Labour Government but unacceptable under this Government. I fear that I can go no further than giving my agreement to the one property to be acquired.</p>
