	<p>It is precisely to avoid such effects that the directive is being put in place. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would welcome the fact that the end-of-life vehicles (producer responsibility) regulations laid before the House in February are due to come into force today. They take into consideration what is known as the &quot;own mark&quot; approach, whereby companies take back the vehicles that they have produced. That restricts the sort of dumping that the hon. Gentleman mentioned and enables the recycling of vehicles to take place. I believe that it will be good for the environment, good for our communities and good for the customers of those vehicles because they will know where they should be returned to.</p>

	<p>I know that that sort of activity is important, as my hon. Friend the Member for Newport, West (Paul Flynn) outlined. Important developments in a range of sectors involve recycling and, in some cases, reuse of materials. I identified in my initial answer the considerable investment that the Government are making through the technology programme to examine the whole area of waste minimisation and waste use, particularly encouraging companies to work together with scientific establishments to develop the sort of innovative processes that will enable us to achieve business and environmental benefits in the future.</p>

	<p>It is enormously important that the coal industry has a long-term future, not least because the profitable colliery of Dawmill is in my constituency. We want to ensure that pits like Welbeck continue. Obviously, at Ellington, there were issues to do with geology and flooding. We engaged in discussions with UK Coal and sought further drainage at Ellington. UK Coal was unwilling to undertake such work. It is a privatised industry and that is a decision that it is entitled to take. We are continuing to work to keep open Welbeck. We are looking at applications for funding and we believe that once we have studied the details of the proposals from UK Coal, it is highly likely that we will continue to provide some funding.</p>

As for the arms embargo on China, my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary has spelt out not only our position on that, but the reasons for it. Let me reassure the hon. Gentleman, as my right hon.

	<p>Will my right hon. Friend remind the House just how important our trade relationship with the US is? It is by far our biggest trade partner. Since Labour came to power, our policies have hugely increased our trade balance with the US, from less than &pound;500 million under the Conservatives to &pound;14,500 million. The longer we keep our strong trade relationship with the US, the better. Nit-picking at the corners, as the Tories do, does not help one little bit.</p>

	<p>Last week, the Secretary of State admitted that, under the Labour Government,</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;one of the biggest frustrations for everyone running a business today is the amount of regulation coming out of Europe.&quot;</p>
	<p>We all agree, therefore, that European regulation is a crushing threat, impeding the prospects of the engineering sector in the west midlands and of all parts of British business. Will the Minister now confess what proportion of the &pound;8.9 billion-worth of extra regulation heaped on British business last year came directly from Europe, how much came from Ministers and officials gold-plating EU requirements and how much was dreamt up by the Labour Government themselves?</p>

	<p>The complacency of that response cannot disguise the fact that more EU directives have been implemented under the Labour Government than was the case in the preceding quarter-century of our membership. Engineers and manufacturers know exactly who is to blame for the ballooning burden of regulation, which is now heading towards a staggering &pound;40 billion.</p>
	<p>Another key concern of west midlands engineers is skills. The most recent study by the Engineering Employers Federation on manufacturing productivity compares the UK with France and Germany, and shows that only UK managers rated the skills available to them as having a negative impact on their attempts to improve productivity. What urgent measures are the Government taking to abolish the inefficient Learning and Skills Council and to create a scheme of vocational grants, with funding following the students so that young people in the west midlands and the rest of the United Kingdom receive the skills training that employers demand and which the Conservatives have promised?</p>

	<p>In supporting what the hon. Member for Crosby (Mrs. Curtis-Thomas) said about the importance of attracting more young women, let alone young men, into engineering, technology and allied subjects, does the Minister accept that the way to do that would be to put greater emphasis not on higher education but on vocational education, both post-16 and even earlier, in secondary schools? That would enable young people&mdash;young men and women&mdash;to develop a skill that they could put to good use in their adult lives, to the betterment of the prospects of engineering and technology in this country.</p>

	<p>I am not surprised, given the dreadful leadership provided by the leader of the Conservative party. I join my hon. Friend the Member for Midlothian (David Hamilton), who is a former miner, in acknowledging the suffering that miners' families experienced and their appalling treatment by the Thatcher Government. When Mrs. Thatcher was Prime Minister, lots of ordinary families suffered from her oppressive treatment, which would make an excellent subject for debate. The BBC programme is an excellent example of pointing out the truth, not least about the behaviour of the then Government.</p>

	<p>On the business for next week, Mr. Speaker, can the Leader of the House confirm that he recognises that his primary responsibility is to this House, not to the Government, for the orderly arrangement of parliamentary business? Will he make a statement on the primacy of the House? As he knows, the Prime Minister and other Ministers constantly object to cross-party plans for reform of the composition of the House of Lords on the grounds that it could undermine the predominance of the House of Commons. Yet the Home Secretary has apparently decreed that the Lords should be the place where substantive amendments to his legislation on house arrest are discussed, having failed to provide a real opportunity for this House to debate them. He has apparently decided that compromise can be achieved only at the other end of the building rather than here. That is where the discussions will take place, and that is where the substantive debate will take place.</p>
	<p>Will the Leader of the House confirm that he stands by his statements on many occasions that the predominant role in the business of Parliament lies here? Will he confirm that elected MPs should take decisions rather than, in his own phrase, unelected peers? How can he defend the contempt that other members of the Government seem to show for the House when compromise and consideration seem to be the rule only for the other place? He announced a few moments ago that we will have very few hours in this place to discuss amendments to an important Bill while considerable time is being devoted to it in the other place.</p>
	<p>Ministers frequently say that the legitimacy of the Lords is, in some way, not complete. Will the Leader of the House indicate the Government's attitude towards cross-party proposals for the improvement of the legitimacy of the other place? Has he had an opportunity to study the Bill that I presented to this House with the support of the right hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook), the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke), the hon. Member for Cannock Chase (Tony Wright) and the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir George Young)? Will he indicate that the House will have an opportunity to debate those matters, and will he tell us the Government's attitude on them?</p>
	<p>Last Thursday, the Leader of the House gave me an undertaking that the Chancellor would look urgently at the question of tax credits, which are causing much misery to our constituents. He may have seen that <i>The Daily Mirror</i> has taken up the issue and has referred to the fiasco that has left tens of thousands of families in financial crisis. When will I get an answer from the Chancellor, which the Leader of the House promised me last week? Much more importantly, when will all those who have been affected by the appalling fiasco get an answer?</p>

	<p>Further to the reply to the question of the hon. Member for Macclesfield (Sir Nicholas Winterton), it is not good enough to say that major matters of foreign affairs, with great issues in Syria and in relation to Iran, should be transferred to Westminster Hall. This is not proper treatment of the House, it really is not.</p>

	<p>As I have already announced, there is other business in the House on that day. The situation will be rather dependent on what comes back from the Lords. If there is any ping-pong on the Bill, we shall have to see. There is plenty of opportunity for debate on this important item, so I can give the hon. Gentleman that assurance.</p>
	<p>I apologise to the hon. Member for North Cornwall (Mr. Tyler). One of the issues that I did not address was his point about the House of Lords report by a number of eminent Members of this place. It is an impressive report and we shall consider it seriously.</p>

	<p>I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving me the opportunity, and I am sure the whole House, to put on record our acknowledgement that Peter Benenson, in founding Amnesty, lit a torch for freedom that has continued to burn brightly and has held every Government in the world, including our own, accountable for any potential human rights abuses.</p>
	<p>As for Burma, I agree with the hon. Gentleman that it is an odious junta. The sooner that it can be brought down and replaced by a democratic, civilised Government, the better for the Burmese people. The treatment of the three individuals to whom the hon. Gentleman refers is completely intolerable, but, unfortunately, in line with the junta's behaviour. As well their treatment, we are aware of the long-standing oppression of Aung San Suu Kyi, who should in my opinion, subject to the views of the Burmese people, be the true leader of Burma.</p>

	<p>Will the Leader of the House arrange a debate as soon as possible to enable the House to end the perceived discrimination by Government against parents in Northern Ireland who wish to have their children educated in grammar schools, by enabling those parents to exercise the same rights that parents enjoy in England, who by local referendum can choose to retain their local grammar school, and also by enabling the House to prevent discrimination against the state sector&mdash;mainly Protestant children in our schools&mdash;in the form of proposals recently, which the Government admit will reduce funding to the state sector by &pound;3 per pupil annually and increase funding to maintained sector children&mdash;who are mainly Roman Catholic&mdash;by &pound;5 per pupil annually? Surely the Leader of the House and the House would uphold the need for abandoning and preventing discrimination at all levels.</p>

	<p>It is our intention to have the Identity Cards Bill on the statute book as soon as we can. That will depend on the Opposition's response. It remains to be seen whether the Conservatives will back this common-sense measure, which is widely supported by about 80 per cent. of the population. That applies to the Liberal Democrats as well. Will they seek to block the Bill? It will be an interesting challenge for the Opposition, and members of the public will be watching very closely to see who is on their side in the fight against terrorism and illegal immigration and in favour of improving the security of legitimate British citizens.</p>

	<p>Will my right hon. Friend reflect on the speculation about the possibility of an early dissolution and, in particular, provide information on the likely progress of the Gambling Bill? In my constituency two casino developers, MGM and Sun International, have expressed interest in developing regional casinos which would be at the heart of major regeneration plans for the old industrial areas of the Lower Don valley.

	<p>I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen) for making those points and I am sure that I shall return to them at the appropriate time when it is in order.</p>
	<p>To return to the point about the home computing initiative, which is a key plank of the Government's policy of increasing access to the internet in UK homes, this amendment would enable the OFT to grant group directions in this and other cases where it would be in the interests of hirers to do so. It is not necessary for the OFT to approve each application individually to provide adequate protection for hirers&mdash;that wastes time and resources; it can simply identify general criteria, which will ensure that agreements under the scheme are in the hirer's interest. The new clause will cause no reduction in consumer protection, but there is a real benefit associated with the costs and efficiency of the process.</p>

	<p>I want to say briefly that I am happy to accept the Government's new clause. Although I have expressed reservations about the OFT, the new clause will give it the power to do the job that it does not do often enough: to adjudicate on whether or not trade is fair. My concern is that the OFT does not do enough to promote fair trade and that it regards itself more as a competition agency.</p>
	<p>The promotion of fair trade is a proper role. Indeed, I have tabled other new clauses and amendments that would impose further responsibilities on the OFT. However, in deference to the Conservative spokesman&mdash;I share some reservations with the hon. Member for Tewkesbury (Mr. Robertson)&mdash;my view is that it is not the accretion of power to the OFT, but the imbalance in the way that the OFT applies its powers and its accountability that are matters for concern. For that reason, the thrust of the new clause is to make the OFT do more of what it should do and perhaps to spend less time on what it should not do.</p>

	<p>Last year, I introduced a ten-minute Bill on creating an interest rate cap. I am grateful to the House for the opportunity to raise this very important issue again, as it is of great interest to many people. I speak in particular about the umbrella organisation, &quot;debt on our doorstep&quot;, which has campaigned long and hard on the subject of an interest rate cap. Oxfam, Help the Aged, the Local Government Association and Church Action on Poverty are involved in that campaign. I also pay tribute to the <i>Sunday Mirror</i>, which has recently launched a campaign called &quot;curb the credit sharks&quot; to promote the idea of interest rate ceilings.</p>
	<p>Essentially, new clause 2 would introduce a requirement on the OFT to collate accurate information on interest rates in the different segments of the consumer credit market and, separately, on any relevant court judgments. It would then provide the Secretary of State with an enabling power to introduce an interest rate ceiling subject to a one-year notice period, in order to allow sufficient time for consultation in the industry.</p>
	<p>We have already had the opportunity to discuss this matter. On Second Reading, the Minister gave an assurance that the subject of interest rate capping would be kept under review&mdash;the door, if not wholly open, is slightly ajar. He said that he stood by the decision not to introduce a ceiling, but that he was committed to keeping the matter under review. I would be interested to hear today a little more about the Government's intention; how do they intend to keep the matter under review? I will make my decision on whether to force the new clause to a Division on that basis. The hon. Member for Rhondda (Chris Bryant) is listening intently to me for once; I thought that he wanted to intervene.</p>
	<p>The &quot;debt on our doorstep&quot; campaign has asked the Government whether it can have more information on how they propose to review the matter. The emphasis in the Bill is on the new unfairness test, which is very welcome but will depend to some degree on interpretation in the courts. The new clause is intended to provide a further guarantee by requiring accurate information and allowing for the enabling power if the unfairness test does not create the desired security.</p>

	<p>I am grateful to the hon. Member for East Carmarthen and Dinefwr (Adam Price) for tabling the new clause, because the subject was not expressly debated in Committee and there is considerable concern about it in my constituency. Some lenders, credit card companies and personal loan providers deliberately target areas with large pockets of poverty. People in those areas want ready access to finance for short or long periods, but they cannot use the services provided by more orthodox lenders, and must rely on those who will lend only at high rates of interest. Such lenders operate in particular in areas where a large proportion of the population own their own homes, so they know that they can turn an unsecured loan into a secured loan, and have some certainty about whether they can get the money back from poor communities. The Government are right to address the issue, as we need to tackle financial exclusion and the profound cynicism in some parts of the financial services market.</p>

	<p>The hon. Gentleman has made an important point. Is it not the case that in a sophisticated and mature financial market the respectable side of the market recognises that it is not a good investment to make loans to some people? Consequently, the portion of the population highlighted by the hon. Member for East Carmarthen and Dinefwr (Adam Price) can be exploited. He gave the example of an APR of 1,000 per cent. or more, and such interest rates can be levied because the mature and sophistimicated market does not sell its products to those people, who cannot access it.</p>

	<p>I think that the &quot;sophistimicated&quot; market is a Bushism&mdash;but I am sure that everyone in the Chamber agrees that exploitation needs to be tackled. We want to try to find the right means to prevent exploitation, whether of individuals or of communities, including the Rhondda, which I represent.</p>
	<p>I do not accept the argument that a maximum interest rate would make it impossible for poor people to gain access to financial services. Some loans should not be made, because people cannot afford them. I accept that most financial services organisations want to ensure that they do not lend money to people who cannot afford a loan, because they might not get the money back. However, if that results in unsecured loans being turned into loans secured on people's homes we should put a stop to that corrupt exploitation.</p>
	<p>I find some aspects of new clause 2 problematic. The new concept of widespread consumer detriment proposed by the hon. Member for East Carmarthen and Dinefwr may well undermine the provisions at the heart of the Bill to tackle unfair relationships. Courts may decide to strike down an agreement that someone has entered into for all sorts of reasons, but they cannot do so because the interest rate is too high, as there is provision to tackle that elsewhere in the Bill. That is detrimental to the cause of preventing exploitation, so I hope that the Minister will give some further explanation. He is waggling his head as he did in Committee&mdash;but perhaps he will do it later. High or excessive interest rates and the charges that often ensue for late payment are exploitative in themselves, and should be considered by the court as reasons for characterising an agreement entered into by a consumer as an unfair relationship and striking it down. If that is the case, we should not support the new clause, as it would contradict the purposes that we are trying to achieve.</p>
	<p>I fear that if the Government used the powers afforded by the new clause and set a maximum interest rate, that rate might be considered acceptable and could lead to a steady sliding up of interest rates. I hope, however, that the Bill will achieve a steady sliding down of interest rates. Once a court strikes down an agreement because the interest rate is excessive and the relationship is unfair, I am sure that there will be a dramatic change in higher interest rates. My contribution has not been as short as I intended, which is often the case. I wholeheartedly support the aims of new clauses 2 and 4, but I am not sure that they would help us to achieve the aims that we are trying to achieve.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2005-03-03.1133.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/760" speakername="Malcolm Bruce" colnum="1133"  time="14:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050303/debtext/50303-16.htm#50303-16_spnew0">
	<p>I am glad that the hon. Member for Rhondda (Chris Bryant) acknowledged the role of new clauses 4 and 5, to which I wish mainly to speak. I have had discussions with &quot;debt on our doorstep&quot;, and the early part of new clause 2 is derived from my original amendment, which I have separated out, partly for the reasons stated. I do not think that we disagree on what we are trying to achieve; we are trying to work out a way to deliver a practical result. As the hon. Gentleman says, we want lower interest rates, and we want people to be able to take advantage of the best available interest rate, rather than the worst, which is often the case at the moment.</p>
	<p>We have gained some useful insight and information from the <i>Sunday Mirror</i> campaign, in conjunction with &quot;debt on our doorstep&quot;, which is to be commended, even if we cannot agree precisely with the three objectives. It seeks a cap on interest rates, and there may be a way of achieving that slightly different from the one in new clause 2; new clauses 4 and 5 might lead to that outcome or to an even better outcome. It also seeks to stop reckless lending, which I shall deal with when we debate amendment No. 21, and it seeks to improve education&mdash;a matter not specifically addressed here, but my new clauses are designed to give people more information, so that they can make informed decisions and be aware.</p>
	<p>One of the main problems that people have is knowing what rate of interest they are paying, and what that means. I hope that new clause 4 will commend itself, at least in principle, to the Government and to the Office of Fair Trading. It would be hugely helpful if we had a mechanism to ensure the comparability of rates of interest and to establish the method by which interest is collected, and perhaps also if we required customers to be given a clear statement of the interest and how it would be incurred.</p>
	<p>The Consumers Association has sent us a briefing with an example of two credit cards from different organisations, ostensibly offering different rates of interest, but charging exactly the same, because of the different way in which the interest is applied in terms of time and repayment terms. Even an intelligent and well-informed customer is in an impossible position when trying to calculate the real cost, so we need to inform, and the Office of Fair Trading should be helping that process. I commend new clause 4 as a means of suggesting how that might be done.</p>
	<p>New clause 5 addresses the issue of excessive interest rates, and suggests a way in which we might achieve the results sought by the hon. Member for East Carmarthen and Dinefwr (Adam Price). The range of products and the way in which interest is charged are differential, so we need some mechanism that can be applied by product. We need to establish a standard way of calculating interest. We may also require a standard way to present interest, and to state product by product the range of interest rates in the market, in real terms, rather than through what the card provider wishes to say. For example, we need to be able to say, &quot;The real rate of interest operating in the market for normal credit cards&mdash;apart from special offers of 0 per cent.&mdash;is between 8 per cent. and 28 per cent., and the median is about 16 per cent.&quot; By implication, therefore, anything outside that borders on the excessive.</p>

	<p>Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the state has the opportunity to be even more proactive? The hon. Member for East Carmarthen and Dinefwr (Adam Price) mentioned the role of credit unions. They could operate through every post office branch, and the Department for Work and Pensions&mdash;a major funder of the mechanism by which money reaches individuals through the financial system&mdash;could be encouraging the relationship to grow so that people could pay their money into credit unions and use them as a mechanism for borrowing, which would tremendously expand that movement, but also set a benchmark for the lower rates of interest that could be obtainable.</p>

	<p>I think that it is, and that is a point of difference. I might mention the fact that I have grave reservations about the Financial Services Authority, the establishment of which I supported and was somewhat involved in, in the House. Far from protecting consumers, it is often used as cover for saying that things are all right. I take the point that the <i>Sunday Mirror</i> and the &quot;debt on our doorstep&quot; campaign have raised, which is that the maximum charge on plastic should be no more than 25 per cent. more than the base rate&mdash;so currently 30 per cent.&mdash;and that the maximum for doorstep lending should be 80 per cent.</p>
	<p>The problem with that is that doorstep lending might be running at 40 per cent. or 50 per cent., which would make it much easier for people to say, &quot;Well, 80 per cent. is okay.&quot; That is a genuine concern. We are not disagreeing about the outcome, but we are offering a different way of achieving the same result. Our proposal is more dynamic and flexible, and would mean that the OFT could give notice as the market developed and say what it regarded as excessive, at a given time and for a particular product.</p>

	<p>I must confess that my proposals do not address that, although the issue is related to a comment that I made in an intervention on the hon. Member for Tewkesbury (Mr. Robertson). I have reservations about the OFT. We need to ask, &quot;Quis custodiet ipsos custodies?&quot; Who ensures that the OFT is trading or operating fairly? I take the point that the hon. Member for North-East Bedfordshire (Alistair Burt) made and I think that mechanisms are necessary. For instance, the Treasury Committee has done a good job and there may be other mechanisms. All I have done with my new clauses is try to give direction to the OFT, so that it does its job more effectively than it has in the past.</p>
	<p>My point, which I hope I have explained clearly, is that I agree that there ought to be a recognition of what are excessive and extortionate interest rates at any given time, and that the unfairness test can be applied to them. However, the only point of disagreement is on quoting a particular rate in the Bill, which denies flexibility and judgment over time, given the development of the market and different products.</p>

	<p>This has been an interesting debate and it reflects well on the House that we can have such a well informed debate, even when we hold different opinions.</p>
	<p>It is important that we discuss the issue, because even if we do not agree with what is proposed, the debate sends a message to the industry that it needs to deal with people fairly and compassionately. We all know that those who can least afford the higher interest rates are those most likely to have to pay them, which is a good reason to discuss the issue.</p>
	<p>Another good reason is that personal debt in increasing. Only this morning in <i>The Times</i> business section, there was a report on HBOS, which has announced that the value of its unsecured loans where borrowers are three months or more in arrears last year rose by more than 20 per cent., from &pound;1.4 billion to &pound;1.7 billion. That is a tremendous amount of money. HBOS figures also referred to borrowers with secured loans totalling &pound;952 million being three months or more in arrears, which was an increase of 100 per cent. in the past year. So debt and arrears are increasing. The reason for that is not necessarily the rate of interest that those people pay, but the point is relevant to this debate.</p>
	<p>Although the Bill is well intentioned and contains much that is good, there is a feeling that it lacks the teeth to address the issues that concern us. Although we accept that, as I am sure the Minister will say, such matters are covered by the unfairness test, which we support, we are concerned that we do not yet know what unfair means in that context. However, I shall return to that issue on a later amendment. There is a need for clarity on how we will address the problem of indebtedness, particularly among those who can least afford it.</p>
	<p>There are nevertheless a number of reasons, some of which have already been raised, why I cannot agree that having the Minister set the maximum level of interest rates is the way forward. One of the most important points, which has been mentioned, is that the rate of interest is not the only thing that matters. There are of course difficulties with agreeing on what that maximum rate should be. Indeed, as the hon. Member for Rhondda (Chris Bryant) said, if a maximum rate were set, lenders might be inclined to increase their standard rates to nearer the maximum than otherwise.</p>
	<p>The point, however, is that the interest rate is not the only thing that matters. The charges that often go with loans are what count. The ability, legal or not, of lenders to write letters when people have missed payments and charge them &pound;25, &pound;40 or whatever for the privilege of doing so is unfair. That adds to the cost of the loan. The interest rate is only one part, although it is of course an important part.</p>
	<p>We must also take into account companies that collect money on the doorstep&mdash;the hon. Member for Gordon (Malcolm Bruce) referred to that, rather than companies that lend on the doorstep&mdash;which can often provide a more flexible approach. Although the interest rates of those companies might be higher than what is found through the ordinary way of borrowing money, they may offer a more flexible service. They know their customers and can sometimes tell them that if they cannot pay one week, they can pay twice the next week. I accept that that can lead to problems, but the difficulty is not crucial when we are talking about amounts of only &pound;5 a week, for example. To take away the flexibility to benefit customers simply because the interest rate charged is higher than normal would be to miss the real problem.</p>
	<p>My main reason for opposing setting maximum rates of interest is that I do not consider that to be the Government's job. We must strike a balance between protecting consumers and making it impossible for people to get a loan or credit, even if they have to pay a bit more money. I believe in the free market. I accept that we have to regulate sometimes, but we must not over-regulate and allow the Government to interfere in every aspect of people's lives. The British people have a good deal of common sense, and we must allow them to borrow money at the rates that they deem acceptable.</p>
	<p>Questions have been raised about the transparency of interest rates, and to some extent that problem has been addressed by a statutory instrument. Much remains to be done in that regard, however, and I accept that we must protect vulnerable people, as lack of choice means that they are more likely to borrow at higher rates of interest than the rest of us.</p>
	<p>That said, we must leave the determination of interest rates charged on credit transactions to those who want to borrow and those who want to lend. I recognise that this matter needed to be debated, and those who tabled the new clauses have done so very competently. However, for the reasons that I have given, I cannot recommend to Conservative Members that they should support the new clause.</p>

	<p>I begin by adding my congratulations to those hon. Members who have contributed to the debate, which has been of a very high quality. Quite rightly, we have moved beyond the content of the new clauses to discuss other matters connected with the Bill, as consumer credit has not been looked at for more than 30 years. All sides of the argument generally accept that something needs to be done, given the maturity and development of the market.</p>
	<p>The hon. Member for Tewkesbury (Mr. Robertson) said that he believed in free markets, but the Government believe in fair and competitive markets. We believe that fairness is a vital component in this matter.</p>
	<p>The new clauses in this group all relate to interest rates. New clause 2 deals with interest rate ceilings, new clause 4 with interest rate calculations, and new clause 5 with the monitoring of interest rates. I shall deal with each proposal in turn, as they cover different aspects of the same theme.</p>
	<p>I am grateful to the hon. Member for East Carmarthen and Dinefwr (Adam Price), who said that he was committed to introducing a maximum rate of interest and who introduced a private Member's Bill on the subject last May. We may disagree on that, but I know that he wants to protect vulnerable people, and he will accept that that has been the spirit of this debate. All hon. Members are aware of the effect on our constituents of unfair credit and the difficulties that people can get themselves into.</p>
	<p>I slightly disagree with the hon. Member for Tewkesbury about debt levels and the proportion of disposable income spent on debt, but I do not want to go into that, as we are all working to the same goal. The Treasury Select Committee, the Treasury, the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux and various consumer groups, as well as the industry itself, have all done a great deal of work on financial inclusion. I also want to go on record with my thanks to &quot;debt on our doorstep&quot;. Although we disagree, its campaign has been important and I have met representatives from that organisation on several occasions. My right hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) has also been heavily involved in campaigns about debt.</p>
	<p>I am grateful for the work done by the <i>Sunday Mirror</i> and many other newspapers with sections devoted to financial advice. The campaign to ensure responsible lending and borrowing has been important, and provides the context for my response to these new clauses.</p>
	<p>I do not believe that imposing an interest rate ceiling is the right option at this time. As has been noted, such a ceiling could harm the very consumers whom we are trying to protect. The hon. Member for East Carmarthen and Dinefwr talked about the research carried out by the Government, which &quot;debt on the doorstep&quot; does not regard as perfect. However, the Policis research is very important, and I shall say more about that later. It shows that interest rate ceilings can lead to low-income consumers using products that are not suitable for their needs. Such products also make it difficult for consumers to control their levels of borrowing. For example, as the hon. Member for Tewkesbury said, they may include late-payment charges that are not part of the advertised interest rate.</p>
	<p>One of the proposals in this group of new clauses is that there should be a cap on high charges, but those charges do not need to be unreasonably high to cause problems for low-income consumers. Those are the people most likely to miss payments, and thus most likely to be charged. Even a charge that does no more than recover costs can be a problem if it is frequently incurred.</p>
	<p>The hon. Member for East Carmarthen and Dinefwr mentioned the research carried out by Policis, which found that interest rate ceilings exclude low-income consumers from the market. That prevents them from getting into debt, but the research shows that demand for credit among that group remained constant, whether or not a ceiling was in place.</p>
	<p>The hon. Member for East Carmarthen and Dinefwr raised a number of other matters to do with the Policis research, and I shall respond to them now. He said that &quot;debt on the doorstep&quot; had sought information under the freedom of information legislation. The inquiry was highly detailed, and I can confirm that the DTI has responded and that some documents have been sent off today.</p>
	<p>Other questions included the calculation of APRs. New regulations on credit advertising come into force on 31 May, introducing a single set of assumptions required for the calculation of those rates. As for the consultation with Professor Reifner, his research showed that low-income consumers in Germany did not have the same access to credit as their UK counterparts. That backs up the point that I made that ours is a mature and highly developed market.</p>
	<p>The DTI also looked at the situation in the Republic of Ireland, where the interest rate cap has been set at 200 per cent. People in Ireland take out fewer small and short-term loans, and the limited competition there has had an adverse effect on low-income consumers. The hon. Member for East Carmarthen and Dinefwr spoke about independent evidence in respect of the time scale for this matter. I shall return to that later, because I am committed to keeping an interest rate ceiling under review, even though we do not intend to introduce it today. In that context, all available information and research will be very helpful.</p>
	<p>The questions covered in the new clauses have been discussed by various consumer bodies. We have taken note of the observations from NACAB and the National Consumer Council, both of which oppose the introduction of interest rate ceilings. We do not want consumers to turn to illegal money lending, and we believe that that risk would increase if such ceilings were introduced.</p>

	<p>The hon. Gentleman will be aware that as a result of the consumer credit regulations that flowed from the White Paper, the summary box on such an agreement has now to be printed in a typeface that people can read. He is right, but this is where the test of unfairness comes into play. Under the Consumer Credit Act 1974, there was an extortionate credit test that was a very high hurdle for people to clear. The unfairness credit test reduces the height of that hurdle and will hopefully get the industry to act more responsibly, while at the same time making consumers more aware of what they need to do.</p>
	<p>Returning to new clause 4, the regulations that address the issue raised by the hon. Member for Gordon (Malcolm Bruce) come into force on 31 May. Removing this important information on the cost of credit from its location in the small print will help consumers to select the product that best suits their needs. We do not believe that standardising the way in which the interest is calculated and applied would benefit consumers, because doing so would eliminate consumer choice. Not all borrowers want to use credit in the same way, and they benefit from being able to choose a product that complements the way in which they organise their finances. For example, some credit card users will want a lower APR but will be prepared to pay interest from the date of purchase. Others will prefer a slightly higher APR but, if they do not settle the whole balance, will want to pay interest on the outstanding amount only. Provided that these aspects of the product are clearly highlighted&mdash;our new transparency provisions will require that&mdash;we believe that it is better to give consumers a choice of products. Standardisation may bring certainty, but it comes at the expense of flexibility and innovation and, ultimately, competitiveness and consumer choice.</p>
	<p>I understand the spirit in which the hon. Member for Gordon moved his new clause, and it will doubtless be reflected in the Bill's implementation and in the regulations to be introduced on 31 May. That said, I do not consider his new clause to be the appropriate way forward.</p>

	<p>I thank the Minister for his response. We are calling for transparency in the industry, and the way in which he has taken the Bill through the Commons has been open, transparent and fair.</p>
	<p>I shall respond briefly to some of the points that have been made in this interesting debate. The hon. Member for Rhondda (Chris Bryant) and others have asked whether the maximum rate would effectively become the going rate, which is the one argument that the Policis report, of which I have been very critical, knocked down. The report states that although many within the UK industry have made that case, no evidence exists to support it from the countries in which a maximum rate has been set.</p>
	<p>Another argument is that a cap could cause some lenders to move out of the market altogether, leaving a gap in the marketplace, which might force some people into the arms of illegitimate lenders&mdash;and to be fair, that argument holds some truth. The key issue is where one sets the cap. I do not claim to be an expert, but I have been told that some evidence suggests that the cap was set at too low a rate in the inefficient financial markets in some American states, which caused some of the problems that have been mentioned. The European experience, however, has been better.</p>
	<p>I have referred to my criticisms of the Policis report, which we do not need to examine in great detail, but I know that Professor Reifner has said that the report's specific conclusions in relation to Germany were absolutely incorrect, and he has provided the Department with evidence that proves that point. I do not know whether the hon. Member for Lichfield (Michael Fabricant) has seen a copy of the report, but the Sparkassen claim that the report is wrong, too. The concerns about the report must be addressed.</p>
	<p>I welcome the Minister's remarks. Both sides of the discussion have legitimate points to make, and both share the same ultimate objective. It is excellent that we can continue this dialogue by leaving the door open and that the Minister is interested in hearing and seeing independent evidence.</p>
	<p>One interesting question concerns the interrelationship between a maximum rate and an unfairness test. I am not a lawyer or parliamentary draftsman, so I cannot answer that question definitively. We used the phrase, &quot;widespread consumer detriment&quot; to avoid confusion around the unfairness test. We used another form of words to avoid directly influencing decisions on the definition of unfairness, but I accept that that matter must be thought through. I point to the example of the South African Department of Trade and Industry, which has introduced consumer credit legislation that performs both of those functions at the same time. The legislation introduced a cap on maximum charges as well as a new test of reckless lending. The South African example shows that it is possible to have both an unfairness test and a maximum rate. Although the details may be different, the principle of two mechanisms is clear in the South African legislation, and I cannot see why it is not possible to combine two such mechanisms in this Bill.</p>
	<p>Although greater clarity on interest rate charges and recourse to the courts will be useful to many consumers, I fear that the poorest consumers will not necessarily be able to avail themselves of either legal action or information and advice, which is why my party remains of the view that intervention by the Government in the form of a maximum rate is desirable to protect the most vulnerable.</p>

	<p>I thank the Minister for moving the amendment. There was clearly an anomaly in that, for historical reasons, the situations in Scotland and England differed. The Consumer Council has made representations to that effect. Clearly, accessibility will be made easier and cheaper than it was under the old unnecessary requirement. People can still use a solicitor or other professional if they wish, but they will be able to make their own choice about how to make representations, and that is very welcome. I am grateful to the Government for bringing Scotland into line.</p>

	<p>Given the subject matter of the amendment, I should declare an interest as a member of the Faculty of Advocates, even though it goes against that interest. Like the hon. Member for Gordon (Malcolm Bruce), I welcome the amendment and the fact that the Government have recognised the concern raised by several Members from Scotland when the issue was raised early during the Bill's process. Citizens Advice Scotland has taken the lead in pushing for the change and is pleased that the amendment has been tabled at this stage. I spoke to CAS representatives earlier this week and they were delighted.</p>
	<p>On the face of it, the amendment is a small one, but it will have important implications, together with the extra funding that the Government and the Scottish Executive are giving to the Money Advice Trust and organisations that work in the area. We should now see a bigger take-up of the opportunities given to those who represent debtors who find themselves in difficulties. The amendment is worth while and I am glad that the Government have tabled it. I commend the Minister for moving so quickly.</p>

	<p>I understand that point: whenever I go to Edinburgh airport I am accosted, and I am frequently accosted at Aberdeen airport, too. Usually, I am accosted by people on behalf of the best-known brand names: Shell promotes at Edinburgh, as does the Royal Bank of Scotland.</p>
	<p>I must balance what I am saying by adding that consumers, of course, have some responsibility and should have a sense of care for themselves. One could say that many people who get into difficulties do so knowingly, but they will say, &quot;The money was available and I could not resist the temptation or did not see how fast I was building up debt.&quot; We can say we have no sympathy for those people and ask why they do it. In reality, they could not have done it if the credit was not made so easily available. What I am trying to say is that we need to show the financial institutions that we expect them to take some responsibility by not putting that degree of temptation in the way of people who will get themselves into difficulty.</p>
	<p>In a particular case, covered, I think, in the <i>Sunday Mirror</i>, someone managed to take out &pound;125,000 on 11 credit cards and in six loans while on a salary of &pound;16,800. The person in question says that he was stupid and brought the situation on himself He describes how the heavy mob was effectively sent in. He says that the debt</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;will never go away, it will follow us until we die.&quot;</p>
	<p>It is awful when people get into such a situation. I am not suggesting that people should not be educated at school about personal finance and responsibility, which is a point made by the <i>Daily Mirror</i> and the &quot;debt on our doorstep&quot; campaign. Frankly, however, part of the education process should be undertaken by the providers of credit.</p>
	<p>First, such providers should always try to ascertain whether people can afford a product, so they should find out about people's circumstances by getting honestly presented evidence of their income and other loan obligations. Secondly, the providers should give advice about the appropriateness of their products. I am worried about the number of people who take out credit on credit cards when it would be much more appropriate to obtain such credit through a bank loan or another product that would be cheaper, more manageable, more organised and less likely to lead to considerable difficulties.</p>
	<p>Products are promoted not only when people are going on holiday, but through 0 per cent. introductory offers. I have already said that I am not against the 0 per cent. special offers&mdash;indeed, I have taken advantage of them. They are, however, an easy way of seducing people. People are encouraged to take out &pound;10,000 of credit with no interest to pay for six or even nine months. The problem is that they do not have the ability to pay after that time, so under the credit card companies' calculations, they must pay an interest rate of 15, 18 or 20-plus per cent. However, the companies do not say to people, &quot;Now that you are in this mess, you should convert the credit to a loan or a cheaper product.&quot; However, that goes slightly wide of the mark of my amendment.</p>
	<p>Amendment No. 21 would make it clear in the Bill that the providers of credit would be obliged to take reasonable steps to determine the circumstances of people to whom they provide credit. That suggests to me that unsolicited credit should not be offered without a second test. People such as the hon. Member for Rhondda (Chris Bryant) might well think that unsolicited credit offers should not be sent out at all, but I am not sure that I would want to inhibit product development in such a way. However, it should be made clear that such credit is being offered as long as the provider can satisfy itself that people have the ability to pay. The providers should make it clear to people that they have to answer specific questions satisfactorily before the credit is given.</p>

	<p>Yes, but there would be a reasonableness test. I agree with what I anticipate the hon. Member for Tewkesbury (Mr. Robertson) would say at this point. I want flexibility and choice in the marketplace. I am certainly not against special offers or inducements. A genuine offer of 0 per cent. interest for six months is a valuable commodity, provided that the price of a product is fair. If a person is buying a car for a given price and has one offer involving paying 0 per cent. interest for six months and another offer that would lead to charges immediately, one deal is incontrovertibly better than the other. I would not want to do anything to close such options. All I am asking is for the providers of credit to take reasonable steps to ascertain people's circumstances, thus protecting them from their lack of responsibility or self-control. I qualify that requirement with the words &quot;reasonably&quot; and &quot;inadequacy&quot;, which are used in the amendment.</p>
	<p>I think that the Minister will acknowledge that the expansion of such credit and the increase in bankruptcies, default and personal debt has much to do with the fact that it is excessively easy to access unsolicited credit. Such credit was not available 30 years ago. Credit was hard to come by then, not least because we had credit squeezes when the Government made things more difficult. I do not think that any of us want to go back to those days, but we want a little discipline. Frankly, the providers of credit are the people best able to achieve that, rather than the Government or a third-party regulator. We simply require a reasonable test of how people should pay for credit. People should also receive advice on the products that they require. Why should they pay credit card interest rates when they could pay bank loan rates? It is distasteful that banks encourage their own customers to take credit on credit cards when they could offer cheaper credit through other products.</p>
	<p>I imagine that the Minister will say that my amendment would have the disadvantage of qualifying the unfairness test, as he has said about other amendments. I understand that, but I hope that he accepts that my amendment is drafted in the spirit of many of the findings of the Treasury Committee. The Committee is not hostile to the expansion of credit or the availability, variety or flexibility of products, but it is worried that many people find themselves in serious financial distress because credit is too easily available and the providers of it do not determine responsibly whether people can afford it. They do that because they assume that they will get their money back from most people by using ruthless methods and making people's lives a misery, so they decide that the odd default will not matter given that the vast majority of people will struggle, but pay. However, for such people, the glamorous offer of credit that was supposed to enhance their quality of life leads to long-term misery. Surely we do not wish to encourage such a credit regime.</p>

	<p>I agree. The second half of my conversation with the Royal Bank of Scotland was to do precisely that. That is the telephone version of the unsolicited blank or filled-in cheque. I am sure that hon. Members will know about receiving a credit card cheque through the post. The individual thinks that it is probably more likely to be a credit card loan. He or she probably does not expect that interest will be charged from the moment that the cheque is paid into their bank account. The process deliberately makes taking out extra loans too easy, in my understanding.</p>
	<p>The hon. Member for Gordon (Malcolm Bruce) referred earlier to cheques that have a certain amount filled in, but I believe that blank cheques are even worse. On my HFS loan card I could actually fill in the amount on the blank cheque with whatever figure I wanted. I could pay it into my bank account and, lo and behold, from that moment I would be paying interest at a fairly high APR.</p>
	<p>All these problems are endemic in the industry, which needs to roll itself back from this position&mdash;partly for its own good, because there may come a time when interest rates rise and people find it much less affordable to sustain their present level of debt. The Minister rightly argued earlier that, as a percentage of people's income, the amount of money expended on servicing debt is now, because of lower interest rates, considerably less than it was 10 years ago. The truth is that if interest rates did have to rise for whatever reason, many people would find themselves hideously exposed, and the industry would find itself exposed, too. That is why the industry should do some of its own rolling back. Of course, many in the industry have written to us to say that they have already done some rolling back. The new banking code, which comes into practice this spring, imposes some further restrictions on what companies should or should not do.</p>
	<p>I will not support the amendment because of what I suspect the Minister will argue. I expect him to say that it would conflict with the unfair relationship clause, which we debated in Committee. I am nervous about the fact that so much is hanging on a fairly slender thread. We do not really know whether it will be a slender thread or a hefty rope capable of sustaining the weight. My metaphors are becoming too complex nowadays, Mr. Deputy Speaker, and I feel that I should draw my words to a conclusion.</p>
	<p>I hope that the Bill will manage to operate in precisely the manner outlined by the hon. Member for Gordon and that it will help to roll back these practices. I believe that they currently expose people to excessive risks. They are irresponsible and feckless. We want a mature industry that provides people with opportunities to manage debt responsibly, and we need to ensure that that is made possible for everyone in the country.</p>

	<p>I want to deal mainly with amendment No. 22, which relates to retrospection, but I also want to add a few thoughts about our debate on amendment No. 21, which was ably moved by the hon. Member for Gordon (Malcolm Bruce). He touched on many important issues and I agree that it is far too easy for people to take out credit these days.</p>
	<p>The hon. Member for Gordon rightly drew attention to the fact that when a &pound;150,000 mortgage is applied for, every nook and cranny will, quite rightly, be examined. It is a major commitment on behalf of the lender, as well as the borrower, which is why such an application is so seriously looked into. Unfortunately, that does not happen when someone wants to borrow just &pound;3,000. I know from private conversations that lenders do not really look into the proposal too seriously. If they lost one or two lots of &pound;3,000 here and there, they would still be making enough out of the interest on the many other lots of &pound;3,000 for it not to matter that much. They tend not to bother too much about applications for relatively small amounts. The problem is, of course, that people can borrow &pound;3,000 from this company, another &pound;3,000 from that company, and so forth. One lot of &pound;3,000 is not very much, but when they are all added together, it could represent a significant debt for an individual.</p>
	<p>I well understand how easy it is for people to get into great difficulty. While we were debating the Bill in Committee, I recall hearing a report on the &quot;Today&quot; programme&mdash;a very sad report that featured a widow whose husband had committed suicide because he had got into terrible debt as a result of having 22 credit cards. That really set the tone of debate in Committee. Tragic though it was, the radio programme did a useful service for our considerations, but we all wished that the tragedy had not happened in the first place.</p>
	<p>I was concerned about the issue and tabled an amendment on data sharing. Unfortunately, it was not selected, because it would have required many changes to the Data Protection Act 1998, which we are not considering; we are amending the Consumer Credit Act 1974. In it I sought to make it easier for lenders to share information on potential debtors. The credit reference agency carries many details on people who have defaulted or been late with payments or who have county court judgments. That is fine, but often they do not share information on how many credit cards people have or what their level of income is. That is where the problem begins because it is so easy to take out many credit cards.</p>
	<p>I do not wish to add to the anecdotes, but over Christmas I had such an experience. I bought several items from Marks and Spencer. I was not paying much attention to what I was doing. It was hot in the store and I just wanted to get out and get home. I ended up signing up to what I thought was just a points card but turned out to be a MasterCard, with which I could instantly spend up to &pound;7,500 anywhere in the country. I did not ask for that or want it. That is how easy it is to take out a credit card. The minimum number of checks was done. Presumably a credit check was carried out, but the store had no idea whether I had other credit cards and no proof of my income. I am probably reasonably safe with that credit card, but many people are not. In my amendment I wanted to enable lenders to have access to information in that situation.</p>

	<p>I am grateful to the Minister, but I do not entirely accept that putting something on the face of the Bill means that something is left out. I suppose that by definition it is, but it is possible to put on the face of the Bill some examples of what the courts might want to give credence to. That does not mean that the courts cannot look at other things as well. Many Acts of Parliament contain clauses that end by saying, &quot;and the Secretary of State shall do whatever else he thinks fit&quot;&mdash;I paraphrase, but I think we all recognise that such a provision appears in very many Acts of Parliament. I think it is called a Henry VIII clause or something like that. So I do not accept that stating some examples of what the court should take into account means that it cannot take into account other things.</p>
	<p>To summarise, I stress that we welcome the change from extortionate to unfair. We accept that some retrospection is necessary&mdash;perhaps even desirable&mdash;in this type of legislation, but we do regret the lack of detail as regards what constitutes an unfair agreement. We also regret the fact that retrospective legislation is effectively being introduced by the courts, and possibly the OFT and Ministers, but not Parliament. That is the point. It is, as I said in Committee, coining a phrase, &quot;a double whammy&quot;. It is retrospective legislation, introduced other than by Parliament. That cannot be the right way of carrying out what is generally appropriate legislation, and therefore I would ask the Minister to reconsider his approach in this respect.</p>

	<p>I have every sympathy with what the hon. Member for Gordon (Malcolm Bruce) said, and the spirit of the debate so far, but it seems to me that we are choosing the more difficult alternative of making increasingly complex definitions of what is fair without trying to cut through the knot.</p>
	<p>When I was taking the 1974 Act through Parliament, I appalled the credit reference agencies by announcing that for the first time they were going to be subject to the law of libel. At that time they literally depended on gossip&mdash;the local milkman, the local bread delivery man and so on&mdash;without verification. I remember being asked to go to Croydon to discuss it with them. I put it to them that if they could not get their act together, it was for them to bear the consequences; it was not for me to exempt them. In fairness, despite all their protestations that the credit reference agency industry was about to collapse, they actually did get their act together, have become very professional, and could become more professional.</p>
	<p>I hope that you will bear with me, Mr. Deputy Speaker, if you think that I am straying slightly from the amendment&mdash;I will be very brief. It seems to me that data sharing by the credit industry with the credit reference agencies is the way of cutting through the complexities of ever more amendments stating what is fair and what is not, trying to meet the manoeuvrings of the industry. Because if there is a focal point at which information is available, from which one is expected to obtain information on creditworthiness, and that body has collectively what no individual card issuer has&mdash;a knowledge of what other cards a customer has when he applies for his 50th or 60th or second or third&mdash;it would seem to me that that is the way through. I know that I have a very old-fashioned approach to legislation, but if it were me, I would be looking to credit reference agencies as a way of short-cutting to the objectives that we all hope to achieve.</p>
	<p>That is all I want to say; my apologies to the Minister for delaying him.</p>

	<p>I am delighted that my right hon. Friend the Member for Swansea, West (Mr. Williams) is in his place, and I congratulate him on the 1974 Act, which has stood the test of time. I understand that it took nearly six years to put that Act together. I spoke earlier about the maturity of the credit industry. Who would have recognised, when my right hon. Friend introduced that legislation, that the availability of products would change so dramatically? I shall refer later to the data sharing that my right hon. Friend talked about.</p>
	<p>I want to speak briefly to Government amendment No. 8, which is a minor technical amendment to clarify the wording of proposed new section 140A(4) of the Consumer Credit Act 1974. The new wording is more precise and makes it clear that the court would be able to apply any provisions where all or any of the parties had no further duties under a credit agreement covered by the new unfair relationships provisions. The amendment will not alter the test or change the circumstances in which the provision applies to agreements. It will clarify the wording to improve understanding.</p>
	<p>I understood clearly where the hon. Member for Gordon (Malcolm Bruce) was coming from when he outlined the proposals in his amendment No. 21. He spoke about marketing techniques and the need to provide education all the way through school about handling money and developing ideas about it, and it is amazing to me that although we teach youngsters about everything, money and how to handle it is not at the forefront of that. A lot of work is being done on that, not least with the new financial inclusion fund.</p>
	<p>An aspect of the Bill that I am passionate about is the momentum that we have developed, through the White Paper and surrounding issues, and the fact that there is an acceptance that things must change. We affect people's lives. The hon. Member for Tewkesbury (Mr. Robertson) raised the issue of the &quot;Today&quot; programme and the unfortunate case of the man who committed suicide. I have, as a Consumer Minister, had too many approaches for my liking from hon. Members with constituents who have had great difficulties and in some cases have committed suicide because of the spiral of debt that they have got into. Surely we have a responsibility to promote legislation to help to avoid that.</p>
	<p>The industry must have a job to do. The sentiments of the hon. Member for Gordon are right and proper. Perhaps he will expect me to say that the wording of the amendment is not quite right&mdash;I shall come to that a little later&mdash;but the message from all hon. Members is clearly that the industry must look at its marketing techniques and its responsibilities.</p>
	<p>We can and will pass legislation, and we try to do that in a way that is as business-friendly as possible, but supports consumer groups and consumers. The industry has a major role to play. The availability of credit is important to all the groups that we have mentioned, but it must be available on a responsible basis. The Bill will enable us to look at instances in which the industry does not operate properly.</p>
	<p>Data sharing is vital. At conferences that I have attended, the industry has raised the point that the Data Protection Act 1998 and other factors prevent the sharing of information, with, for example, credit reference agencies. I have made it clear that, as I have said already today, the 1998 Act should not be used as a barrier to the sharing of that information. I am pleased that work has been carried out with organisations such as the Finance and Leasing Association, that members of the Association for Payment Clearing Services agreed data-sharing principles in September 2004, and that the DTI has been discussing further measures to improve current levels of data sharing within the credit industry.</p>
	<p>As the Minister, I shall, as far as I can, ensure that we pursue the industry to honour its commitments to ensure that people cannot accumulate debts of low amounts on many different credit cards; I do not think that is acceptable.</p>
	<p>Clause 19 is wide enough to allow the courts to take into account the factors that the hon. Member for Gordon listed, as well as any other relevant matters. Therefore, amendment No. 21 is unnecessary. The unfairness test is concerned not with specific types of behaviour but with the unfairness of the relationship between the debtor and the creditor. It allows the courts to decide on the basis of the widest possible range of behaviour without being constrained by market practices or issues of concern. We want the test to be able to deal with the ingenuity of those seeking to exploit and harm consumers. Therefore, the court can consider the types of practice that the hon. Gentleman identified, and can provide remedies when such practices make the relationship unfair.</p>
	<p>The hon. Gentleman's amendment might even be unhelpful. It is vital that the proposals do not limit the court's discretion in matters of unfairness. That would serve to do two things: narrow the range of matters that the court will consider in determining whether something is unfair, and encourage a culture of minimum compliance by businesses, which operate on the basis that if the practice is not expressly outlawed in law, it is permitted. The hon. Gentleman's proposals would not enhance the test, are unnecessary given the breadth of the test, and may prove to be unhelpful to consumers by limiting the test's operation.</p>
	<p>I have set great store by this test. My hon. Friend the Member for Rhondda (Chris Bryant) said that it was a thin thread; I hope that it is more than that. It is a lower hurdle than the extortionate credit test in the 1974 Act, and will capture the core of what we are trying to achieve: responsible lending and responsible borrowing. If someone acts unfairly, they will be seen to be outside the spirit of what we are trying to achieve.</p>
	<p>Amendment No. 22 proposes that the new unfair relationships provisions should apply only to agreements made after commencement of those provisions. We have consulted widely on the issue and considered it carefully. It might help hon. Members if I explain precisely what the Government propose. Unfair relationships provisions will commence in line with the other provisions of the Bill, and we will consult on when that will occur. That means that the new test will apply to new agreements made from the date of commencement. The new test will apply to existing agreements after the end of the transitional period. We believe that that will give businesses time to adjust. The transitional period will last for at least 12 months after commencement.</p>

	<p>I appreciate the Minister's response and the terms in which it was couched. I did not say so when I introduced it, but I regard the amendment as probing. In fact, I agree completely with him about the unfairness test and the desire not to qualify it. On the other hand, I believe that when passing a Bill that updates 30-year-old legislation, it is important to have a proper debate about how it should be applied. In our debates, we are trying to give the authorities that are to implement the legislation some idea of our expectations regarding its application. The Minister is in a particular position, in that what he says carries some judicial force, whereas what the rest of us say has no consequence, but I am optimistic enough&mdash;some might say na-ve enough&mdash;to believe that the authorities that apply the legislation in such a specialist area will read the Committee proceedings and our debates to inform themselves about the thrust of what we are trying to achieve.</p>
	<p>Without putting words in his mouth, I think that the Minister has, in essence, gone as close as he can&mdash;without restricting the test's application&mdash;to stating the Government's view that consideration of the unfairness test should take on board the issues that have been raised. He knows that my colleagues and I favour the principle of applying the duty to trade fairly, or the duty not to trade unfairly, much more widely. In the present context, I agree with him: there is no point in having a test and then surrounding it with qualifications.</p>

	<p class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move, That the Bill be now read the Third time.</p>
	<p class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I would like to return briefly to the consumer credit White Paper, in which we said:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;We want a modern framework that encourages and rewards vigorous competition, innovation, choice and enterprise, while stamping out irresponsible and unfair lending practices.&quot;</p>
	<p>I hope that hon. Members agree that the Government have produced a Bill that not only fulfils those commitments but in many cases goes beyond them. It is the keystone of the most ambitious reform of consumer credit legislation since the Consumer Credit Act 1974 was introduced. Its passage through the House has justified the Government's position on all counts. I would like to thank hon. Members from all parts of the House for their contributions. In particular, I am grateful to the hon. Member for Bournemouth, West (Sir John Butterfill) and my hon. Friend the Member for Bootle (Mr. Benton) for their effective joint chairmanship of the Committee. I am also grateful to the hon. Members for Tewkesbury (Mr. Robertson) and for Gordon (Malcolm Bruce), as well as everyone else who served on the Committee.</p>
	<p>I am extremely encouraged by the support that the Bill has received from consumer groups, the industry and Members from all parts of the House. That support is reflected in the speed with which it has progressed through Parliament. Second Reading provided an insight into problems experienced by both consumers and the industry. In Committee, we had discussions of more specific and detailed concerns. In our final debate, I would like to conclude discussion on matters of particular interest, including unfair credit relationships. Hon. Members will recall the extreme care that I took in explaining the concept of unfairness.</p>

	<p>If my hon. Friend can wait a few moments, I shall come to credit card cheques and what the Government intend to do about them. However, I pay tribute to him and to the Treasury Committee for their work in exposing the issue in the context of responsible lending.</p>
	<p>The Bill provides a regime that is based on fairness for consumers and competition for the industry, and which gives regulators the powers they need to keep it that way. Those proposals are not a luxury addition to the Bill but are vital and necessary foundations on which to build a modern and effective consumer credit market now and in the future.</p>
	<p>Unfortunately, misconduct will be found in almost any market, and the consumer credit market is no exception, so the Bill ensures that proportionate sanctions are available to the regulators. The importance of those sanctions is not simply that they punish wrongdoing; it is that they are a flexible deterrent to unscrupulous lenders, now and in the future.</p>
	<p>If we enable the regulators to penalise misconduct, we must also enable consumers to resolve disputes for themselves. That means introducing a system that is cheap, fair and easy to use. The alternative dispute resolution system is all of those things. Not only will it empower consumers to act with confidence in the market, it will ensure stable competition throughout the credit sector, now and in the future.</p>
	<p>Hon. Members will be aware how successful the Bill was in Committee. That was due not simply to the hard work of my hon. Friend the Member for West Bromwich, East (Mr. Watson), who unfortunately is not in his place, but to the contribution made by all hon. Members with the detailed knowledge that they brought to the Bill at all its stages.</p>
	<p>I hope that the Government listened to what was said&mdash;and we shall continue to do so. That is highlighted by two additional commitments that I have made in response to my hon. Friend the Member for Warwick and Leamington (Mr. Plaskitt). In any market there are often key factors beyond even the control of the regulators&mdash;factors that have the potential to cause consumer detriment. I have acted on the wishes of many and have committed the Government to looking further into the issue of credit card cheques and their unsolicited nature, under secondary legislation. In addition, comments from consumer groups and Members from Scotland have prompted me to act on the issue of lay representation in Scotland. That is another example of the Government listening to and acting on what people say.</p>
	<p>It does not matter where one lives or what one does, consumers should all have the same rights. I hope that I have clarified and reaffirmed the Government's position on some of the more significant points of the Bill. I have no doubt that we will revisit them further, both now and as the Bill progresses through the other place. I hope that it progresses through the other place as swiftly as possible, whatever the Prime Minister's thinking on the date of the general election. I would be sad to see the Bill thwarted in the other place, for whatever reason. The momentum that we have established is important. The industry, consumer groups and all those affected by the Bill understand the need for the discussions to continue. If the Bill were not enacted, that would be to the detriment of consumers, and the industry would not be clear, and would be unable to deal with its rogues.</p>
	<p>The Bill is an important package of reform. It caps the work that has been done over the past four years and brings together the Government's proposals for a 21st-century consumer credit market. It delivers everything that we set out to achieve. It benefits consumers, industry and the regulators, it promotes responsibility and fairness across the sector, it encourages effective competition, and it allows for comprehensive and unbiased enforcement. I commend it to the House.</p>

	<p>I pay tribute to the Minister for his steadfast conduct of the Bill on the basis of careful consideration and patient dealing with the questions raised. I also pay tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Tewkesbury (Mr. Robertson), who has worked diligently to ensure that the issues have been properly considered, as well as to all my right hon. and hon. Friends who have served on the Committee.</p>
	<p>It has been just over 30 years since the last Consumer Credit Act. Since then the credit market has undergone a process of rapid and radical transformation. The liberalising reforms of the last Conservative Government not only opened up financial markets, but brought new opportunities and new sophistication to consumer behaviour. In general, and importantly in the context of this Third Reading debate, during the past 30 years consumers have become more and more powerful in driving the marketplace. Effective access to credit is indispensable to economic growth. It not only provides a way for people to manage their finances; it enables risk taking and entrepreneurialism, which in turn, via Government revenue, pay for schools and hospitals.</p>
	<p>The present legislative framework governing the consumer credit market might have been adequate for a world in which only one type of credit card was available, but it is certainly not adequate for a world in which there now exists a choice between more than 13,000 such cards. In particular, it is apparent that the extortionate credit test provides, at worst insufficient, and at best unclear, protection to consumers. Indeed, only 10 cases have succeeded under that test since the Consumer Credit Act 1974 was passed.</p>
	<p>As the legislation has become increasingly dated and unsatisfactory, the problem of consumer debt becomes more acute. I am sure that we all know from our constituency casework of debt-related problems tackled by citizens advice bureaux, which do an outstanding job, especially on managing debt that has become difficult or unsustainable, on behalf of our constituents. The number of problems with which the CABs deal has risen by 75 per cent. since 1997. Under the Government, the savings ratio has almost halved and, in 2004, household debt broke the &pound;1 trillion barrier for the first time. As the Bank of England recently warned, with consumer credit running at approximately &pound;1.5 billion a month and increasing by 15 per cent. every year, we are</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;building up vulnerabilities for the long term&quot;.</p>
	<p>For all the reasons that I have outlined, I made clear on Second Reading my strong support for a new consumer credit Bill to crack down on unscrupulous lenders, make credit agreements more transparent, and provide consumers with an effective means of redress for unfair credit agreements. However, the support of Her Majesty's Opposition was not&mdash;and never is&mdash;unconditional. There are genuine and important anxieties about the Bill's timing, the manner of its passage through Parliament, and the significant but somewhat ill defined powers that it will transfer from Parliament and thereby from people&mdash;the consumers&mdash;to a policing regulator, who, by definition, is remote from consumers.</p>
	<p>The Prime Minister described the Bill as</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;an important piece of legislation&quot;,</p>
	<p>but the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry was not here either for today's debate or on Second Reading. However, like me, she was here for Trade and Industry questions earlier today. Her absence is therefore by choice. Of course, I cast no aspersions on the Under-Secretary who is in his place, but we must draw our own conclusions about why the Secretary of State felt that it was not important to present and defend her Bill, which the Prime Minister described as</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;an important piece of legislation&quot;.</p>
	<p>I fear that the problems of consumer credit and debt are too low a priority for her to trouble to come to the House and take responsibility for the measure.</p>
	<p>Although I am conscious of the strong tone of happy consensus on many aspects of the measure&mdash;I am not necessarily about to fracture that spirit&mdash;it is our duty to point out when things are not what they seem and especially when they are not supportable. The delay in introducing the Bill to tackle the menace of unsustainable delay can be explained by the fact that the Government are demonstrably incapable of maintaining spending in line with the growth of the economy, with the inevitable tax rises that that would entail should they be re-elected. I hope that that will not happen.</p>
	<p>The delayed and subsequently somewhat hurried timing&mdash;I am sure that that has nothing to do with the proximity of a general election&mdash;is at least partly because the EU Commission has just announced a consultation on a new draft consumer credit directive. Consumer credit legislation is like buses: you wait for more than 30 years for a new law and then two come along at once. Moreover, the proposed new directive will cover unfair terms, contractual information requirements, licensing of creditors and credit intermediaries. The directive and the Bill therefore deal with similar if not identical issues.</p>
	<p>Parallel legislative proposals from the UK Government and the EU Commissions hold a danger of creating a confused and duplicating legislative structure that places unnecessary burdens on business. That is an especially sensitive matter, given the Government's serious reservations, which I acknowledge, about the draft consumer credit directive. The Department of Trade and Industry's consultation on the directive, which was published last month, stated that the Government</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;continues to have concerns with the current draft Directive. We believe that some of the proposals place unnecessary burdens on business.&quot;</p>
	<p>It goes on to press for</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;substantial amendments to specific provisions contained in the Directive to ensure an appropriate balance between costs to business and benefits to consumers&quot;.</p>
	<p>One such provision that the Government would like deleted from the directive is the proposed duty on lenders to advise consumers of appropriate credit products. I hope that the Minister will confirm that the Government, for once, will stand up for British business and make it clear to the Commission that they will not implement the directive in the UK if the amendments that they seek are not adopted.</p>

	<p>I am grateful to my hon. Friend, but his intervention should not be interpreted as a criticism of the diligence and expertise of those officials who must deal with the implementation of EU directives into UK law. Although I do not want to go too far down this road, my hon. Friend's question is pertinent and deserves a direct answer. Reconciling administrative and legal systems in all EU member states presents a permanent challenge. In Britain, our legal system causes us to adopt an approach based on means as well as on ends. By contrast, member states in continental Europe have inherited legal systems based more on the Napoleonic code, which leads them to prescribe the ends and to leave the means to discretion.</p>
	<p>The British approach causes us to gold-plate directives, as my hon. Friend the Member for Lichfield (Michael Fabricant) said, and to over-implement them. That is becoming a menace, as it applies friction to the competitiveness of British business. The directive in question directly contradicts some of the proposals in the Bill, and it is important that we draw attention to that. I know that the Government are seized of that already, as they have made their representations on the matter known, but it is worth putting the issue on the record.</p>

	<p>I understand why the Government have made the judgment that they have made, but I am sure that the Minister will accept that this is a matter of principle and that it is right, in a Third Reading debate, to ensure that it is placed on the record.</p>
	<p>Representations were made to the Government during the consultation process, but the Minister will know that the industry is constantly in touch with members of all parties on these matters. That is understandable, as it sometimes feels that the consultation process with the Government does not carry great weight and that another approach has to be adopted to ensure that matters are given an appropriate airing. The tendency to gold-plate directives identified by my hon. Friend the Member for Lichfield, and the potential discord over implementation are worth putting on the record, not least so that those in the other place are aware of all the issues that have been raised in this debate when it is their turn to consider this Bill.</p>
	<p>As I said, the burdens imposed by this Bill on the consumer credit industry are not insignificant. According to the Department of Trade and Industry's website:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;licence fees will approximately double to around &pound;220 over five years for sole traders and to &pound;550 for incorporated bodies . . . There are also new requirements for provision of post-contract information, which we estimate to be around &pound;1,000 one-off for a small business, &pound;5,000 for an intermediate business and &pound;20,000 for a large business.&quot;</p>
	<p>I am also concerned that implementing the provisions in the forthcoming EU consumer credit directive will further jeopardise one of the Bill's aims. I took note of the Minister's saying that the issues under discussion are, in his view, largely outside the scope of the directive as it is anticipated, but that the idea is to make it much easier to challenge unfair loan agreements. On that point, we coincide.</p>
	<p>Already under this Bill, there are at least three ways of dealing with unfair or inappropriate lending practices that affect consumers. They can challenge unfairness through the new &quot;unfair relationships&quot; provisions in clauses 19 to 22. Under clauses 59 to 61, they can take disputes to the Financial Ombudsman Service for resolution. Alternatively, they can complain to the OFT or to their local trading standards authority, which, under the Bill, have enhanced powers to deal with lenders through a reformed licensing system.</p>
	<p>I am not sure that the Government have necessarily considered the confusion that this array of options could cause for consumers. So I hope that the Minister will explain the basis on which consumers are expected to make an informed choice between the courts, the FOS, the OFT and their local trading standards authority. I hope that he will also confirm today that there are no plans to introduce further options for challenging unfair agreements, if and when the new directive is transposed into UK law. The current options in the Bill seem more than sufficiently widespread, and could already lead to lack of certainty and confusion.</p>
	<p>It is possible to argue that the Government's motive in introducing this Bill and its rather rushed passage through Parliament are unimportant issues. Of course, people will draw their own conclusions, but given the need for such legislation and the general support for it from the official Opposition, from the minor political parties and from business organisations and consumer groups, should we not simply trust this Government, take their word for it and rubber-stamp the Bill? The answer, of course, is no: we cannot and we should not. It is not possible, in my view, to trust a word that this Government say any more, particularly given their addiction to presentation. Moreover, we must scrutinise the Bill as best we are permitted&mdash;in this House and in the other place&mdash;given this Government's command of the parliamentary timetable. We owe that to those who back the principle behind the Bill&mdash;as, indeed, do we&mdash;but who have serious and justified doubts about some of the detail, or lack of it.</p>
	<p>In particular, the provisions relating to unfair relationships and the OFT's new licensing regime have given the consumer credit industry cause for concern. As I made clear on Second Reading, I share reservations about the wording of&mdash;if not the intention behind&mdash;the relevant parts of the Bill, and I also believe that both these provisions reflect this Government's potentially unsatisfactory habit of seeking to empower regulators in order to absolve themselves of all possible blame. This has the twin effect of encouraging regulatory creep&mdash;the flow of regulations has increased by 50 per cent. under Labour&mdash;and of dispersing and undermining proper parliamentary accountability.</p>
	<p>The major Government regulators now spend three times the amount spent before Labour took office, with twice the number of bureaucrats. It is surely unacceptable that, on top of this, the regulators' regulator, the so-called Better Regulation Task Force&mdash;a highly questionable title&mdash;is forced to admit that there are now so many regulators that no one in government knows how many there are.</p>
	<p>Returning to the &quot;unfair relationships&quot; provisions in clauses 19 to 22, it is surely a statement of the obvious to say that good regulation&mdash;not to mention the comparative &quot;better regulation&quot; favoured by the Government&mdash;should set out clearly and simply what is intended and what the obligations of business will be in order to meet the new requirements. The CBI has made clear its view:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;Clause 19, which sets out the substance of the new test, is too wide and too imprecise to bring about necessary certainty and clarity in the legislation. This is particularly when it is combined with Clause 22 (4) which states that when an agreement is challenged on the grounds of an unfair relationship it will be for the creditor to prove to the contrary. This is extreme and provides far too high a burden on traders.&quot;</p>
	<p>This lack of clarity is also a serious problem for parliamentarians, who are unable to fulfil their democratic duty to scrutinise Government legislation, as well as for businesses, which face uncertainty as to their new obligations. For those reasons, I specifically asked the Minister on Second Reading for his assurance that OFT guidance on draft relationships&mdash;it is important to make it clear that I am referring to the guidance on draft relationships, not the guidance on fitness&mdash;would be made available before the Bill entered Committee. I would be happy if the Minister were to correct me, but as I understand it, although the OFT draft guidance on fitness was provided in Committee, the guidance on unfair relationships was not. According to the Library, where I checked yesterday, that guidance, which I was promised on Second Reading, was not available in Committee.</p>
	<p>I hope that the Minister will produce that guidance. The matter is important, because it raises the suspicion that the OFT is not ready and has not thought the matter through. I am sure that the OFT is the last organisation that would want to embarrass the Minister, who wanted to make all the information available, and I hope that the explanation does not involve incompetence. We must see the draft OFT guidance on unfair relationships. My hon. Friend the Member for Tewkesbury used the guidance on fitness in Committee, and he has kept me fully informed.</p>
	<p>Whatever the reason why the guidance on unfair relationships was not produced, it damaged our ability to scrutinise the Bill. The Minister is surrendering authority to a regulator that clearly feels no urgent duty to be accountable via him to this House and to the citizens, consumers and businesses represented by hon. Members. I am sure that the other place will focus on that issue, and if the OFT has still not lived up to the Minister's promise, their lordships will be justified in being highly critical and in considering delaying the passage of the Bill. I hope that a delay will not be necessary, but the matter will be taken seriously in the other place.</p>
	<p>We all know that the absence of necessary detail makes for bad law, and that is also true of the retrospective implementation of the unfair relationships provisions for all existing agreements following a 12-month transitional period. As the guidance in the 1974 Act on extortionate arrangements is being repealed, until the new legislation is tested in the courts, companies have no clear idea of which adjustments they should make. I acknowledge the point about transitional arrangements, but the legislation is designed to enable companies in particular to achieve clarity and certainty, which is why the guidance should be on the face of the Bill.</p>
	<p>The unsatisfactory provisions on extortionate credit are being replaced with, at least in the short term, a legal vacuum. The Council of Mortgage Lenders has said:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;This flies in the face of assurances from DTI as late as September 2004 that while retrospection would be adopted in principle, lenders would not be financially liable for mistakes occurring before the Bill became law.&quot;</p>
	<p>Members of the Committee and I have received numerous representations in the same vein from across the consumer credit industry.</p>
	<p>The amendments tabled by the official Opposition would have avoided uncertainty for businesses by ensuring that the provisions would not apply to agreements which were established before the Bill's enactment, and I regret the fact that that the Government did not have the good sense to adopt them. I am confident that their lordships will study the advocacy of my hon. Friend the Member for Tewkesbury in representing those concerns and in providing the Government with an opportunity to restore clarity, fairness and balance in line with the long-held principle and custom that legislation should not, save in the most exceptional cases, apply retrospectively. I foresee that that particular issue will consume much of their lordships' time and expertise, and it could delay the passage of the Bill, although I hope that the Government will avoid that outcome. That serious concern remains unresolved, however, and it continues to generate many representations to me and my hon. Friend.</p>
	<p>The OFT guidance on licensing is available, which is all the more the reason why the guidance on unfair relationships should have been available in Committee. The issue remains that the Secretary of State and the Government will have no direct influence over the OFT once the Bill has transferred powers away from this place. I am not often to be found arguing that Secretaries of State should be given further statutory powers, still less that they should do any more &quot;nannying&quot;. However, it should not be forgotten that an independent regulator and a Department of state have very different remits. The Department of Trade and Industry has a responsibility to promote the health of the consumer credit industry and business competitiveness in general, while the OFT has a duty, and consequently a regard, only to protect the consumer. There are therefore consequences of transferring powers in the way proposed in the Bill.</p>
	<p>I regret that the Government have resisted the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Tewkesbury that would have given the Secretary of State the right by order, subject to affirmative resolution, to vary guidance to the OFT, or issue further guidance, about the issuing of standard licences. Where guidance exists, it appears to be beyond accountability to Parliament; where it does not exist, there is no possibility of adequate scrutiny.</p>
	<p>In Committee, the Minister told my hon. Friend that he did not entirely challenge the statement that the Bill was &quot;wholly vague&quot;. That sounds to me like a polite way&mdash;the Minister is unquestionably polite&mdash;of partly accepting that the Bill is partly vague. I agree with that. I support the Bill on the basis that the present legislation is badly in need of revision, but I regret the fact that consumers, businesses and Members deserve and require more detail than has been provided in the Bill, particularly on its face. I am confident that the other place will carefully note those concerns, which centre on the Government's reluctance to publish the OFT guidance, at least in draft, in relation to unfair relationships. That is integral to proper consideration of the Bill. In addition, there are the Government's inadequate attempts to justify breaking from long held and well founded parliamentary convention not to legislate retrospectively so long as it is unclear what companies need to do.</p>
	<p>I was struck by interventions during the last group of amendments on Report. The Minister was, in an adjective I used at the outset of my remarks, steadfast in resisting publishing a list of what companies have to do. He was supported by the hon. Member for Gordon (Malcolm Bruce) in the suggestion that there is a cultural issue, which, at least in part, there unquestionably is, but it would be helpful to know whether he has a list that he thinks it would be unhelpful to publish or whether there is no list at all. If there is none, I am even more concerned that the Government are taking a deliberate risk and that it is being left to the courts to set benchmarks, standards and precedents. Inevitably, the difficulty will be that that will be piecemeal. We cannot predict what set of circumstances, what facts, and which plaintiffs and defendants&mdash;with what financial resources&mdash;will go all the way through to the courts.</p>
	<p>I hope that the Minister will take note of that important consideration, and that it will get a broader airing in the other place. On that basis, and anticipating their Lordships' consideration, we are content to let the Bill proceed and do not wish to divide the House. We wish the Bill well, but we wish for further clarity and detail in future.</p>

	<p>I congratulate the Government on an important Bill. From my constituency I know&mdash;and others in the House will feel the same&mdash;that all too many families and individuals have been caught in a vicious cycle of debt that has made ordinary family life impossible. Sometimes, that may be their own fault, and sometimes there are feckless buyers and borrowers. However, in many instances the consumer credit industry has been reckless in the way in which it affords loans and hands out credit cards, making it all too tempting for people to run up debts that they cannot afford and that the credit card companies and loan providers did not know whether they could afford.</p>
	<p>I am grateful to the Government for bringing forward the Bill and to the Minister for the way in which he has handled it. I also thank him for listening to much of our debate in Committee. Although we have not been able to tempt him down the road of being explicit about what he understands to be an unfair relationship, he has none the less made it fairly clear that he hopes that the law will be used robustly and that we will thus row back from the vicious cycle of more loans and debts that are doled out irresponsibly.</p>
	<p>After listening to the speech made by the hon. Member for Eddisbury (Mr. O'Brien), I felt that he had not been kept well abreast of what was debated in Committee&mdash;perhaps he could have listened more carefully to his colleague, the hon. Member for Tewkesbury (Mr. Robertson). He inveighed against the Government, albeit in his usual charming way, by saying that unfair relationships are still too vague under the Bill, but he missed the point that the Minister tried to make. If we were to make the provisions too precise, there would be the danger that we would not row back from the culture of over-indebtedness that has grown up over the past 30 years.</p>
	<p>The hon. Member for Eddisbury said that the Bill had been hurried through the House. The programme motion allowed for eight Committee sittings, but we needed only four to provide absolutely adequate scrutiny of the Bill. We had a full exploration of many important issues, so his comments were rather unfair. However, I think that it should be hurried through the next part of its passage so that it will arrive on the statute book.</p>

	<p>I suggest that regulation by Parliament, when we can debate it and when it is in the Bill, would be far better. I ask the hon. Gentleman to comment, if I am in order in doing so, on the closing remarks of the hon. Member for Rhondda (Chris Bryant). For the courts to consider whether something is unfair, it will largely be up to the debtor to take the issue to court. I think that I am right in saying that. How many debtors will have the confidence to take a matter to court when it is not even established what will constitute an unfair relationship or agreement? Does the hon. Gentleman agree with me on that point?</p>

	<p>My understanding is that the debtor can take the matter through various routes&mdash;through the Office of Fair Trading, through trading standards or through the ombudsmen. There are various mechanisms. Given the representations that we have had from a variety of interest groups, it seems that test cases will almost certainly be taken up on their behalf. I do not want to be contentious. I think that the Government have set a framework and an approach that is constructive and worth trying. In my view, it might well lead to lower rather than higher levels of regulation.</p>
	<p>I have expressed the view before that the Office of Fair Trading often disappoints us, but we have tried to give that body a framework and a clear understanding of what the Bill is designed to achieve, which it should be able to apply. We hope that it will then produce the practical results that we want, which is to bear down on extortionate and excessive interest rates, to ensure a spread of information better to enable people to take appropriate decisions about credit, and to discourage lenders from reckless lending.</p>
	<p>We have debated all those matters and amendments have been tabled and discussed. We concluded&mdash;as far as I am concerned, by consensus&mdash;that we want the unfairness test to make all that happen and we want better practice established in a relatively short period of time. The reality is that we either do it that way or write every single bit directly into the Bill. From the start, we all accepted, including Conservative Members, that the Bill provides a way forward. Conservatives have always had some reservations but, at the end of the day, we have to go one way or the other: there is no halfway house that could operate consistently. As I have already made clear, my party believes that the ideas of reasonableness and fairness have a wider application and I would contend that they should lead to lower rather than higher regulation. The practice will no doubt test the argument and I am pleased that we will be able to proceed in that way.</p>
	<p>I should like to acknowledge the role of my hon. Friend the Member for Richmond Park (Dr. Tonge), who is unable to be with us today, but who made a useful contribution in Committee. On a slightly wider basis, I should also like to mention my hon. Friends the Members for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb), a member of the Treasury Committee, and for Twickenham (Dr. Cable). They have both been active in making the case for this legislation to combat some of the abuses in the credit market and I appreciate their contributions.</p>
	<p>I am rather intrigued by the style and approach of the hon. Member for Eddisbury (Mr. O'Brien), who comes to this place, rebukes the Secretary of State for not being present&mdash;I make no comment on that&mdash;and characteristically enters the debate towards the end, making a long and, frankly, boring Third Reading speech, which bore very little relation to our preceding debate. He then raises some issues that have been discussed&mdash;in particular, he expressed his concern about the need to review regulation. I tabled amendments expressly to deal with that matter, yet the hon. Gentleman's party tabled no such amendments. If he is so concerned about regulation, why did he not ensure that some amendments were tabled about it? <i>[Interruption.]</i> What I am saying is most certainly right.</p>
	<p>I hope that the issue of regulation will crop up again in the other place. Although I cannot order my noble Friends what to do, I want to make it clear, on behalf of my party, that we support the Bill and want it to come into law. We certainly do not want it to get caught up in any of the other arguments that might well be happening in the other place. Such amendments as my noble Friends table will be designed simply to improve the Bill, and the matter of regulation and its review could be one that they will want to deal with further.</p>
	<p>I believe that the spirit in which the Bill has proceeded through the House has been extremely constructive. Many of us do not look forward to taking a Bill through its Committee stage: it is not always the most inspiring part of our work and it can be time consuming and somewhat tedious. However, that has not been the case with this Bill. It has been an interesting and lively process throughout.</p>
	<p>I should like to express my appreciation of the Minister's considerable courtesy. Throughout the different stages of the Bill, he made regular contact with me and, I am sure, with other Members, to inform us of progress and liaise in order to ensure the smooth progress of the Bill. We have all had the opportunity to express our views in an orderly and constructive way. I have to say that the Government could well use the Minister in other Departments&mdash;<i>[Interruption.]</i> What I am saying is that not every Minister is as diligent and attentive to taking a Bill through Parliament as this Minister has been. It is greatly appreciated. I believe that it helps the Government, the parliamentary process and&mdash;<i>[Interruption.]</i> I seriously believe that it helps us to produce better legislation and I am happy to put that on the record.</p>
	<p>The Bill will make an important contribution. I shall follow the operations of its mechanisms with interest. I hope that they will be a model for how other matters can be dealt with. I repeat that the outcome should be lighter, not heavier, regulation. I hope that that will happen. It is a good Bill and I am happy to support it.</p>

	<p>I should like to tell the House a story about several hundred Lords and an ordinary person. I have observed the hard work done here today and I have followed it in Committee, and before Members go off for their well-earned rest, they deserve to be tucked in with my story.</p>
	<p>The story concerns an ordinary constituent, Mr. Frederick Jones, who wanted to improve his house, do a better job for his family and ensure that his wife was well looked after. To do that he borrowed &pound;8,500. He now owes &pound;123,000. That is not a fairy story; more like a nightmare.</p>
	<p>Today's Third Reading gives Mr. Jones some hope of a happy ending. I will not give the House the full details of the long story, which stretches over seven or eight years to my certain knowledge. It has been a nightmare for Mr. Jones. He has done nothing to deserve the treatment that has been meted out to him. Indeed, he has paid the original loan many times over. I believe that he has paid back something like &pound;24,000 already on an &pound;8,500 loan.</p>
	<p>The hon. Member for Gordon (Malcolm Bruce) referred to being stuck in Committee. Sometimes it is not the greatest parliamentary perk available. It is hard work. I hope, however, that Committee members feel that their work is valued, not just by other Members, but by many constituents, supporters of Conservative, Labour, Liberal and other parties, throughout the land. All hon. Members have stories similar to that of my constituent. Those people are right to look to us for redress. It is one of the main functions of the House. Committee members and Front-Bench spokesmen have done a great service in their hard-working Committee for many people.</p>
	<p>Several hundred Lords who enter this story at a late point have a great deal on their plate. There are grand issues of state, matters of fundamental import to our democracy and great constitutional issues. As many colleagues have said today, we hope that they do not allow those issues to overtake and suffocate the good work that the Committee and the Chamber have done in progressing the Bill to Third Reading. I hope that the Bill does not become a party political football and get lost in the maelstrom of events in the other place.</p>
	<p>One might say ungenerously that their Lordships may not be involved too much in this end of the loan market and that they might not have personal experience of taking out loans from, not a loan shark&mdash;let us call a shark a shark. One might stereotype them and say that they are not particularly interested in this. I refute and reject that. They are interested. I hope that, despite the significant issues on their plate, they consider the story of Mr. Jones while these high matters of state fly between the two Chambers. I hope that they consider seriously the possible rescue of Mr. Jones from his predicament.</p>
	<p>The main reason why I ask their Lordships to think seriously about the issue relates to the important clause on retrospection. We all heard the Meadows family case. It was the fundamental case in reviving the possibility of a reasonableness test on whether a loan was extortionate. I welcome that, and it will be a great relief to many of my constituents. I hope that those who take out loans in future will have a strong rope&mdash;the bonds that have already been referred to&mdash;to help them through any difficulties.</p>
	<p>Retrospection is important for another group of people who, like my constituent, went through the legal process prior to our consideration and prior to the Meadows case. They are entirely dependent on retrospection to obtain justice in their various cases. Much as my constituent wishes the Bill to go forward to help other people, he is dependent on retrospection, as are so many others, to help him to obtain justice. Just looking at the figures&mdash;a loan of &pound;8,500 resulting in a debt of &pound;123,000&mdash;is case enough to make to their Lordships, and I hope that they would consider that seriously.</p>
	<p>Even as an outsider, in that I was not a member of the Committee, although I followed its proceedings carefully, I would like to place on record my thanks for the way in which it conducted its business, and I particularly thank the Minister, who did not just follow his brief but clearly cares about the issues concerning my constituent that I have been trying to raise with him for some time. I also thank the hon. Member for Tewkesbury (Mr. Robertson) for the way in which he marshalled his arguments in Committee, and other members of the Committee.</p>
	<p>The way in which the matter has been dealt with so far shows the exemplary way in which the House helps individuals throughout the country. I hope that their Lordships will take that responsibility equally seriously and give the Bill a fair wind so that it can help people like my constituent.</p>

	<p>This Third Reading debate epitomises where we need to be with the Bill and its effect on our constituents. We all know constituents with tremendous debt and credit problems. I shall put the matter in context. We have discussed how matters have evolved since the 1974 Act with increased confidence because we have had a stable economy and people have been able to use credit as a tool for good. I referred earlier to how important it is to consider the amount of disposable income that is spent on personal debt.</p>
	<p>The hon. Member for Eddisbury (Mr. O'Brien) said that debt is a problem and out of control. I do not accept that. The organisations involved in debt relief accept that a small number of people have debt-related problems, but that most people can handle credit as a useful tool. It is important to legislate 30 years on to ensure that the industry acts responsibly with appropriate marketing strategies and that consumers know the full facts of what affects them when they enter an agreement.</p>
	<p>The hon. Member for Eddisbury knows that I always try to be open and to make information available. I am grateful for the comments of the hon. Member for Gordon (Malcolm Bruce). I have tried to keep Opposition spokespeople in touch with developments.</p>

	<p>I undertake to do that, but my hon. Friend has made the point and he knows that the OFT is regulated. It has to produce an annual report and it has regular meetings with the Secretary of State and myself, and clearly we can raise these issues at those meetings. It was Parliament that decided to give powers to the OFT, through the Enterprise Act 2002 and the Competition Act 1998, and I hope that hon. Members will respect that.</p>
	<p>The Bill is a vital piece of legislation and I hope that the other place will recognise that. It is true that there can never be unconditional Opposition support for Bills, but I think it is agreed that this has not been treated as a party political Bill, perhaps with the exception of the contribution by the hon. Member for Eddisbury, for understandable reasons. It has been generally a matter of consensus.</p>

	<p>I welcome the opportunity to respond to the Adjournment debate secured by my hon. Friend the Member for Falkirk, West (Mr. Joyce). He was correct to say that initially these are matters for Ofcom. Having introduced the relevant legislation, the Government should leave the regulator to get on with it. I accept that it is the Government's responsibility to make sure that legislation is effective. It is early years for Ofcom, but that process will take place.</p>
	<p>We should approach our debate as a message to Ofcom. It is entirely proper and welcome that we hold such debates in the House, but I am not in a position to reply on its behalf. To provide a context for the SMG proposals, I shall set out the legal strategy behind the Communications Act 2003 and Ofcom's guidelines. This is essentially a Scottish issue, as the hon. Member for Moray (Angus Robertson) said. Both local and national politicians know that news is incredibly important, and all the evidence shows that news broadcast on television is more likely to be considered a straightforward and objective representation of events than news in the newspapers. I share that view.</p>
	<p>Interestingly, every survey that has taken place shows that people rate local news services most highly. That is not to say that they do not want national coverage, but they rate local news services most highly. The BBC's regional news at 6.30 pm is the most watched news programme. Having said that, I accept what my hon. Friend said about the importance of national news. I do not want to go into what the Scottish electorate might think is more appropriate for them, but I will refer to the SMG proposals at the end.</p>
	<p>Because of the importance of news, both local and national, the Communications Act 2003 gave Ofcom the duty to ensure that all licensed public service channels include high quality news and current affairs programming, covering both national and international matters. That may be helpful to my hon. Friend, given his reflections during the debate on national news and the coverage of international matters, and, I suspect, the interface between local and regional news. Clearly, in some instances there will be news that is both local and national, depending on who is listening to the broadcast, so sometimes it may be difficult to draw the dividing lines. Almost in defence of democracy, we need high quality regional news, as local as it can be, but national news to give us that sense of national identity and to enable everyone to take part in democratic processes.</p>
	<p>What my hon. Friend did not touch on, but a matter that is very much behind this debate and which was particularly relevant to yesterday's announcement, is that the debate about how news is broadcast and what news is broadcast, at which time of the day and for how long, is very much governed by the great changes that are taking place in broadcasting and will continue to take place during the next 10 years.</p>
	<p>Ofcom has two responsibilities&mdash;first and foremost, to ensure that the duty to make sure that licensed public service channels include high quality news and current affairs programming is kept to, but at the same time not to fail to understand that that public service news broadcasting obligation takes place against the background of many more digital channels, and that without doubt people's increasing decision to access digital channels has an impact on the public service broadcasters.</p>
