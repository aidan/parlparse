<p>How convenient for the Minister. Does he accept that mortgage default is now one of the major causes of homelessness in Scotland and that 130 people in East Lothian became homeless last year because of mortgage default? That is about 15 per cent. of the official homelessness figure in my constituency. Is he further aware that a significant proportion of such folk bought their district council houses at a discount and are now having to be rehoused by the same local authority? Will he please admit that the Government's cockeyed housing policy has now made a crisis into a disaster of homelessness for many people?</p>

<p>I can tell the hon. Gentleman that only 4 per cent. of homelessness applications were attributed to that cause by the applicants. I stress that Clackmannan district council operates a scheme for tenants who are aspiring owners but find themselves in difficulty. Any other district council may operate that scheme if it so wishes. We have also developed a cash incentive scheme for housing associations to assist homeless families. Few people become homeless because of mortgage default and the figure is well below the number in England.</p>

<p>Does my hon. Friend agree that figures from the building societies show that about 96 per cent. of those with mortgages in the United Kingdom are not in default of any kind? Every trader would love to be able to present such figures. Does my hon.

<p>Yes. First, 0&#x00B7;47 per cent. of all mortgage holders in Britain have been subject

to repossession. That is well below 1 per cent. and the percentage in Scotland is lower because market values are lower. My hon. Friend asked me about the rents-to-mortgages scheme. We launched our publicity on the scheme on Friday, and there have been more than 4,000 expressions of interest from local authority tenants throughout Scotland. That shows that many people believe that this is the bargain of the century.</p>

<p>Responsibility for homeless persons in England, including the funding of voluntary agencies, rests with the Department of the Environment, the Department of Health and the local authorities concerned, but the Scottish Office is making available &#x00A3;50,000 a year for three years to voluntary bodies to assist projects to discourage young people from Scottish cities moving to London.</p>

<p>That is a pathetic response. There is a problem here and now, involving hundreds of young Scots in London, of which the Minister should be aware. Half of them come from Glasgow and many of them have a social work care background. The Minister should have read the booklet that was sent to him called, "Living on the Borderline", which was published last week by Borderline, Centrepoint and Shelter (Scotland). It tells a tragic tale. The Irish Government provide &#x00A3;500,000 to London agencies to deal with their young homeless. When will the Scottish Office take similar responsibility for young Scots in London?</p>

<p>The &#x00A3;50,000 is designed, exactly like the Irish scheme, to discourage young persons from leaving home. The scheme's purpose is to encourage people to obtain accommodation in their home areas. We have other initiatives. Some &#x00A3;72,000 has been allocated to the centre for housing research in Glasgow, which will carry out a study to see how social work can prevent homelessness. We have also provided &#x00A3;48,000 to the Scottish Council for Single Homeless. Over and above that, we have made an additional allocation to the four cities of Scotland and we have invited bids from the towns which have most homelessness&#x2014;Renfrew, Dumbarton, Falkirk and Kirkcaldy. We think that that will be of substantial assistance.</p>

<p>If a substantial proportion of the 26,000 empty houses were brought back into use, that would be of assistance. The code of practice that we will issue shortly takes into account the &#x00A3;50,000 project which seeks to discourage young persons from leaving their home areas.</p>

<p>I had a meeting on 12 February with representatives of the Scottish National party at which my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for the Environment was present.

<p>Is not it now becoming increasingly clear, as a result of those meetings and others, that local government finance in Scotland is in a state of crisis and that the indebtedness that has resulted from the past two years of the poll tax is well in excess of &#x00A3;500 million? Is the Secretary of State so sanguine as to think that he can persist with the concept of the poll tax in Scotland, or will he face up to his responsibilities and recognise that, if he does not rule it out, the electorate will rule him out?</p>

<p>The term "crisis" is hardly appropriate to a system in which 98 per cent. registration has been achieved and in which 95 per cent. collection is anticipated for the first year of the charge. Nine out of the 12 levying authorities have already collected 95 per cent. Their task would be eased considerably if Scottish National party Members would adopt a more responsible approach to the funding of local government. It is disgraceful that those who seek to make laws in this place should seek to break them when it comes to funding local authorities.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend is right. I was particularly glad to be able to allocate more than &#x00A3;500 million in capital allocations to local authorities with particular emphasis on the improvement of school buildings, on general services, including the provision of factories where they are needed, and on the improvement of water services and sewerage, in respect of which we plan to increase funding by almost two thirds during a three-year period.</p>

<p>Will the Secretary of State acknowledge the growing problem caused by people who have hitherto paid the poll tax but who say that they intend to deduct from next year's poll tax the amount that is attributable to non-payment?

Is not it the case that the property tax is electorally attractive, as was demonstrated in last year's regional elections when the Labour party won a considerable victory, and that if we introduce such a tax it will leave the Minister of State looking something of a lulu?</p>

<p>My hon. Friend is right, for that is the lesson to be learnt from the outrageously high tax that is imposed in places such as Edinburgh, where the community charge is &#x00A3;584.

<p>It seems from what the Secretary of State says that democracy has gone out of the window for the health service in Scotland and that there is a clear and urgent case for a portion of health board members to be directly elected. What criteria were used for the election of health board members to the reconstituted boards? Was election based on ability or knowledge of the health boards, or was it&#x2014;as it appears to us&#x2014;based on affiliation to the Conservative party? Will the right hon. Gentleman tell the House how many members of health boards are card-carrying members of the Tory party or hold office in that party?</p>

<p>The hon. Lady demeans herself. It is absolutely outrageous to suggest that appointment is based on political affiliation. In the vast majority of cases the political affiliations of members of health boards are not known.

<p>Is the Secretary of State aware of the widespread anxiety felt throughout Falkirk district council about the absence of any residents of Falkirk district on the new Forth Valley health board, and that that anxiety is shared even by leading Tories such as Bill Hughes and Councillor Malcolm McNicol? In view of the blatant political bias, as well as the geographical bias, will the Secretary of State now take steps to try to achieve a better balance, instead of allowing his colleague, the Minister responsible for health, blatantly to abuse his political power to appoint his friends, such as Mrs. Isbister and a lot of other Tory party hacks who seem hell-bent on trying to wreck the national health service when they should be defending and improving it?</p>

<p>As I have already said, members of health boards are not chosen for their political affiliations, which are not known in most cases. They are chosen for what they can contribute to the work of the health boards, based on the advice of a wide range of bodies. Geographical representation is not a relevant factor in the appointment of health boards. The proper means to represent interests of that type is through health councils.</p>

<p>I agree with my hon. Friend and pay tribute to the work being done by the board. I had the opportunity to meet some of its staff recently. My hon.

<p>I welcome the medical innovations described by the Minister, but why is he putting all that at risk by persisting with the completely discredited policy of allowing hospitals to opt into the NHS trust system?

<p>Every time the hon. Gentleman says that there is no interest in the scheme, we seem to receive another application. Six hospitals throughout Scotland have now expressed interest. The proposal for Forresterhill in Aberdeen has come from consultants and management, because they believe that it will result in improved patient care. Once the Scottish Office has received a proposal, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State will examine it and decide whether to give it the go-ahead on the basis of whether it will improve patient care.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman is quite wrong about the ability of hospitals to spend money without Scottish Office approval. The whole point of self-governing hospitals in the NHS trust system is that they will be free to make decisions at local level that would otherwise have been made over their heads. I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman is so opposed to the idea of giving local communities a chance to run and manage their hospitals.</p>

<p>Was not the Minister entirely wrong to say that expressions of interest in trust status are coming from hospitals? In fact, they are coming from a small clique within those hospitals. Has the Minister not read what was said recently by John Cooper, chief executive of the Royal Free hospital, an opting-out hospital, in London? He said:

being managed centrally. The whole point is that they will have contracts with the health boards and will remain a part of the NHS, and that doctors and management will have an opportunity to run them locally. What I said earlier was that the proposals for NHS trusts were coming from doctors and management who believed that it would improve patient care. I believe that those proposals should be evaluated on the basis of their merits, not on the basis of Labour party dogma.</p>

<p>The allocations represent a significant increase. The allocation to Borders Enterprise represents an increase of 27 per cent. over comparable spending in the area this year and Borders Enterprise will have grant powers to encourage the provision of advance factories. It is keen to use those powers rather than to provide the property itself. District councils in the region received capital allocations totalling &#x00A3;1&#x00B7;8 million, an increase of &#x00A3;260,000, and Borders regional council received an allocation of &#x00A3;1&#x00B7;2 million, which was an increase of &#x00A3;350,000. I sympathise with the hon. Gentleman and we recognise the need to provide premises for alternative sources of employment to diversify the local economy. The increased allocations reflect that.

As we enter a recession which is affecting Scotland, why are local enterprise companies being faced with a cut in their budgets which means that less will be spent in each area in Scotland this year on the functions of the Scottish Development Agency and the Training Agency than was spent last year?

Unemployment in Scotland is now below the EC average.

<p>The hon. Gentleman is talking nonsense. Local authorities have collected, or expect to collect, 95 per cent. of their budgeted income for last year. Strathclyde has failed to use warrant sales so far and the comptroller of audit has rightly criticised the performance of authorities in failing to implement collection procedures in accordance with the statutory timetable.</p>

<p>As has already been mentioned, there is a deep resentment among those who pay and obey the law as regards those who will not pay. Is my hon. Friend aware that the resentment is compounded in areas


such as Kincardine and Deeside, where the percentage collection is good, but where next year people will have to pay more than a proportion of what is uncollected in that area because other district councils, such as Aberdeen, have collected a lower proportion of the community charge that is due? Is it fair that community charge payers in Kincardine and Deeside will have to pay more, not just to compensate for those who fail to pay in their own area?</p>

<p>My right hon. Friend is absolutely right. A tide of outrage is sweeping Scotland among law-abiding citizens who have to pay the SNP surcharge. I can perhaps reassure my right hon. Friend about the position in Grampian. He may have seen an article recently in <i>The Scotsman</i> headed,
<q>Labour rift as warrant sales approved".</q>
In the article it was announced that Grampian region had decided to go ahead with eight warrant sales for non-payment. The article stated that the Labour leader, Councillor Jurgen Thomaneck, said:
<q>It would be asking too much of us to condone illegal acts by people who evade the poll tax in a way that is to the detriment of other poll tax payers.</q>
I am sure that my right hon. Friend would agree with that. I hope that those sentiments will get a ringing endorsement from the Opposition Front Bench.</p>

<p>In the last months of the poll tax, will the Minister finally seek to bring some common sense to at least some parts of its operation? Will he relieve local authorities of the need to pursue this blunderbuss approach in the legislation which means that the poorest people in the land, who are in arrears on a proportion of the poll tax of up to 20 per cent., have to be pursued in exactly the same way as the wealthiest people in the community who default voluntarily, with which I have no truck whatever? Will the Minister bring to the attention of his right hon. Friend the Secretary of State the possibility of getting rid of the 20 per cent. minimum payment? Does he agree that if the poorest people in Scottish society, who are being hounded for 20 per cent. of the poll tax, were taken out of the equation much of the administrative shambles, chaos and misery that surround the poll tax would disappear with them?</p>

<p>There will be no amnesty. The community charge benefit is widely available to assist those on low incomes. Some of the people to whom the hon.

<p>Surely the effectiveness of warrant sales must be called into question, bearing in mind the large number of Scottish Members of Parliament who still have not paid their poll tax. What does my hon.

<p>I am not sure whether my hon. Friend was referring to the Labour party or to the Scottish National party. Almost certainly, he was referring to both. Of course, he is absolutely right. Scottish local authorities have failed so far to use warrant sales and they have been consistently criticised for the delay. In some authorities, such as Borders and Fife, payment levels are extremely high. If Borders and Fife can do it, so can Lothian and Strathclyde.</p>

<p>As the Minister knows, in Glasgow there are hospitals which are on the hit list for the opting out procedure. I remind him that, in approaching this matter, he said that one of the tests would be a substantial commitment of those likely to be involved in the new management. Does he agree that that does not mean six persons&#x2014;any six persons in any hospital? The consultants in South Ayrshire hospital voted by 50 to nine against opting out, and those in Aberdeen Royal infirmary voted by 82 to seven against. Does the Minister agree that, even in his Looking Glass world, that cannot be equated with a substantial commitment on the part of those who will be involved in new set-ut? He talks about local choice and local democracy. Does he agree that forcing opting out through on that basis would be offensive and indefensible?</p>

<p>No Government&#x2014;not even any previous Labour Government&#x2014;have taken decisions concerning the future of hospitals on the basis of votes or ballots. The criteria for the approval of applications for self-governing status are set out in the working paper, which the hon. Gentleman has seen, and they are perfectly clear. The hon. Gentleman referred to a "hit list". I regard that as a fairly offensive term. In hospitals throughout Scotland, people are looking behind the Labour party's rhetoric and seeing the opportunity to improve patient care. In the case of the South Ayrshire hospital, in respect of which an application is coming into the Scottish Office, the leading person responsible is a consultant with a distinguished history in the national health service. I do not believe that people of that calibre would do anything other than go forward with proposals that they thought were in the best interests of patients. That is the sole criterion on which my right hon. Friend's decisions will be based.</p>

<p>I thank my hon. Friend for his kind invitation to visit south Dorset. I should certainly like at some stage to take it up, as my responsibilities for forestry stretch throughout the United Kingdom. I am glad to be able to assure my hon.

In addition, the processing industry has been revitalised, with investment of about &#x00A3;1 billion. The farm woodland scheme, which we are currently reviewing, has led to about 2,200 applications

to plant about 15,000 hectares&#x2014;a high proportion of the trees being broad-leaves. The forestry industry is in good heart and in good shape.</p>

<p>The point that I made&#x2014;that the regulations were not opposed in debate in the House&#x2014;is correct. They place a clear duty on the education authorities to administer the test. Until now, the Labour party and the EIS have argued that parental choice and involvement should not extend to the curriculum and to professional matters. Their conversion is as rapid as it is unexpected. I have no doubt that, having released this genie from the bottle, education authorities will be reflecting on the implications. Are parents to be able to withdraw children from physical education, music, computer studies and the technical and vocational education initiative, for example, or to insist on the inclusion of their children in classes on a subject? Once the pilot testing round has been completed, we shall consider what further action is necessary.</p>

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, of which I have given you notice. On page 2426 of the Order Paper today, you will see that the first question is in my name. This question has been transferred from the Department of which I originally asked the question to another. In the process, it has been rewritten, and as a consequence of that rewriting, nonsense has been made of the original question. I asked the question originally of the Attorney-General, and if he had answered my question I might have been enabled to put a supplementary question to him concerning the scandals on the Isle of Man and the way in which people have been defrauded by those who run that island.<br/>
By virtue of what has happened, I am once again denied that opportunity. If every time I table a question to the Attorney-General it is automatically transferred to the Home Secretary, I shall never get an answer to the question that I am tabling.</p>

<p>I am asking you, Sir, whether it is in order not merely to transfer questions but to rewrite them so that the consequential content of the question is changed. I asked the Attorney-General what contact he had had; I did not want to know what contact the Home Office has had. If I cannot ask that question, the people whom I represent will be denied the opportunity for justice.</p>

<p>In answer to the first question, it is in order to transfer questions. I refer the hon. Gentleman, as I have done before, to page 286 of "Erskine May", which says:
<q>It is a long established principle that decisions on the transfer of questions rests with Ministers and it is not a matter in which the Chair seeks to intervene.</q>
I am afraid that I cannot help the hon. Gentleman on that.<br/>
As to the question whether his question has suffered a material change, I shall look into the matter, but if it simply directs the question from the Attorney-General to another Minister, I am afraid that that would be covered by the ruling that I have already given.</p>

<p>I beg to move,
<q>That leave be given to bring in a Bill to provide for persons employed at the Government Communications Headquarters to have the right to belong to an independent trade union of their choice; and for connected purposes.</q>
The Bill would once again allow GCHQ employees to belong to an independent union of their choice. Just over seven years ago, on 25 January 1984, the then Foreign Secretary announced in the House that unions would be banned at GCHQ. Indeed, on 1 March this month, it was the seventh anniversary of the time limit given to the employees at GCHQ to sign what was described as an option form. That form states:
<q>I, &#x2026; have read and understood General Notice 100/84 and wish to continue to be employed at GCHQ. I agree to resign from membership of any trade union to which I belong. I also undertake not to join a trade union or to engage in its affairs or to discuss with its officials my terms of employment or conditions of service or any other matter relating to my employment at GCHQ. I understand, however, that I may join a Departmental Staff Association approved for the time being by Director GCHQ.</q>
That was an infamous document, and no British citizen should be forced to sign such a document. No one should be surprised to learn that 25 January, when the Foreign Secretary announced the ban, and 1 March, when everyone had to sign that form in order to continue as an employee at GCHQ, are well remembered. This state of affairs is totally unacceptable to trade unions and the labour movement.<br/>
At the time of the ban, much was made by Ministers about industrial action that had occurred at GCHQ, particularly in 1979 and 1981. It was argued that the ban on union membership would ensure that there was no more disruption. The then Foreign Secretary, however, when trying to justify the ban, conceded that no threat to the nation's security resulted from industrial action that had taken place at GCHQ. Sir John Nott, Defence Secretary in 1981, said that an industrial dispute had not in any way affected operational capability.<br/>
Hon. Members may argue that, as we have just been through a war, that justifies even more the ban on union membership.</p>

<p>I note that the hon. Member believes that.<br/>
Union membership was allowed of course at GCHQ in 1982 during the Falklands war. Sir Brian Tovey, then director general at GCHQ, sent a telegram to all the employees in Cheltenham and the outstation after the Falklands war. That telegram read:
<q>High level praise. There can be no doubt that this praise has been well deserved. It has been earned by hard and dedicated work by you as individuals.</q>
Less than two years after that telegram had been sent, the Government showed their thanks by taking away the basic right of those dedicated individuals to belong to an independent trade union.<br/>
It is no wonder that the hon. Member for Cheltenham (Sir C. Irving), who represents so many of the people who work at GCHQ and live in Cheltenham, was highly critical of the Government ban. He made a courageous speech in


the House when he said that there was never a hint of disruption at GCHQ during the Falklands campaign, and that to imply otherwise had hurt and infuriated the staff. He also said that the slur that union membership at GCHQ involved the risk of putting people's lives in danger was completely beyond the bounds of decency and truth.<br/>
In December 1989, the certification officer made a decision on the application for a Government communications staff federation&#x2014;one can imagine what type of organisation that is. He considered whether that represented an independent trade union, and, not surprisingly, he came to the view that it was not an independent trade union at all. He said that the staff federation functions subject to the approval of the director at GCHQ.<br/>
I am myself an active trade unionist, and I believe that it was an impertinence in the first place that any such application was made. How can a staff association that is bound by the organisation in which the employees work be described as an independent trade union?<br/>
The International Labour Organisation, which largely functions under the auspices of the United Nations and works closely with it, has repeatedly called on the Government to rescind the ban and to negotiate with the unions. In recent weeks, we have heard much about binding Security Council resolutions. The House knows that I believed that those resolutions had to be implemented, but when the International Labour Organisation has told the Government that the ban is wrong and that they should negotiate with the unions surely it is only right and proper for the Government to take notice. The Government have completely ignored all its requests.<br/>
I imagine that the right hon. Member for Finchley (Mrs. Thatcher), when Prime Minister, was the most enthusiastic member of the Cabinet urging a ban on union membership. We are told that since her departure various matters have been looked at and that there is a different kind of Government who are more caring and less dogmatic. They are even looking at the poll tax, for which we are told that nothing is ruled in and nothing is ruled out. No doubt we shall know more about that after tomorrow's by-election. If they are really a different kind of Government, why have they not rescinded the ban on union membership at GCHQ? If the right hon. Member for Finchley was largely responsible for that ban, as I believe she was, why will the Government not do away with that dogma and prejudice, because that is what it is?<br/>
Anyone who thinks that the issue will go away and that, as it arose seven years ago, it is a dead issue could not be more wrong. We intend to keep the issue very much alive. We intend to ensure that people are reminded, as they are year after year by the demonstrations at Cheltenham, that in January 1984 a basic right of British citizens was taken away. I understand that no Conservative Member wants to oppose the Bill. <i>[Interruption.]</i> If the ban is right, I hope that a Conservative Member will have the guts to stand up and defend it.<br/>
The ban should be removed now. This Tory Government remain the same as they always were, regardless of who leads them. If they do not remove the ban, the next Labour Government will do away with it and

will ensure that employees at GCHQ have the same rights as the rest of us to belong to an independent trade union. The sooner that that comes about the better.</p>

<p>I do. I oppose the Bill because the record on this matter must be properly set straight so that the people of this country are able to understand it. The hon. Member for Walsall, North (Mr. Winnick) said that the trade unions at GCHQ had not merited the ban and that it was wrong. I shall give a history of the events. The trade unions at Cheltenham always knew, and were never in any doubt, that, because of the unique nature of their work, if they took part in any kind of industrial action, the Government of the day, of whatever complexion, would have no option but to bring in measures to remove the right to such action. That applied under Labour and Conservative Governments.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Walsall, North shakes his head. Let me tell him that, for six and a half years, I was a trade union representative, and in the 1960s I represented the largest union at GCHQ. That was during the period of office of a Labour Government. I was an employee when sensitive and delicate work important to our security was being carried out. That required 365 days of work a year, 24 hours a day, and the civil service and the military were closely involved. Lives could have been put at risk in various parts of the world, and that was properly and fully understood by the trade unions and their representatives.<br/>
Government action was taken for two reasons. First, the trade unions took action at Cheltenham even though there was an unwritten agreement that they would never take such action. Secondly, the trade unions were exposed because of publicity generated by trade unions and political activists throughout the country who tried to make political capital out of the situation. They were prepared to put the nation's security at risk for purely political ends. Such action had not occurred in all the years that GCHQ had functioned so effectively and well looking after the nation's security.<br/>
The hon. Member for Walsall, North has obviously not made any attempt to study the history of the matter, nor has he spoken to the vast majority of the people who work at GCHQ. If he had, he would understand that they would have no truck with such a measure.</p>

When the two voices on the Conservative Benches said, "No," including that of the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) who spoke against the Bill, it was noticeable to all hon. Members that the hon. Member for Tatton (Mr. Hamilton), a Government Whip, went across to those two hon. Members and convinced them not to vote. It is almost certain, Mr. Speaker, that we would have won a handsome victory, which would have been clear in the Lobbies. I fear that, on the day set down for the Second Reading, a Tory Whip will rise in his place on the Government Front Bench, object to the Bill, and kill it.

<p>New clause 5 is the first of a series of 10 closely related new clauses. Together with an associated new schedule, they will, if approved, provide for the confiscation of assets belonging to persons who have benefited from terrorist-related activities. The new provisions are aimed at those persons who have involved themselves, or who may be tempted to involve themselves, in the financing of terrorism in Northern Ireland. If they become law, persons who are convicted of a range of offences&#x2014;of a type known to be committed by terrorist financiers&#x2014;will be liable to personal financial loss, as well as to whatever penal sanction the court convicting them may impose. I hope that it will be for the convenience of the House if, when introducing new clause 5, I also say something about the confiscation scheme as a whole&#x2014;the background to it, its rationale and its main features.<br/>
You and other hon. Members, Mr. Speaker, will note that the 10 clauses and the schedule contain a good deal of technical legal language. You may therefore be somewhat reassured to know that much of this is necessary repetition, for the purposes of this Bill, of very similar language contained in comparable provisions of the Drug Trafficking Offences Act 1986, which provide in England and Wales for the confiscation of the assets of persons involved in drug trafficking, and the Criminal Justice Act 1988, which deals with the confiscation of the proceeds of involvement in other serious crime. Moreover, many of the paragraphs in the text now before us repeat, almost word for word, provisions in the Northern Ireland (Criminal Justice) (Confiscation) Order 1990, which reproduces, for Northern Ireland, the substance of the two Acts which I have just mentioned.<br/>
First, I will give some background. The Government are convinced that an effective strategy for the eradication of terrorism in Northern Ireland must be one which includes effective measures for tackling terrorism at its financial roots. Finance is the life blood of terrorism. It is required not simply for the acquisition of weapons, explosive and other terrorist material, some of it very sophisticated and expensive; it also pays the so-called


"volunteers"&#x2014;those who carry out acts of terrorism on behalf of their organisation. The provisions before us represent an important additional element in what we intend should he a comprehensive range of measures for curbing the financing of terrorism, itself an increasingly diversified activity. There is, I suggest, little doubt that such measures are necessary.<br/>
It is well known that terrorist organisations in Northern Ireland and those who handle money on their behalf are becoming ever more sophisticated in the means by which they raise and launder funds. Increasingly, persons of substance, including business men and accountants, are involved. It is a particularly worrying feature of the current scene that persons known to be involved with terrorist organisations are involved in the running of what may be regarded as legitimate businesses, with the principal objective of using those businesses to raise or launder funds intended to finance terrorism. There is good reason to believe that some of these people have been involved in such terrorist-financing activity for several years and that they have derived substantial personal benefit from their involvement.<br/>
There is in the Government's view&#x2014;a view which is fully shared by the Royal Ulster Constabulary&#x2014;a serious risk that, unless effective action is taken soon, persons acting on behalf of terrorist organisations will succeed in establishing a commercial or business infrastructure capable of providing long-term support for terrorism. Perhaps just as much a matter for concern is the risk that, even after a cessation of political violence, such an infrastructure might remain in place, able to sustain a potential for more straightforwardly criminal racketeering. No one would wish to see the creation of a Mafia-style society anywhere in the United Kingdom.<br/>
It was against this background, and with the concerns that I have just outlined, that the Government considered how they might use the opportunity created by this Bill to strengthen the law to allow more effective action against terrorist financiers. There were two principal outcomes of this consideration. The first was the new investigative powers for non-police officers, which were introduced by my hon. Friend the Minister of State in Committee, and which are now to be found in clause 47 and schedule 4. An ability to invoke these powers, and to secure the involvement in a financial investigation of persons with the special skills required for this task, should considerably ease the task of the RUC in bringing to justice those involved in such activities.<br/>
The second main outcome of our consideration of possible new measures is the scheme for confiscation which is now before us. It addresses a gap in the existing law. As Lord Colville has pointed out in his recent report on the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1989, the present law, while providing some machinery for the confiscation of money or property which it can be proved is intended for terrorist use, does not provide any means of depriving "terrorist financiers" of the personal benefit which they derive from their involvement in such activity.<br/>
It is a matter of regret to me that the very extensive and detailed work that was necessary before these provisions could be brought forward could not be completed quickly enough to allow them to he considered in Committee. They were, however, tabled at what was the earliest

possible moment after the necessary preparatory work had been done, and I am grateful for the indulgence of the House.<br/>
Despite their length and technical complexity, the provisions that make up the new scheme have a simple purpose, and their intention can be expressed in straightforward terms. In essence, they provide that, if a person is convicted in the Crown court of a relevant offence as defined in new clause 7, and if certain conditions have been fulfilled, the court will be required to make a confiscation order. The amount of that order will represent either the value of the person's proceeds from terrorist-related activity during the six years preceding his conviction, or the value of his realisable property&#x2014;as defined in new clause 8&#x2014;at the time when proceedings are instituted, whichever is the less. The relevant offences will be the scheduled offences identified in new clause 7 from the commission of which persons are most likely to benefit or which are most closely related to terrorist finance.<br/>
There are five matters, identified in new clause 5, about which a court must be satisfied, after it has convicted someone of a relevant offence, before it can make a confiscation order. It must be satisfied first that the defendant has engaged in terrorist-related activities; secondly, that he has benefited from such activities; thirdly, that at some time since the commission of the offence the defendant has had realisable property exceeding &#x00A3;20,000 in value; fourthly, that, in the period of six years ending when the proceedings were instituted, the defendant has committed another relevant offence on a separate occasion; and, fifthly, that in the particular case, having regard to the circumstances of the offences, the making of the order would not be unfair or oppressive.<br/>
Terrorist-related activities are defined in new clause 5(2)(a) as activities that consist of, or involve the commission of, one or more relevant offences, and it will be provided that a person benefits from such activities if he obtains money or other property as a direct or indirect result of such activities.</p>

<p>As my right hon. Friend has said, the wording of the new clause is somewhat extensive, and difficult for anyone to understand completely. Will one of the conditions to be met before the court can make an order be that the defendant must be given notice that, if he is convicted, an application for such an order will follow? Or will an order be made in any event against anyone who is convicted of such an offence?</p>

<p>As I said a moment ago, the court will be required to bring in a confiscation order if the relevant circumstances obtain.<br/>
To assist the court in its task of determining whether the conditions have been fulfilled, the scheme will provide certain assumptions which the court. in the absence of evidence to the contrary, will be obliged to apply. They include the assumption that any property appearing to the court to have been held by the defendant at any time since his conviction, or to have been transferred by him at any time during the six-year period ending when proceedings were instituted, was received by him as a benefit from terrorist-related activities.<br/>
As with other confiscation schemes, such as the 1990 Northern Ireland order that I have already mentioned, provision will be made for restraint and charging orders. Those are required to enable assets to be frozen at an early


stage so that they are available to meet any confiscation order that may be made if the defendant is convicted. There will also be provisions creating offences aimed at persons who attempt to avoid confiscation.<br/>
The power to make confiscation orders will be available only to the Crown court in Northern Ireland, but the funds subject to such orders may be held elsewhere. For that reason, the scheme will enable provision to be made by Order in Council for the enforcement in England and Wales, Scotland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man of confiscation and restraint&#x2014;but not charging orders&#x2014;made in Northern Ireland. The offences provisions in new clauses 11 and 12 will also be capable of application in those separate jurisdictions.<br/>
It is intended that restraint orders should normally be granted by the High Court in Northern Ireland. However, it will also be provided that, in certain closely defined circumstances, the power to grant such orders should be exercisable by the Secretary of State. The circumstances will be that the Secretary of State should be satisfied on all the matters on which a High Court judge would have to be satisfied before granting such an order, and that in addition it should appear to him that the disclosure of information that it would be necessary to provide to the judge in support of such an application would be likely either to place someone in danger or to prejudice the capability of members of the RUC, or an authorised inquiry, to investigate offences to which the scheme applies.<br/>
I readily acknowledge that these provisions appear severe. Indeed they are severe, which is their intention. They are intended to make people who have deliberately involved themselves in financial activity in support of terrorist organisations, or who may be thinking of so involving themselves, to think twice about that involvement. I remind the House that, in principle, the provisions are no different from or more severe than provisions that Parliament accepted for those who profit from their involvement in drug trafficking. The Government, and I hope the House, regard the deliberate financing of terrorism as an equally heinous activity. That is why I introduced the provisions and am commending them to the House.<br/>
The Government amendments are all consequential on the new clauses to which I have referred.</p>

<p>To some extent, we welcome the new clauses. We question them not because of a lack of good will towards them&#x2014;we welcome their purpose and hope that they will be speedily and readily effective&#x2014;but because we believe that they should be part of the general law of the land. I understand that a Home Office committee is considering their provisions, but we would have preferred them to be part of the general law on preventing anybody from benefiting from criminal offences.<br/>
It is of the utmost importance that no one should be able to benefit financially from the proceeds of terrorist offences. It is important that such proceeds, whether they be from extortion, illegal rackets or bank robbery, do not find their way into the normal channels and thereby make it appear that they came from legitimate businesses. That is very dangerous because, if the criminal elements&#x2014;the IRA, some Protestant paramilitaries or the mafia&#x2014;were to

gain control of our economy, it would make us a very sick society. We cannot allow that, so we welcome the new clauses.<br/>
We regard the Bill as proper anit-terrorist legislation. To deal with terrorism, we must get at terrorists' financial routes and cut their ability to finance their enterprises. It is perhaps not a spectacular way of dealing with it. It is not immediately emotive and it will require much hard police work, but in the long term we believe that it is far better than any knee-jerk reaction to terrorist offences.<br/>
The Secretary of State has said how the system will work and it seems to contain adequate safeguards to prevent abuse. Unless all the conditions are fulfilled, seriatim, no orders can be made against individuals. Again, we welcome that.<br/>
We should not wish a legitimate business to go out of existence merely because its financial control was in the hands of terrorists or terrorists' front people. Legitimate jobs may be placed at risk and many innocent people may suffer. One would like to think that there was some way of thinking this matter through so that those points were covered.<br/>
Finally, I turn to the tracing orders that will be made for the United Kingdom, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands. Is there any provision that would enable funds to be followed to other Community countries&#x2014;because of the free movement of capital that now exists within the Community&#x2014;or to countries outside the European Community where they could be used to buy arms? It would be a great benefit to terrorist organsiations to have apparently legitimate funds in such countries.<br/>
With those general caveats, we welcome the provisions. We believe that they will be effective and hope that they will form part of the general law of the land. As this is emergency legislation, let us hope that, when the Home Office inquiry is concluded, we see such provisions as part of general legislation and included in our ordinary Criminal Justice Acts.</p>

<p>It is gratifying for all of us who represent Northern Ireland constituencies to debate a Bill, not an Order in Council, because the benefits that will flow from that will enable people from all walks of life in Northern Ireland to feel that their views have been expressed both in Committee and on Report.<br/>
We hope that we can illustrate the inaccuracy of the advice that is sometimes given to the Secretary of State, to the effect that, if the Government legislated by Bills as a matter of course for Northern Ireland, that would place an intolerable burden on the time of the House. My colleagues on this Bench, and, I hope, all those in the House, will do our best to illustrate that that is not an accurate assessment. We can all help. I make a plea to my colleagues of all parties who represent Northern Ireland constituencies to help by making their contributions crisp, accurate and concise, and not to waffle on at great length on matters which, strictly speaking, have nothing to do with the provisions under discussion.<br/>
We are aware of the hurried introduction of some of the new clauses and the thinking behind them. If there had been a longer period for consultation&#x2014;if the provisions had been tabled, even in outline, on Second Reading or earlier in Committee&#x2014;we would all have had the benefit of receiving some input from interested bodies and


experienced persons in Northern Ireland. We might then have been able to assist the Secretary of State and his colleagues to improve the legislation still further.<br/>
I find it difficult to understand why we appear to have been caught on the hop. My hon. Friend the Member for Upper Bann (Mr. Trimble) reminded the Committee&#x2014;I put it on the record now&#x2014;that some of us had read in <i>The Sunday Times</i> as far back as 21 October 1990 that the Northern Ireland Office had it in mind to introduce legislation on this subject akin to what applies in the United States of America. However, there appears to be a curious dichotomy in the Government's thinking as a unit. Not all Departments in Whitehall seem to be alive to the possibilities of the legislation and the potential effectiveness of clauses such as those which have now been introduced. All honour to the Secretary of State and his colleagues for perhaps defying the advice that they have received from certain other quarters, to the effect that they should take their time and put off this matter until after a general election. That would not have been desirable.<br/>
I find it curious that we have not been given more time, but I appreciate the problems and the fact that discussions probably took place in Government at various levels, so I shall not press that point too far today.<br/>
My colleagues and I welcome the fact that the Secretary of State seemed to say that he was providing for the application of certain provisions to Great Britain by order. I am sure that the right hon. Gentleman will forgive me for not being precise because, like his hon. Friend the Member for Orpington (Mr. Stanbrook), I find it difficult to take all these matters in at one bite. Nevertheless, if that is what the Government have in mind, it would be highly desirable. Like the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, North (Mr. McNamara), I go further and suggest that thought should be given to a wider application, where possible, to overseas finance houses if co-operation could be secured.<br/>
At various stages of the Bill, my hon. Friend the Member for Upper Bann has made pleas for greater precision in drafting. Having listened to the Secretary of State, I hope that he will not close his mind to further suggestions about how precision could be attained. In various respects, the new clauses represent a considerable improvement on the outline made available in Committee, but I hope that, in our examination of the new clauses and amendments, we can give further help to the Secretary of State to achieve greater precision.<br/>
I assume that, even when Royal Assent has been obtained, the Secretary of State and his colleagues will pay heed to expert advice and opinion&#x2014;I use those words deliberately&#x2014;about closing loopholes which terrorist godfathers, like tax dodgers, will inevitably discover in the legislation. I assure the Secretary of State and his colleagues of the co-operation of the law-abiding people of Northern Ireland and their representatives in the House, first, on the passage of the remaining stages of the Bill and, secondly, in helping him to scrutinise the effectiveness of the legislation when it is applied to doing something significant to contain terrorists, wherever they may be found.</p>

<p>Signals from the Labour Front Bench were trying to attack me through the mouth of my right hon. Friend the Member for Lagan Valley (Mr. Molyneaux), but they should remember that example is better than precept.<br/>
Of course hon. Members from Northern Ireland welcome the fact that we are discussing a Bill in the House. We should not be over-enthusiastic, because I do not think that the Government are in any way converted to the view that all legislation for Northern Ireland should be done through Bills. This legislation is being done by Bill because of certain regulations connected with it. However, I do not think that the Government have been down a Damascus road and have been persuaded that the House should legislate for Northern Ireland in the same way as it legislates for other parts of the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>I have my doubts about the Government, so I can give them the benefit of the doubt at all times.<br/>
I regret that, when the Government introduce a Bill, we have all these changes and additions. It would be easier for Northern Ireland Members to discuss a measure on Second Reading if they knew the full content of the Government's mind. Of course, the Government may not know the content of their own mind, and may therefore be in difficulty about delivering it earlier.<br/>
The Government are trying to do what needs to be done. Money should be clawed back immediately from anyone who benefits financially from terrorist activity. Everyone is in full agreement on that. I have tried to be concise.</p>

<p>For once, I shall try to follow the example of the hon. Member for Antrim, North (Rev. Ian Paisley).<br/>
Again, I am disappointed that this new legislation has been introduced in the manner in which it has. The Minister of State was good enough to consult members of the parties from the north of Ireland in the concluding phase of drawing up the legislation, but we now have 10 new clauses, a complete new schedule and almost a complete new Bill on Report. It may be easy for people with legal expertise to deal with such legislation, but those of us who are not so qualified find great difficulty with it. It is not fair to hon. Members to introduce what is essentially almost a new Bill at this stage, because the Bill is not open to the investigation and examination that is required.<br/>
Another important factor is that, if the changes to the Bill had been dealt with in Committee, we would have a much clearer idea of the import, impact and effectiveness of the Bill. I have sympathy with the point made by the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, North (Mr. McNamara). One of the difficulties with emergency legislation&#x2014;I made this point on Monday&#x2014;is that we end up with a patchwork quilt. The Government have drawn a little from the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act 1973, a little from the prevention of terrorism Act, a little from the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, a little from the Drug Trafficking Offences Act 1986 and a little from something else, and have ended up with a panoply of measures which is like a patchwork quilt, with no central unity. It is almost impossible to deal with such a measure as a single piece of legislation. That is what has happened, and that is why the changes have been made so late.<br/>
The Bill seeks to take provisions from the ordinary law, to put them into emergency legislation and to make them apply to proscribed organisations and scheduled offences. The patchwork quilt approach has continued. It does not seem the right way to deal with the matter.<br/>
I regard wealth or money which is obtained through violence or as a result of violent activity as nothing less than blood money. <i>[Interruption.]</i> I am not terribly sure why the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, North has given me a glass of water. Is there a Freudian message within it, or is there something stronger?</p>

<p>I thank the hon. Gentleman for it. I know that, when it comes to that which goes into a glass, he is an expert on the implications of Lent.<br/>
Money earned as a result of violence is simply blood money. I and everyone else who lives in the north of Ireland have seen the way in which some people have become wealthy on the back of the sufferings of others, so no one would question the need for legislation to deal with it. It is a difficult area of operation, and the problem has been with us for several years. The reason why it became so widespread and so much a part of the sub-culture of the north of Ireland was that successive Governments were not willing enough to get to grips with it. It is on record in the House through the years that organisations such as the Housing Executive, which is charged with providing housing in the north of Ireland, have paid out millions upon millions of pounds&#x2014;in protection money and other forms of racketeering. Part of the problem was a reluctance to come to grips with it, because it was a conduit for intelligence. That is a reality which people may not like to hear, but it is one of the difficulties. As a consequence, racketeering has become part of the sub-culture of the north of Ireland. That is why it has reached the stage that it has.<br/>
I have reservations about certain elements of the new clauses. I am worried about the families of those who may come under scrutiny. I am fairly certain that in some cases a woman has no control whatsoever over the activities of her husband. Such a woman might find that her home was subject to confiscation. In other words, a woman and her children could lose their home through no fault of their own. I am not sure that such sensitive matters are dealt with clearly. Let us hope that the Secretary of State will be able to clarify the situation.<br/>
My other fundamental reservation concerns the fact that, once again, the onus of proof is on the suspect. Throughout these new clauses, the suspect is required to prove his innocence. That represents not just weak law but also a weak approach to law.<br/>
4.30 pm<br/>
The provision concerning compensation is particularly ambiguous. Compensation may be paid if the High Court decides that there has been some serious default on the part of a person concerned in the investigation or prosecution of the offence. Surely the provision must be made much more precise. Is not proof of innocence sufficient to establish entitlement to compensation under this type of legislation? It seems to me that there is a high degree of subjectivity in the definition of serious default by

the High Court. Once a person has been absolved, he should be entitled, without this subjective element, to compensation. The provision would substantially weaken the subject's position. As this is emergency legislation, we should be especially concerned about the protection written into it. It is not enough to provide for the punitive element.<br/>
I repeat that there is a need for this type of legislation. It is not confined to proscribed organisations. Indeed, some of the most serious racketeering in the north of Ireland is indulged in by an organisation that some people deem no longer to exist. Those of us who live there know how potent it still is. We know how much money it puts through its hands every year&#x2014;and its members through their pockets. We know that it works very closely with what many people now regard as a legitimate political party. The fact that it is not proscribed shows the difficulties that could be faced in the application of the law to such racketeering. There are weaknesses in the new clauses. We must always look for means of protecting accused people.</p>

<p>This new legislation manifests the determination of the Government and of the people of Northern Ireland not to let up, even for a moment, in the attempt to throttle the evil men&#x2014;on whichever side of the divide&#x2014;who parade themselves as patriots. The legislation can grab hold of what the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh (Mr. Mallon) referred to as the blood money which has been screwed out of the people of Northern Ireland by the terrorists, in particular by the Provisional IRA.<br/>
I have some reservations about the legislation. As the Secretary of State said, it is based on legislation dealing with drugs in England. The courts have not been determined in grabbing hold of all the money that drug dealers have accumulated. They have interpreted the laws extremely strictly and dealt kindly with the relations of the defendants in the dock. The laws should be tougher. As the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, North (Mr. McNamara) said, we must be able to follow funds that go to other parts of the world&#x2014;for example, the tax havens in the West Indies.<br/>
The IRA is extremely astute at manipulating money. Those funds have been and are being accumulated for the express purpose of terrorism, but the terrorists also have in mind the day when peace will come&#x2014;as it surely must&#x2014;to Northern Ireland and put the money away for their retirement. It is said, although I cannot produce any proof, that IRA funds have been used to buy property in my constituency. Some people act as front men for the terrorists.<br/>
I only hope that, when the legislation is enacted, it will be fully implemented, with the greatest determination. As the Secretary of State said, money is the life blood of the terrorist. We must cut off that money and, in so doing, we shall help bring down the evil men who have haunted Northern Ireland for more than 20 years, and whose day of reckoning has come.</p>

<p>The legislation, which was introduced late in the course of the Bill's passage through Parliament, is full of good intention. However, I have been in the House for 17 years and have lived through the problems and troubles of Northern Ireland since the day they began, and I have seen much


legislation pass through the House that was full of good intentions. But good intentions are not enough; the practical consequences of those good intentions are what count. If the Secretary of State thinks back on all the legislation brought before the House that was supposed to produce good consequences, but which gave birth to nothing of the sort, I have no doubt that he will share my reservations about the legislation before us.<br/>
The Secretary of State knows perfectly well, because he referred to it, that the legislation is based on the powers contained in the Drug Trafficking Offences Act 1986 How much money, and on how many occasions, and how much property has been seized as a result of the application of that Act against people committing drug offences? Similar powers, relating to the seizure of bank accounts, were contained in the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1989: how many bank accounts have since been seized?<br/>
If the Secretary of State asks us to pass such legislation, surely he should tell us the practical consequences of earlier, similar legislation, but he did not do so. The House has a right to hear the answers to those questions and to know whether similar legislation has been effective. I fear that it is not effective in those two situations. Whenever he says that business men and accountants are now involved in these matters, he inadvertently proves to the House and to the country that all this talk about mindless violence committed by members of the IRA is utter nonsense. The IRA and its fellow travellers are not engaged in mindless violence. The Secretary of State knows perfectly well that I, for one, have never accepted the belief that they were mindless thugs. They are directed by clever, efficient and ruthless people. By telling the House that business men and accountants are now involved, the Secretary of State has given us proof positive that these organisations&#x2014;not only but principally the IRA&#x2014;have got the thing down to a fine art.<br/>
These people are being well advised by able people. Therefore, a botched job will be no good. It will only bring the law being formulated against them into grave disrepute. That does no good to anyone: in fact, it makes the matter a great deal worse. Therefore, I hope that, when the Secretary of State, his colleagues and his advisers were dreaming up these new clauses, they asked themselves how the provisions could be circumvented. As soon as they appeared, the IRA and other terrorist organisations had their boys on the ball trying to figure out ways round them.<br/>
I have no doubt that, when the Secretary of State and the police proceed against the first targets that they have in mind, they will find that those people have discovered ways round the new law. They will have found the loopholes and expanded them until an elephant, never mind a mouse, can get through. This is a serious issue, and I hope that the Secretary of State and his advisers, and the police officers and accountants who have to investigate such matters, have put themselves into the minds of terrorist organisations, have tried to, discover the loopholes, and as a result have created nets-to ensure that those people are caught in one way or another.<br/>
The hon. .Member for Newry and Armagh (Mr. Mallon) referred to the situation in the building trades in Northern Ireland. That has been an open scandal for more years than any of us cares to remember. The consequence is that, whenever a legitimate builder looks for work in Northern Ireland, he is confronted with two problems. The first is that many believe that building firms are under

the control of these evil organisations. If even one tenth of what we hear is to be believed, firms have been paying large sums to terrorist organisations on every building contract that has been put through in an area ruled by such an organisation.<br/>
The second problem is partly the result of the DHSS in Northern Ireland still falling down on its job. We hear tales from the small builders of how they can no longer compete because these fellows are doing the double, working for &#x00A3;20 a day. Will the DHSS be called in to close that aspect of the building trade? That concerns every legitimate builder in Northern Ireland.<br/>
New clause 5 says that the value of the realisable property has to exceed &#x00A3;20,000. I should like an explanation of that figure. Am I to take it from that that persons can acquire a maximum of &#x00A3;20,000 from terrorist organisations or activities before the legislation catches them? Many people would like &#x00A3;20,000 if they thought that they could get it without any danger to themselves. It might be a powerful incentive to some of these folk to go ahead. If that is so, can we close that loophole?<br/>
The third line of new clause 5 says:
<q>whether before or after the coming into force of this Part".</q>
That implies retrospective legislation. Nobody likes that but the fact that it is necessary in this case shows that the Government are a minimum of six years late in introducing this measure.</p>

<p>I think that it is rather more than 12, but we shall only try to catch the latter half of the 12, even if that is incorrect.<br/>
I appreciate the need for retrospection in this case, but I regret that it is needed, because it is not the sort of Bill that any hon. Member would like to accept or willingly pass. Retrospective law is generally bad law, and I do not like it. However, in this case it is necessary.<br/>
4.45 pm<br/>
I also noted that the individual who is convicted cannot be caught by these provisions for only one proven offence. He has to be convicted of more than one. I should like the Secretary of State to comment on that. The implication is that we are trying to catch not the one-off offender, but the committed, continuing offender. If that is so, I should welcome it.<br/>
New clause 14 speaks of "property wherever situated". As has already been said, property owned by these organisations, and income-producing property at that, can be anywhere&#x2014;the United States, Canada, the Irish Republic or England. I can understand that the Secretary of State is referring to property in Northern Ireland and probably in the United Kingdom and adjacent British Isles. However, is he saying that he will try to find out the situation in foreign states such as the Irish Republic? If he is not, here is the first great gaping hole. We need to have that cleared up. I do not believe that the IRA has invested all its ill-gotten gains in Northern Ireland. A lot of it is invested elsewhere, where it is safe.<br/>
The new clause seems to be aimed at individuals who have benefited, but we are not dealing with terrorists as individuals. Individuals get caught, but they are only part and parcel of the terrorist machine. I am curious about what consideration has been given to how we can get at the whole machine. Although the person who has been caught may have benefited, he is only a tiny part of the machine.


How about the money held by the organisation that owns the property and employs the individual, perhaps as a consultant, a worker, a director or a simple, straightforward employee or alleged employee? These matters need to be addressed, because these organisations are super-mafias.<br/>
I wonder whether the powers that the Government have taken unto themselves are sufficient, draconian though they are. Will they hurt these organisations where it matters&#x2014;in their pockets? That is where we want to hurt them. We do not want to attack the minor individual who has made a small profit, take the money off him and leave the whole organisation with its property and money and resulting income intact.<br/>
I am curious to know whether, if one of these individuals has been paid as an employee and has benefited over the past six years to the tune of &#x00A3;10,000 or &#x00A3;12,000 a year, we will tell him that he will have to pay such wages back. What will be the practical consequences of such a move? The person does not have money in the bank, because he was paid the money and has spent it on living. It would be difficult, if not impossible, to recover that money.<br/>
I welcome the fact that any compensation that the convicted individual has to make will have priority over any other claim. I am happy to see that, because those who have suffered injury and may be able to claim compensation from the individual who has committed the offence will be protected, and their interests will be safeguarded. It is unusual that the individual rather than the Crown will be first in line for the money. If that policy were applied generally, many people in the business world would be happy to see the tax man's demands. I do not think that the Secretary of State will ever convince the Chancellor to adopt that approach to debts.<br/>
Under new clause 6(8), the courts will have to state the reasons for their actions. I am curious about whether that is necessary, because we may create a precedent which, instead of being helpful, turns out to be an albatross. Perhaps the Secretary of State and his advisers would like to consider that measure again. If the right hon. Gentleman puts himself into the position of the courts or the terrorists, he may think of some of the possible problems.<br/>
You will have gathered from my comments, Madam Deputy Speaker, that I do not think that this is a good curate's egg overall. It looks good. No doubt the hen's intention in laying it was good. It is a pity that the egg was kept in the nest for six or seven years too long and went bad. However, good intentions are welcome. We hope that, with increasing knowledge of the capacity of the wicked organisations at which the Bill is aimed, the Government will understand that this is a fair beginning but is not yet a good or successful end.</p>

<p>I support and welcome the Bill, which we hope will prevent racketeers from using normal businesses to make money for terrorist purposes. As a former plumbing contractor and one who worked in the construction industry, I have taken great exception to the threats against business people and tradesmen in the building industry and the protectionism practised by terrorist groups and racketeers.<br/>
Many jobs have been lost because of changes in certain areas of Northern Ireland. Many tradesmen and other workers in the construction industry are on the dole

because threats mean that they cannot work in certain places because of threats. Sadly, people who went to work in such places were murdered because they came from a different area. It is disgraceful that a person who is trying to earn money for his family should be treated in that way.<br/>
The threats are made by cowards, not by people who express their views to workers. They are made by telephone calls and by "a word to the wise". That is absolutely disgraceful. Unfortunately, the cowards are getting away with it. It is a tragedy that people who wish to work cannot do so. If the Bill has any effect on such actions, I should very much welcome it on behalf of those who work in the construction industry. Attempts are made to extract money from people so that they can work in particular areas&#x2014;and, sadly, workers are paying it. That is another tragedy.<br/>
The Bill is the other side of the coin from the terrorists who prevent workmen from going to certain areas or certain camps to carry out their building trade. Workmen are murdered to prevent them from doing their work. Firms are intimidated. I have been sadly disappointed by certain firms that backed down when threatened. For years, workers who have travelled into and out of these areas have been intimidated and threatened but have gone to work; but as soon as some firms are threatened or intimidated, everyone loses his job. I have been sadly disappointed that business people should do that.</p>

In such circumstances, workers are put on the dole. The fellow travellers of those who carry out the threats and murders then wring their hands in despair about unemployment in Northern Ireland. The hypocrisy of such actions is beyond belief and is treated by the people of Northern Ireland with the contempt that it deserves.<br/>
I am sure that the racketeers and the terrorists will not listen to anything that I say or, indeed, to what the House says, but they are not wanted by people in any area in Northern Ireland.

<p>It would be entirely wrong to give the impression that everyone working in the building trade in the north of Ireland is, first, a member of that nationalist community and, by implication, a member or a supporter of Sinn Fein or the IRA. The real racketeering in the building trade is organised by the loyalist paramilitary groups, and hon. Members who represent Belfast know that. They also know that the people who have been killed on building sites because of racketeering are, by and large, Catholics who have come to those sites from other areas.<br/>

<p>I wish to make it clear at the outset that I support the new clause and the others grouped with it. Like other right hon. and hon. Members, however, I believe that they should have been tabled much earlier so that more detailed consideration could have been given to them.<br/>
When considering this type of legislation one must consider the overview and ask whether such measures are necessary in the present circumstances. The present circumstances in Northern Ireland are such that it is clear that further measures are necessary to curtail the activities and membership of terrorist organisations.<br/>
One has only to consider the actions of the Provisional IRA in Northern Ireland in the past 48 hours to appreciate that it is attempting to take away people's livelihoods. In

my constituency, Mountpottinger police station was attacked. The area surrounding that police station is largely Roman Catholic and a number of properties were affected by the attack which, once again, the IRA got wrong. A large and vital area of industry in east Belfast is Short's. The Provisional IRA has also damaged that company&#x2014;it has not damaged the structure of the building so much as the credibility of the firm. The Provisional IRA is attempting to undermine that firm and its attempts will be condemned by everyone in the House. Such damage affects the employment of many people and casts aspersions on many. The Provisional IRA may send one person out to infiltrate an organisation and, as a result, that person may cause damage. However, the finger of suspicion is pointed at many when all but a few are not entitled to be viewed with such suspicion.<br/>
The Provisional IRA is the master of taking away the livelihoods and finances of others. If I have any criticism of the new clause, it is that it does not go far enough. I cannot see the logic behind simply going for the terrorist who has been involved in profiting from acts of terrorism. There are those terrorists who cause loss to others by their terrorism but who live very nicely thank you in Northern Ireland.<br/>
A bomber from the Provisional IRA or any other paramilitary organisation may cause damage worth &#x00A3;100,000 to a public house in Northern Ireland. That person may be found guilty of that terrorist crime and convicted, and the police may have evidence to prove that that individual owns property to the value of more than &#x00A3;100,000. Why should the state compensate the person who has lost his public house when the person who carried out that damage has goods to that value and more? I urge the Secretary of State to consider taking away benefit, by whatever means it may have been acquired, from the terrorist who is prepared to cause damage and loss in society and the public purse. Such confiscation is entirely justified.<br/>
I have some scepticism about the general premise advanced by the shadow Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. He has argued that the new clause represents a major way in which to deal with terrorism. I agree with the hon. Member for Londonderry, East (Mr. Ross) that the new clause deals with the problem on the periphery and that we should be cautious about how advantageous the new clause turns out to be.<br/>
If the powers in the new clause strike at the pockets of the terrorists, it will do good, but I do not believe for a moment that touching the finances of the godfather of terrorism or other terrorists will effectively deal with terrorism. The new clause deals with the problem on the periphery; there is no alternative to strong, resolute military activity against terrorists.<br/>
Touching the finances of the terrorist will have a marginal effect. Political stability in Northern Ireland will have a marginal effect on terrorism, but I believe that it would have a greater impact on terrorism than touching the terrorists' finances. To defeat terrorism one must take strong, resolute military action against the Provisional IRA and its fellow travellers. No one who supports the new clause should think for one moment that we have cracked the problem and that we have the means to defeat the IRA. At best, we have a marginal advantage on the previous legislation.</p>

<p>I was sorry that at one stage in the debate it sounded as though we were entering into a squabble about something on which we all basically agree, but perhaps we have passed that stage now.<br/>
One can level criticism at the Government for the procedural avenues on which they have decided. It is a pity that we have before us 22 pages of amendments, including a huge schedule, all of which could readily have been included in the original Bill and debated properly on Second Reading. Hon. Members who disagree with the Government amendments and new clauses could have tabled amendments to them. There are five Opposition parties in the House with the resources to do that. However, Report stage is not the same as Second Reading, after which a Bill goes to Committee for detailed scrutiny, at which point amendments can be tabled. Hon. Members who do not have the resources of political organisations are affected by this. There are better opportunities to introduce amendments in that way than if the Government suddenly introduce a bundle of proposals almost like a new Bill.<br/>
I do not know why the Government have introduced so many new proposals at this late stage. The proposals could form a separate piece of legislation rather than being included in the Bill, and thus allow the usual processes of proper scrutiny of a measure which in principle might be widely supported. Such legislation could have been fine-tuned and improved.<br/>
The Bill seeks to tackle the laundering of money from criminal to legitimate areas. Much of that money is obtained by dubious practices, such as theft and exploitation. Funds collected from overseas are also fed to paramilitary organisations and some of those funds finish up in the kind of businesses that hon. Members have described. People need to be told how money collected in America finishes up with the IRA and how it is used. The people who carry the collecting tins say, "It is for our boys." We must spell out what happens to the boys and girls and the adults of Northern Ireland as a result of paramilitary activity.<br/>
Yesterday representatives from a group called Families Against Intimidation and Terror were present in a Committee Room. The group was set up by Nancy Gracey in Downpatrick following the knee-capping of her son, who had been involved in some trouble on a bus. The bus passengers were called together by the IRA which meted out its dubious method of justice. Nancy Gracey's son was taken out and knee-capped. Even if he had been guilty of some crime, there was no ground for such punishment. The fracas was about someone who had been in the IRA and had been in prison.<br/>
Nancy Gracey was so incensed by what happened that she made a brave stand and the result was an organisation which operates in both Protestant and Catholic areas and involves people suffering at the hands of their own sectarian organisations. The situation has become worse and the proposed legislation should have been introduced earlier. Organisations continue to grow and develop. Extreme organisations, such as the Baath party, the Nazis and Stalinists attract to themselves all sorts of thuggery because they employ methods which ignore law and order and the normal checks and balances in a democratic system. That leads to massive exploitation because such organisations have the freedom to act unlawfully.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman spoke about funds collected in the United States. Has he any observations on the amount of money which the supposedly defunct Official IRA raises on the west coast of the United States and launders back to the north of Ireland every year? It is interesting to note how an organisation that is supposed to be defunct operates probably the biggest international scam of the lot.</p>

<p>Once again we seem to be on the verge of confrontation, which is inevitable when we discuss Irish issues. My knowledge of the Official IRA is in terms of its successor bodies and the developments which led to the establishment of the Workers party. That shows that the democratic process offers opportunities and hope to people and can help to transform the situation. That needs to be taken into account when people consider what action to take about Sinn Fein and whether it should be banned in the same way as the IRA. We might finish up with the same people wearing a different hat. However, the attractions of having to use the ballot box to achieve political change can help to transform organisations. The changes that have taken place are welcome, although the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh (Mr. Mallon) may wish to stress problems that have arisen.<br/>
The measure is essentially directed at banned paramilitary organisations and deals with the misuse of their funds for further exploitation. Such organisations engage in the legitimate collection of money and use it to build up or retain their strength. The hon. Member for Belfast, East (Mr. Robinson) said that such a measure was welcome. He also said that it was by no means the main method of dealing with terrorism. I agree. But terrorism cannot be overcome only by massive police and military action to search out and remove terrorism at every stage. Such actions tend to become part of a pattern. The way forward is the long-haul solution which seeks to undermine the very conditions which lead to terrorism. The economic and social agenda, such as Monday's debate on the Northern Ireland (Appropriation) Order, which is equivalent to the Budget, is important and needs to be seen in the context of other issues.<br/>
The other avenue is the democratic one of people coming together and standing up for the sort of society that they wish to see. Nancy Gracey's organisation has stood up and campaigned and organised in Downpatrick to such an extent that the official organiser for the IRA has moved out of the area. The argument is being won by people who put forward alternative solutions.</p>

<p>I am delighted to have the opportunity to reply to the debate. I shall allude first, because it has been mentioned by a number of hon. Members, to the delay in bringing forward the legislation. I understand the feelings of the House. I have thanked the House for its indulgence and, in the context of the language that has been used in the debate, I thank the House for its patience and understanding.<br/>
The right hon. Member for Lagan Valley (Mr. Molyneaux) was understanding of some of the circumstances which might have given rise to the delay. It is better that the legislation should have come forward than that it should be delayed further, but I recognise the difficulties in


which the Government have placed the House and I appreciate the understanding that has been shown towards us.<br/>
A number of points have been made and I will do my best to respond to them. The hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, North (Mr. McNamara), in welcoming the general principles of the legislation on behalf of the Opposition, asked why the new provisions could not be part of general law. The new provisions rely on the concept of scheduled offences and are therefore unique to Northern Ireland. They cannot be applied in England and Wales where there are no scheduled offences. They are also designed to deal with a particular situation in Northern Ireland. However, I understand the sentiment which underlay the hon. Gentleman's question and I am grateful to him for his tribute to the police for their hard and painstaking work.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman asked about legitimate businesses. A legitimate business, properly so called, has nothing to fear from these provisions, but somebody who provides a legitimate service but who also helps terrorists will be vulnerable under the legislation. The hon. Gentleman asked a question which was also raised subsequently about a move into Europe and overseas. That is not possible under the present law, but it is not impossible in the longer run. We might be able to take powers to enter into reciprocal enforcement arrangements. That is a proper matter to have been raised and it is something which we would seek to pursue.<br/>
I expressed my gratitude to the right hon. Member for Lagan Valley for his understanding and I assure him that, with regard to what he said about loopholes and the provision of expert advice and opinion, we shall welcome all the help that we can get to obtain the maximum benefit from the legislation and to prevent loopholes occurring.<br/>
The right hon. Member for Lagan Valley and the hon. Member for Antrim, North (Rev. Ian Paisley) had a small internal debate about the Government's practice in the legislative procedures in the House. I noted that the phrase "the benefit of the doubt" crept into the debate. That phrase derives much from the game of cricket. I apologise if I have in any way polluted Northern Ireland debate by introducing such metaphors. My experience is that one is given out as often as one is given not out and that they balance out over the years. I hope that the right hon. Member for Lagan Valley will feel that his optimism was more justified than the scepticism of the hon. Member for Antrim, North.<br/>
The hon. Member for Newry and Armagh (Mr. Mallon) asked me a series of questions. It is always a source of pleasure to me that my hon. Friend the Member for Wiltshire, North (Mr. Needham) should have had an ancestor who was a Member for Newry and that I should have had an ancestor who was a Member for Armagh. We watch the hon. Gentleman's progress with care and we take perhaps greater interest in his development than that of any other Northern Ireland Member.</p>

<p>I thank the Secretary of State for his felicitations. Can he make any observation on the fact that his noble antecedent represented one part of Newry and Armagh and that of the hon.

<p>Ever since the hon. Member entered the House I have much admired his productivity.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman asked about the onus of proof. The onus remains on the Crown throughout to prove all the matters set out in new clause 5. Assumptions are provided to assist the Crown in establishing some of these matters, but all those assumptions can be rebutted by a defendant on the lowest civil standard of proof&#x2014;the balance of probability.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman asked about compensation. The provision in the schedule is in exactly the same form as appears in the other compensation schemes such as those in the Drug Trafficking Offences Act and the prevention of terrorism Act, which have apparently worked without difficulty. The fact that the provisions are broadly paralleled and mirrored in the Drug Trafficking Offences Act will, I hope, help the House in its consideration.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman asked about the position of children and spouses. All that can be confiscated are the proceeds of terrorist-related activities. I think that he cited the house. If the house represents the proceeds of such activities, it is right that it should be confiscated. However, if the defendant can show that, on the balance of probabilities, the house was come by legitimately, it cannot be the subject of an order.<br/>
The hon. Member for North Down (Mr. Kilfedder) expressed the expectation that peace would come and in so doing endorsed the legislation, and I am grateful to him.<br/>
The hon. Member for Londonderry, East (Mr. Ross) asked me a question relating to the amounts secured under earlier legislation. The Home Office started collecting statistics on restraint orders issued under the Drug Trafficking Offences Act in 1989, but the returns received were so unreliable that it was not felt safe to quote the figures. Customs and Excise does not collect figures and there is no obvious evidence from, for example, bank evidence to Select Committees, that the banks have any figures.<br/>
However, against that background, statistics are available for confiscation orders under the Act&#x2014;a matter which I think also underlay the hon. Gentleman's question. That is the stage that comes after restraint orders. Statistics are as yet available only for England and Wales where, in 1987, 200 offenders were ordered to pay &#x00A3;1&#x00B7;2 million on confiscation orders. That was the year after the Act came into force. In 1988, 540 offenders were ordered to pay &#x00A3;8&#x00B7;1 million and in 1989, 800 offenders were ordered to pay &#x00A3;7&#x00B7;8 million. Therefore, a significant sum of money is coming into the public coffers as a result of the legislation.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman asked why we had not introduced legislation before.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman is right to remind me that he raised that question. No restraint or forfeiture orders have yet been made in Northern Ireland under that Act, but I remind the House of what I said earlier. As Lord Colville pointed out in his recent report on that Act, the present law, while providing some machinery for the confiscation of money or property which it can be proved is intended for terrorist use, does not prevent any means of


depriving terrorist financiers of the personal benefit which they derive from their involvement in such activity. That gap is filled by this legislation.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman was free with criticism of the legislation. I did not catch in his speech much detail of the alternative legislation that he would like to see against the problem which I think we all acknowledge exists. I agree with what he said about mindless violence. There is no question but that manipulative skills of a high order are employed within the terrorist movement, and it is an index of the purpose of the legislation that it is being directed against just such skills. The hon. Gentleman saw that point and I can confirm that it is true. He will recall the 62 establishments which were raided simultaneously in the latter part of last year on warrants signed by myself for the collection of documentation which was then taken away for analysis.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman asked about builders, as did the hon. Member for Antrim, South (Mr. Forsyth). I recognise that that is not specifically contained in the legislation except as a side-wind. It is a complex matter, because one must be certain to introduce powers which, although they will defeat terrorists, do not impose impossible burdens on honest business men throughout the Province.

<p>I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his support. The Government are determined to bear down on all sources of finance. Today, we are adding to our armoury a contribution to that process.<br/>
The hon. Member for Londonderry, East asked why there should be a &#x00A3;20,000 cut-off. The scheme is deliberately targeted at persons who make a practice of, or living from, financing terrorism&#x2014;in other words, the major players&#x2014;and to ensure that a requirement on the courts should not be imposed when someone is convicted of a minor, albeit relevant, offence but who has received no benefit or hardly any benefit personally from his actions. Any cut-off point is arbitrary, but a figure of &#x00A3;20,000 seems about right. It can be varied by order, and we would be perfectly happy to return to that question. The hon. Gentleman, in his remarks about the commissioning of more than one offence, correctly interpreted the Government's intentions.<br/>
A confiscation order will apply to property anywhere in the world. If the prosecution can establish that the defendant has realisable property in Australia, for example, it will be included in the order. If the defendant does not pay, he will be sentenced to imprisonment in default of not having done so. The location of the asset is not significant.<br/>
The hon. Member for Londonderry, East asked whether the scheme will apply to property owned by a terrorist organisation. It does not, but such property is

already liable to forfeiture under schedule 7 to the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1989.<br/>
I am grateful to the hon. Member for Londonderry, East for a most agreeable culminating phrase, when he commented that the clauses are not a good curate's egg overall. I shall treasure that phrase, and whenever I quote it I will give the hon. Gentleman the credit for having originally uttered it.<br/>
The hon. Member for Belfast, East (Mr. Robinson) spoke of the measures as being on the periphery, and referred to the remarks of the hon. Member for Londonderry, East about the particular persons to whom the legislation is addressed. I repeat that terrorism will be brought to an end by exercising pressure on terrorists across the whole front. I am the first to acknowledge that the aspect dealt with by clause 5 is not a decisive element, but it is much better to exercise pressure across the whole front so that the terrorist is made to realise that there is no way he can win.<br/>
The hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East (Mr. Barnes) argued, perfectly properly, for a doctrine of perfection. As I said earlier, I should have been delighted if these measures could have been introduced on Second Reading. However, the best can be the enemy of the good, and it was desirable to bring forward this measure only when it was ready. I appreciate the understanding that the House has shown in that regard.</p>

<p>I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.<br/>
The new clause would empower the Secretary of State to make regulations that provide for identity cards in Northern Ireland. It is deliberately drafted in a permissive form to give the Secretary of State leeway in introducing such a system. That is not to undermine or devalue the need for identity cards. Given the situation in Northern Ireland, there is clearly a need for a system of identity cards to enable everyone moving within its jurisdiction to be identified.<br/>
One of the major tools used by the security forces when trying to contain terrorism is the widespread operation of vehicle control points, road blocks, and road checks. Earlier this week, the Secretary of State himself, while commenting on the regrettable series of incidents of the past few days, referred to an increase in the number of vehicle control points in the hope that that would inhibit the movement of terrorists and their ability to carry out ghastly acts.<br/>
It is essential that those who man VCPs are able to identify people who pass through them, and an identity card system is necessary for that purpose. In Committee, the Minister of State commented:
<q>on the face of it, we can see how a common identity card could be of help. It might help security forces who come to the Province for a relatively limited time and then leave, and do not have the benefit of developing detailed knowledge of the

people in whose areas they serve, as does the Royal Ulster Constabulary. There might be therefore a certain security advantage in that regard."&#x2014;[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee B,</i> 31 January 1991; c. 326&#x2013;7.]</q>
I welcome those comments, but the Minister was taking far too limited an approach. Not just Army personnel serving in the Province for a short time require the help given by identity cards; members of the RUC need it. RUC officers may come to know all the people in rural areas with small populations but they cannot know everyone in areas with a population of tens of thousands. It would be impossible for RUC members to know everyone in such areas, let alone all the suspected terrorists. The Minister's remarks point to the need for identity cards to help all the security forces.<br/>
Identity cards should be linked to some form of computer databank from which other security intelligence would be available, so by cross-referencing the card, the security forces and others would have available a wide range of information about suspects. To a certain extent, that happens at present. Northern Ireland Members of Parliament are familiar with the extent to which it happens. We have documents which are used for identity purposes. I have in my hand a Northern Ireland driving licence; I referred to it in Committee. Unlike licences in England and Wales, it carries a photograph and is produced in plastic.<br/>
Car licence plate numbers are held on a central computer. We know that there is a certain amount of tagging of such numbers. At vehicle checkpoints one regularly sees a member of the security forces reading car registration numbers into a microphone. The general understanding is that that information is transmitted to a central point and checked on the records to find out whether there are any tags in the computer for the registration numbers concerned. The security forces can then decide whether to pull in a car and its occupants for closer examination.<br/>
The system that I am arguing for exists to a certain extent already through driving licences and car number plates, but that is a partial, rather than an effective, system.</p>

<p>Should it not also be underscored that this House, in its wisdom, has decided that people must carry an identity card of some type when they vote, and have listed the only identity cards that are accepted on such an occasion?</p>

<p>I thank the hon. Member for his intervention. He is perfectly correct, and the fact that the House decided that evidence of identity should be produced for one function underscores the need for it. The hon. Member will know that the multiplicity of documents available to prove identity for voting purposes is a weakness of the system. A coincidental benefit of new clause 1A is that it would provide for a single, common identity card which could be used instead of all those other documents. That is an incidental benefit, but I am afraid that, in Committee, the Minister was confused into thinking that it was one of the main planks of the proposal. We are arguing for an identity card system to help the security forces, so we need a comprehensive system.<br/>
Some people have reservations about identity cards. When one mentions computer records and other information being held centrally they get even more upset. They think that the existence of such information will undermine civil rights or infringe their human liberties in


some way. Like some other hon. Members, I find it difficult to see any merit in that argument. There is nothing unusual about identity cards. Indeed, we are all wearing one. If one looks around the House, one can see several hon. Members who are clearly wearing the required identity card. Hon. Members obviously do not find that the personal use of an identity card is an infringement of their civil liberties because when the requirement to wear one was extended to Members of Parliament it was accepted without murmur or complaint.<br/>
Coincidentally, this week's edition of the magazine of the Police Federation of England and Wales, which is supplied to all hon. Members on a complimentary basis, includes an article on identity cards which describes the situation in other European countries. It says:
<q>Spain: A compulsory system comes into force from the age of 14 onwards. Germany: Identity cards are required from the age of 16.</q>
In some other countries, such as France and Italy, cards are voluntary, but the federation understands that they are used on almost all occasions.<br/>
The article also refers to the seventh report of the Home Affairs Select Committee, published last July, which recommended the introduction of a common identity card system and discussed the arrangements in Europe. There is a slight conflict between the report and the article about Denmark, but we need not go into that. One states that identity cards are compulsory there and the other says that they are not.<br/>
I refer to European practice because I want to emphasise that identity cards are known and are used on a wide scale in Europe and do not cause any problems for civil liberties or infringe human rights. I feel that that objection has no merit.<br/>
In Committee, one practical objection to identity cards was mentioned. Persons from the Republic of Ireland come across the border to a number of towns to do their shopping. We would not want to discourage that. Such people might not have identity documents with them. That is an anomaly, which should perhaps be considered more comprehensively. It is anomalous that the United Kingdom still refuses to recognise the independence of the Republic of Ireland in some respects. The anomaly flows from legislation of 1949, in which this Parliament said that it would not recognise the Irish Republic as a foreign country. In some respects that is not a privilege which is being extended to citizens of the Irish Republic, but a subtle refusal to&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>

<p>Yes, as my colleague says, it is, in a sense, an insult because it refuses to recognise their independence.<br/>
Common travel arrangements, which may have been convenient in other respects, flow from that anomaly. To some extent, there is a strong argument&#x2014;we dealt with it here on Monday night&#x2014;for extending proper passport controls and the sort of regime that applies to other countries to the frontier in Ireland. That argument should be studied, rather than allow the present anomaly to persist.<br/>
I realise that the Bill may not be the appropriate vehicle to tackle the common travel area in the British Isles. Moreover, with 1992 just around the corner, it may be inappropriate to refer to passports, or to give instructions

to increase their number, because if there is to be free travel throughout the European Community post-1992, we may not want to increase passport arrangements.<br/>
The new clause would enable identity cards to be issued to visitors to Northern Ireland, although the regulations that we suggest could also provide for passports as identity cards. Both could be used which should keep the inconvenience caused by the proposal to a minimum.<br/>
This may be a temporary provision&#x2014;much less temporary than the provision that we discussed on Monday&#x2014;because post-1992 it is probable that there will be a common European standard on the use of identity cards. If there is to be a common travel area in the entire Community and no passport controls at borders, some other form of identification will be required. It is likely that common identity cards will be introduced as a European requirement to deal with the security implications post-1992. If that is the case, the new clause would he temporary because it covers us only for the period between now and the common regime likely to be introduced through the European Community. However, that is like looking into a crystal ball.<br/>
The new clause would enable the Secretary of State to make regulations for identity cards, which we believe are necessary. To a certain extent, such provision exists, but it must be put on a better comprehensive footing so that we have a common identity card which is used throughout Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>I support the new clause, which has been ably and convincingly proposed. The wording is admirable, as it does not place an obligation on the Government, but would enable the Secretary of State to nudge his Cabinet colleagues and to say that the time has come when we should introduce identity cards in the country as a whole.<br/>
The discussion about whether we should follow the lead given by other members of the European Community and introduce compulsory national identity cards has reached a stage at which the arguments for and against are fairly evenly divided. The argument in favour has strengthened. Originally, it was suggested that, apart from its convenience for law enforcement and other purposes, the system would assist immigration control. Subsequently, the question of terrorism has arisen.<br/>
The argument for compulsory introduction of identity cards in the United Kingdom as a whole has now been largely accepted. A fortiori, we should surely introduce them in Northern Ireland, where the problems of the security authorities are so much greater and terrorism is a constant threat. The public there need to be reassured that the Government are doing everything possible to defeat terrorism and restore law and order. Because I am sure that the Government are indeed determined to do everything possible, I hope that they will accept the new clause and pass the necessary enabling legislation.</p>

<p>For two reasons, I am surprised at the new clause and its source. First, I gather that the same proposal was made in Committee, but was defeated. Secondly, the new clause would make Northern Irish people second-class citizens, as only they would be required to carry identity cards: Englishmen, Scotsmen, Welshmen and citizens of the Republic would


not be subject to the same requirement. Usually, my hon. Friends want Northern Irish people to be treated in the same way as everyone else.<br/>
The new clause has been described as permissive rather than mandatory. I do not trust Secretaries of State with permissive legislation. With the best will in the world, they are inclined to use whatever powers they have, often&#x2014;although perhaps not under the present regime&#x2014;unwisely, hastily and without due consideration. I think that legislation should always be mandatory, especially when it deals with the rights of the individual and with restrictions on freedom of movement.<br/>
Currently, anyone who ventures abroad without some form of identification to present on demand at the legitimate and numerous vehicle check points on every road and byway is acting very foolishly. Nearly everyone, apart from very young people, has identification of some kind. The mind boggles at the idea that identity cards will carry some special mark meaning, "I am not a terrorist" or, indeed, "I am a terrorist", or, "I am a suspected terrorist"; unless we bear in mind the earlier suggestion that the card be linked to a data bank where the holder might be placed, unknown to him, in one of those categories. He would then have no chance to defend himself.</p>

<p>It would be possible to ensure, without the need for a data bank, that different categories were included on the cards. When a card is taken away from someone who is being investigated, the information can be added without anyone knowing. That would have applied to the "smart cards" that were proposed for football fans.</p>

<p>That is true. Anyone who has had the misfortune to buy a secondhand car that, unknown to him, has been tagged will find himself the subject of intense interrogation at vehicle checkpoints. Identity cards cannot further the information that is available to the security forces at vehicle checkpoints. As Northern Ireland Members know, security intelligence in Northern Ireland is extraordinarily intense. I am certain that I could not move a couple of miles from my home without my movements being known and my category well understood at any vehicle checkpoint.<br/>
The practicalities make my argument even stronger. Some of the new clause is very vague. It refers to the penalties incurred by those without identity cards. What administrative nightmare will be created, and what new judicial processes will evolve to bring to book those who have forgotten their cards? At what age, for example, will young people be required to produce them? Will it be 18 &#x2014;the age at which they can vote&#x2014;or 17, 16, 15, 14, 12 or even 10? Young people need to be free to go about their daily business, whether it be school or leisure. Unless everyone is tagged from the cradle to the grave, the position will become nonsensical. I do not think that even those who tabled the new clause would argue that young people, who are constantly subject to military searches &#x2014;both personally and when in vehicles with others&#x2014;should have to carry identity cards to school with them.</p>

<p>That proves my point. All of us already possess some form of identification.<br/>
The new clause involves another administrative nonsense. There is currently a big drive to bring more tourists into Northern Ireland. As soon as they reach either the land border or the sea border&#x2014;perhaps it is the border with the English channel&#x2014;tourists must apply for and obtain an identity card. A traveller from the Republic of Ireland, England, Scotland, Wales, the continent, America or anywhere else&#x2014;intending, perhaps, to do some shopping&#x2014;must obtain such a card. God knows the problems that hon. Members experience when travelling to and from Belfast under the present security arrangements will be nothing compared with the problems that will arise when a whole queue of people travelling to Belfast with British Airways or British Midland must produce not only passports but identity cards. The poor old sod who has forgotten his card, or does not even know that he should have one, will hold up the whole plane load.<br/>
The new clause is unnecessary, because of the plethora of identification that people already hold. More important, however, it takes yet another bite out of personal liberty and freedom. I am talking not merely about the identity card itself, but about the motivation behind its introduction. Information will be in data banks that the individuals concerned will never know about.</p>

If identity cards infringe civil liberties, why is the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh wearing his? There must be another reason for the opposition to the new clause.<br/>
How can the Government justify refusing to accept the new clause when they were happy to introduce identity cards for football fans? If cards would have stopped hooliganism and protected fans at football matches, why would not they ensure the safety of the people of the Province?

<p>I thank my hon. Friend for his intervention. If the Government were happy to accept identity cards for football, why will not they accept them to ensure the safety of people in the United Kingdom, especially in Northern Ireland?<br/>
In Committee, some hon. Members said that they would accept a national identity card. Conservative Members were happy to accept that proposal, and suggested to the Minister that the Government should act to implement a scheme.<br/>
In 1992, there will be a European identity card. Will Opposition Members object to that as an infringement of civil liberties that makes people in the Province second-class citizens? They will happily accept that card. It will be interesting to see how a distinction is made between Community countries. The citizens of Northern Ireland will probably have to wear an identification card that will show a Union Jack, which will be rather hard for some to swallow.<br/>
It was strange&#x2014;I shall not say hypocritical&#x2014;that the Government were happy to introduce legislation that made people wear identity cards when exercising the greatest civil and democratic right&#x2014;the right to vote. No citizen in Northern Ireland is allowed to vote without having identification. Strangely, SDLP Members do not object to that identification card, which can allow or deny

a person the right to vote. Even if someone's name is recorded on the electoral register, he will not be allowed to exercise his right to vote without an identity card.</p>

<p>I thank the hon. Gentleman for his comments&#x2014;at least in respect of the legislation, but not in terms of the person sitting in the Chair.<br/>
I am arguing for something that would do away with the load of regulations in favour of only one identity card, which could be easily carried. One of the problems that all our constituents face when they go to vote is that they think that they have the proper identification with them, but are told that it is out of date or that what they are carrying is not one of the accepted identity cards. That is a fact; that is what is happening, as hon. Members of all parties in Northern Ireland know. A common identity card would resolve that problem. Instead of the evidence disproving my case, it actually proves that a common identity card is necessary and would be of great assistance to our people both in the exercise of their franchise and for the safety of the community as a whole.<br/>
The hon. Member for South Down made great play of the fact that the provisions might affect visitors at a time when we need tourists. The hon. Gentleman might have found it helpful to read the new clause. Perhaps it would be a good thing if he were to read it now because paragraph (a) states:
<q>requiring all persons ordinarily resident in Northern Ireland to possess an identity card".</q>
He would also find that paragraph (c) covers another aspect of this matter:
<q>prescribing the circumstances in which passports may function as identity cards".</q>
A visitor need not apply for a special identity card, because his or her passport will be accepted as an identity card. Therefore, the legislation will not in any way stop citizens entering Northern Ireland as tourists.</p>

<p>Is it not a fact that the police have come out in favour of identity cards over and over again?

If the authorities of the House, the Government, and the leaders of the major parties in the House have all decided that the card is necessary for the defence of Members and the House, and we have agreed, I believe that there is now an excellent precedent for saying that identity card provisions could be applied more generally throughout the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman may say that it is a ridiculous card, but it is his photograph on it. As I have said, my wife likes my photograph on the card &#x2014;I am not sure whether the hon. Gentleman's wife will like his.<br/>
The card is considered necessary in the House. We would not have to wear the card around our necks in Northern Ireland. We wear these cards around our necks in the House for the sheer convenience of the guardians of the House and its Members, and for our own protection. People would not be expected to wear an identity card on their collar or around their necks in Northern Ireland.<br/>
An identity card would be useful in all sorts of ways. One way that has not yet been mentioned relates to those who use plastic money in shops. Because of the rates of interest, people may not be anxious to use their credit cards in the future, but we should remember that it would be useful to shopkeepers if purchasers showed not only their credit card, but also an identity card bearing their photograph. There would then be no doubt about identity. Of course, I am assuming that the photographs would be better than those that usually appear on passports.<br/>
As the hon. Member for Mid-Ulster pointed out, the provision would be useful, in that a single mode of identification could be used by everyone. It would have the advantage of bearing the photograph of the individual. Most of the documents which are used for identification when casting a ballot do not have a photograph. The identification document which we propose would be extremely useful. It would enable a citizen to go about his normal business with minimum inconvenience, because he would have a simple, straightforward means of identification. I have no objection to wearing identification in the House, given the current position. I would have no objection to carrying it and producing it on demand in Northern Ireland, any more than I object to producing my driving licence or my firearms certificate, which also bear my photograph.<br/>
People could be made to carry identification if there were a small on-the-spot fine. If we make a hullabaloo about it, involving court proceedings and a huge fine, people would resist it and would become heroes for refusing to pay. If there were an on-the-spot fine of &#x00A3;1, &#x00A3;2 or &#x00A3;3 every time a person did not produce the identification, everyone would soon catch on. It is a matter of attrition, because only the wicked would refuse to produce identification.<br/>
As to personal freedom, I objected to the legislation on the compulsory wearing of seat belts, but I wear one now, as a law-abiding citizen. I suspect that most people would take the same attitude to the use of an identity card. Personal freedom is damaged far more by terrorist action. Our civil rights are injured far more by the activities of the IRA and other terrorist organisations than they would be by the carrying of a positive means of identification. The format would be a matter for discussion, but the introduction of an identity card would be one of the most useful things that the Government could do for the convenience of citizens of Northern Ireland.<br/>
As has already been pointed out, after 1992 we may be forced to produce an identity card for the entire United Kingdom. If so, I suspect that the civil rights, personal freedom and all the other objections which have been bandied about, not only today but on every other occasion when the matter has been debated, will vanish like a morning mist. There will not be a cheep, especially from those who are in favour of the Common Market.<br/>
The objections to the new clause are spurious. There is no good reason, apart from Government cowardice, for opposing such a provision. It should have been done long ago. It should be brought into operation without further delay, because there is no good reason for delay.</p>

<p>I do not propose to prolong the debate, since I spoke on the subject on Monday. May I inform the hon. Member for South Down (Mr. McGrady) that I dealt with it in the context of the entire United Kingdom? We are asking that it should apply not only to Northern Ireland but throughout the United Kingdom. We are not as brainless as the hon. Gentleman may think. There are some brains north of Newcastle as well as south of it. I should point out to him that the Bill before the House relates only to Northern Ireland.<br/>
Why do Northern Ireland Ministers not want to take up the proposal? Has it to go before the Anglo-Irish Conference? Has the Secretary of State to persuade Mr. Collins that it would be a good idea? Has he to exercise his great talents of persuasion and to use all possible pressure to get agreement? We know what happened with conscription in Ireland when we were at war. Pressure from the south kept conscription from the north. Let me put it on record that, nevertheless, there were many volunteers from the south and the north in both world wars. We remember the nationalist community from the south who fought so bravely at the battle of the Somme in world war 1.</p>

<p>Northern Ireland Ministers were glad to put the passport of the Irish Republic on a level with the passport of Her Majesty's Dominions as a means of identification for voting, so no doubt they would have no twinge of conscience about accepting anything, including even a pass to a bar in Dublin. An on-the-spot fine might change the Secretary of State's mind: he might decide to get payment from Mr. Collins for not having a pass.<br/>
Police officers on both sides of the water have often spoken to me about the importance of eliminating people

on whom they do not need to waste time when there has been terrorist activity. The way to do so is to have proper, on-the-spot identification.<br/>
I had a letter from the Secretary of State the other day telling me that he intends to bring in an additional means of identification. The Government are going to add yet again to the list of acceptable identification documents. I suggest that he abolishes all those means of identification and introduces one identity card to do the job at election time.</p>

<p>I am amazed at the great reluctance of hon. Members representing the major parties to countenance an identification document. Points have been made about the number of identification documents which we have and it has been said that we do not need an identity card. I think that makes the case. When we consider the number of items that a person could have, I cannot see any reason for not having an official identification document.<br/>
There is a passport, a driver's licence, a national insurance number, a student's pass, a House of Commons pass, a Visa card, an Access card, an American Express card and bank cards. If we have to travel on public transport, our names are put on tickets on planes, on boats and on rail. Hon. Members are proud to display their photograph and their party affiliation on election literature and posters. When a person is employed, he may have a clock number, a pay number and even a VAT number. When the major parties hold conferences, delegates have conference passes. Even people playing football have numbers on their backs for identification, as do rugby players. I understand that cricketers may have to put their names on their cricket kit.<br/>
I was disturbed to learn recently that if someone applies for a telephone, British Telecom will approach credit companies for information about the person. If the applicant has had difficulty with credit in the past, British Telecom will make that person pay a deposit for the telephone. In all, we have an amazing number of means of identification.<br/>
I am surprised that there are those in the United Kingdom who are afraid to identify themselves and are not proud to take their pass out of their pocket and hand it to whoever asks for it. They wish to hide their identity. I am afraid that most of those people fear that in certain circumstances such identification would be a disadvantage to them.</p>

<p>I am glad that the hon. Gentleman pointed that out. That could be a case for introducing a single identification card to cover all those matters. I agree that perhaps such a measure should extend to the whole of the United Kingdom rather than apply only to Northern Ireland.<br/>
Of course, such identification cards are very handy for elections in Northern Ireland. I wonder how the major parties would react if there were a close result in an election or by-election&#x2014;<i>[Interruption.]</i> No, I am not prophesying. If identification documents were required and perhaps 500


people were not eligible to vote because they had no identification document, that might make people think differently as regards the position in Northern Ireland.<br/>
In wartime, identification documents had to be obtained. We feel that we are in a war situation in Northern Ireland and see no reason why we should not have identification documents.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for South Down (Mr. McGrady) was incorrect on only one point&#x2014;his point about what occurred in Committee. A motion similar to the one before the House now was dealt with in Committee and was withdrawn. Had it not been withdrawn, we should not be debating a similar motion now. The new clause is slightly different from the proposal in Committee because a flaw in the previous proposal in respect of what would happen to people who had come from outside Northern Ireland has been covered by a provision allowing passports to be used as identification. The new clause is more consistent than the previous proposal, but it is no more correct.<br/>
The last place in the United Kingdom and perhaps in the world where identity cards should be introduced is Northern Ireland. That is partly for the reasons stressed by those who want to introduce them&#x2014;that when incidents take place, the police can get hold of information quickly. Identity cards would be a godsend to terrorist organisations. Identity cards could be inspected by terrorist organisations and fed into their databanks and computers. We have just discussed a measure on how we could confiscate the vast funds that terrorist organisations hold. Undoubtedly, they have great strength of organisation, and their organisation would be further strengthened by introducing identity cards which people would be expected to carry with them all the time.<br/>
Enough problems are already caused by terrorists getting hold of identification documents. People might choose to go about without identification, not simply to avoid the security forces but to avoid being tackled by terrorists and their friends. Furthermore, the technology referred to by the hon. Member for Welwyn Hatfield (Mr. Evans) which allows cards and smart cards to bear all sorts of information seems terribly dangerous. Such cards can be impregnated with invisible information which can be read only by those who have the proper machinery. Not only the security forces may have such machinery. In any case, there may be worries about the security forces and the police having access to such information. Terrorist organisations may get hold of the machinery and add all types of information, including basic information about whether they judge the person to be a Protestant or a Catholic, which they could use on future occasions.</p>

<p>Will the hon. Gentleman look at the first line of the new clause, which says,
<q>The Secretary of State may make regulations"?</q>
Surely such regulations would be subject to scrutiny in the House and surely the House would lay down the information which could be put on the card. If the hon. Gentleman does not believe that the officials who would create the cards would carry out the instructions given to them, how would he deal with such people?</p>

<p>If officials were given cards which could be impregnated with information other than that which they

had been requested to put on it and the House made regulations which prohibited them from doing so, an extra problem would be created in respect of the acceptability of the cards in Northern Ireland. Vast elements of the population may come to believe that the cards would be misused even though the regulations prohibited it. If it is possible to impregnate the cards with various information, the IRA and Protestant paramilitary organisations would hardly be put off by regulations passed by the House.<br/>
There are further serious reasons to be added to the points made by the hon. Member for South Down about why the measure is incorrect and will be counterproductive. It is a dangerous measure and that is why the House should vote against it.</p>

<p>You may know, Mr. Deputy Speaker, that, except for some minor alterations, the new clause was debated at some length in Standing Committee. We have had a longer debate this evening, with one or two new players. Unfortunately, contrary to the idea of the hon. Member for Antrim, South (Mr. Forsythe), they did not have numbers on their backs, so we found it difficult at times to identify them. With the exception of the idea of soccer numbers and, I presume, rugby numbers and perhaps even innovations for cricket teams&#x2014;about which the Secretary of State may tell us in a future debate&#x2014;no new arguments have been made in the debate.</p>

<p>No new argument ever comes from the mouth of the hon. Member for Londonderry, East (Mr. Ross). No new arguments have been made in the debate.<br/>
There is an argument for identity cards. I do not agree with them but I admit that there is an argument. There is a genuine debate about identity cards, not only in the United Kingdom but throughout Europe. That may be a factor which we shall have to face post-1992.<br/>
The only justification for introducing such a scheme into the Province and not into the remainder of the United Kingdom is that it would improve security and enhance the position of the security forces vis-&#x00E0;-vis terror groups in the Province. All the information that I have received, and certainly the view advanced on behalf of the Government by the Minister of State in Committee, runs counter to that argument. The information from the mouth of the Minister of State is that that is not a requirement of the scheme.</p>

McNair-Wilson), who has only just entered the Chamber, and similar arguments that were made by Ulster Unionist Members.</p>

<p>If I am stopped and asked for identification&#x2014;not in this place, because as an elected Member of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, I am supposed to be known to the security people&#x2014;<i>[Interruption.]</i> That is true, but it is a different argument.<br/>
If I were stopped by the police, on suspicion that I had committed an offence, and were asked to produce identification&#x2014;not on the spot, but at a place of my choosing, in agreement with the police&#x2014;I should do so. But that point is totally different from the one concerning the general introduction of identity cards in the Province of Northern Ireland.<br/>
The hon. Member for Upper Bann (Mr. Trimble), in his interpretation of the Minister's response in Committee to his amendment, sought to mislead the House to some extent. I shall quote what the Minister said in the Standing Committee on Thursday 31 January. He will forgive me for quoting him. On the other hand, perhaps he is pleased, as I may be saving him the problem of quoting himself. On that occasion he said:
<q>If his argument"&#x2014;</q>
the argument of the hon. Member for Upper Bann&#x2014;
<q>was for security, on the face of it we can see how a common identity card could be of help. It might help security forces who come to the Province for a relatively limited time and then leave, and do not have the benefit of developing detailed knowledge of the people in whose areas they serve, as does the Royal Ulster Constabulary. There might, therefore, be a certain security advantage in that regard.</q>
Those are the words that were quoted by the hon. Member for Upper Bann. I draw the attention of the House to the fact that the Minister used the conditional tense throughout that part of his statement. But he went on to say:
<q>However,"&#x2014;</q>
note the change&#x2014;
<q>I am not aware that the security forces or the police have major difficulty identifying people. Indeed, I know from our debates that at least some in the community think that the ability of the police and security forces to determine people's identity is over-extensive, almost to the point, of being intrusive. So the argument that a security lacuna needs to be filled does not convince me."&#x2014;[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee B,</i> 31 January 1991; c. 326&#x2013;27.]</q>
Hon. Members, especially Conservative Members, should bear that in mind when this new clause is put to the vote. In the Government's view, identity cards in the Province alone would not affect the security situation a great deal. I think that I am right to say that the hon. Member for Upper Bann misled the House a little when he prayed in aid the remarks of the Minister of State: In fact, the Minister of State was using a slightly different, and stronger, argument to refute the suggestion of the hon. Gentleman.<br/>
6.45 pm<br/>
In another debate, the hon. Member for Orpington (Mr. Stanbrook) argued that identity cards should be supported if it were thought that they would provide extra security assurance. Like the Government, I believe that identity cards would not provide additional assurance against acts of violence, or enhance the position of the security forces in the Province. In Committee, the Minister could not think of any overriding security need to justify the introduction of such cards&#x2014;and I am sure that his officials were putting their minds seriously to the subject.

The argument stands or falls on the basis of the security question alone. For that reason, if for no other, I oppose this new clause.<br/>
The Minister also mentioned reasons of convenience. The hon. Member for Upper Bann has sought to rectify the fault in the new clause by introducing paragraph (c), but the basic argument still applies. The Province has many visitors, not just from overseas and from the Republic, but also from the remainder of the United Kingdom. I travel to Northern Ireland fairly frequently, though not as often as some of my hon. Friends think I should. If I had to produce my passport or an identity card &#x2014;a card for which I had had to be photographed&#x2014;or were further inconvenienced in what can already be a very trying journey, even I might find that a deterrent. Such an additional restriction, as well as deterring visitors and tourists from the remainder of the United Kingdom, could well have a detrimental influence on business people travelling to the Province. I refer to business men not just from abroad but also from the remainder of the United Kingdom. Surely it is such people that the Province is most anxious to attract, on the ground that inward investment and jobs are so important. The convenience argument is as strong now as it was when the Minister of State used it in Committee on 31 January.</p>

<p>When I talked about travel I was not referring to travel within the Province. I suppose that I really ought not to reply to the hon.

Member for Antrim, East, with whom I have spent some happy hours in the Province. Travel within Northern Ireland has never presented me with any problem. If that is the assurance that the hon. Gentleman wants, I am happy to give it. However, as he must know, the journey from Great Britain to Northern Ireland is sometimes trying. That is what I was referring to.<br/>
I want, finally, to repeat something that I said in Committee. As the Minister will know, in Committee my speech on this matter was very short. My party and I find it ironic that the new clause should be introduced by a political party that believes in selective internment on the ground that the terrorists are already well known to the


security forces. If that proposition is correct&#x2014;it is put continuously by hon. Members on both sides of the Chamber&#x2014;and the people are already known to the security forces, why would identification cards make their job any easier?</p>

I was asked to produce my identity card and I ask you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, to consult Mr. Speaker because I think that the occupant of the Chair should be able to give us a proper ruling so that we know the facts.

It is right that the security authorities of the House should have the power to challenge an hon. Member about whose identity they may have doubts, so that the identity is put beyond doubt.<br/>
As I understand it, no hon. Member has been refused admission to the precincts of the Palace of Westminster because he or she was not, at the time, wearing his or her identity card. Identities are challenged, but once they have been established the hon. Members are admitted. It would

<p>At the beginning of our proceedings, the right hon. Member for Lagan Valley (Mr. Molyneaux) encouraged all of us to be concise and not to waffle. I shall seek to follow the sterling example of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State in this and other speeches that I have to make during the evening, being careful at the same time to answer the arguments of the individual debates. In that context, it may be helpful if I start by clarifying one or two issues, so that I do not have to come back to them as I review this interesting debate.<br/>
First, this is emergency legislation as it relates to Northern Ireland, and is not United Kingdom legislation. There may be arguments on both sides of the fence for an identity card scheme in the United Kingdom, but, as I made clear in Committee, that is not what the legislation is about, and neither I nor the Northern Ireland Office have responsibility for such a scheme in the United Kingdom. Therefore, I hope that the House, like the Committee, will not allow me to become sidetracked by that argument.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Orpington (Mr. Stanbrook) has consistently supported the introduction of an identification scheme throughout the United Kingdom, for which I pay tribute to him and do not argue with him, but that does not relate to this debate. I recognise the legitimacy of the point made by the hon. Member for Antrim, North (Rev. Ian Paisley), who spoke on Monday about an identity card system in the United Kingdom. That was perfectly legitimate. As the hon. Member for Leicester, South (Mr. Marshall) said, there is an argument relating to such a scheme on a United Kingdom basis, although he does not support it, but it does not relate to the Bill, so I do not wish to get involved in that argument tonight. Exactly the same argument applies to the issue of 1992. There may be discussions about having identity cards after 1992, but that is not a matter for the Northern Ireland Office or for me, and I do not want to include it in my reply.<br/>
Secondly, this is emergency legislation, so if identification cards were to be introduced under it, it would have to be&#x2014;as the hon. Member for Leicester, South said&#x2014;for an overwhelming or compelling security reason, not for administrative convenience or any other reason. I understand the point made by the hon. Member for Mid-Ulster (Rev. William McCrea). There is an argument that, on purely administrative grounds, one form of identification is better than six or seven. Another argument to be made is that six or seven forms of identification provide a degree of convenience. But those are not the issues before the House in relation to the new clause. This is emergency legislation, so security should be paramount.<br/>
As the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East (Mr. Barnes) said, we debated this matter in Committee. The original clause was withdrawn and was reproduced as clause 1. I suspect that, following the debate in Committee, new clause 1A was added to address the issue.</p>

<p>I see that the hon. Member for Upper Bann (Mr. Trimble) nods in agreement. I do not believe that he sought to mislead the Committee, although I understand why the hon. Member for Leicester, South said so. The hon. Member for Upper Bann quoted what I said in Committee to support his argument, but in Committee he made it clear that he is much too good a lawyer not to expect other hon. Members to quote different parts of my speeches in Committee to counter his argument. I am grateful to the hon. Member for Leicester, South for doing so and for saving me the trouble.<br/>
I repeat what I said in Committee: the Royal Ulster Constabulary and the armed forces already have considerable powers to examine and establish people's identities. There is no evidence that the RUC experience any major problems in establishing people's identities. This point was made in Committee by the hon. Member for South Down (Mr. McGrady), and it remains as true now as it was then.<br/>
I am told that it would be technically feasible to produce an identity card and even one that would be difficult to forge, although there would be no guarantee that it would be impossible to forge. However, even if such a card were produced, all it would show was that it had been issued by the appropriate authority. It would not necessarily identify the individual who was holding it. It would not prove, for example, that the card had not been fraudulently applied for, or that the information on it was accurate. Accordingly, a sophisticated screening system would be necessary to prevent fraudulent applications.<br/>
7 pm<br/>
Given the scope for abuse with postal applications, a system of personal applications would probably be necessary. The population at which an identity card system would be particularly targeted&#x2014;terrorists and their supporters&#x2014;represents considerably less than 1 per cent. of the total population. Whether certain persons fall into this category would not be known to the issuing authority, and, given that consideration, the RUC would probably be the most appropriate issuing authority. However, this would present major resource difficulties for the RUC, and there would also be security reasons for not allowing too much public access to police buildings.<br/>
When the hon. Member for South Down raised some of the practical difficulties, most people could identify with them, whether or not they found them compelling. However, there are even more fundamental difficulties associated with such a scheme in the context of Northern Ireland that the House must bear in mind.<br/>
A number of right hon. and hon. Members on both sides of the argument have asked what would happen to those wishing to come to Northern Ireland who were not normally resident in the Province. The hon. Member for Upper Bann has tried to solve that problem, but the new clause does not answer some of the fundamental difficulties associated with it.<br/>
It is all very well saying that people from the Republic or from Great Britain could get an identity card before

coming, but where would they get it, from whom and on the basis of what information? How would that information be checked so that we could be sure that it was accurate?<br/>
There are serious problems at the heart of the issue. If that of dealing with people living outside Northern Ireland is put in the context of the United Kingdom, as it might be, some of the difficulties would be lessened, as they would be if it were put in the EC context, but that is not the issue before the House. We are dealing with these two clauses, which relate just to Northern Ireland.<br/>
I have a great deal of sympathy with the argument that such a scheme is likely to be a deterrent not only to visitors but to those who have an investment commitment to the Province. Ministers and hon. Members representing Northern Ireland constituencies spend a lot of time out and about around the world singing the praises of Northern Ireland&#x2014;its beauty, its hospitality, the generosity of its people to visitors and the advantage of investing there for the creation of jobs. It does not make sense then to introduce regulations which have no compelling security argument behind them but which would be detrimental to that process.<br/>
I pay tribute to the hon. Member for Upper Bann for his consistency. He said in Committee that he was not impressed by the civil libertarian argument against identity cards, and he repeated that this evening. Nevertheless, such arguments exist, and they are compelling for some people.</p>

<p>The hon. Member must have seen me turn to address the hon. Member for Antrim, North (Rev. Ian Paisley) to answer that point. I accept what the hon. Gentleman said about hearing police officers on television or personally saying that they are in favour of such a system. I do not question what he has told the House. He will want to know that the RUC were consulted on this subject, at senior level, during a major security review in 1988 and they said that they were not in favour of an identification card scheme&#x2014;for two reasons. First, they did not believe that such a system was necessary; secondly, they said that there would be formidable problems in administering an effective scheme. I hope that that answers the hon. Gentleman's point. That is the best and most up-to-date information that I have.</p>

<p>The advice was given in 1988; the hon. Gentleman will be able to work out the answer to his question from that information.<br/>
We have had a good debate and aired important issues that the House should consider. However, I am not convinced that the uncertain advantages of a compulsory identity card system outweigh the practical difficulties and penalties associated with it, or that the security arguments are compelling in the Northern Ireland context. Therefore, I hope that the hon. Member for Upper Bann will follow


the good precedent that he set in Committee and not push the new clause to a vote. If he does so, I must ask the House to resist it.</p>

<speech hansard_id="786243" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1991-03-06a.339.0" hansard_membership_id="271" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/3418" speakername="Mr. Trimble" colnum="339" time="18:30:00">
<p>As the Minister said, we have had a good debate. It was much longer than the debate we had in Committee, and a wider range of views have been expressed. One of the advantages of the debate is that we have now had a longer and more considered response from the Opposition. In Committee, the hon. Member for Leicester, South (Mr. Marshall) limited himself to two interventions.<br/>
I am sure that the hon. Member will understand when I say that I must take exception to his suggestion that I intended to, or did, mislead the House. No one could reasonably hold that view. I quoted precisely the words that the Minister used in Committee. The limited and tentative nature of his support for an identity card system was clear from the words that he used and, after quoting those words, I went on to disagree with them in some respects. No one could have been misled then, but if they were, I hope that I have made it clear now.<br/>
The burden of the observations of the hon. Member for Leicester, South and the Minister was that the security forces do not want an identity card system. I am not privy to the advice given by some senior officers in the RUC in 1988 but, like the hon. Member for Antrim, North (Rev. Ian Paisley), I have often heard members of the security forces refer to this system. I believe that the Northern Ireland Police Federation, like the Police Federation of England and Wales, as evidenced by the article that was coincidentally published this week, is in favour of it.<br/>
It is a constant wonder to those of us who represent constituencies in Northern Ireland how advice from senior levels of the RUC so often seems to contradict our experience and what we hear at almost all other levels of the RUC from those people to whom we speak when we come across them. Those views never seem to be expressed by people speaking to us. We could all benefit from such experiences.<br/>
The Minister of State said that this was a debate on Northern Ireland emergency provisions, not a debate on the United Kingdom or Europe. He was right to say that, strictly, some of these matters are not relevant, but such a narrow approach is not altogether realistic. Issues overlap, and form part of the background. I appreciate that there would be difficulties in operating this scheme on a purely Northern Ireland basis, but I am convinced that, even on that limited basis, there would be advantages, and that we must explore these matters further.<br/>
The hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East (Mr. Barnes) was worried about tampering with identity cards, and he referred to smart cards. Last year, the Home Affairs Select Committee argued in its seventh report for smart cards. I hope that the hon. Gentleman noticed that I did not argue for them. Cards could be tampered with. The system could be broken into and be open to abuse. I am not an expert and am prepared to be guided by those who are experts in this matter, but it may be safer to have a simpler card that relates to information held in security force data banks.<br/>
The new clause does not attempt to deal with all the points of detail. It is an authorising, empowering provision, which leaves it open to the Secretary of State to

make regulations. We would expect regulations to deal with many of the points made in the debate, particularly some of the Minister's.<br/>
Several hon. Members referred to the difficulties that would arise for visitors, and I agree that they would arise. I do not think that they can be avoided if security measures are to be taken. Significant numbers of people move back and forth between Northern Ireland and other places. At certain times of the year when thousands of people travel, hon. Members are occasionally caught up in huge queues at Heathrow, but the people involved travel year in and year out; they would need to get an identity card only once, or they could use other identity documents, if that were provided for by regulations. The problems could be overcome.<br/>
The hon. Member for South Down (Mr. McGrady) raised some interesting points which got him into some difficulty with hon. Members, especially when he said that it was strange that such an argument should come from our Benches, because it suggested that we wanted to create second-class citizens. He was not being integrationist; he was using the words ironically. I am sure that he appreciates the danger of irony because it often backfires; he will learn from that experience.<br/>
The hon. Member for South Down asked about the age from which people would carry identity cards. I am not old enough to remember it personally, but I believe that identity cards were carried by the entire population during the war. That answers his point.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman asked what the penalties would be. They would be a matter for the regulations. We have referred in previous debates to European precedents. In France, citizens are arrested if they cannot produce an identity card and are given four hours to find it. In Spain, people are given time to produce their card on request. Similar arrangements exist in Germany. A range of procedures could be followed, but I suspect that the suggestion by my hon. Friend the Member for Londonderry, East (Mr. Ross) would be the simplest procedure.<br/>
The hon. Member for South Down complained about my suggestion that the identity cards could be used in connection with information held in security force data banks and was worried about what that might lead to. This week, an article in<i>Police</i> states:
<q>In Denmark &#x2026; they record data from the cards onto computers. This information includes health service numbers, criminal records and even the number of a library ticket.</q>
That procedure does not seem to have worried the Danes. We should bear that information in mind when objections are made on a civil liberties or human rights basis.<br/>
The hon. Member for South Down referred to a practice which I mentioned earlier, whereby identity cards are logged on security force computers and tagged by reference to their owners' perceived activities. The hon. Gentleman mentioned the difficulties that people face when buying second-hand cars. He will realise that an identity card system would remove those difficulties, because the information would be tagged by reference to the identity card rather than the vehicle. I trust that there will not be a market in second-hand identity cards.</p>

<p>The hon. Member obviously did not pick up my point correctly. I said that, as many members of the security forces are on short-term duties in Northern


Ireland, presentation of an identity card by, for example, me would assist them in determining whether I was a terrorist or suspected terrorist. That could happen only if that card were accompanied by computerised data about which I knew nothing but which showed whether I was such a person. If that information is not attached, the card is just a piece of plastic which is entirely useless for security purposes.</p>

<p>That is what I said in introducing the new clause&#x2014;that there should be a link between an identity card and a computer database. That system exists. The hon. Gentleman talked earlier about the difficulties that some card owners would face. My point is that they would not get into difficulties if there were an identity card system.</p>

<p>People in Northern Ireland do not know what data are held on them. I am not sure that we should know. I am not sure that I want to know. By a roundabout route, I once discovered information held on security force files about me that was utterly wrong, but I thought that it was quite a joke. That would make an interesting story which I will not repeat. Anyone who wants to find out the whole story can see me outside.</p>

<p>On a point of information, let me explain what has happened in other circumstances. Some of my constituents have lost their jobs because of incorrect data held by the security forces. On only one occasion was I successful in getting an accusation rebutted and the person involved restored to his job. One has no control over the data. If that is acceptable to the hon. Member, democracy is down the drain.</p>

<p>We could pursue that matter at some length. There are several unknowns. One cannot assume that the information is always incorrect. We appreciate that there is a serious risk in Northern Ireland and that serious measures must be taken in response, just as they have been and will continue to be taken. Occasionally, inconveniences fall on innocent people. We expect people in the community to support the need for these measures and to accept inconveniences where they arise. That is necessary and it applies in respect of identity cards as well.<br/>
I was encouraged by some support during the debate, particularly by the hon. Member for Orpington (Mr. Stanbrook), who expressed his support, just as he did in Committee, although he supported cards on a United Kingdom basis. Perhaps such a system will end the anomalies that may arise by operating on a Northern Ireland basis only.<br/>
The hon. Member for Stockport (Mr. Favell) also supported an identity card system, although on a United Kingdom basis. I can think of no better way of concluding than by quoting the hon. Gentleman's exact words, and I hope that I do not mislead the House by doing so. The hon. Member said:
<q>I see no reason why an identity card should not be used throughout the United Kingdom, including Northern

Ireland. I firmly believe that the only people who would object are cranks and those who are up to no good&#x2014;the latter are the very people we want to trace quickly and bring to justice". &#x2014;[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee B,</i> 31 January 1991; c. 325.]</q>
That sums up the matter in a nutshell.<br/>
In view of the wide-ranging discussion we have had on this matter, my hon. Friends and I are confident that this cause will continue to progress. We believe that there is significant support for an identity card system, and we are encouraged that we are winning the argument on this matter. Consequently, I do not intend to press the motion to a Division but will seek to withdraw it, as I did in Committee. I am sorry if I have disappointed hon. Members who sought otherwise.<br/>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.</p>

<p>I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.<br/>
The purpose of the new clause is to uncover Government thinking on miscarriages of justice in Northern Ireland. We are also thinking of the consideration that the Secretary of State is giving to the case of the Ulster Defence Regiment Four, otherwise known as the Armagh Four. The new clause also deals with possible mechanisms that could be introduced to deal with suspected failures of justice.<br/>
The report of Sir John May on the implications of the Guildford Four case for the criminal justice system in England and Wales will soon be submitted. The conclusions that Sir John reaches, having examined all the factors involved, must be tackled by Northern Ireland Ministers. The new clause seeks to explore Government thinking on that and it gives hon. Members who wish to do so the opportunity to raise issues that they believe to he relevant to the case of the UDR Four.<br/>
We do not make any pretence that the new clause represents the best or the only way in which to tackle problems of miscarriages of justice in Northern Ireland. We do not intend to suggest that such miscarriages of justice are excessively frequent in Northern Ireland. Fortunately, the Court of Appeal in Northern Ireland has a good reputation, particularly on the supergrass trials. There is only one case that has gone to that court that has aroused great emotion and confusion in the community &#x2014;that of the Armagh Four.<br/>
There is a need to consider ways in which such miscarriages of justice can be resolved, especially given the sensitive nature of public confidence in the administration


of justice in Northern Ireland. That is a fragile commodity and there is a paramount need for an effective, corrective mechanism in Northern Ireland.<br/>
The present law is embodied in section 14 of the Criminal Appeal (Northern Ireland) Order 1980, which gives the Secretary of State discretionary power to refer a case to the Court of Appeal when he believes that some new evidence or factor not available at the time of the trial has come to light. It is on the basis of that particular power that the Secretary of State is now considering the fresh material submitted by hon. Members representing Northern Ireland in the case of the UDR Four.<br/>
Our solution to the problem is to take away the Secretary of State's present role when considering possible miscarriages of justice. It is hard for the ordinary citizen to distinguish between the semi-judicial and political roles of the Attorney-General, but it is infinitely more difficult for people to distinguish between the high profile political role adopted by the Secretary of State and his quasi-judicial one when he discusses evidence before him. We believe that the Attorney-General, in his capacity as Law Officer, would be more suitable than the Secretary of State to handle such cases. It might be thought that the Secretary of State has responded to particular political pressures in certain cases.<br/>
The case of the Armagh Four is happily the only major case of possible miscarriage of justice in Northern Ireland. On this island, however, we have had the cases of the Guildford Four, the Birmingham Six and the Maguire family. The Armagh Four are four members of the UDR who are contesting their convictions for murder. It is not for me to declare their guilt or innocence, but the Secretary of State will know of my concern from correspondence that I had with his predecessor. Members of the families of some of those convicted have approached me and I am aware of the unease felt not only in Northern Ireland but in the rest of the United Kingdom about the safety of the convictions.<br/>
Obviously, the interests of justice and public confidence in the criminal legal system demand that the evidence collected by the supporters of the Armagh Four, some of whom may speak later in the debate, should be scrutinised by the Court of Appeal as quickly as possible. We hope that the Government will introduce a long-term mechanism that will obviate the need for my previous remarks, and prevent the need for such long-drawn-out campaigns by many people in Northern Ireland, including the hon. Members for Belfast, East (Mr. Robinson) and for Fermanagh and South Tyrone (Mr. Maginnis).<br/>
7.30 pm<br/>
The interests of justice demand a self-correcting mechanism in the criminal legal system which will remove the need for outside pressure. A booklet has been produced by campaigners who support the case for the retrial of the UDR Four. Point 8 in the introduction makes an interesting and valid comment on which I should like the Minister of State to comment. The compilers of the dossier say:
<q>We contend that the referral of this case to the Court of Appeal will have been brought to the point of inevitability by the contents of this dossier.</q>
That is a matter for judgment, but it is the opinion of the people who prepared the dossier, which continues:

<q>However, the Secretary of State might also like to consider whether or not it would be more appropriate that there be a police inquiry by another force &#x2026; such as preceded the resolution of the Guildford case. More particularly, not that an investigation has commenced, the scope and remit must be widened and the legal representatives of the men should be given access to all the relevant material.</q>
That is important and it is necessary for it to be carried out.<br/>
The May report will no doubt contain many important recommendations, but it is not for us to guess what they will be. It is important carefully to consider the need for an independent forensic service in Northern Ireland and Great Britain. That has been shown by the English cases, and the need has also been shown by what is happening, or may have happened, in Northern Ireland.<br/>
Cases such as that of the Armagh Four always arouse great emotions. In a contentious situation the attitude of the Secretary of State or any other Minister is bound to create controversy on both sides of the community. It is vital that both sides of the community have absolute confidence in the administration of justice. Taking away decisions that have to be made by the Secretary of State because of the existing law and putting them in the hands of the Attorney-General or into some other mechanism, if one can be found&#x2014;we are not bound by the details of our proposal&#x2014;would make a judicial decision less politically flawed. Already, too many decisions in Northern Ireland have caused grave questions to be asked not about the judges, but about Ministers.</p>

<p>I am grateful to the Opposition for the new clause because it enables us to debate a case that is vital to the interests of everyone in Northern Ireland. I approached the Secretary of State about this matter and he graciously responded and said that he certainly would be prepared to consider any evidence that we would prepare and put to him. I and my hon. Friend the Member for Belfast, East (Mr. Robinson), who will seek to catch your eye, Mr. Deputy Speaker, were appointed by our party to consider the preparation of a dossier. The remit was widened and a committee of all interested parties was set up and prepared the dossier from which the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, North (Mr. McNamara) has quoted.<br/>
The Secretary of State has received that document and has assured me and my colleague, the leader of the Official Unionist party, the right hon. Member for Lagan Valley (Mr. Molyneaux), that he is giving it careful attention. The Secretary of State has a quasi-judicial role in this matter. I urge on him the necessity of a speedy decision because at the end of the day his decision is really a referral to a court which will decide whether there is a case to be answered and whether the weight of the new evidence is such that it would be unsafe to uphold the verdict of a previous court.<br/>
I am convinced that the weight of the new evidence and some of the facts that have come to light cast considerable suspicion and a shadow upon certain witnesses upon whose word the judge largely depended in his summing up. The statements of those witnesses have been challenged and seem to be seriously flawed.<br/>
I am alarmed by a matter that was brought to light by Mrs. Mairead Maguire, who was better known to many of us as Mairead Corrigan during the high days of the peace movement in Northern Ireland. Mrs. Maguire has been looking at the case of the UDR Four and at the part played by two well-known Roman Catholic priests, Father


Faul and Father Murray. In a letter Mrs. Maguire says that she accepts what the dossier states about her role in this matter. There is no challenge to what is contained in the dossier.<br/>
Mrs. Maguire said that the two priests had collected certain evidence against the UDR in this case but that they would not give it to the Royal Ulster Constabulary until they had undertakings from the Chief Constable and higher authority. Those undertakings were:
<q>1. That an entire UDR patrol, operating in the North of the city, should be arrested by Police Officers from another locality.</q>
<q>2. That the UDR soldiers should be taken to a holding centre other than Gough Barracks, namely, Castlereagh.</q>
<q>3. Interrogating Officers should be of Senior Rank and again the majority of these officers, preferably completely unknown to any of the Soldiers.</q>
Until those undertakings were given and carried out, the priests were not prepared to present the evidence that they had collected.<br/>
It is troubling to know that certain people can go to the authorities and ask for something to be done before they are prepared to bring forward evidence. I am alarmed at the fact that it has been established beyond doubt that when RUC officers and members of the Ulster Defence Regiment are brought before a court on charges relating to violence or terrorist crimes, the authorities go the double mile to make the defence case difficult to present. In prison, they even lose the facilities that are given to members of the IRA and other organisations. In case after case, I have had great difficulty obtaining even the elementary parole that was due to some police officers. I have raised that matter before and I find it difficult to understand.<br/>
I agree with the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, North that all classes in Northern Ireland should feel that they have recourse to justice and that justice will not only be seen to be done but will eventually be done. Whoever it is, that should he established in their mind. But when I talk to the families of police officers and members of the UDR who have been charged with such crimes, it is apparent that even in prison their membership of the security forces is held against them, and that is not right. I trust that the Secretary of State will take that on board this evening.<br/>
I am grateful to the hon. Member for tabling the new clause, but he knows that I do not agree with it. I do not want the Attorney-General to have this power because if he did we would not be having a debate such as this. All sorts of judicial barriers would be put up and Mr. Speaker would be telling us that we should proceed in accordance with the motion and it is unlikely that I would be able to table such a motion so there would be no opportunity to discuss such a matter. Therefore, I am arguing tonight that the Secretary of State should retain and exercise the power.<br/>
I come to the authority upon which the judge seemed to rest when he gave his verdict&#x2014;witness A. I am sure that all hon. Members will be amazed to hear something of what happened to witness A. Witness A had some terrible things to say when she appeared on Radio Telefis Eireann about how she found herself having to give evidence against the UDR men. There is also a typescript of a telephone conversation between witness A and Mr. Hegan. In that, she states clearly that the two officers who were interrogating her said that
<q>they were bad boys and that no judge in the land would ever let them out. He said that if they get out and they kill someone, he says, it will be your fault for letting them out &#x2026;

because they'll murder all round them. I said I didn't believe they done it. He said 'They done it all right'. So what d'you want me to &#x2026; what do you expect me to believe?</q>
We cannot try anyone in the House, nor can anyone be tried on television, but when a question mark is placed over evidence given on oath on which the judge largely relied, and said that he did, there must be an inquiry. I urge the Secretary of State to do his level best to bring his inquiries to a speedy conclusion. As I have said, he is not passing a verdict&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>

<p>Yes. That is why I say that the Secretary of State is not asked to give a verdict; he is asked to say that the court should have another look at the evidence. We are asking the Secretary of State for a referral.<br/>
7.45 pm<br/>
I am also worried about the electrostatic data analysis reports from the police. I do not know why those have riot been made available. I have talked to the Chief Constable about the matter. The fact that he has set up an inquiry into the matter arouses suspicion. If he feels that he has to appoint a high ranking officer to investigate the ESDA reports, there must be something to investigate. Those reports need to be made public. Certainly the lawyers for those four young men should have them. I urge the Secretary of State to come to a speedy conclusion on the matter.<br/>
As I have said in an early-day motion, this matter affects a wide range of people in Northern Ireland. It casts its shadow across the Province. If some members of the police force have acted wrongly and illegally, they must be brought to justice and dealt with. There cannot be and must not be any cover-up. After all, those four young men put their own lives at risk by joining the UDR. They could have had their lives taken from them; they could have been shot by the IRA if they had continued to serve in the regiment.<br/>
Bearing in mind that the four were members of the UDR, a regiment of the British Army set up by the House, and bearing in mind what the people who are not sympathetic to the Loyalist position have been saying&#x2014;I salute them because they are prepared to face up to the matter&#x2014;it is imperative that the Secretary of State refer the matter to the court as quickly as possible. I make that personal plea tonight with all the passion of my heart, having known the young men and their families for years and having known what they have gone through. Then the court can give them a proper trial and the allegations in the dossier can be tested in a court of law. The people against whom they have been made will have the opportunity to rebut them if they are able to do so. No man should be seen as guilty before he is proved guilty.<br/>
There are many other matters in the dossier that I could read to the House, but I will not do so. Through the extracts that I have read, I have tried to show just how serious the matter is. I urge the Secretary of State tonight to give some hope to the four young men and to their families that the country that they have sought to serve so faithfully and well is prepared to give them the right that every British citizen should have&#x2014;the right to British justice.</p>

<p>New clause 2 is entitled "Miscarriages of Justice". I am grateful to the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, North (Mr. McNamara) and to his hon. Friends for giving the House an opportunity to debate the unfortunate consequences of such incidents.<br/>
Given human nature, there is always a chance that something will go wrong with the legal process. When miscarriages of justice occur, they are blots not only on the police, as the investigating officers, but on the the defence and prosecution solicitors and barristers, the judiciary, and the community in general. We have every right to feel deeply concerned when miscarriages occur, and we should do all that we can to make amends.<br/>
I was once involved in a case in which an individual admitted to murder when questioned by the police, pleaded guilty to murder&#x2014;it was a particularly vile murder at a farmhouse&#x2014;and was given a long sentence. As a constituent of mine, he subsequently wrote to me. Like most Members of Parliament who are contacted by prisoners, at first I wondered whether he was not just another of the innocent men of which prisons seem to be full whenever one speaks to their inmates. That prisoner also wrote to Mr. Douglas, who represented a Londonderry constituency at Stormont&#x2014;and as the murdered man was a neighbour of his, both Mr. Douglas and myself started our own investigations.<br/>
Mr. Douglas visited the farmyard where the murder took place. By then, we both had a good idea of the contents of the convicted man's statements. We discovered that he had described not the yard in which the murder had actually been committed, but one a mile or so down the road. We were left in an extremely difficult situation. Mr. Douglas and I went to see the right hon. Member for Chelsea (Mr. Scott), who was then a Northern Ireland Minister. If the Secretary of State cares to talk to the right hon. Member for Chelsea, I am sure that he will recall this clearly. We put our views to that Minister, having discussed the case at considerable length with the police. Eventually, the right hon. Member for Chelsea, the police, and ourselves were thoroughly convinced that something was wrong, but we were in some dilemma as to what could be done.<br/>
The matter was eventually resolved when another individual made a statement to the police indicating that he had driven the car that had taken a group of robbers to the farmhouse where the murder had taken place. Unfortunately for my constituent still in prison, that witness subsequently committed suicide. We found ourselves in an even more difficult situation. We were in possession of a confession from a dead man, another man was in prison, and there was evidence that seemed to cast a deep shadow of doubt over the safeness of the conviction.<br/>
As it happened, my constituent was released some months later. Nevertheless, that experience brought home to me the necessity of collaborative evidence. It is well known that whenever a murder occurs&#x2014;the more vile its nature, the more likely this is to happen&#x2014;there is a queue of people waiting to claim the credit for it. That happened even when the death penalty was still in force.<br/>
Police questioning techniques have moved on, and the police can play on the psychology of the suspect and exert considerable pressure. There is a danger that people admit to crimes that they did not commit, which is why we need more than a signed confession. When the innocent are

convicted, or convict themselves, the unfortunate consequence is that the guilty escape due retribution for their wicked deeds. The case that I described makes me view with somewhat less jaundiced eyes those individuals who, having been convicted, then claim that they are not guilty. I begin to wonder whether they are not further examples of the type of case in which I was involved.<br/>
I know nothing of the Birmingham Six, the Guildford Four, or the Maguire family, because they have little to do with Londonderry, East. Nor have I concerned myself with the case of the UDR Four, to which a large part of the debate has been devoted, because they were from the constituency of a late colleague, Mr. Harold McCusker. I well remember his reaction whenever a member of the Ulster Defence Regiment was charged with murder. He was exceedingly angry that the regiment was once again being besmirched.<br/>
When Harold McCusker first talked to the UDR Four, he was a very troubled man&#x2014;and he was not a fool, as those right hon. and hon. Members who knew him can testify. He undertook extensive investigations, and I understand that his wife is still associated with the committee involved with the UDR Four. The more he examined the facts, the more convinced he became of the innocence of those individuals and that there had been a grave miscarriage of justice.<br/>
I have not been personally involved, but since Harold's death, other hon. Members have taken an interest in that case&#x2014;not least the hon. Member for Belfast, East (Mr. Robinson), party leaders, and the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone (Mr. Maginnis), who has reported fully to the members of his party. Having myself heard the results of investigations, I have grown more and more concerned. The powerful case being made for the UDR Four should be fully investigated, and a completely fresh look should be taken at what appears to be a most dreadful miscarriage of justice, with four soldiers serving life sentences for murder.<br/>
Complaints are sometimes made about the fragility of justice in Northern Ireland. However, in the face of the most dreadful provocation and difficulties, it has proved far more robust than in England&#x2014;to judge from the number of people apparently being found not guilty after serving many years in prison.<br/>
Frankly, I am not one of those to call for speedy decisions, in the light of my experience in investigating one such case. I want careful and deep consideration to be given to this matter, and not a precipitate announcement. I want the matter to be thoroughly investigated and I want the truth to come out for the good of all concerned, because that is the safest and the wisest way to proceed.<br/>
In all four cases with which we have been concerned &#x2014;three in England and one in Northern Ireland&#x2014;where people have been tried and convicted, it would appear that in England the police reached quick decisions and acted upon them, that people were convicted and that on every occasion the guilty have escaped.<br/>
8 pm<br/>
Certain questions follow on from that regarding police activities after the trials were over and convictions had been handed down. Did the police consider that their work was done in each of those cases? Did they stop asking questions? Did they close the files? Did they forget about the 21 people who died in a Birmingham pub? Did they forget about all the folk who died as a result of the alleged


activities of the other accused? If so, people are walking around who committed those murders and who have got away with them because the police did not do their jobs properly and because, frankly, the courts and the lawyers did not do their jobs properly. That is a real blot on the legal system in this country, and it must be tackled and corrected because the people of this country cannot afford to lose faith in the judicial system or in the capacity of the police&#x2014;whether the RUC in Northern Ireland or any of the police forces in England&#x2014;to carry out efficient, in-depth investigations that enable them to lay their hands on the guilty, rather than condemn the innocent. It is a serious matter, which will not go away.<br/>
We are grateful to the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, North and to his hon. Friends for tabling the new clause. Our discussions have perhaps wandered rather far from the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Bill but this matter had to be aired in the House, and aired rather bluntly.<br/>
I have investigated one such case in my constituency. The individual concerned was eventually released on licence. In the light of all that has happened since, I wonder whether that decision should not also be reconsidered and a fresh trial granted to that man, who has now been free for some years. The fact that he is still under licence is not a satisfactory outcome for him.<br/>
If the four Ulster Defence Regiment men, or any of the other people mentioned, were to be released on licence, the blot would remain. That blot must be removed if they are innocent; and if they are not, proof of the guilt should be put beyond any reasonable doubt.<br/>
There is more to say, but I think that all the necessary things have been said about these cases many times over. I should prefer the matter to remain with the Secretary of State for a decision rather than going to the Attorney-General. I find it easier to talk to another politician than to a legal man. No matter how much I may disagree with the politician, at least we can keep on hammering at him, time after time, in this place. That is a good reason to let the matter rest with the Secretary of State for a decision, and that is the only quibble that I have with the new clause.<br/>
I hope that the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, North will carry the provisions of the new clause into effect. In his opening remarks he said that the reason for the new clause was to explore the Government's mind. The hon. Member may rest assured of one thing&#x2014;he has put his view, hon. Members representing Northern Ireland have put their views, and we now wait with interest to find out what the mind of the Government is.</p>

<p>I should like to add my voice to those who have thanked the shadow Secretary of State for tabling this new clause, which has given us an opportunity to speak on an issue of some considerable importance to people in Northern Ireland, none more so than the four men who have been imprisoned for the past seven years as a result of a miscarriage of justice.<br/>
At least in its more candid moments, the House will recognise that miscarriages of justice occur. Happily, however infrequently that may happen, this is not a perfect world. From time to time, either people who enforce law and order in Northern Ireland or members of the judiciary in Northern Ireland make mistakes. It is quite clear that one such mistake was the conviction of four men arising out of the murder of Adrian Carroll on 8 November 1983. Four of the six men who appeared before the court were

convicted&#x2014;all were members of an Ulster Defence Regiment patrol. The men were charged with murder and the basis of the Crown case against them was that together, and with others, they had conspired to murder a well-known republican, Adrian Carroll, and that they had done so in a premeditated fashion.<br/>
The Crown described the way in which they had carried out the murder. To support its contention, it had signed statements from five of the men before the court and a statement from a witness, known as Mrs. A. The Crown had another and, in my view, more important witness&#x2014;indeed, the only witness who was able to give evidence that she saw the gunman. She was the only eye-witness to the killing of Adrian Carroll. She was brought by the Crown to the court and was never broken down during cross-examination or by evidence in chief. She testified that the gunman she saw on the day of the killing was smaller than she was&#x2014;she is 5 ft 4 in&#x2014;and that he was not the person charged with murder, Neil Latimer. That was the evidence given by the Crown's eye-witness.<br/>
The eye-witness to the event had clearly testified that, not only was the person in court and arraigned as being the gunman not the gunman; it was someone considerably smaller. Neil Latimer is 5 ft 10 in and the estimated height of the gunman is 5 ft 2 in. There were a number of other witnesses to a pattern of events on the day of the killing which was considerably different from the pattern suggested by the Crown. Mrs. A, who was not at the scene of the crime, identified Neil Latimer close to Armagh on that day in dress similar to that which Elaine Faulkner, the single eye-witness, had said that the gunman was wearing. That produced a link for the Crown between the evidence of witness A, who said that she had seen Neil Latimer, and the events that took place in Abbey street in Armagh.<br/>
To all intents and purposes, the signed statements of the men in question led to their convictions. As I said, more than four men appeared before the court, but the case against one man was thrown out precisely because the court recognised that undue pressure had been applied to him under interrogation. It recognised that the police had behaved in a way in which they were not entitled to behave to secure a signed confession from the man. The same judge could not, however, accept that the same pressure could have been applied to the four other men before him, or that their signed statements could have resulted from physical or mental torture by the RUC.<br/>
The four men gave evidence to the effect that they had not signed their statements willingly, and that the statements had not been written by them but had been concocted by others. The most important evidence against the four was represented by those signed statements of admission, which suggested a pattern of events that fitted the evidence of witness A.<br/>
As the two pillars of the case against the four were their signed statements and the evidence of witness A, the judge, in finding the four soldiers guilty, was disregarding the evidence of the one eye-witness who had testified that the accused was not the gunman, the evidence of the Archbishop's gardener, who had seen the gunman depart in a different direction from that mentioned in the Crown case, the evidence of a police patrol who had been on the road by which, according to the Crown case, the gunman had left, but had not seen him, the evidence of a resident of Abbey street who said that the man who had shot Adrian Carroll had left by a different route from that described by the Crown, and the evidence of other


members of the UDR who had been in the same patrol as the four men. If the four were guilty, they were not guilty alone; nine other guilty men are outside prison. The Crown case was that the entire patrol was involved in the murder. I should add that the judge also went against the evidence of the four men.<br/>
Since the appeal, much new evidence has come to light. Like the hon. Member for Londonderry, East (Mr. Ross), I live some distance from the constituency, and I felt that the matter did not directly involve me. No one from the constituency had come to see me. Some years later, however, I met the mother of one of the four men by chance at a wedding. She told me, "My son is serving a life sentence in prison for a crime of which he is not guilty."<br/>
I confess that at the time I thought, "Well, she would say that, wouldn't she?". Naturally a mother would find it hard to believe that her son might be guilty of murder. The lady&#x2014;Christian lady that she was&#x2014;said that she would send me some papers to try to convince me. Of course, I expressed willingness to read any papers that she sent. I was rather surprised when, about a week later, the papers arrived. She had sent me the judgment of the Court of Appeal. It struck me as strange that someone who was trying to convince me of her son's innocence should send me the judgment that had convicted him rather than, for instance, her counsel's summation of the case in his defence.<br/>
I read the judgment. On five or six occasions, the Lord Chief Justice had had to consider whether to take the side of the Crown or that of the defence in order to settle a matter of contention. Each time, he had come down in favour of the Crown. Whenever there was doubt, he gave the Crown the benefit of the doubt. I had always thought that the benefit of the doubt should be given to the accused, especially in murder cases, in which sentences of life imprisonment can be imposed.<br/>
8.15 pm<br/>
After reading that lengthy judgment, my initial scepticism diminished. I was no longer sure that the conviction was safe. I could not and did not say at that stage, either publicly or privately, that I believed the men to be innocent, but I asked the lady to send me more documentation&#x2014;a request that I regretted somewhat on the arrival of a 4ft-high pile of transcripts of both the original trial and the appeal.<br/>
As I waded through those papers, I became convinced beyond doubt that the conviction was insecure. The more I read, the more doubt I felt. I met the families of the convicted men. At that time, the only campaign for their release was the one promoted by their families. They had no new evidence then, apart from a transcript of what had been said by witness A on an RTE programme. That transcript had been given to the Secretary of State's predecessor, who had judged that it did not amount to new evidence that would justify the referral of the case to the Court of Appeal with a recommendation for a retrial.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Antrim, North (Rev. Ian Paisley) was, however, promised that, if we provided a dossier of new evidence, the Secretary of State would consider it carefully. About 18 months ago, we set about putting the dossier together. We suspected then that it might take us two or three weeks, but the more that we

delved into the case, the more doubt entered our minds, the more queries were raised and the more new evidence was unearthed.<br/>
At that point, the two props that had held up the prosecution case in court were pulled away. There can be only two ways of drawing the statements signed by the two men into question, both of which are forensic. The most direct is a test known as syntax analysis&#x2014;a linguistic test involving the examination of the formation of words and sentences, from which it aims to determine whether the words and sentences used in the text in question could have been uttered or written by its supposed author. The authority on that test is Professor Andrew Morton, of Edinburgh university. He has considerable expertise, and has been employed in cases elsewhere in the United Kingdom, as well as in the United States and Australia. He has written many books about his work, which is considered completely accurate.<br/>
Professor Morton was given copies of letters written by the four UDR members, and their so-called statements of admission. When he compared the two, he reached a definite conclusion and when I spoke to him on the telephone, he described his findings plainly. I approached the subject almost sideways. I did not want to imply an answer in the terms in which I put my question; I made it clear that I wanted his view. I asked him whether any concern arose from his study of the letters and the statements of admission. He replied:
<q>There is cause for more than concern, there is cause for alarm. They"&#x2014;</q>
the confessions&#x2014;
<q>are quite unsatisfactory. Not one of them is a genuine confession of the accused.</q>
That man has considerable experience in the subject. He studied each of the confessions and determined that not one of them was genuine. In more detail, he suggested that the statements had been concocted by more than one person, which fits with the views expressed by the four men concerned, who said that their so-called confessions were concocted by the interviewing officers and that they were forced to sign them. Syntax analysis establishes that the so-called statements of confession were not made by the four purported authors of them.<br/>
The second way to assess the accuracy, and therefore the relevance, of signed confessions is the electrostatic data analysis technique. The legal representatives of the families of the four men asked the RUC to carry out ESDA tests on the interview notes. The Chief Constable of the RUC was given a preliminary report by the forensic science laboratory, presumably because of its concern about the results of the tests. The preliminary tests showed that a considerable number of alterations had been made.<br/>
The laboratory considered about 200 documents, and the ESDA tests showed that changes had been made to almost every page of the interview notes. In some cases, there was a multiplicity of changes in the interview notes.<br/>
The initial test results fuelled the concern of the Chief Constable who, rightly and properly, before awaiting the final document, asked one of his senior officers to carry out an investigation. He would not have ordered such an investigation because somebody had not spelt a word right, because their grammar was not right or because they got the name of a town or place wrong. Such an investigation would be ordered only if changes of some significance had been made. The Chief Constable admitted by his statement that the ESDA tests caused some concern


about the authenticity of the interview notes. The syntax and ESDA tests question the correctness of the so-called signed statements of confession, which were one of the main pillars, if not the main pillar, of the prosecution case.<br/>
As the statements were supported by the evidence of witness A, we must consider how that evidence stands up in the light of the fresh evidence. My hon. Friend the Member for Antrim, North mentioned how the process began. Witness A called in two parish priests who assisted her&#x2014;I use that term having considered fully the consequences of it&#x2014;to put her statement into writing. During the court case, it was recognised that she signed her name on seven blank pieces of paper and that the statement was included afterwards.<br/>
As I understand it, the priests went to the local police chiefs and said, "We have evidence which implicates members of the Ulster Defence Regiment in the murder of Adrian Carroll." The natural response of the police chief to whom they spoke was, "I hope that is not true." On hearing that, the priests felt that the police were reluctant to take action against the UDR men and said, "We shall take our statement elsewhere."<br/>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Antrim, North said, according to Mairead Maguire of the peace people and Mr. and Mrs. Bell, the father and mother of one of the four UDR men, Father Faul admitted to them that he went to see the Chief Constable and someone higher. I shall not abuse the rules of the House by naming that person because I have no evidence against him, but as it is an hon. Member I am being particularly cautious. They were given three undertakings before they handed over the statement: first, that the RUC would arrest a patrol of the UDR; secondly&#x2014;this was a fairly understandable concession&#x2014;that they would be interviewed by officers who did not know them and who were senior in rank, which is normal interrogation procedure; and, thirdly, that they would be interviewed in Castlereagh holding centre and not Gough barracks. Hon. Members are wondering why on earth Father Faul, who has castigated Castlereagh holding centre, would want the men held there rather than at Gough barracks. Presumably, he sought to get them moved further from the location in which they were known. Therefore, before the statement of evidence was given to the Chief Constable of the RUC, an undertaking had been given to arrest a patrol of the UDR.</p>

Therefore, the arrest was not only unlawful but the decision to arrest people was taken with the participation of someone higher than the Chief Constable. If it transpires that that person was an hon. Member and perhaps a Minister in the Northern Ireland Office, that was grave interference by a member of the Executive in a quasi-judicial decision, which is quite unprecedented and has grave constitutional implications that should be explored.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman is, of course, right. That incident has given rise to wide-ranging ramifications &#x2014;if Father Faul's statement is true. The hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, North (Mr. McNamara) said that the Secretary of State was being asked to refer the case to the Court of Appeal for retrial and to consider whether it might be appropriate for a further investigation to be

carried out. That is an important point that needs to be underlined, especially given the special circumstances of this case.<br/>
8.30 pm<br/>
In relation to witness A's statement, the agreement had apparently been entered in before it was in the hands of the police or even of its Chief Constable. That would be very bad if it happened in connection with any member of the general public, but we are talking about a patrol of the British Army&#x2014;about members of our security forces. The fact that an undertaking was given to arrest members of the security forces without seeing any evidence against them seems totally absurd. However, I shall not labour that point because my general point relates to the validity of the evidence of witness A.<br/>
After her statement was handed over, the RUC presumably started to question witness A and to get details from her. As my hon. Friend the Member for Antrim, North has said, a transcript is now available of a telephone conversation between witness A and the father of one of the four men who has been convicted. It is available in the dossier and I have the original tape. It contains several points of importance suggesting that witness A was pressurised at various stages when she was giving evidence.<br/>
In court, when the accused person to whom I referred earlier was discharged because it was felt that undue pressure had been applied to him, witness A telephoned the parents of one of the four UDR men and said, "I am unhappy at what is happening in court and I intend to retract my evidence." One can imagine the feelings in the home of the parents of that young UDR man when they were informed that the witness upon whom the prosecution was relying intended to retract her evidence. Naturally, the parents informed their legal representative who, next day, sought to have witness A recalled so that she would be in a position to retract. During that day, the court was informed that witness A was not available, but that she would be brought to court on the following Monday. The telephone transcript showed that witness A was not only available, but was ready to go to court. However, instead of being brought to the court, she was deliberately taken instead to Mahon road police station where she was pressurised not to retract, but to stand by her evidence.<br/>
According to witness A's own mouth, therefore, the police had deliberately obstructed justice from being done and the Crown counsel had unknowingly misled the court by stating that the witness was unavailable, no doubt on the basis of the information that had been received from the police. As has already been recorded in <i>Hansard,</i> the remarks were attributed to witness A because she was told that those men were murderers; that the police knew that they were murderers, and that if she did not stand by her evidence, the blood that they would shed in the future would be upon her.<br/>
If witness A is to be believed, there are serious consequences for the RUC. However, I do not believe that witness A is to be believed. It was unknown to us at the time of the trial, at the time of the appeal and until recently, but it has been established, that witness A has twice been in a mental institution for what was termed "a psychopathic personality". I am informed that her medical history notes that:
<q>(a) she is a danger to herself and to her children.</q>
<q>(b) she is &#x2026; persecuted.</q>


<q>(c) she is inclined to be jealous.</q>
<q>(d) she is very unstable, emotionally varying from depression to aggressive tendencies &#x2026; demanding to get out of hospital yet due to her attitudes and threats one could not allow her to do so.</q>
<q>(e) she is suffering from a mixed psychoneurotic reaction.</q>
She was recorded as suffering from:&#x2014;
<ol><li>(1) Obsessional fears or thoughts.</li>
<li>(2) Disturbance of behaviour and activity.</li>
<li>(3) Delusions and misinterpretations."</li></ol>
I repeat that the Crown's key witness is someone whose mental history shows that she suffers from delusions and misinterpretations.<br/>
Under the new clause, it will be the Attorney-General&#x2014;at present it is the Secretary of State&#x2014;who has the job of referring such cases to the Court of Appeal. Knowing what we now know about witness A's background and the evidence about the confessions, I ask the House how anyone could possibly believe that, if the judge at the trial or the judges at the appeal had had that information available to them, they would not have arrived at a different conclusion. In my view, it is a probability&#x2014;at the very least, it must be a distinct possibility. Furthermore, there is other and additional new evidence. Therefore, the job of the Secretary of State, or what would be the job of the Attorney-General if we adopted the suggestion of the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, North, is to decide whether to refer the case to the Court of Appeal so that it might consider the strengths and depths of the new evidence that is available to us.<br/>
There is no longer any need for the Secretary of State to wait for the final report from the RUC, the result of its investigations into the ESDA tests, or of the investigation into the interviewing officers who have to explain away why changes were made in the interview notes. If one sets aside the ESDA tests, there are still compelling reasons&#x2014;indeed, an irresistible case&#x2014;why the Secretary of State must refer that case to the Court of Appeal for a retrial. If he was to do otherwise, it would bring into discredit the whole process of law in Northern Ireland.,<br/>
I happen to believe that, simply because a mistake has been made in the judicial system or in the police system of law and order enforcement, that does not mean that the system is rotten or that it needs to be dragged down; it simply means that a mistake has been made and that it has to be put right. We damage the system more by pretending that a mistake has not occurred and that everything is all right when everybody of four years of age and upwards in Northern Ireland knows that it is not all right. If we were to suggest that our courts and our police are infallible, we might fool ourselves, but we would not fool the people of Northern Ireland or the general public anywhere else in the United Kingdom.<br/>
Mistakes can be made and a mistake has been made. I urge the Secretary of State at the earliest opportunity to send this case to the Court of Appeal. He does not have to decide the innocence or guilt of the four men&#x2014;and he will be glad that he does not have that onerous responsibility &#x2014;but he has a responsibility to judge whether there is sufficient new evidence or significant new factors to merit the case going before the Court of Appeal. Having heard what I have said in the past few minutes outlining a part

of the new evidence, the Secretary of State has an unanswerable case for passing the detail to the Court of Appeal.</p>

<p>I had not intended to speak, but on reflection I felt that I should, because for some time I have been pressing at business questions for the Secretary of State or the Attorney-General to come to the House to make a statement on the case of the UDR Four. Therefore, if I do not speak now, some people may think that I am running away from the issue on the only occasion that we have been able to debate it.<br/>
I should be happier if the new clause referred to the Secretary of State rather than the Attorney-General. I welcome the understanding that the new clause has been tabled to tease out Government thinking. So long as matters are in the realm of the Secretary of State, it will be possible for hon. Members to raise them sooner or later in the Chamber. One can choose different ways of doing so. If a matter is kept strictly within the sphere of the legal fraternity, we cannot get the necessary debate and scrutiny.<br/>
I have been interested in the case since shortly after the four men were arrested and detained in custody prior to trial. The right hon. Member for Witney (Mr. Hurd) will remember, if he reads the debate, that I was in correspondence with him about the trial being brought forward quickly, for two reasons. First, I still believe that justice delayed is justice denied. Secondly, I have had grave misgivings over the years about servants of the Crown being imprisoned in the same place as terrorists and ordinary criminals who know their background. Having spent a couple of day in Her Majesty's "hotel" at Crumlin road, and having been there when a young British soldier was brought in, I know the feeling of prison inmates that he should not have been there.<br/>
I pressed for the trial to be brought forward. I was convinced of the innocence of the four men. The case had been brought to my attention by the prison chaplain who asked me, at their request, to visit them. I listened carefully to their story, because I have been around long enough to realise that most people want to paint the best picture of their case. As I probed them, I was absolutely convinced that they had not been party to the crimes of which they were accused. Time elapsed before the trial. I will not go into detail on the trial, but several points lend credence to the belief that there has been a miscarriage of justice. The time has come to put it right by an open examination of the facts.<br/>
I think that it was a previous Secretary of State who suggested in a letter to a colleague that the retraction of the evidence of witness A was unimportant in so far as her evidence did not lead to the conviction but only to the police being able to extract confessions. I may be naive, but I am speaking now in tribute to my young colleague in the Northern Ireland Assembly, Edgar Graham, who was murdered by the IRA. He was one of the brightest young legal brains in the United Kingdom, and respected equally in the United States.<br/>
Sitting on the Assembly bench in Stormont, I said to Edgar, "I cannot understand how anyone would confess to a crime which he had not committed." He said, "I know what you are saying, but all I can say from my legal background is that I have seen it happen time and time


again. People can be conditioned into saying things that lead to their conviction when they have not been party to the crime."<br/>
Thereafter, I began to look afresh at the case. We have an opportunity in the Chamber to highlight a miscarriage of justice, in the opinion of many people in Northern Ireland. There should be a proper appeal procedure to examine the evidence again and to bring out a new verdict, which I believe, in the light of the information and evidence now available, will be not guilty.<br/>
Servants of the Crown have as much right as others to the protection of the legal system. If we are prepared to allow a right of appeal to others who, so far as we can see, have been improperly convicted, servants of the Crown should not be penalised simply because they were servants of the Crown and there was a reaction because it was felt that they had let the side down. That seems to be the real reason why the case has gone so far.<br/>
I support the thrust of the new clause but dissociate myself from the terminology which would put the Attorney-General in place of the Secretary of State. I hope that the Secretary of State, who has been listening carefully to the debate, will in the near future come up with the good news that he has asked the Court of Appeal to re-examine the case.</p>

<p>We have had an important debate about serious matters. The new clause is headed, "Miscarriages of justice". It is common ground that when miscarriages of justice occur that is an unhappy state of affairs. We are also united in believing, happily, that they do not happen often.<br/>
When the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, North (Mr. McNamara) moved the new clause, he said that he was doing so in a probing fashion, explicitly to permit hon. Members who wished to do so to comment on the case of the UDR Four, as it is commonly known. He has succeeded in that purpose.<br/>
I must deal first with the new clause. As it is a probing new clause, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will be satisfied with the probe and will withdraw it. If not, I will have to ask the House to reject it for two reasons. First, it is unnecessary, as it seeks to confer on the Attorney-General a power which, in substance, is already possessed by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State. Secondly, the new clause is drafted in terms which would apply to a conviction for any criminal offence. It is in any case inappropriate for inclusion in an Act which is temporary and is concerned only with an emergency situation. The proper context within which to consider a change of the kind proposed by the hon. Gentleman is legislation on the general criminal law.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman set out the existing law. Under section 14 of the Criminal Appeal (Northern Ireland) Act 1980, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has a discretionary power to refer a case to the Court of Appeal. That power is not unique to Northern Ireland. The hon. Gentleman did not suggest that it is, but I think that he suggested that it is more difficult for someone in a political role to exercise that power. In accordance with the practice followed in England and Wales, and in Scotland, successive Secretaries of State have been prepared to

exercise the power only when some new evidence or new consideration of substance which was not available to the trial court or at any previous appeal came to light.<br/>
The new clause seems to envisage a reference being made by the Attorney-General in almost exactly the same circumstances. The Attorney-General would refer a case when there was
<q>relevant evidence which was not available to the court at the time of conviction and at the time of any subsequent upholding of the conviction".</q>
The Government's view is that a power to refer a case to the Court of Appeal because there are doubts about the justification for a conviction would more appropriately be exercised by the Secretary of State than the Attorney-General. I think that I am right to say that all hon. Members who have spoken in the debate, except the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, North sustained that view. It is more appropriate to the Secretary of State, not least because the Attorney-General has responsibilities in connection with the prosecution of certain offences with which the new power might not sit comfortably. We further believe that it would make no sense for similar powers to be possessed by both the Secretary of State and the Attorney-General.<br/>
As the hon. Member for Belfast, South (Rev. Martin Smyth) said, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has been present throughout the debate. It is worth making that clear for the record. He has listened carefully, as I have, to everything that has been said on the case of the UDR Four. I am grateful to the hon. Member for Antrim, North (Rev. Ian Paisley) for expressing his appreciation and, I expect, that of his hon. Friends and others, of the "careful attention"&#x2014;I use his phrase&#x2014;which my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State is giving to the dossier provided to him. That was appreciated. I have also noted that he wishes the matter to be tackled as speedily as possible. That view is endorsed by other hon. Members, but I am sure that they also accept the view of the hon. Member for Londonderry, East (Mr. Ross) that processing and consideration should not be so speedy that it is not exhaustive and detailed.<br/>
My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State would not be justified in referring the case of the former UDR soldiers to the Court of Appeal unless some new and substantial evidence which was not available at the time of the trial or the appeal came to light. The dossier on the case presented to my right hon. Friend by the hon. Member for Belfast, East (Mr. Robinson), to which much reference has been made and from which quotations have been given to the House, was handed over on 10 January this year. As the hon. Gentleman told us, it took more than a year to prepare. It is currently being given vigorous and detailed consideration. The dossier raised several issues on which the advice of the Chief Constable of the RUC has been sought.<br/>
As has been said, the RUC was already conducting an inquiry on foot of receipt of a report from the forensic science lab on the outcome of electrostatic deposition analysis tests on the original police interview notes from the interviews with the four men. The result of that inquiry by the Chief Constable will be reported to the Secretary of State and will be an integral part of his further consideration of the case.<br/>
The House will have heard the views that hon. Members have expressed about the case and the conviction with which they were expressed, but the House will also


understand that I am in no position to comment on any of them. They reflect what is in the dossier and the dossier is being given detailed consideration as speedily as is appropriate in all the circumstances.<br/>
I hope that, on reflection, the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, North will feel that the debate has been worthwhile&#x2014;I believe that it has&#x2014;that his probe has been answered and that the views of the Government have been made clear on both the substantive motion and, as far as I am able to go at this point, on the UDR Four. I hope that he will withdraw the new clause.</p>

<p>I thank hon. Members from the parties of Northern Ireland for their kind words about my hon. Friends and myself. We felt that it was important that an issue of such concern should be given an airing, particularly as hon. Members from the area have tried to raise the matter in different ways. It seemed to us that to table a new clause on the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Bill would give hon. Members an opportunity to make their points, however it was calculated and provided that it was selected. However, I would point out that the UDR Four were convicted of scheduled offences so the emergency powers legislation, which creates scheduled offences, is the right place to raise the matter.<br/>
I was not aware until now that the Secretary of State was so popular with the hon. Members from Northern Ireland. The wind of good will which has blown through Belfast town hall during the past few days must have affected the Chamber, too. They have shown their confidence that he is the right person to hold his position.</p>

<p>Has it escaped the hon. Gentleman's notice that the hon. Member for Antrim, North (Rev.

<p>I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for his intervention. I am sure that everyone involved in the discussions has had a harmonious relationship with the Secretary of State. We all hope that the discussions will be carried forward to such a point that talks will take place shortly on the three points which all parties have accepted should be the basis of any talks.<br/>
But I digress. If hon. Members are prepared to accept that the Secretary of State should have the power to refer cases, they should also be aware that there are anxieties about whether matters even come before the courts and whether prosecutions are ever carried through. There was a decision not to prosecute on the Whiterock killings and on the Armagh killings, otherwise known as the shoot-to-kill killings. The attitudes of the Attorney-General and the Director of Public Prosecutions in those circumstances perhaps gave substance to the anxieties expressed by hon. Members. That may be why they preferred that the Secretary of State should have the power.<br/>
Three further points are important. I hope that the Northern Irish Members will consider them when considering other legislation which has been before the House or might come before the House in future. First, hon. Members objected to the way in which the UDR

Four were originally arrested. I share their objection, but they voted to give that power to the police on Monday night when the Labour party suggested that the power to trawl should not be allowed. That power was vigorously defended by the Home Secretary.<br/>
Secondly, Northern Ireland Members are concerned about uncorroborated confessions. Opposition Members have emphasised the dangers of accepting uncorroborated confessions, whether in this part of the Kingdom or in Scotland or Northern Ireland. The hon. Member for Belfast, South (Rev. Martin Smyth) said that he had been concerned time and time again about what his friend the late Edgar Graham had told him about people being tricked or persuaded or pressured into making uncorroborated confessions.<br/>
In this context, I have to draw attention to amendments which were tabled but not selected by the Chair. Of course, I make no criticism of the Chair. I refer to amendments concerning cases involving scheduled offences. Despite some of the difficulties of which the police talk, interviews ought to be tape-recorded. That could be done with appropriate safeguards. Interviews could even be videoed. The essential point is that if the dossier evidence that we are asked to believe is true&#x2014;evidence about the pressuring of the four soldiers; evidence about the intensity of interrogation&#x2014;allegations of verbal or other ill-treatment would be revealed. Such recordings were recommended by Lord Colville. However, the Government refused to accept his recommendation and, regrettably, it did not have the full support of Northern Ireland Members.</p>

In our view, it is of paramount importance that the security forces&#x2014;specifically, the Army &#x2014;in Northern Ireland have such a structure, so that it may be shown beyond any shadow of doubt that many of the complaints levelled against the Army are malicious and untrue. If that can be done by means of independent machinery, the Army's position will be enhanced, and the public's confidence in it will be increased, resulting in an increased flow of information to the security forces generally.<br/>
No doubt the Minister agrees that if such an appointment were made the Army would be brought formally into line with the RUC in this respect. Lord Colville devoted a large section of his latest report to the subject of complaints. He pointed out that an effective complaints procedure is essential, for at least two reasons &#x2014;first, to avoid the creation of more terrorists as a result of counter-terrorist measures; secondly, to ensure that relations with the civilian population are such as to guarantee a ready flow of information to the security forces. With your permission, Mr. Deputy Speaker, I

intend to quote Lord Colville's report at some length. I apologise for having to do so, but I hope that I shall not be accused of making the mistake of which I accused the hon. Member for Upper Bann (Mr. Trimble)&#x2014;making selective quotations to support a case.<br/>
Lord Colville stressed the importance of this issue. Paragraph 5.51 of his report says:
<q>So long as emergency laws are in force effective complaints procedures must take equal rank with training and sensitive planning, in ensuring that the operations which constitute the campaign against terrorism do not end up by alienating the civilian population.</q>
Paragraph 5.5 states:
<q>The fundamental reason for trying to satisfy the public is that the security forces are there only to bring order according to the law. There is an operational reason to reinforce this".</q>
That reinforces the point that I have already made twice. The report continued:
<q>the majority of crime is reported by the public, and the majority of the solutions depend on information given by the public. Assistance will come more readily from those whose contacts with the security forces are such as to encourage them.</q>
At paragraph 5.7 the report continues:
<q>There is then the battle for hearts and minds. The winning of that is no one-way trade. The armed forces seek to instill confidence through sensitivity and politeness whereas it is greatly to the terrorist's advantage to mar that image.</q>
At paragraph 5.12, Lord Colville quotes from the instructions issued by the commander land forces in 1988 on the consequences of the effective investigation of complaints. The report states:
<q>Effective investigation of complaints may have the following desirable consequences: (a) Justice is done and seen to be done. (b) Good order and military discipline are properly enforced and seen to be so. (c) Public confidence in the armed forces is maintained and improved. (d) False accusations are properly and, if necessary, publicly refuted, thus countering terrorist propaganda and preserving the reputation of the armed forces, individually and collectively.</q>
Lord Colville concludes in paragraph 5.26:
<q>I believe it to be in the public interest, and of great potential value to the security forces as well as the community, that serious thought should now be given to devising acceptable supervisory systems".</q>
I recognise that there are informal mechanisms for the handling of complaints&#x2014;the Minister referred to some of them in Committee&#x2014;but the new clause rectifies the anomaly that the police are subject to a statatory procedure while the Army is not. What I have said shows that the new clause is inspired by a suggestion made by Lord Colville&#x2014;page 22 of the report, paragraph 5.25&#x2014;that an ombudsman-type official could be responsible for the investigation of complaints against the Army.<br/>
In Committee the Minister gave signs of his intention to consider ways of bringing that about. He said:
<q>I said that we intended to return to the matter on Report, and that remains our intention. I did not undertake to return to the matter in Committee because I did not think that we would be in a position to do so, and we are not.</q>
<q>That answer may not give the hon. Gentleman great insight into the thinking of my colleagues in the Ministry of Defence"&#x2014;</q>
that is true&#x2014;<br/>
<q>but I reiterate my assurance on 17 January that we are considering the matter and that when we have something to report we shall return to the House. I therefore ask the Committee to reject the motion."&#x2014;[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee B,</i> 31 January 1991; c. 354.]</q>
In the first part of that quotation the Minister made a specific commitment&#x2014;he said that he intended to return to the matter on Report. In the second part of the quotation, he was a little more evasive and said that the Government


were considering the matter and would return to the House when they had something to report. I am prepared to accept that the Minister intends to present some proposals at some stage, but it would have been far better for all of us if he had been able to present them on Report. We regret that he has not been able to do so, which was one of the primary reasons why we reintroduced the new clause on the ombudsman.<br/>
The new clause is designed to probe the Government's present thinking on the procedure. If the Minister deflects our probe or even refuses it and makes it clear that he will reject both our proposal and Lord Colville's thinking on complaints against the armed forces, we shall press the new clause to a Division. I hope that we are not driven to that course of action, but a great deal will depend upon how the Minister responds to the points that I have made.</p>

<p>I do not quite understand why the word "ombudsman" was used. I am not criticising the official Opposition, because I understand Lord Colville used that word, although he said, "ombudsman-like". The function of an ombudsman is to investigate complaints of maladministration, and such a complaint is usually laid &#x2014;sometimes by Members of Parliament&#x2014;against Departments of Government, in this case the United Kingdom Ministry of Defence. Such complaints could be made only against Ministry of Defence agents&#x2014;in this case, the Army&#x2014;for example, because of damage to a vehicle or a house after or during a search.<br/>
The mechanism set out by the hon. Member for Leicester, South (Mr. Marshall) already exists for complaints against individual soldiers, and I should have thought that that was sufficient. I know of many cases in which it has been the instrument for disciplining soldiers who, like all of us, occasionally step out of line when they are in uniform.<br/>
Like the hon. Member for Mid-Ulster (Rev. William McCrea), I noted the point made in an earlier debate on the desirability of common citizenship of the United Kingdom and of avoidance of second-class citizenship anywhere in the United Kingdom. Therefore, it is peculiar that we are now contemplating having second-class treatment for the element of the Army that serves in one part of the United Kingdom.<br/>
Wherever it is based, the Army supports the civil authorities. It has been used in support of civil power in this capital city of the United Kingdom. For example, the Special Air Service was used, with great success, to storm the Iranian embassy. The troops in Northern Ireland and in the Ulster Defence Regiment have not chosen to be shot at in the course of their duties. British military personnel have borne and used arms in many places on the continent, notably in West Germany. There too they are in contact in the course of their duties with the civil population. Will this proposed clause be applied to those troops? If not, why not?<br/>
To go a little further afield, some of us have noticed that parts of the Army are dealing with civilians in a place called Kuwait and have also been at some considerable risk, and risk of complaint. I understand that some parts of the Army are still in Iraq and no doubt they are doing their best to win the battle for hearts and minds in that country. I have great sympathy with our serving soldiers because of the manifold restrictions already imposed on

them. I doubt that our 1st Armoured Division would have advanced so swiftly across the desert last week if its soldiers had been told by their commander before they started, "Watch it boys: the ombudsman will be looking over your shoulder at all stages," and if they had been warned that they would be court-martialled if they happened to ram an Arab camel in the dead of night.<br/>
If we are to have this device in Northern Ireland alone, we should face up to the fact that we need an entirely new force rather than a rotating element of the Army serving there. There must be a special permanent force, presumably a special unit of the Army, perhaps in conjunction with the Ulster Defence Regiment. I hope that no further burdens will be imposed on the soldiers who risk their lives in defence of all of us when they happen to be posted to Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>I should like to pick up a point made by the right hon. Member for Lagan Valley (Mr. Molyneaux). No comparison can be made between an army during a declared war, as in the desert in Kuwait, and an army that fulfils a policing role, as in the north of Ireland.</p>

<speech hansard_id="786293" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1991-03-06a.364.2" hansard_membership_id="8397" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/3021" speakername="Mr. Mallon" colnum="364" time="21:15:00">
<p>Substantial differences occur in Germany compared with the north of Ireland, especially in terms of confrontation and manoeuvres. The policing role that the Army performs in the north of Ireland is, of necessity, of great sensitivity.<br/>
Any army is a blunt instrument, as the right hon. Member for Lagan Valley said. Either it has a policing role or it is involved in a war. The Government tell us at great length why the Army is not involved in a war. One need only remember the former Prime Minister's references in a European country to a war in Northern Ireland to recognise the hasty way in which the Government's position was clearly put. The implications are immense and far-reaching, and are not always conducive to solving the problem.<br/>
An Army complaints procedure is needed. The present mechanism is not sufficient, because it is not a complaints procedure but merely an informal method. A young person who wishes to complain has three options. First, he can go to the RUC. He will be told that, unless violence was used against him or threatened or a criminal offence was committed, it is not a matter for the RUC. The second option is to go to an Army base. One can imagine the reception that that young person would get when he arrived at the outside gate of any Army base and said that he would like to make a complaint against the Army.<br/>
The third option is what is termed the informal choice &#x2014;to process complaints through Members of Parliament, local councillors and people who have standing in the community, such as clergymen. Such people would consider the case at third hand, which is a difficulty in itself. We cannot deny a proper means of processing legitimate complaints and not provide the necessary means to do that while somewhere in between relying on an informal process and hoping for the best, which is what happens at present.<br/>
Difficulties arise for officers in the armed forces. If a complaint involves a disciplinary matter, they can investigate and deal with it speedily and efficiently, as they


do now. As well as being a blunt instrument, an army tends to have a strong discipline base, and its commanders have a strong sense of authority.<br/>
It is possible for someone like myself to process a complaint and to receive certain satisfactions because such and such an action was taken against a certain person on a certain date. One accepts that such disciplinary action is used in certain circumstances.<br/>
What happens when it is suggested that a complaint should be taken to law? Do the officers try a soldier twice? Is he subjected to the disciplinary process within the Army and an official investigation by the police at the same time? The difficulty is that, in 99 cases out of 100, when there is a threat of or actual violence, invariably there are no witnesses. When that happens, the person who is aggrieved must put his word against that of five or six members of an Army patrol. When the case goes to the Director of Public Prosecutions and he takes a cursory look at it&#x2014;it is right to be cursory, as there is no supportive evidence&#x2014;it is stamped "no case".<br/>
It is bad for everyone that we do not have a formalised, clearly defined statutory way in which such a complaint can be processed. We should not be glib about this, because it is bad for morale, for people and for those soldiers against whom unfounded complaints are made. I am aware of circumstances in which that happens and, in those cases, I am the first to recognise that that is unjust to the soldier involved. Such cases should not be allowed to stand, but when a genuine complaint is made there must be a proper way in which to proceed with it.<br/>
One hon. Member said that he wanted to bring complaints against the armed forces into line with complaints against the police. He should read Lord Colville's report&#x2014;I referred to it on Monday&#x2014;which, in implied scathing terms, referred to the success, or lack of success, of the Police Complaints Commission in the north of Ireland. From more than 400 complaints to that commission, not one disciplinary charge resulted. That tests the credibility of anyone who knows the tinder box that is the north or Ireland and the sensitivities that exist.<br/>
There is something wrong with that complaints procedure, but it is not the fault of the legislation. I was in the House when that legislation was passed. It is good, and it has laid down procedures to ensure that there is a full and adequate investigation of a complaint and adequate redress. Is it not time to consider the 400-odd cases that have gone before the commission and to ask what is wrong? Lord Colville's report contains a strong implied criticism of and comparison between the effectiveness of the police complaints procedures in England and Wales as opposed to those in the north of Ireland.<br/>
The Secretary of State should look carefully at the Police Complaints Commission in the north of Ireland, although I accept that it is a bit late to do that, because new appointments have been made. Suffice it to say the facts speak Tot themselves.</p>

<p>I thank the hon. Member for Leicester, South (Mr. Marshall) for the way in which he introduced his new clause. He did so in the same measured and responsible manner as he acted in Committee. No one objected to the references to Lord Colville&#x2014;indeed, the hon. Gentleman did the House a service.<br/>
The hon. Member for Newry and Armagh (Mr. Mallon) repeated the arguments he put in Committee and affirmed his belief that some new measures are necessary.

I understood the point that the right hon. Member for Lagan Valley (Mr. Molyneaux) made. Bearing in mind his typical grace, I know that he will not mind if I do not follow him into the sands of the desert and the autobahns of Germany.<br/>
I shall start in the spirit with which I tried to conduct proceedings in Committee by seeking common ground in the House. I am sure that it is common ground that the public have a right to expect the highest standards of behaviour from police officers and members of the armed forces. Activity or actions falling short of those standards will never be condoned.<br/>
The Government believe that anyone who has a genuine cause for complaint about the conduct of a police officer or a member of the armed forces should use the existing procedures for the investigation of such complaints. It was against that background that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland told the House on Second Reading that the Government were paying special attention to what Lord Colville and indeed others have had to say on this particular subject. He said that we would return to the subject as the Bill progressed. As the hon. Member for Leicester, South reminded the House, we returned to the issue in Committee.<br/>
As Lord Colville observed in his review, the Independent Commission for Police Complaints was established by the Police (Northern Ireland) Order 1987 in order to provide an independent element in the scrutiny of complaints against the Royal Ulster Constabulary. In Lord Colville's view, which the Government share, the commission is now making a valuable contribution, and should continue to be the main vehicle for reinforcing public confidence in the handling of complaints involving police officers. The commission has wide powers. As well as supervising the investigation of all complaints alleging death or serious injury, it can decide to supervise the investigation of any complaint. It does that to good effect and I understand that it intends to supervise even more of these cases in the future.<br/>
Ensuring that complaints against the armed forces are investigated promptly and thoroughly is no less important, as the military authorities fully recognise. In recent years, as Lord Colville has pointed out, the Army has therefore consistently sought to improve the way in which complaints are dealt with. The latest in a series of improvements will be the establishment, next month, at Army headquarters in Northern Ireland of a central complaints office to improve the monitoring and handling of complaints against the armed forces. I am sure that the House welcomes that initiative.<br/>
However, such measures do not of themselves answer Lord Colville's arguments in favour of bringing the complaints process under some form of independent scrutiny. Allegations of criminal misconduct by the armed forces are already, and will remain, subject to independent investigation by the Royal Ulster Constabulary. That is an important point for all hon. Members to bear in mind.<br/>
The hon. Member for Leicester, South reminded the House that in Committee I said that I intended to return to this matter on Report, and I now propose to fulfil that commitment. The Government have considered most carefully the arguments advanced by Lord Colville, the Standing Advisory Commission on Human Rights, the Committee on the Administration of Justice, and others, including members of the Committee who expressed their


view when the matter was debated there. Therefore, I am pleased to tell the House that we have decided in principle to introduce an independent element into the scrutiny of the armed forces' procedures for handling those complaints which fall short of allegations of criminal misconduct.<br/>
This matter falls primarily within the responsibility of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence. As I told the Committee, we have accordingly been discussing the matter with our ministerial colleagues in that Department, including how to give effect to our decision. As hon. Members will recognise, the subject is important and some care must be taken in drawing up proper arrangements. This will take a little more time, and my noble Friend the Paymaster General will therefore return to the subject in another place.<br/>
The Government are confident that, for the reasons set out by Lord Colville and others, this measure&#x2014;in addition to all the other improvements in complaints systems either introduced in recent years or about to be introduced&#x2014;will be of value to the community. It will also be of value to the armed forces in helping to build and retain the confidence and support of all men and women of good will from both traditions in Northern Ireland.<br/>
The Government are already addressing the important issues raised by the new clause. I hope that the hon. Member for Leicester, South feels that his probing clause has been satisfactorily met. It would have been convenient to the House if we had been able to bring forward the specific ideas that we have in mind. That has not proved possible, but at least I have made the commitment in principle. I hope that that will be satisfactory to the hon. Gentleman and that, consequently, he will not press his new clause to a Division.</p>

<p>I welcome the Minister's final comments, but before I speak at greater length on what he had to say I must comment on what the right hon. Member for Lagan Valley (Mr. Molyneaux) said. Like many of his hon. Friends from the Province, he fails to distinguish between the Army acting in its usual role&#x2014;he highlighted the warfare in the middle east theatre over the past few weeks&#x2014;and in its role in support of the civil security force in the Province. There is a huge difference between the two roles.<br/>
I express no opinion on the recent war in the middle east, and clearly the restrictions that we seek to impose on the Army when it operates in the Province would not, could not and should not be imposed in an acknowledged theatre of war. But when the security forces are there to support and buttress the civilian security force, it is our duty to ensure that the Army is as nearly as possible subject to the same degree of control and scrutiny and to the same adherence to the law of the land as we expect from our police forces, whether in the Province or elsewhere in the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman put his finger on the point in his penultimate sentence. He implied that one could not expect soldiers from a unit which had not been accustomed to service in Northern Ireland to behave as though they were local bobbies on the beat, and I accept that. It may surprise the hon. Gentleman to know that

some years ago, when I had the freedom and privilege to drive my own car, soldiers belonging to a regiment which was withdrawn recently from the British Army of the Rhine, at a time when there was more tension in Germany than there is nowadays, would haul me out of my car at least three times a week, often in pouring rain, and frisk me, spreadeagled across the car. The car was searched and they would address me in terms that I shall not use in the House. It never occurred to me to lodge a complaint against any of those soldiers because, being an ex-service man myself, I recognised that they were not trained in community relations. They were trained to be the spearhead of the British Army of the Rhine. I hope that I have made the point that if an element of the 1st Armoured Division should, in the course of the rotation of units, be brought to Northern Ireland to do duty, it would almost need a special induction course. It could not be expected to behave like a London bobby.</p>

<p>I shall not be tempted to follow all that the right hon. Gentleman has said, but the House realises that soldiers going to the Province for the first time will have a naivety that one would not expect from soldiers who have been there on more than one visit. The right hon. Gentleman must know that that is recognised by the Army authorities. The Army tries to teach such soldiers how to behave in a civilian role. I presume that it does it as well as it possibly can, although one might argue that it could be better done.</p>

<p>I have already stressed that there is clearly a difference between the inexperienced soldier who is serving in the Province for the first time and the service man who has been there on more than one occasion. Nevertheless, inexperience does not excuse certain types of behaviour.<br/>
The Army acknowledge that first-time soldiers need to be educated as to the way they should operate in a civilian theatre. It knows more than anyone else that without the support and co-operation of the civilian population its role will be made more difficult by an order of magnitude than would otherwise be the case. That is why the Army emphasises the need for civility, but that point is one that the right hon. Member for Lagan Valley sometimes fails to understand.<br/>
I welcome the establishment of a central complaints office within the next few weeks, and the Minister's decision in principle to establish also an element of independent security in respect of allegations against the armed forces. I appreciate that there are caveats and that discussions must take place. I am sure that the Minister realises that there must be fuller debate on that issue both in another place and in this House at the appropriate time.<br/>

<p>I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.<br/>
The new clause deals with an issue which has been a matter of some contention in the Province for a number of years, but more particularly in recent months in respect of a specific case. It would provide judicial control over the Secretary of State's power to end the public funding of organisations that he believes promote the interests of proscribed organisations. The intention is to limit the present arbitrary and unfair system, rather than to make it easier for proscribed organisations to obtain access to public funds. I wish to make that clear.<br/>
The present power of the Secretary of State is exercised under the terms of policy set out by the present Foreign Secretary, the right hon. Member for Witney (Mr. Hurd), in his written answer of 27 June 1985. It is not my intention to read out that answer, but the House will recognise that it gives the Secretary of State wide powers and wide discretion to stop financing certain organisations.<br/>
Our new clause recognises the fact that it may be necessary to stop funding if it might be of benefit to proscribed organisations. However&#x2014;this is where our clause differs from Government policy&#x2014;it places the exercise of such power on a statutory basis and provides for independent scrutiny of the power by the courts.<br/>
As the Secretary of State recognises, under the existing system there is no right of redress, despite the severe consequences that groups, individuals or communities may suffer if funds are removed. Appeals can only be made to, and heard by, the Secretary of State&#x2014;the very person who made the decision in the first place. Such a practice creates an image of arbitrary and, in some cases, unfair government.<br/>
A few moments ago, I referred to a specific case&#x2014;the Glor na Gael affair&#x2014;which will come as no surprise to the Secretary of State. For whatever reason, he removed funding from that Irish language group. Unfortunately for him, no one&#x2014;including, apparently, the RUC&#x2014;believes that his decision was either sensible or correct.<br/>
The present system makes it difficult to reverse such decisions, which are essentially political, without causing embarrassment to the Government, and, as we all know, no Government likes deliberate political embarrassments. The new clause would provide judicial scrutiny before such decisions were taken. We recognise that that is not a

perfect solution, but at least it would reduce the arbitrary nature of such decisions, while meeting any Government objections based on security grounds, since the flexibility of a system of judicial review is such that it can be conducted without any security risks.<br/>
I commend the new clause in the hope that it will find favour with the Government. Even if the Secretary of State cannot accept it as it stands, I hope that he will reflect the bipartisanship shown by his Minister of State in our previous debate and will be able at least to accept the spirit and intent of the new clause.</p>

<p>How does the Secretary of State form his opinions on these organisations? Does he receive advice or information from someone or some group who may be against the activities of such an organisation? They might be motivated by petty jealousy, because the organisation in question is maintaining and making progress in community and social activities. Such individuals or groups may have political or other aspirations and may believe that they are reduced because of the beneficial activities of such an organisation.<br/>
What appeals can such an organisation make against an adverse opinion or complaint by the Secretary of State? Is machinery to be set up to investigate such complaints?</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Belfast, North (Mr. Walker) illustrates the weakness of the new clause. It would transfer responsibility from the Secretary of State to a High Court judge with no rules, motivation or purposes, and without limiting the judge's discretion in any way. It has been admitted that the decisions concerned involve political considerations. Are we content to transfer responsibility for them to a judge who, for these purposes, would be superior to the Secretary of State, who is himself responsible to Parliament? That is absurd. The new clause is fundamentally misconceived.</p>

<p>I share the doubts expressed by the hon. Member for Orpington (Mr. Stanbrook). I think that the new clause would cause more problems than exist now.<br/>
The hon. Member for Leicester, South (Mr. Marshall) mentioned an Irish language organisation from which funding had been withdrawn. It is interesting to note that that organisation subsequently sought support from the Irish Government&#x2014;unsuccessfully; I do not know what that implies. Another interesting fact, which the hon. Gentleman failed to mention, is that it applied for a judicial review of the Secretary of State's decision, and failed in that as well.<br/>
I think that what the hon. Member for Leicester, South said was inaccurate. The existing law provides for the challenging of decisions to withdraw funding made by the Secretary of State or others. Applications can be made for judicial reviews, and, if an organisation can show that the Secretary of State had arrived at his decision unreasonably, a remedy, albeit limited, is available.<br/>
How would the court proceed if the existing judicial review procedure were replaced by new clause 15? Under the new clause,
<q>Where the Secretary of State is of the opinion that an organisation &#x2026; is furthering the aims of a proscribed organisation, he may seek an order from the High Court".</q>
What does the High Court do then? Is it bound to grant the order? Must it consider whether to grant it, and, if so,


on what evidence must it proceed? How can such procedures be adopted, given that the Secretary of State may be in receipt of confidential information?<br/>
I hope that I am not misquoting the hon. Member for Leicester, South&#x2014;if I am inadvertently misleading the House, no doubt he will correct me&#x2014;but I believe that he said that the flexibility of the judicial review system is such that it can be implemented without any security risk. What does that mean in this context? Does it mean that the Secretary of State's opinion will be conclusive, allowing him not to divulge any information that would carry a security risk?<br/>
The new clause refers to
<q>furthering the aims of a proscribed organisation".</q>
Proscribed organisations have many aims. I believe that one of the IRA's aims is the promotion of the Gaelic language. Does this mean that funds should be withdrawn from all organisations that promote the Gaelic language?</p>

<p>This novel measure seeks to substitute the judgment of the court for that of the Secretary of State in a matter that is manifestly the domain of the executive &#x2014;as my hon. Friend the Member for Orpington (Mr. Stanbrook) pointed out.<br/>
The hon. Member for Leicester, South (Mr. Marshall) was concerned about the manner in which the Secretary of State exercises his discretion in discharging his responsibility to protect public funds where there is a grave risk that the provision of support would assist a paramilitary organisation, directly or indirectly. He did not quote the answer given by my right hon. Friend the then Secretary of State&#x2014;who is now Foreign Secretary&#x2014;on 27 June 1985, and I shall not do so in full. The heart of that answer was in the words
<q>However, I am satisfied, from information available to me.</q>
This is a matter properly for the Government, not the courts.<br/>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Orpington and the hon. Member for Upper Bann (Mr. Trimble) said, the courts have acknowledged that judges should not make decisions on policy. Lord Diplock, in Council of Civil Service Unions v. The Minister for the Civil Service in 1984 &#x2014;a case to which, ironically and coincidentally, reference was made this afternoon in the debate on the Employment Protection (Government Communications Headquarters) Bill&#x2014;made that clear when he said that the application of Government policy involves the weighing of competing policy considerations&#x2014;
<q>a balancing exercise which Judges by their upbringing and experience are ill qualified to perform.</q>
To give the courts the role that the new clause suggests would conflict with our well established and sensible separation of powers. As the hon. Member for Upper Bann said, the new clause does not make clear what the High Court should take into account in considering an application by the Secretary of State for an order permitting him to terminate public funding. It would be most unusual if the court were empowered to examine the merits of the Secretary of State's opinion and substitute its judgment for that of the Secretary of State should it see fit.<br/>
Hon. Members can be assured that all decisions to withhold public funds in line with current Government policy are taken by the Secretary of State after most careful consideration.</p>

<p>The new clause would enable the Secretary of State to seek an order from the court. Under the law in Northern Ireland, is it possible for an organisation whose public funds have been terminated by the Secretary of State to appeal to the court?</p>
</speech>
<speech hansard_id="786317" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1991-03-06a.372.1" hansard_membership_id="3735" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2472" speakername="Mr. Brooke" colnum="372" time="21:45:00">
<p>I shall deal with that later, but there is the right of appeal to myself in the first instance.<br/>
Decisions to withhold public funds are taken by the Secretary of State after the most careful consideration. The policy is even-handed and has been applied in respect of republican and loyalist paramilitary interests. Ignoring the four cases in which the decisions were reversed after fresh evidence was put before the Secretary of State, the pattern of the withholding of public funds shows that just under 60 per cent. have been in connection with republican paramilitary groups and just over 40 per cent. with loyalist groups.<br/>
Political opinion is not an issue. Decisions are subject to review and can be changed in the light of a change in circumstances. That is what happened in the four cases in which the decisions were reversed. That is not an answer to the legal question that I was asked but it is a response to the hon. Member for Belfast, North (Mr. Walker).<br/>
It is not possible, for security reasons, to divulge the information on which decisions are based. I do not accept that the introduction of a court in a supervisory capacity, as proposed by the hon. Member for Leicester, South, is appropriate or would lead to an improvement in the quality of decision making. Well established arrangements for the judicial review of administrative decisions&#x2014;this answers the question asked by the hon. Member for Falkirk, West (Mr. Canavan)&#x2014;recognise the different responsibilities of Ministers and the courts. Any organisation that considers that it has been unfairly treated by a decision of the Secretary of State can apply to the courts for a review of the decision, as happened recently. I see no reason to introduce any further judicial scrutiny.<br/>
It is not practicable&#x2014;this answers the question asked by the hon. Member for Belfast, North&#x2014;either at present or under the proposed new clause to advise an organisation of the precise grounds for the Secretary of State's belief that withdrawal of grant is justified. Such decisions are taken on the basis of confidential security advice, the disclosure of which could reveal to those engaged in unlawful activities involving paramilitary organisations the extent of the information known about them, how it is evaluated and possibly its source, with consequential risk to those involved in its procurement.<br/>
The hon. Member for Leicester, South referred to the case of Glora na Gael. The decision to withdraw funding from the west Belfast committee and the procedure by which such decisions are taken are subject to judicial review. The hon. Member for Upper Bann thought that it had been turned down, but the case is still under review.<br/>
In those circumstances, the House will understand if I am constrained in what I say on such matters. I do not accept that the present arrangements are unreasonable or inappropriate; nor am I prepared to be drawn on the detail of the arrangements or the nature of the information relied upon.<br/>
In view of those overall considerations, I must ask the hon. Member for Leicester, South to withdraw his new clause or the House to vote against it.</p>

<p>I and my party are naturally disappointed with the Secretary of State's reply. Within a matter of minutes, we shall be showing our dissatisfaction by supporting our new clause in the Lobby. I ask the House to support us in that action.<br/>
The hon. Member for Orpington (Mr. Stanbrook) said that, in his view&#x2014;I recognise that it is his view only&#x2014;our new clause is to be described as "absurd". His reason for using that word was that he claimed that only the Secretary of State and only the Government can make political decisions. There is no disagreement between us on that point. Politicians and Governments are there to make political decisions. If the Secretary of State was to come to the Dispatch Box to say, "I have made this decision on political grounds; these are my reasons for doing that," there would be no disagreement between the two sides, because I recognise that that is the nature of politicians and of Governments.<br/>
However, that is not the point at issue. These judgments are not supposed to be based on political considerations; they are supposed to be based on security considerations. In those circumstances, we have every right to say that, if it is a matter of judgment and of balance, a judge and the system of judicial review are able to make that decision and to judge that balance. We are not asking the judges&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Orpington is shaking his head, but we are not asking the judges to make political decisions; we are asking them to decide whether, on balance, they believe that the Secretary of State has acted fairly or unfairly when weighing up the security risks to make his decision.<br/>
The altercations between myself and the hon. Member for Upper Bann (Mr. Trimble) are increasing. He always accuses me of misrepresenting his case and of making half a case myself. I tend to believe that my assertions about him are always correct and that his assertions about me are always wrong. He is clearly wrong in the specific point that he has made in this debate. The Secretary of State supports and buttresses my point when he reminds the hon. Gentleman that the case of Glora na Gael is still in the process of judicial review.<br/>
In case he has forgotten, I remind the hon. Member for Upper Bann that the Secretary of State has made it even more difficult for that organisation to defend itself and to put its case to the judicial review because the right hon. Gentleman has introduced a public interest immunity certificate, which is signed by him, the Secretary of State, and which has prevented that organisation or its counsel from gaining access to specific papers that it believes would assist it&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>

<p>The Secretary of State reminds me that the case is sub judice. I am referring not to the details of the case, but to the actions that the Secretary of State has taken which make it more difficult for that organisation to present its case at the judicial review.

<p>That is not the point that is included in the new clause. The new clause says:
<q>Where the Secretary of State is of the opinion that an organisation in receipt of public funds is furthering the aims of a proscribed organisation".</q>
No decision is made; the Secretary of State is simply of the opinion, and he then may seek an order from the High Court. In other words, the whole decision is transferred to the High Court. It is not a question of confirming, or of some sort of review, under the wording of the new clause. The new clause is talking not about judicial review but about transferring responsibility for the decision from the Secretary of State to a judge. That is entirely and utterly wrong, and I still think that it is absurd.</p>

<p>I am not pleased to hear that the hon. Gentleman still thinks that the new clause is absurd. We are seeking to reverse the present procedure. If the new clause was adopted, before the Secretary of State took a decision, he, his ministerial colleagues and his officials would have to realise, in the light of all the security considerations available at the time, that any decision they took was likely to be upheld or turned down by the judge. The position seems to be clear.<br/>
The Secretary of State repeated many of the points put forward by the hon. Members for Orpington (Mr. Stanbrook) and Upper Bann (Mr. Trimble). He seemed to imply that many of his decisions were taken on political rather than security grounds. I am sure that he did not


mean to give that impression, but he made the point. I accept that he makes the decisions not on political but on security grounds.</p>

<p>In Committee, the use of lethal force by the security forces was considered on several occasions. There has been a continuing debate on the issue&#x2014;the matter was raised when last we had a full review of the Act in the previous Parliament. The new clause and the amendment attempt to deal with subsequent developments in the debate.<br/>
Amendment No. 39 seeks to complement the codes of practice issued under sections 48 and 49 of the Act by including guidance to the security forces on circumstances in which it is legitimate to use force. Given the controversies over the use of force by the security forces, and the implications for public confidence in the security forces, such a guide would help to clarify the nature of security force operations.<br/>
In his penultimate report, Lord Colville stated that the major difficulty for the administration of justice stemmed from deaths caused by the security forces. We have only to think of the Armagh killings and the Whiterock bookies shop case and other incidents to understand the passions and problems involved. Large sections of society believe that the security forces are immune from the law, and a number of killings by the security forces are not regarded as unavoidable or representing the legitimate use of force.<br/>
The new clause and the amendment are a response to the concern expressed by the Standing Advisory Committee on Human Rights last February. The new schedule copies the draft code of practice proposed by SACHR. It says that it is a "tentative draft" to provide a focus for proper consideration of the issue, but if the Government were to accept the principle of what we are urging we should be happy for them to produce a better


draft. The key elements of the draft code suggested by SACHR are as follows. The minimum possible force should be deployed, force should be used only when it is unavoidable, and senior officers should be held responsible for the actions of their subordinates if they permit violations of the code of practice.<br/>
The first principle differs from the existing provision in so far as it replaces the concept of reasonable force with the concept of minimum force. Such a standard would facilitate public understanding of the limits of legitimate use of force by the security forces. Using force only when it is unavoidable also differs from existing practice in so far as the existing law allows for the use of lethal force to apprehend a person who cannot otherwise be arrested. The logic behind it is that the failure to arrest an individual may allow that person to escape and commit further crimes of violence at a later date. While that is understandable, the practical consequences have been damaging as it has become lawful to use lethal force to apprehend a person who, it subsequently becomes apparent, is not a terrorist. The code of practice is designed to prevent recurrence of such incidents by ensuring that firearms can be used to effect an arrest only if there is immediate danger of a grave threat to life.<br/>
The purpose of making superiors responsible for avoidable breaches of the code of practice is to provide an incentive to maintain high standards of discipline. In addition, given that the preparation of an operation by superior officers may have a substantial influence on the behaviour of subordinates during an operation, the code of practice considers the responsibility of those who plan and those who conduct operations.<br/>
Paragraph 12 of the schedule deals with a problem that has caused some concern. When members of the security forces are involved in incidents where lethal force is used, RUC officers investigating such operations have experienced some difficulty gaining access to carry out questioning. The schedule would require access to be granted, thus eliminating any suggestion that such incidents are not properly investigated by the authorities.<br/>
Lord Colville has paid great attention to this issue over several years. In it report on the concept of the taking of human life, the other place also paid attention to the proposals, some based on the Australian code of practice, made by Lord Colville. Our proposal is based essentially on the recent proposals of SACHR. The code embodies what it is seeking and what it believes, in the interests human rights, should be adopted in Northern Ireland.</p>

<speech hansard_id="786358" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1991-03-06a.379.0" hansard_membership_id="271" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/3418" speakername="Mr. Trimble" colnum="379" time="21:45:00">
<p>The hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, North (Mr. McNamara) said that the schedule in the amendment setting out the code of practice is based on the tentative views of the Standing Advisory Commission on Human Rights and it says that its proposals are based in part on a draft resolution prepared by a United Nations body. That makes one a little concerned&#x2014;I say a little because in some respects I support the objective behind the new clause. There is merit in having a code of guidance on the use of potentially lethal force and in spelling out in more detail the rather old terms of section 3 of the Criminal Law Act (Northern Ireland) 1967. That is the ordinary criminal law base from which the security forces operate in the use of potentially lethal force, in all circumstances, not just in the emergency provisions.<br/>
An examination of the draft code shows that there are problems, which SACHR acknowledged. Comparing its document with the yellow card, it states:
<q>the yellow card expressly permits the use of lethal force to effect an arrest of someone who has just killed or injured another person, where there is no other way to make an arrest, while the UN Basic Principles permit the use of lethal force to effect an arrest only where the person continues to present an imminent threat of death or serious injury and where less extreme means are insufficient. It should be noted that this difference is probably an accurate statement of the current judicial interpretation of the terms of section 3 of the Criminal Law Act (Northern Ireland) 1967".</q>
The code is not an accurate statement of the law.<br/>
Paragraph 7 of SACHR's report&#x2014;which I think hon.<br/>
Members received&#x2014;states:
<q>In the second place the UN Basic Principles include more detailed provisions in respect of the responsibility of superior officers for the actions of their subordinates. There is no such provision in the yellow card. This again reflects a distinction which is inherent in the prevailing judicial interpretation &#x2026; in &#x2026; section 3 of the Criminal Law Act.</q>
SACHR acknowledges that its code does not correspond with the law.<br/>
If the code were enacted, we should have to change section 3 of the Criminal Law Act (Northern Ireland) 1967. If we enacted the code at present, we would be inaccurate and would give effect to something much narrower than section 3. Under new clause 17, failure to comply with the code will be an offence punishable on conviction by imprisonment for two years. The code is inappropriate. I have great difficulty understanding how one could comply with it.<br/>
According to paragraph 3 of the proposed schedule,
<q>No live rounds are to be carried in the breech</q>
unless a weapon is about to be fired. In that way, members of the security forces will give terrorists that extra vital second or two that it takes to make a weapon ready for use. Paragraph 4 states:
<q>Firearms shall not be used against a person except in the following circumstances&#x2014;
<ol><li>(1) in self-defence or defence of others against the imminent threat of death or serious injury;</li>
<li>(2) to prevent the commission of a particularly serious crime involving a grave threat to life".</li></ol></q>
How does one work out that the commission of a serious crime will involve a "grave threat to life"? How does one work out that there will be
<q>imminent threat of death or serious injury"?</q>
The paragraph refers to "serious" injury rather than just injury. A soldier is expected to deal with those complex issues in the agony of the moment, when a terrorist may use lethal force without the slightest compunction. Having decided that his action comes within those provisions, he is not to use force unless he gives the warning, "Army: stop or I fire", or words to that effect. The proposed schedule states that those words "are to be used". If they are not used, it will mean a failure to comply, which is an offence punishable by imprisonment for a certain term. That is not an appropriate measure.<br/>
I am not familiar with United Nations proceedings, so I do not understand why the United Nations document is only a draft resolution and did not proceed further perhaps it was because it was unrealistic. I hesitate to add to my criticisms of SACHR on other occasions, but I am not surprised that it adopted an unrealistic set of principles. SACHR does not have the competence to draw up such a code because it does not understand the position that soldiers and policemen will face. Although SACHR pointed out the difference betweent the code and the law,


it did not give due weight to the fact that under the law soldiers and policemen are under a duty to arrest persons whom they believe to be law breakers. They must use such force as reasonable to achieve that arrest. The code appears to weaken the duty on the police and the Army. The net effect will be that persons guilty of crime, or those whom the security forces suspect to be guilty, will go free.<br/>
I know that tragic mistakes have been made in Northern Ireland which have affected all sides of the community. Sometimes one wonders about the mistakes that generate concern and the principles that operate in such circumstances.<br/>
10.30 pm<br/>
No one likes to see mistakes made, but they are unavoidable. The recent conflict in the Gulf has served to show that in a war, or in a situation where arms are used, mistakes will be made. When those mistakes occur, however, we must not lose sight of the fact that the ultimate responsibility for them rests with those who have created the violence. When members of the security forces act negligently and incorrectly and mistakenly kill others, we must not forget that the ultimate responsibility lies with the terrorist organisations.<br/>
Although I feel some sympathy with the concept of a code of practice, the present code of practice is not good. I do not like the provision in subsection (3) of the new clause to make that code of practice legally enforceable with criminal sanctions. For that reason, I cannot support the new clause or the schedule.</p>

<p>I agree with the hon. Member for Upper Bann (Mr. Trimble). If one looks at the current situation in Northern Ireland realistically, one must recognise that the schedule would put the terrorist at a tremendous advantage compared with the security forces.<br/>
I do not believe that the House appreciates the seriousness of the situation in Northern Ireland. A close friend of mine is approaching the end of his life in the Royal Victoria hospital. I cannot go to visit him without three Land Rovers of police and three Land Rovers of soldiers. I was speaking to another clergyman who also visits that hospital and he goes there in the same way. We are up against a serious situation in Northern Ireland.<br/>
Members of the security forces seek to provide protection and to defend the community against terrorism. If they were not allowed to draw their guns unless a superior officer tells them to do so, and so on, those people would have no defence and would be shot down. Terrorists will look upon the code of practice as a magna calla for success. We must be realistic.<br/>
I agree with the hon. Member for Upper Bann that there should be such a code of conduct, but it must be realistic in view of the terrorist threat. The code of practice is unrealistic. Members of the security forces may as well not be armed if they are unable to defend themselves and those who need to be defended. The code of practice envisaged in the new clause would make it impossible for members of the security forces to provide such protection from the current terrorist threat that we are up against.</p>

<p>I support my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, North (Mr. McNamara), who moved the new clause.<br/>
We all agree that there is far too much use of lethal force in Northern Ireland and that there is too much killing. Both sides of the House deplore the use of force by

paramilitary organisations. We should also deplore the unjustified use of force by members of the security forces. Such unjustified use of force by the security forces is even worse in a sense than the use of lethal force by terrorist organisations. When the security forces resort to the unjustified use of lethal force, they are not just placing themselves at the same level as the terrorists they are supposed to be combating, but reducing if not eradicating respect for law and order. That can have serious repercussions in any society.<br/>
Sadly, over the past 20 years or more, there have been far too many instances of the use of unjustified force by members of the security forces. Hon. Members have said that mistakes are made, but we have a responsibility to try to create a legislative framework that will minimise the possibility of mistakes which may result in people being wrongfully killed. The account of former Assistant Chief Constable Stalker and his evidence points to a shoot-to-kill policy by the RUC. The Army and the Ulster Defence Regiment have killed people in circumstances which, to say the least, have been questionable.<br/>
Quite apart from those killed by the use of what might be called conventional weaponry, some people have been killed by plastic bullets fired by the security forces. We should not lose sight of that. Three or four years ago, I introduced a Bill that sought to abolish the use of plastic bullets in Northern Ireland or in any other part of the United Kingdom. At that time, the statistics showed that about 15 people had been lethally injured by plastic or rubber bullets. Most of them were children or young people who by no stretch of the imagination could have been described as suspected terrorists. Some of them were killed by plastic bullets fired at point blank range.<br/>
I do not know whether amendment No. 39 covers plastic bullets. I suspect that they might be covered, because that amendment refers to people "about to fire a weapon" and mentions "an explosive device".<br/>
Hon. Members spoke about the yellow card and the existing code of conduct, which may or may not be observed in all circumstances. It is plain that the code of practice is grossly inadequate, so we should accept the new clause and its related schedule.</p>

<p>I invariably shudder when I hear the word "accident" used in relation to lethal weapons. I vividly remember an occasion when Mr. Gerry Adams spoke on behalf of the organisation that he leads after a baby had been shot in Belfast. He pontificated to the world and said there would always be accidents when firearms were used, but he offered his organisation's apologies to the baby's mother and father and to all concerned for the death of the child. That is appalling. It is also appalling to use the word "accidents", especially in relation to circumstances in which there were other alternatives.<br/>
Public concern in the north of Ireland has made a clear distinction down through the years between a soldier, perhaps under threat from a sniper or a sudden movement, acting instinctively and using his weapon, and those incidents which have become issues of great contention, almost all of which happened during a concerted effort by the armed forces&#x2014;in other words, when they were involved in a specific manoeuvre which would itself have made possible an arrest with the minimum use of force, not a matter of being overpowered or of superior fire power


coming from those whom the armed forces might have intended to arrest. In the real shoot-to-kill incidents, those people were unarmed.<br/>
If we look at the trend through the years, we see that not only have such incidents arisen during a manoeuvre, but they have been accompanied by erroneous intelligence. Almost invariably, when there is a controversial incident, one finds that the Army personnel involved were pumped up with adrenalin as a result of intelligence which ultimately proved faulty. I can be specific about that. We have only to look at the last three serious incidents in the north of Ireland to see that grossly faulty intelligence was at the root of them.<br/>
The problem is that, once an Army patrol is given intelligence and is primed to believe that, at a certain place and time and in a certain way, it will be facing dangerous and heavily armed people, the men in that patrol will naturally be in an aggressive frame of mind. When they are working on crucially faulty intelligence, the guilt lies with those who presented them with that intelligence and the direction under which they are operating. That is the substantial difference between what are now known in the north of Ireland as shoot-to-kill incidents and other incidents in which people have been killed as a result of other circumstances.<br/>
I remember clearly in my constituency when a bus

driver was shot at the permanent checkpoint in Middletown as a result of a conversation that he was having with a member of the security forces. Does one class that as a shoot-to-kill incident? That was a tragic circumstance for that man and his family, and for the young soldier involved. But when people have been stopped and searched and it has been established that they are not in possession of weapons and within a short time and less than 100 yards they are shot dead, one has to ask substantial and serious questions. Therein lies the difference.<br/>
I accept some of the criticisms of the new clause and schedule. The hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, North (Mr. McNamara) himself acknowledges how difficult it is to draft with a high degree of accuracy a schedule that meets every situation. Nevertheless, I support the schedule, because I do not accept the Gerry Adams thesis that in a war&#x2014;we talked earlier about the use of that dangerous term&#x2014;there will always be accidents. That argument plays right into the hands of people such as Mr. Adams, who spuriously apologised for the killing of a little child some years ago.<br/>
The new clause is the nearest that we have come to facing a problem that the Bill does not address, and I hope that it will be supported on the ground that a substantial change is needed.</p>

<p>I oppose the new clause. We have seen tonight that there is no shortage of armchair critics who know little about facing terrorists and what it is for a young man to go out to defend the innocent people of a community and risk being shot at any and every corner.<br/>
It is easy for hon. Members who sit in the comfort of the House and do not have to share the experiences of our soldiers, UDR members, police and reserves, who have to face the terrorist threat in our community. It is disgraceful to link our security personnel and their responses to anything that has come from the lips of the hypocritical Gerry Adams. That is not worthy of any further reference.<br/>
Some hon. Members&#x2014;perhaps one cannot blame them for this, because they are far removed from the situation &#x2014;seem to think that we in Ulster are in the midst of a picnic rather than in the midst of cruel warfare. Irrespective of whether the Government want to face this fact, the IRA has openly declared war on the British establishment and the British Ulster people. Sinn Fein means "Ourselves Alone'&#x2014;and that certainly does not mean the British Ulster man or woman.<br/>
We are facing a bloodthirsty animal in the IRA terrorist. One might also think&#x2014;if one attaches any credence to some of the remarks made a few moments ago &#x2014;that our security forces are on the rampage, looking for innocent victims to shoot to kill, and that they have not performed their duties with great honour and diligence. I want to place on record the fact that our security forces and the forces of the Crown have acted with great courage and exemplary restraint over the past 20 years of murder and destruction in Northern Ireland.<br/>
No doubt everyone can recount an incident in which someone has stepped outside the law&#x2014;but they will have received their proper and due judgment. I wish, however, that hon. Members who are so quick to criticise and find fault were equally eloquent when it came to giving due praise to the security forces in the Province for facing the dastardly enemy in our midst.<br/>
Our security forces operate under a severe disadvantage every time they go out. Unfortunately, they are often reacting&#x2014;the Government: have decided on a policy of reaction&#x2014;rather than acting against the terrorists and their enclaves. The advantage is in the hands of the terrorists. For example, they have the element of surprise.<br/>
Terrorists can watch the movements of the security forces. Doubtless they can watch a young man walk up the street to go on duty. They can watch young UDR men as they leave and return to their homes and establish what time they go on duty. That has happened too often. They have been allowed to go up the road safely for as long as a year, but then they let down their guard and the IRA murders them on their way to the UDR camp or the police station. That chapter has been written over and over again.</p>

<p>In 'it moment.<br/>
We must sit back for a moment and reflect on whether we should make it more difficult for members of the security forces to carry out their duties. It is easy to say that they should have done it differently. With hindsight, it is easy to pontificate about the manner in which they should have arrested someone and to question whether minimum force was used.<br/>
The hon. Member for Falkirk, West (Mr. Canavan) talked about Stalker, but I do not remember how many times Mr. Stalker had to face an IRA bullet or bomb. I cannot recall the number of times that he was out on duty in Northern Ireland and faced terrorists on the streets. I cannot remember the number of times that he went on duty to find out the reality of the situation. If people put their minds together they will find, I think, that he was never on the streets of Northern Ireland in uniform. It was easy for him, who came from the comfort of some plush office, with his airs and graces, and had no understanding whatsoever of reality.<br/>
Hon. Members have paraded the shoot-to-kill policy in the House tonight. Yes, there is a shoot-to-kill policy in Northern Ireland. The IRA has a full-blooded shoot-to-kill policy and intends to shoot every policeman, every UDR man and every Army lad or lassie who comes to the Province. That is the reality, and there is little or no hindrance whatsover to their efforts. The House ought to give credit and honour where it is due&#x2014;to members of our security forces.<br/>
In relation to the plastic bullet issue, it was suggested that no young person could be responsible for terrorist activity. If the hon. Members for Upper Bann (Mr. Trimble) and for Londonderry, East (Mr. Ross) were listening, they would find it interesting to learn that there is a new terrorist cell in our locality. We have information that those who are being trained as the major gunmen are between 14 and 16 years of age. That is a new departure. I do not know whether they cannot get older people into the IRA groups. However, it is interesting that information from the security forces shows that, in our locality, the people who are going out to pull the trigger are very young.</p>

<p>No. I have already given way to the hon. Gentleman once, and I want to finish what I am saying.<br/>
The hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, North (Mr. McNamara) said that no one could suggest that young people would be involved in the use of plastic bullets. Does he not realise that the IRA do not care who they use as a human shield&#x2014;that fancy term that was coined during the Gulf war? They do not care if the child whom they put in the front line is killed by a plastic bullet. In the past, they have been willing to put not only women and children but even their own members in the front line, as long as they benefit from the propaganda.<br/>
I vividly remember the tragic case of the two young soldiers in west Belfast&#x2014;two young men in a car who thought it wiser to hand themselves over to the republicans


than to draw their guns to defend themselves. They were killed. Anyone who remembers that incident will know that there was nothing pleasing in it: it was one of the most despicable, disgraceful and horrifying things that have ever been witnessed, as the films and photographs that were taken at the time will confirm. Many observers believe that those two young men died because they were afraid to break the yellow-card restrictions, fearing that, if they escaped with their lives, they would end up in court being treated as criminals.<br/>
I oppose the new clause, and I think that anyone who has any knowledge of what it is like to be a serving member of the security forces will do the same.</p>

<p>I have two main objections to the new clause and amendment No. 39. First, if they were adopted, the substantive law on self-defence would be fundamentally and radically changed in a way that would have important consequences for our criminal law. The Opposition have cooked up an amendment which they admit is based on tentative conclusions derived from a draft document laid before the United Nations. That gives no authority to the proposition that the general law of this country should be changed. If it is to be changed&#x2014;if there is anything in the contention that the existing law is inadequate or wrong&#x2014;surely the matter should be properly discussed outside the House.<br/>
The opinions of military and legal experts should be obtained and, if possible, some agreement should be reached. Until that is done, it would be highly irresponsible to accept such changes to the substantive law.<br/>
11 pm<br/>
My second objection is that the new clause is rather airy-fairy. It is an idealised conception of what rules can be imposed on persons who must act in the agony of the moment. Her Majesty's forces are trained to use their weapons at such times, but no hon. Member can imagine what he would do. It is virtually impossible to lay down rules governing their behaviour in such circumstances.<br/>
Amendment No. 39 says:
<q>No live rounds are to be carried in the breech of a firearm &#x2026; unless they are about to be fired.</q>
What an absurd suggestion, given the realities of war, violence and terrorism and the possibility that lurking around a corner ahead of a soldier is an armed man ready to open fire. Those rules will be imposed not on the IRA but on our representatives, who are protecting the ordinary people of Northern Ireland. It is absurd that we should say to them, "You cannot carry a live round in the breech of your gun because you have not had your superior officer's permission to do so. You must wait until you see your adversary aiming a gun at you before you are entitled to put a round in the breech of your gun."<br/>
That is so manifestly unreal that one reaches the conclusion that the Opposition have no faith in what they are doing but simply want to handicap the Government in their prosecution of the war against terrorism in Northern Ireland. For that reason, the new clause is a perfectly reprehensible idea.</p>

<p>When the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, North (Mr. McNamara) moved the new clause he said that we had discussed the use of lethal force several

times in Committee. It is right that we should do so again this evening because it is of considerable importance. As has been reflected in the debate, it leads to misconceptions. It is not frequently understood that split-second decisions must be taken when an incident is in progress. It also leads to the mistaken perception that there is, or has been, a shoot-to-kill policy in Northern Ireland.<br/>
I acknowledge the strength of the concern expressed about the use of firearms by the security forces and the emotiveness of the issue in parts of the community in Northern Ireland. I recognise the argument advanced by the Standing Advisory Commission on Human Rights that a code, as proposed in the new clause, would provide a clear set of rules, with statutory effect, on the circumstances in which the security forces might use firearms, thereby showing the Government's commitment to the principle that the security forces are tightly governed by the rule of law and recognising the special circumstances in which the security forces operate in Northern Ireland.<br/>
The issues involved are complex. As he did in Committee, the hon. Member for Upper Bann (Mr. Trimble), with his legal training, illustrated some of the complexities and difficulties associated with the issue and with these proposals in particular. As I said in Committee, the use of firearms and the law on the use of force are matters that go beyond the emergency provisions legislation, since they affect the criminal law as a whole. It would be anomalous, in the Government's view, to make special provision for the circumstances in which policemen might open fire in dealing with suspected terrorists, but not in a range of other circumstances. We must also consider whether it would be desirable that the law on such a fundamental matter as the use of force in Northern Ireland should be distinct from that in England and Wales. These are thus issues which take the new clause and the amendment outside the scope of the Bill.<br/>
A statutory code of practice on the use of force, if such were to be introduced, would more properly belong in the ordinary criminal law, where the law on the use of force is to be found. As I explained to hon. Members in Committee, however, the Government will keep the issues under consideration. My Department accepted the offer of the Standing Advisory Commission on Human Rights to prepare a draft code so that we could see what it might look like and whether it was feasible or practicable for such a code to be drafted.</p>

<p>What is taking place in Northern Ireland is a lot of criminal activity by criminals, by people


who are called terrorists and by thugs, but it is certainly not anything comparable to what we have just seen in the Gulf states. That was a war. I am not sure whether there is a lot to be gained from debating the semantics of the position.<br/>
We all recognise that there is the illegal use of force in Northern Ireland. The hon. Member for Mid-Ulster (Rev. William McCrea) was right. There is a shoot-to-kill policy in Northern Ireland; it is conducted by terrorists, primarily by the Provisional IRA, but also by others, including loyalist terrorists. Whether the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh (Mr. Mallon) wants to call that war is a matter for him. The House clearly understands the circumstances of what is happening in Northern Ireland and the need to address those circumstances in a way which is within the law, but nevertheless gives the security forces the opportunities to respond on behalf of the people whom they are there to serve and to protect to the maximum possible extent.</p>

<p>The Minister has used the word "semantics". I agree that the debate is not about semantics. He has surely referred to the nub of the problem. He said in his answer that criminals are involved. Criminals are answerable to the law. Yet in all our debates we have the juxtaposition of one hon. Member saying that it is a war situation, the next saying that it is a matter for the ordinary law, and the next saying that it is a question of criminality. Certainly, some of the speeches made by Conservative Members show the need to make it clear that we are not talking about war. That is exactly what the Provisional IRA want us to talk about. It wants us to regard the situation as such because of the implications of that for the IRA. We are talking about trying to cope with criminal activity with the most normal law available to us.</p>

<p>It is for right hon. and hon. Members of the House to make their own speeches. I am not responsible for the speeches of other hon. Members. I am responsible on this occasion for expressing the view of the Government. I confirm to the hon. Gentleman that we are talking precisely about the law. That is what we have before us this evening. We have before us a Bill which, subject to the wish of this House and of another place, will become the law of the land. It will become the legal framework which governs the activities of security forces, police and others, in relation to those who go about terrorising, killing, maiming and breaking the law in Northern Ireland. The Bill will be used as law within the legal system for the protection of those who live in Northern Ireland. On that the hon. Gentleman and I are in agreement.</p>

<p>I agree with the hon. Gentleman. If I may bring us back to the Bill, it is emergency provision legislation. It is an emergency provision for the reason that the hon. Gentleman has so eloquently stated, but it is still legislation. That is the way in which the House must proceed and the framework within which the security forces also have to proceed.<br/>
As the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, North said, the new clause appears similar to that which the Standing Advisory Commission on Human Rights has produced, as indeed it is. It is a useful contribution to our consideration of the issue. We have been giving our thought and consideration to that issue since we received the proposal from the commission, and our dialogue with the commission will continue&#x2014;it has not ended just because we have had a suggestion from the hon. Gentleman.<br/>
The House will appreciate, however, that such issues require careful consideration. Indeed, some of the reasons why they need to be carefully considered were mentioned by several hon. Members. The consideration that the issues deserve and require will take the matter well beyond the immediate timescale of the Bill. Indeed, I understand that the commission itself said that it would have preferred to have more time to consider the proposals that it made to the Government.<br/>
Against the background that I have described, I invite the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, North to withdraw his new clause. It raises issues which go beyond the Bill. Therefore, and for the reasons that I have stated, the Government are unable to accept it. But I give the hon. Gentleman the assurance that we shall continue to review the position with SACHR in the weeks ahead.</p>

<p>I am grateful for what the Minister has just said, but I am afraid that I am not satisfied with it. Before I press the new clause to a Division, I would like to respond to some of the points made by other hon. Members.<br/>
Part of the code would require that firearms always be made safe. That was laughed at. Should firearms be unsafe? Is that what the hon. Members for Upper Bann (Mr. Trimble), for Orpington (Mr. Stanbrook) and for Mid-Ulster (Rev. William McCrea) are saying?<br/>
I spoke about warning and said that the words "army", "police", "stop or I fire", or words to that effect, should be used. Should they not be used when the code says that security forces
<q>shall give a clear warning of their intent to use firearms, with sufficient time for the warning to be observed, unless to do so would expose others or themselves to undue risk or would be clearly pointless or inappropriate in the circumstances."?</q>
One cannot be allowed to get away with partial quotations. People delight in using partial quotations when they do not like a concept that is proposed. In this case, the concept is that members of the security forces who are in possession of firearms of tremendous power ought to use those firearms responsibly. Normally, the arms should be carried safely, and anyone who appears to have used a weapon wrongly should be answerable under the law. It is not good enough for the hon. Member for Upper Bann to say, "It is terribly sad if a member of the security forces negligently or mistakenly discharges a firearm and kills somebody." The hon. Gentleman used the words, "negligently or mistakenly"; I took them down. It is indeed very unfortunate if a person is killed. Victims too have certain rights.</p>

Indeed, it has been driven home by the events of the past week, but that is not what the argument is about. The argument is about the proper use of force.

<p>Under military law, it is a criminal offence to discharge a firearm negligently. Anyone doing so ends up in the glasshouse.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman said that we should be changing the law if we were to pass this new clause. Of course we should. We introduced the new clause because we want to change the law. It cannot be acceptable to the House that a person who cannot be charged with murder must be discharged. In respect of the use of firearms, there are different levels of culpability.<br/>
There are cases in which people kill others as a result of negligent, mistaken or careless action. In such circumstances, the crime may not amount to murder as such, but the people involved must be held responsible. Under current criminal law, that is not the case. The hon. Gentleman says that this should be part of the general law of the land rather than of emergency law, but we are concerned here with the emergency use of troops in support of the civil power. This legislation is designed to deal with that situation, and that is our reason for tabling the new clause.</p>

The amendment gives effect to a commitment which I gave in Committee. Clause 18(4) provides a new power for the armed forces to seize items which are, have been or are intended to be used in the commission of an offence under clauses 24 or 25.<br/>
I gave a commitment to the Committee to consider whether it would be desirable to limit the new power of seizure to a maximum of four hours, as with the power to arrest and detain persons under clause 18(1). The Government have decided that it would be desirable to make this change, and the amendment makes the necessary provision.<br/>
The effect of the amendment is that, if after four hours the items had not already been returned to their owners, they would have to be returned, unless the police considered it necessary to retain them under their powers in clause 17(3).<br/>
I hope that the House will welcome the amendment.</p>

In Committee, I undertook to change the statutory test in clause 19(4) to require the police and armed forces reasonably to believe that it is necessary for the purpose of effectively carrying out a search or of preventing the frustration of its object before imposing restrictions.

<p>I hope that amendment No. 5 obtains the unanimity given to Government amendments Nos. 16 and 17.<br/>
Clause 22 gives the security forces the power to examine and remove documents found in the course of searches of premises, vehicles or persons. As the Minister will remember, in Committee we tried to amend the clause. I believe that he had some sympathy with our arguments but was not prepared to accept our suggestions.<br/>
We are returning to this subject because we are still unhappy with clause 22 and we are not convinced that amendments Nos. 40 and 41 will be an improvement. We believe that they will make the clause unworkable. That is why we continue to press for the emasculation of the clause. The amendments, if agreed to, would make the clause ineffective.<br/>
Lord Colville of Culross ruled out the proposed innovation in the Province until such time as the relevant Police and Criminal Evidence Act provisions had been tested in the courts. The Minister will recall that that statement appears in paragraph 2.9.6 of Lord Colville's report. Lord Colville alluded to difficulties that the proposed power would create:
<q>I have a reluctance to recommend extensions of emergency powers, especially when they expand the powers to search. Private papers are not lightly to be laid open to a rummage.</q>
That is strong language for Lord Colville. I am sure that the Minister agrees that the consequent confrontations could give rise to considerable potential friction between the security forces and members of the public.<br/>
As we said in Committee, we believe that the penalties
that are attached to refusal to co-operate are excessively severe. It should be recognised that many ordinary people will be incensed by these draconian powers. Any premeditated attempt to disrupt a search is already covered by existing law&#x2014;for example, obstruction, breach of the peace and other offences within the criminal code. The penalties that are attached to offences under the clause are excessive and unnecessary, given the provisions of the criminal law.<br/>
I congratulate the Government on tabling amendments Nos. 40 and 41, to the extent that the Minister accepted some of the arguments that we advanced in Committee. I presume that the Government's amendments are designed in part to try to meet the criticisms that we expressed at that stage. The Minister will recall that, in Committee, we prayed in aid in support of our views the Law Society of Northern Ireland and the Bar Council. I hope that the Minister has had discussions with those two bodies. I hope also that he will be able to convince us that those two bodies think that amendments Nos. 40 and 41 are suitable.<br/>
As I understand amendment No. 40, it is an attempt to introduce the concept of legal privilege so that certain documents will be exempt from the power that is defined


in the clause. I am sure that the Minister will agree that that concept was absent as the clause was drafted originally.<br/>
We welcome the concept of legal privilege. Indeed, it is one that we introduced in Committee. We have grave doubts, however, about the practicality of the clause if amendment No. 40 is agreed to. On what basis is it possible for a soldier at a checkpoint to determine whether an item is subject to legal privilege? A check can be made, but that will involve the soldier reading the material, and by reading it he would be committing an illegal act. How can the Minister reconcile that? A soldier can only ascertain that a document is legal by reading it, but, by doing so, he commits an illegal act.<br/>
The new subsection 2A strengthens the argument for the complete removal of an unworkable and counterproductive clause. Given the Government's view on the operation of PACE in the Province, the remainder of Government amendment No. 40 is ironic. In Committee, the Government rejected the PACE-type safeguards we proposed on the ground that they would lead to unnecessary bureaucracy.<br/>
Amendment No. 40 is a cynical attempt to amend the unamendable rather than accept that clause 22 is impractical. Unless I receive assurances from the Minister, we intend to press amendment No. 5 to a vote. We have grave doubts about the practicalities of amendments Nos. 40 and 41&#x2014;we trust that the Minister will be able to give us further reassurances about them&#x2014;but, despite those doubts, we do not intend to oppose the amendments in the Lobby.</p>

<speech hansard_id="786404" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1991-03-06a.395.0" hansard_membership_id="681" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/3052" speakername="Dr. Mawhinney" colnum="395" time="23:30:00">
<p>I am sorry that the hon. Member for Leicester, South (Mr. Marshall) used the word "cynical", as it was a departure from his normal generosity of spirit when we have not agreed on the Bill on the past. I am also sorry that he believes that amendments Nos. 40 and 41 are so unappealing.<br/>
One of the terrorist's most vital weapons is intelligence and the collection of information. I am sure that most people would agree with that statement. I therefore find it difficult to understand why the hon. Gentleman believes that amendment No. 5 should be pursued and that amendments Nos. 40 and 41 are "unworkable and unnecessary". If the terrorist sets such store by the collection of information&#x2014;he needs that information to target his attacks on individuals or places&#x2014;surely it must be appropriate for the House to address that issue. At present, the security forces are poorly equipped to profit from such opportunities as they may have to get hold of such information.<br/>
Although it is an offence to possess information which is likely to be of use to terrorists, there is no related power to examine material that may be found during the course of a lawful search to ascertain whether it contains such vital information for the terrorists. We went over this in Committee, and it is the basis of clause 22. The existing provisions in the PACE order, which require prior application for a warrant, are not adequate for this purpose.<br/>
As the law stands, it works greatly in the terrorists' favour. The Government regard the new powers in clause 22 as an appropriate way in which to enhance the security forces' ability to obtain evidential material, as well as

offering the potential to deter and disrupt terrorist operations. Unlike the hon. Gentleman, we believe that these powers are justified and necessary. Nevertheless, I announced in Committee on 15 January that we had received representations from a number of bodies about the scope of the powers in clause 22. As the hon. Gentleman said, we had a thorough debate about the issue in Committee, when concerns were expressed by both sides about that clause.<br/>
The bodies that made representations to us included the Law Society for Northern Ireland, the Bar Council, the Standing Advisory Commission on Human Rights and the Committee on the Administration of Justice. I told the Committee that we would consult further on the issues, and we have done so.<br/>
After consultation with the interested parties, we have reflected on all the issues to establish whether we can provide greater protection for certain categories of document without sacrificing the essential security purpose of the power contained in the clause. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman and I will simply have to agree to differ on that fundamental issue.<br/>
I take some pleasure from being able to tell the House that we have been able to introduce some important safeguards. I am sorry that the hon. Member for Leicester, South does not share that pleasure. The proposed changes are in amendments Nos. 40 and 41.<br/>
First, amendment No. 40 provides that the power in clause 22 shall not be taken to authorise the examination, removal or retention of a document or record when there is reasonable cause for believing it to be an item subject to legal privilege. That was urged on us in Committee and it is an important limitation on the scope of the new power. The point was made to us by a number of bodies, including those to which I have just referred, that legal documents are given absolute protection under the ordinary law and should be similarly protected under clause 22. That was also urged on us in Committee. After careful reflection, we have concluded that it would be right to exclude such documents from the scope of clause 22.<br/>
11.45 pm<br/>
Secondly, the amendment places a duty on the police and armed forces to make a written record where a document or record is examined under clause 22, and to provide a copy of the record to any person whose documents have been examined. The record would also state the date and time when any document or record was removed and retained for examination, and it would identify the constable or member of the armed forces making it. The record would therefore constitute a receipt where documents are removed and retained for examination. The Standing Advisory Commission on Human Rights considered that point to be important.<br/>
Thirdly, the amendment would set limits on the length of time that any document or record may be removed and retained for examination by the police or armed forces. It is right and proper that documents should not be removed for an indefinite period. The amendment would require the police and armed forces to return retained documents to their owners before the expiry of 48 hours from the time when they were removed, unless they were seized for evidential purposes.<br/>
However, we have thought it right to provide the police with powers, exercisable only on the authority of an officer of the rank of chief inspector or above, to extend the


period for another 48 hours in cases of particular difficulty, making a 96-hour maximum. Authorisation by a relatively senior police officer is an important safeguard against the possibility of documents being held for longer than is absolutely necessary.<br/>
Finally, the amendment prohibits the photographing or copying by the police and armed forces of any document or record which is examined. That should provide valuable reassurance that the confidentiality of documents will be respected.<br/>
Amendment No. 41 deals with a consequential change to clause 26. It simply provides that, where a document or record is found in the course of a search of a vehicle, vessel or aircraft, then the copy of the record of the examination shall be provided to the person in charge of the vehicle, vessel or aircraft, and will contain appropriate details.<br/>
The hon. Member for Leicester, South asked a practical question about what he saw as the difficulties of ascertaining whether a document was subject to legal privilege, and of someone having to read it in order to make that judgment. A police officer or member of the armed forces can examine documents only so far as is reasonably required to ascertain whether the document contains information likely to be useful to terrorists. The term "reasonably required" means that the matter is a subject for the courts.<br/>
The Government believe that the powers in clause 22 are necessary and justified. We listened to representations by members of the Committee, as we were urged to do, and to representations by others. We have responded to those representations, and we propose to provide important protection for legal documents and to build into the clause a series of procedural safeguards. I hope that, if amendment No. 5 is pressed to a vote, the House will feel able to reject it and to accept amendments Nos. 40 and 41.</p>

<p>First, I should like to comment on my use of the word "cynical". I do not usually reflect and then agree that I may have used an inappropriate word. On this occasion I have thought about the use of the word "cynical" and I agree that it was perhaps inappropriate to use such a word at this juncture. I put my use of it down to the lateness of the hour. I realise that I cannot get the <i>Hansard</i> reporter to change the word, but I should like the record to show that I have withdrawn the word "cynical" and would have liked to use the word "sceptical" instead.</p>

<p>Before the Minister is too grateful, I suggest that he looks at the dictionary definitions of "cynical" and "sceptical"&#x2014;but let my retraction stand.<br/>
There is not much difference between the Government and the Opposition on the use of documents by terrorist organisations and the need for security forces to have some powers to inspect such documents. As the Minister will appreciate, however, in Committee we placed great emphasis on legal documents. The Minister said then that under existing criminal law such documents have absolute privilege, but from what the Minister has now said, that will clearly not apply under this emergency legislation.<br/>
Again we come back to the old conundrum of who will judge reasonableness and at what stage in the process it will be ascertained. I presume that a judge or a court will decide, but that will be at a stage far removed from the

soldier looking at the document and having to read either a short or long extract before he is able to decide whether it is subject to legal privilege.<br/>
That is why we are sceptical of Government amendment No. 40. The introduction of the concept of legal privilege is good and coincides with the Opposition's view, but in practice it will have little or no effect, and the average legal document which should be subject to privilege will be treated no better or worse than any other document.<br/>
That is the basis of our doubts about Government amendment No. 40. As I have already said, however, it is not our intention to oppose it. Nevertheless, despite the Minister's criticism of amendment No. 5, we shall seek to divide the House on that amendment.</p>

<p>Clause 27 was introduced by the Government, rather strangely, during the final stages in Committee. It creates a new offence of directing
<q>the activities of an organisation which is concerned in the commission of acts of terrorism",</q>
the punishment for which shall be life imprisonment.<br/>
There are several objections to this clause. It creates a new offence, but fails to define it. The concept of directing is totally unknown in existing law. Concepts such as permitting, allowing, suffering and controlling all exist and have a definite meaning, but there is no such precision in this clause.<br/>
It is also noteworthy that the draft criminal code drawn up by the Law Commission in 1989 does not refer to the concept of directing anyone in the commission of any crime. Given that lack of precision and definition, the Government are likely to argue&#x2014;as they did in Committee &#x2014;that the courts will provide the necessary definition. Such an argument amounts to claiming that good judges in Northern Ireland will rescue us from bad law passed by the House of Commons.<br/>
Not only does the clause lack precision; it is unnecessary. It is already illegal to take part in the preparation, instigation or commission of acts of terrorism. The definition is already wide enough to encompass any behaviour that could legitimately be considered to direct the activities of an organisation involved in terrorism. Furthermore, the clause is, to a degree, dishonest. Its practical effect would be to make virtually every member of a proscribed organisation liable to a life sentence. As such persons would inevitably be involved in directing activities at some level, almost any involvement in any such organisation would make them so liable. If the Government intend to increase the penalties &#x2014;there may or may not be an argument for that&#x2014;they should say so openly, arid do it directly rather than through the back door.<br/>
It can be argued that the failure to keep sentences proportionate to crimes poses an additional danger for the security forces, as there would be little difference between the consequences of less severe crimes and those of murder. The provision of the new offence would have strange, almost absurd, consequences. It relates not to the direction of terrorist activities, but to the direction of organisations concerned in such activities. Anyone responsible for bringing about a decision to cease terrorist activities would be liable to life imprisonment. People who engaged in conversations with terrorist organisations with the aim of persuading them to lay down their arms and pursue their goals democratically would be penalised by the clause.<br/>
Clause 27 is not tied to the present emergency, in that it does not confine itself to terrorist activities engaged in by proscribed organisations, or to terrorism connected with the affairs of Northern Ireland. It seems to be an example of the consequences of an error known to the Central Intelligence Agency as "blowback". "Blowback" occurs when official propaganda feeds back into official policy-making&#x2014;when people act on the belief that their own propaganda is necessarily true. The theory behind it is that of the godfather hypothesis, which posits the existence of a directorate that plans, but does not carry out, acts of terrorism. Apart from the fact that anyone so involved is already guilty of a wide range of criminal offences, everything that is known about terrorism in Northern Ireland suggests that the credibility of the paramilitary leaders among their supporters depends on their being, or having been, personally implicated in specific acts of terrorism. A surprising number of them have been found by the courts to be involved in specific crimes.<br/>
We cannot accept clause 27. The Government have not said that they are prepared to accept any of the amendments. Amendment No. 1, which was tabled by Ulster Unionist Members, seeks to make clause 27 more specific. It removes the phrase, "at any level", thereby restricting its scope to the leaders of proscribed organisations. If they push it to a vote, we shall vote for it.<br/>
Amendment No. 2 would ensure that the clause applies only to organisations that have been proscribed, so that leading an organisation that may be involved in violent incidents does not lead to conviction unless it has been proscribed. I am not too happy with the amendment because a front organisation may condemn some acts of violence while sponsoring terrorist activity or benefiting from it. The amendment will need more careful consideration.<br/>
Amendment No. 3 makes the clause more specific by restricting guilt to those involved in the direction of terrorist activities. The legal activities of the organisation would not be covered. My hon. Friends in the SDLP have tabled an amendment to achieve a similar purpose, and I should have thought that it would recommend itself to the Government.<br/>
In amendment No. 12, my hon. Friends in the SDLP seek to change the blanket charge or the indeterminate or mandatory life sentence to up to 10 years' imprisonment. Given the vagueness of the clause and the possibility of conviction under it for varying responsibilities for paramilitary campaigns, preserving judicial discretion would allow for sentences to be proportionate to the offence.<br/>
Clause 27, which has no parallel in criminal legislation, introduces a dangerous new concept. In Committee, the Government said that it is necessary, yet members of the various terrorist organisations are already caught by the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act 1973 and the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1989. By creating a new offence to pretend that they are doing something about the godfathers, the Government are not helping the fight against terrorism. The new clauses that we discussed earlier contained sensible provisions, but clause 27, which seems to be an emotional spasm, should not be in the Bill.</p>

<p>Amendment No. 11.<br/>
Under clause 27, any person who directs the activities of an organisation which is concerned in the commission of acts of terrorism is guilty of an offence. The clause is open to an interpretation that could be quite erroneous. Someone could direct several activities within an organization&#x2014;an organisation that supports and is involved in terrorism&#x2014;that are not terrorist acts and that could not be considered criminal acts. The clause must be clearly defined, or it will rightly be described as loose, imprecise and bad legislation.<br/>
In Committee, it was suggested that we shall rely on good judges to protect the accused from bad law. I described clause 27 as resembling something that had been written on the back of an envelope by someone on his way home on the Underground&#x2014;if the Underground had not been disrupted by someone who had been directing the activities of an organisation involved in terrorism.<br/>
The purpose of amendment No. 12 is to try to soften the notion that somehow such activity merits a life sentence. The clause invites the judge to consider a life sentence. The Minister of State will argue that it would be nonsense for a judge not to use his discretion. If discretion is being left to the judge, that should be defined in the legislation. It is for that reason that we tabled the amendments.</p>

<speech hansard_id="786427" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1991-03-06a.402.3" hansard_membership_id="271" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/3418" speakername="Mr. Trimble" colnum="402" time="00:15:00">
<p>When the clause was discussed in Committee, we said that we could see merit in its general objective, but we were concerned about the width of its terms. In Committee, I put a number of questions to the


Minister of State on the point. In the light of his answers, we decided to table amendments to put on record our reservations, doubts and unhappiness about some aspects of the clause. I should like to speak to those briefly.<br/>
Reference has been made to amendment No. 1, which would delete the phrase "at any level". As the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, North (Mr. McNamara) said, the object is to tighten the legislation. If it inflicts life imprisonment on the person who directs the activities of the organisation at any level, it will sweep up people who are engaged in low-level activity. We think that life imprisonment may not be appropriate when members of a proscribed organisation pay heavy penalties simply through membership, and any criminal activity that can be proved will carry its own penalty.<br/>
The object of the clause is to give a special additional heavy penalty in the shape of life imprisonment to people who are, as is said, the godfathers. The godfathers are not the small fry. We can see merit in the legislation, because it is reasonable to believe that there are circumstances in which persons who are not members of proscribed organisations are directing their activities. I take the point made by the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, North, but in some cases they are former active members of proscribed organisations who have moved on to other activities which are not formally proscribed but none the less, from that position of relative safety, they still direct terrorist activities. It is right that severe penalties should be available for them. I should like to think that they would be used, but we will wait and see.<br/>
In Committee I asked the Minister of State why the clause was not directed specifically to proscribed organisations. He said that he did not want to refer to proscribed organisations because of the width of the power to proscribe. In clause 28(3), the Secretary of State may proscribe an organisation if it
<q>appears to him to be concerned in terrorism or in promoting or encouraging it.</q>
The Minister of State said that he did not want to cover all those organisations. He did not want to cover organisations that were simply promoting or encouraging terrorism; he wanted to focus on organisations which were concerned in terrorism. The spirit of his reply was that "proscribed" was too wide, that he wanted a narrower focus.<br/>
In framing the amendments, I tried to get the best of both worlds by referring to proscribed organisations and then by making it clear that the offence would apply not just to directing any activity of a proscribed organisation but to directing the terrorist activities of proscribed organisations. I think that in those circumstances life imprisonment is not inappropriate.<br/>
With regard to other organisations which are not proscribed, there are two answers&#x2014;either the organisation should be proscribed or the criminal or terrorist activities themselves could be brought in. The clause would bring in other organisations not proscribed where it might not be appropriate.<br/>
In Committee the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, North gave an example. He referred to the Animal Liberation Front as an example of an organisation which has been engaged&#x2014;or there is reason to believe that it has been engaged&#x2014;in activities which would come within the definition of terrorist activities. In this clause, a person

who directs any activity, whether criminal or non-criminal, within a body such as the Animal Liberation Front could be exposed to life imprisonment. We felt that was perhaps a little too draconian.<br/>
If we are to have a penalty of this nature, it is appropriate that it be more narrowly focused. We tabled the amendments to put our position on record and I hope that the Government will consider the matter further.</p>

<p>Several important amendments have been tabled to the clause, and several hon. Members have spoken to them. I will do my best to meet the standard that I set myself at the beginning of the proceedings to be as concise as possible but to do justice to the arguments made.<br/>
The hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, North (Mr. McNamara) does not like clause 27. He did not like it in Committee, and he does not like it today. He has the virtue of consistency and we all admire him for that. I like clause 27. We have the same consistency and it seems that we shall have difficulty in achieving a meeting of minds on the subject. I ask the hon. Gentleman to consider the ordinary, common-sense meaning of this simple clause. A significant feature of all the amendments is that they focus on individual words.<br/>
Clause 27 is short and needs to be taken in the round. The word "directing" has its ordinary common-sense meaning. The hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, North does not like the word "direct"&#x2014;he wants it to be defined&#x2014;but if the House defined "direct" the courts would still have to reach a judgment about what the words meant. It seems much better that they should have to interpret a simple sentence with its common-sense meaning rather than complicated definitions of the word "direct", which they would still have to interpret. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman has looked up the definition in the Concise Oxford Dictionary. The meaning of the word "direct" is clear and straightforward.<br/>
Amendment No. 1 is designed to remove the phrase "at any level". I advise the House that that phrase was included deliberately in the provision. Indeed, the hon. Member for Upper Bann (Mr. Trimble) acknowledged that I made that clear in Committee. The phrase was included to make it clear that anyone who directs the activities of one of the organisations, whether at headquarters, regional or local level, is equally open to prosecution.<br/>
The hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, North suggested that the clause was not necessary because those involved in terrorist organisations could always be got for something else. But some of them cannot be got for something else. That is precisely why the clause has been inserted in the Bill.<br/>
As I said in Committee, the expression "at any level" was chosen to give specific recognition to the types of structure that terrorist organisations adopt. I am slightly surprised at the hon. Member for Upper Bann. I should have thought that, with his knowledge, he would have recognised that the structures of terrorist organisations gave the phrase "at any level" genuine meaning. The hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, North has never accepted that concept, either in Committee or today, but I should have thought that the hon. Member for Upper Bann would recognise it.</p>

<p>Perhaps in my haste to make progress I passed over that point when I should have dealt with it in detail. I remember the points that the Minister made in Committee. He referred to cell-like structures, and so on. I formed the opinion then&#x2014;and I am still of the opinion now&#x2014;that the Bill would catch people directing cells of terrorist organisations if it simply used the phrase "directing the activities". I believe that "at any level" is still too wide.</p>

<p>I thank the hon. Gentleman for explaining his view. I am afraid that we shall have to agree to disagree. It is gratifying that he recognises that there are structures which make the inclusion of the words "at any level" arguably defensible, even if he is not persuaded by the argument.<br/>
As the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh (Mr. Mallon) said, the purpose of amendment No. 11 is to narrow the scope of the offence. It would apply to those directing the criminal activities of organisations concerned in the commission of acts of terrorism. Of course, I accept that in certain circumstances some of the activities of terrorist organisations may not be overtly criminal&#x2014;that is to say, they may not, in themselves, be breaches of the criminal law. For example, activities which may be directed by a person holding the position of quartermaster may not in themselves be criminal activities. It is not a criminal offence to purchase or acquire items such as gloves, balaclavas, overalls, two-way radios or walkie-talkies. On the other hand, we can have no doubt about the purpose behind the quartermaster's direction that such items should be acquired. I therefore suggest to the House that it is right that those against whom there is evidence of the direction of such activities, even when those activities may not in themselves be unlawful, should be open to prosecution.<br/>
With regard to amendments Nos. 2 and 3, it may interest the hon. Member for Upper Bann to know that when the clause was being drafted our initial inclination &#x2014;in line with the hon. Gentleman's own thinking&#x2014;was to define the offence in terms of proscribed organisations. Clearly, it was&#x2014;and is&#x2014;our expectation that, in practice, it is against the leaders of those organisations which are currently proscribed, at whatever level, that the offence will be used. It became apparent, however, that there could be potential complications in using that definition. As hon. Members will recall, clause 28(3) empowers the Secretary of State to add to the list of proscribed organisations
<q>any organisation that appears to him to be concerned in terrorism or in promoting or encouraging it.</q>
The use of the definition "proscribed organisation" for this offence would have opened up the theoretical possibility that those who might be directing the activities of organisations which had been proscribed only for promoting or encouraging terrorism, rather than because they were concerned in terrorism, would be open to prosecution for this serious offence. That is not a situation that we wish to see arise.<br/>
I see difficulties also in respect of amendment No.3. It is clear that, as the amendment is drafted the offence applies to anyone involved in directing the activities of terrorist organisations without seeking to put limits on the types of activities concerned. The point here is that every organisation is composed to some extent of different groups with different specialisations. In addition to those who actually plan and carry out acts of terrorism, there are

those who perform other functions such as intelligence-gathering, recruitment and quartermastering which are vital to the existence of the organisations. It is therefore right that those responsible for those various functions should be subject to prosecution for the offence if there is evidence of their directing role, although in individual cases that role may well not be such as to justify the maximum penalty.</p>

<p>I understand what the Minister is saying about activities other than those of a directly terrorist nature&#x2014;gathering information, for instance&#x2014;but he must realise that the cooks and bottlewashers are included.</p>
</speech>
<speech hansard_id="786432" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1991-03-06a.406.1" hansard_membership_id="681" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/3052" speakername="Mr. Mawhinney" colnum="406" time="00:15:00">
<p>If cooks and bottlewashers are members of terrorist organisations, it is possible that we are gathering them in.<br/>
Amendment No. 3, however, appears to limit the application of the offence solely to those directing the activities of these organisations with regard to actual acts of terrorism. Not only would that represent an unacceptable narrowing of the offence, but it would place an additional heavy burden on the prosecution to demonstrate that that was precisely the suspect's role within the organisation's command.<br/>
The purpose of amendment No. 12 is straightforward &#x2014;it would reduce the maximum penalty for the offence from life imprisonment to 10 years. The Government cannot support that amendment. As hon. Members know, the offence is aimed at those who direct the activities of terrorist organisations, and it simply would not be credible for those in control of such organisations to be subject to a lesser maximum penalty than their subordinates. Rank and file members of those organisations are liable to sentences of life imprisonment where serious offences are committed, and it is right that those who are responsible for directing such activities should be subject to no less a penalty.<br/>
The purpose of Government amendment No. 33 is to add the offence in clause 27 to the list of scheduled offences in schedule 1. It would clearly be inappropriate for the offence to be dealt with before juries, and the amendment will ensure that cases will be dealt with in accordance with the procedures in part I of the Bill.<br/>
For all those reasons, I invite the House to resist amendments Nos. 6, 1, 11, 2, 3 and 12, but to accept Government amendment No. 33.</p>

<p>It is not my intention to keep the House long, but the Minister of State has confirmed the point that we made earlier&#x2014;he is boxed in by his own propaganda. He accused me of being consistent. On this issue, I am consistently right and he is consistently wrong and has dug a big pit for himself. He started by saying that everyone knew what "directing" meant. I asked him what he meant, and he replied that it would be foolish to define it. The Bill contains clauses that consist of nothing but definitions, so everything will be defined except the major new offence.<br/>
The Minister said that we needed the new offence because there would be occasions when the people involved would not otherwise be, to use his charming and immortal word, "got". He did not give an example of what he meant, but he then said that he had thought of one and talked about quartermasters who, when sending out


people to collect items such as balaclavas and two-way radios, would be directing. They would be caught under clause 30 on obtaining possession of items intended for terrorist purposes.<br/>
The Minister gave a list of other examples. He rightly said that it would be wrong for people who direct terrorism to be given more lenient prison sentences than those who carry out the crimes. But there are offences, including being an accessory to a crime and conspiracy, that cover every example given by the Minister. Someone felt that the Government had to appear to be tough. The proposal is nothing but an emotional spasm, and we should get rid of it.</p>

<p>Clause 54 provides that no proceedings for an offence under the Bill shall be instituted except by or with the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions for Northern Ireland. I am sure that hon. Members agree that private prosecutions for an offence under the Bill would be inappropriate.<br/>

<p>I ask for the Minister's tolerance and sympathy. As a Scots Member, I am puzzled about why there is no mention of Scotland. When I was on a local review committee inquiring into Edinburgh prison, I had to assess for parole purposes a number of men who were in gaol in Scotland for committing terrorist acts involving groups in Northern Ireland. I ask the question because the Director of Public Prosecutions has no responsibility in Scotland. Why is there no reference to Scotland in the clause?</p>

<p>If the hon. Gentleman had allowed me to move on to the next paragraph of my reply, his question would have been answered.<br/>
To ensure that there are no private prosecutions for offences under the Act, the amendments provide that proceedings in Northern Ireland and in England and Wales shall not be instituted except by or with the consent of the respective Directors of Public Prosecutions. No equivalent provision is necessary for Scotland, because private prosecutions cannot be brought in Scotland. I understand that prosecutions in Scotland have to be brought by the Lord Advocate.</p>

<p>In Committee, I opposed giving to a lay person powers that are normally reserved for a police officer. The amendments are designed to introduce a judicial requirement into an order for a person to attend and answer questions, or an order to produce documents. The legitimate power of a police officer should not be given to a lay person, however qualified. A lay person should not be able to initiate and continue a specialised investigation. That is why the amendment provides that the powers should be given to a judge and not an authorised lay person.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman's intervention shows his youth. When I was about the hon. Gentleman's age, county court judges were known as circuit court judges. I happen to live close to the border and I have some knowledge of judges south of the border, who are also known as circuit court judges.</p>

<p>The amendment would confer on circuit court judges a novel inquisitorial role. As drafted, it would authorise them to require persons to attend before them. Such a person would be required to answer questions put by the judge. I suspect that the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh (Mr. Mallon) may not have intended to introduce such a far-reaching reform, and that his intention was to require an authorised investigator to obtain authority from a ciruit court judge before exercising the powers that are set out in paragraph 2(1) of schedule 4. If that was the hon. Gentleman's intention, I must tell him that it has not been achieved by the amendment. I therefore hope that he will be willing to withdraw it.<br/>
I must tell the hon. Gentleman also that amendment No. 14 is defective for the same reason. I hope that he will feel able not to move it.</p>

<p>I beg to move, That the Bill be now read the Third time.<br/>
Today we have had serious and constructive debates on the important issues relevant to the Bill. In the past four months, the House has given most careful consideration to the proposals. I recognise the strength of feeling that hon. Members have brought to that consideration of the Bill. I hope that hon. Members on both sides of the House accept that, where they have been unable to accept the arguments advanced by the Government, the Government have nevertheless listened carefully to what has been said and have sought to respond with genuine argument.<br/>
I acknowledge and thank those outside the House who have played their role in our consideration, who have taken an active interest and made contributions. I have particularly in mind the Standing Advisory Commission on Human Rights, the Committee for the Administration of Justice, the Northern Ireland Law Society and the Bar Council. I hope that those organisations feel that their contributions have been taken seriously and have added to our considerations.<br/>
It would be wrong if I did not refer again to the crucial contribution made by Lord Colville. His report formed the backbone of our debates and I know that I speak for the whole House when I say that his report did us all a service. Lord Colville, through his skilled and penetrating analyses, laid out clearly for us the various issues that needed to be addressed.<br/>
The Bill has benefited from the consideration that right hon. and hon. Members have given it, here and in Committee. I am grateful to all those who took part for the spirit in which they have contributed to the debate. I also thank and pay tribute to all those who have advised and worked with Ministers as we have studied the issues involved in the Bill.<br/>
Those who served on the Committee will appreciate that the Bill has sought to find a balance, which is always a matter of judgment. That important balance is between the need for effective security legislation that offers protection to the people of Northern Ireland against those who would kill and maim and use the bomb and bullet because their arguments are not persuasive at the ballot box and the powers that are given to the security forces and police. When granting such powers, we must be aware of the rights of individuals and the fact that they too require protection in a democratic society. The Government have been conscious of that need for balance throughout the proceedings on the Bill. We believe that we have achieved that balance.<br/>
We believe that the Bill will be a valuable and important contribution to security in Northern Ireland. On that basis, I commend it to the House.</p>

<speech hansard_id="786597" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1991-03-06a.425.1" hansard_membership_id="9158" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/3081" speakername="Mr. McNamara" colnum="425" time="00:53:00">
<p>The Opposition do not intend to divide on Third Reading, nor on the order that follows.<br/>
We have already demonstrated our hostility to the Bill on Second Reading, in Committee and on Report. Because of the situation in Northern Ireland, we recognise that paramilitary campaigns of violence require emergency legislation. We do not believe, however, that the Bill represents the best instrument to meet that threat.<br/>
We have tried to adopt a rational approach to the Bill. Terrorism arouses understandable emotions, but we

cannot allow those emotions to override the necessity for a rational response to the threat posed. After all, terrorism represents a failure of reason. Democracies cannot surrender reason.<br/>
All of us who have given serious consideration to the Bill are mindful of the fact that it has serious consequences for those who are charged with operating it on our behalf. The members of the security forces have to live and work with the legislation, so the House must be careful not to place them in positions which make their task more difficult, nor which condemn them to further decades of conflict in Northern Ireland. Too many elements of the Bill would do so.<br/>
In Committee and on Report, the Minister of State often referred to the need for balance within this legislation. We accept that the Government have had to use their judgment in choosing between sometimes conflicting demands. Our objection is that they have systematically and continuously come down on the wrong side of the argument. Nowhere is that more clearly seen than in the Government's treatment of Lord Colville's careful and thorough reports. Glowing tributes have been paid to his work; then most of it has been ignored.<br/>
Lord Colville's reviews have provided a focus for reasoned argument over the logic and nature of emergency legislation. If devolved institutions emerge in Northern Ireland, and when perhaps security powers are transferred, the people of Northern Ireland will be able to ensure proper democratic scrutiny of much of this legislation.<br/>
Too many of Lord Colville's recommendations have been travestied or ignored by the Government. For instance, clause 30 on the possession of items connected with terrorism contains a completely distorted version of a proposal by Lord Colville. Similarly, Lord Colville proposed a switch to the certifying in of scheduled offences rather than scheduling out. This modest reform, which would have helped to ensure that the Diplock courts were employed for the purpose for which they were designed &#x2014;trials involving terrorist offences&#x2014;was completely ignored.<br/>
Worst of all has been the Government's decision to pay no attention to Lord Colville's eloquent plea for the removal of the power of internment from the statute book. The Opposition are convinced that that is a serious mistake which undermines the credibility of efforts to create a normal and democratic society in Northern Ireland. It represents a commitment by the Government to cling to every last ounce of arbitrary executive authority. It is a hangover from the special powers Act. It reveals a state of mind which is not conducive to a focused, rational and intelligent security policy.<br/>
Hegel may be alive and well in Craigavon, and he is also active in Hillsborough, but Belfast and Northern Ireland in the 1990s should not be confused with Berlin in the 1820s. To the Opposition, order and freedom do not appear as conflicting alternatives. We believe that political order is best guaranteed by freedom.<br/>
Lord Colville's recommendations provided the Government with an opportunity to make a fresh start in a difficult and sensitive field. They came down on the side of coercion rather than reason. Eventually the Government will have to accept that reason alone is the main weapon to defeat terrorism in all its forms.</p>

<p>After 44 hours of debate on the Bill, which has twice been in the House, and in Committee, concluding in the week in which we had to deal with a motion on the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1989, we should not prolong the agony. I thank the Minister and officials for their courtesy during our consideration of the Bill. I also thank the Chairman of the Committee for his unfailing help and courtesy at all times.</p>

<speech hansard_id="786601" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1991-03-06a.427.1" hansard_membership_id="2024" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2510" speakername="Mr. Canavan" colnum="427" time="00:58:00">
<p>I am not in favour of giving the Bill an unopposed Third Reading, and I shall briefly explain why.<br/>
The Bill is indicative of the hypocrisy and double standards of the British Government and the whole British establishment. The Government claim to believe in the unity of the United Kingdom and they say that Northern Ireland is and should remain a part of the United Kingdom. If the unity of the United Kingdom means anything, the Government should be consistent and ensure that equal standards of justice apply to all parts of the United Kingdom.<br/>
The Bill reinforces and continues inferior standards of justice in Northern Ireland compared with the rest of the United Kingdom. The people there are subjected to powers of arrest, search and detention, and, above all, are deprived of the opportunity of a fair trial according to the principles and standards of justice which apply elsewhere in the United Kingdom.<br/>
The Government's excuse for that is the emergency situation in Northern Ireland. How long will the emergency last? An emergency, by its very nature, should be temporary. When this legislation was first introduced in the early 1970s, it was considered to be a temporary measure. Then it was renewed and now we are getting further measures, albeit with some amendments.<br/>
The Government have lamentably failed to solve the problems of Northern Ireland. Their cure is clearly not working. People are still being killed almost daily in Northern Ireland. To imagine that those problems will be solved by more and more repressive legislation is naive, or worse, it is to try to fool the people inside and outside the House. Those problems will never be solved simply by repressive legislation. It is about time that the Government started to look more seriously at the underlying political reasons for the insecurity and instability in Northern Ireland.<br/>
It could be argued that Northern Ireland has been an unstable entity since its inception. It has been unstable politically, economically and socially. That instability is inherent within the system and the constitution of the Province. The sooner that the Government recognise that problem and address it and work towards the peaceful reunification of Ireland the better.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend the Member for Falkirk, West (Mr. Canavan) suggested that the Bill is inadequate. I agree, but I do not agree with much of the rest of his analysis about how to begin to solve the problems of Northern Ireland. It is oversimple to suggest that a move to a united Ireland would in some way solve the problems.<br/>
Measures which allow the use of extra force to establish the authority of the state begin to make the state less acceptable to minorities which might be disenchanted and see their loyalties as lying elsewhere. We need serious measures to improve economic and social welfare in Northern Ireland. The Government's enterprise culture in Northern Ireland and the unemployment there have not assisted in that.<br/>
We need to tackle the basis of terrorism in Northern Ireland. Emergency powers may be necessary in certain periods, but other factors are more important.<br/>
Next week, the House will debate Northern Ireland appropriations&#x2014;which will be like discussing Northern Ireland's budget. We can debate then matters of significance, rather than problems such as whether windows need to be fitted correctly in the Divis flats and other issues that, unfortunately, hon. Members who represent Northern Ireland constituencies sometimes choose to raise rather than bread-and-butter matters.<br/>
Democracy is difficult to achieve in the circumstances because of the need for people to share and to interconnect. Democracy in Northern Ireland in terms of a devolved Government could be possible with a Bill of Rights that guaranteed minority rights. In certain circumstances, Protestants can find themselves in the minority and feel oppressed, just as Catholics do&#x2014;although their experience in that respect may be greater. That is why we must introduce measures such as fair employment legislation.<br/>
Even more important is the need to encourage all those brave people in Northern Ireland who take a stand against terrorism and try to take the ground from under it. Earlier, I mentioned Nancy Gracey and the movement comprised of families who campaign against intimidation and terror techniques such as knee-capping. I must refer also to those who run the peace trains between Belfast and Dublin, who attempt to ensure that the line is not disrupted by IRA terrorism of the kind that we are now experiencing to some extent in this country. We should aim to share to some degree our responses with the people in Ireland.<br/>
There also exist three New Consensus groups. One operates from Northern Ireland, another from Ireland, and the third from this country. They stand for the principles of devolved government, a Bill of Rights, and integrated education. The latter should start with teacher training colleges. It is an obscenity that one such college is Protestant-controlled and that another is Catholic-controlled, and that the only integrated teacher training is at Belfast university.<br/>
There is a trade union movement that says, "Hands off my mate", which seeks to defend people against oppression. There is much that is good in Northern Ireland, and it should be promoted more.<br/>
The failure in Northern Ireland is the failure of the Northern Ireland politicians on all sides&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>

<p>&#x2014;one of whom is trying to intervene, who in essence represent sectarian divisions and do not do enough to gain support from other groups.<br/>
We should be seeing from the Democratic Unionists and the Ulster Unionists an attempt to alter their stance and gain support from the Catholic community, while the SDLP should try to gain support from the Protestant community. Only two Northern Ireland parties are


attempting to do anything of that kind, but they are finding it difficult to get any grounding. I refer to the Workers party and the Alliance party, which at least try to have a broader appeal.</p>

<p>I am sure that the hon. Gentleman does not want to mislead the House. The hon.

<p>our agreement, Mr. Deputy Speaker, I shall briefly respond to that intervention. I understand that there are two teacher training colleges, one which is essentially Catholic-influenced and the other which is Protestant-influenced&#x2014;[HON. MEMBERS: "No."] Hon. Members may correct me on the details. I understand that a third avenue for teacher training exists in the university, and is more clearly integrated. I know that some Protestants go to the Catholic-dominated teacher training college and vice versa. I know that some Protestant Members of Parliament have been to the Catholic-dominated college. Nevertheless, that influence needs to be broken down. If we are to get integration in education, it needs to begin with teacher training. Perhaps I am a little short of detailed information&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>

<p>I shall conclude my speech now. I was trying to argue that the emergency provisions could have been different if Lord Colville's full recommendations had been taken into account and that they would then have been more acceptable. Such provisions, even if they are in an ideal form, can be acceptable only if economic and social welfare, democracy, devolved government, a Bill of Rights and community involvement are taking place at the same time, because they are what takes away the grounding for terrorism and, in the end, they are more important than emergency provisions, although I realise the significance of this legislation.</p>

<p>The last Adjournment debate that I secured on the Cornish tin industry, in 1988, began at 2.26 am. It is a relief that tonight's debate is not starting quite so late.<br/>
I thank the Minister for being present. The hon. Member for St. Ives (Mr. Harris) is here and I know that the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne (Mr. Mudd) will be here shortly.<br/>
In the debate in 1988, we regretted the loss of 200 jobs in the industry. It is always tragic when jobs are lost because of the suffering that is caused, not least to the individuals involved. Tonight, we are debating the loss of 415 jobs; 415 families will be devastated.<br/>
We are probably now discussing the end, at least for the foreseeable future, of tin mining in Cornwall, purely as a result of a Government decision. It is a tragedy for those who will lose their jobs and for the surrounding communities and it is an untimely death blow to a tradition of mining in our county which goes back 2,500 years. I have no hesitation in blaming the Government for that.<br/>
I blame the Government because Carnon has been operating on the basis of a support scheme to which the Government were apparently committed and on the basis of money already promised. The Government have reneged on that commitment. They have broken their promise in a disgraceful manner, informing the company without warning late on Friday afternoon, and without letting hon. Members know what was coming.<br/>
The most extraordinary point about the decision is that it defies all logic. The Government had promised a further &#x00A3;1&#x00B7;7 million loan to the mines and RTZ was due to invest, on the back of that, a further &#x00A3;2&#x00B7;4 million, which it is withdrawing as a result of the Government's decision. Having invested &#x00A3;23 million of public funds so far, for the Government to pull out now to save &#x00A3;1&#x00B7;7 million is senseless and a tragic letdown for the people.<br/>
Let us remember that the package came about by agreement and set certain targets. The company had to keep to those targets. Had it not done so, the Government decision might have been justified, but the company did keep the targets&#x2014;indeed, it exceeded them&#x2014;so what justification can we find for the Government's decision?<br/>
The Government might have argued that they could not afford it, but that patently is not the case. Apart from anything else, the money was earmarked and the company asked for not a penny more than it had been promised.<br/>
The Government might also have argued that the company had not met its targets for cost cutting, but that is not so. The company had been successful in beating the cost reduction targets set by the Department. The break-even point in 1988 was &#x00A3;6,734 per tonne. For 1990, it was down to &#x00A3;4,340 a tonne. For the last quarter for which figures are available, it was down to &#x00A3;3,703 a tonne and it was still falling dramatically, week by week, day by day. Tin is currently being sold at &#x00A3;3,000 per tonne, so the company is getting close to the break-even point. As most analysts predict that the price of tin will rise in the next year, the company could soon be in a position to make profits once again, as it was only a few months ago.<br/>
Why would the Government not give the company a chance? The projected break-even point in the Department of Trade and Industry plan was &#x00A3;3,500 per tonne by 1993. That has already been more than surpassed, as the figures that I have given make clear, so how can the Government justify their decision? The only people who did not meet their targets were the Government themselves. When the deal was agreed, exchange rates were projected at under &#x0024;1&#x00B7;50 to the pound. If that were so today, the company would be highly profitable. If anything has failed to meet targets, it is Government economic policy.<br/>
Another possibility occurs. Perhaps the Government do not believe that the area needs the support that tin mining provides economically and socially. Perhaps they believe that the area is wealthy enough, or sufficiently full of job opportunities. Let me put the record straight. Carnon has a loyal labour force who have not received a pay rise for four years, precisely to improve the chances of making the company a success. The job losses come at a time when employment prospects in the area are particularly bleak. In the Redruth-Camborne area&#x2014;the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne, who represents the area, will seek to intervene in a moment &#x2014;unemployment is running at 15&#x00B7;7 per cent. and nearly one in four males in the area are unemployed. Unemployment in Cornwall as a whole has reached a percentage in the teens and is rising more rapidly than anywhere else in the south-west, or in almost the entire country. So it cannot possibly be that the area does not need the support that the Government were in a position and had pledged to provide.<br/>
The Government might have argued that the decision was to save taxpayers' money, but in truth they cannot justify such an argument. The costs of unemployment benefit to those losing their jobs will amount to &#x00A3;1&#x00B7;2 million per year, and the indirect knock-on effect on other jobs&#x2014;on previous occasions the Government have talked about the other jobs supported by the investment&#x2014;means that the figure is more likely to be &#x00A3;2 million per year. That discounts the loss of tax and national insurance payments. Even if we assume that not all the people will join the unemployment queues directly, it is certain that there will be no net financial gain to the Treasury.<br/>
More than that, the Government are in the process of writing off not just a &#x00A3;1&#x00B7;7 million loan but the whole &#x00A3;23 million of public money that has so far been invested in the mines. That is short-sighted, mean-minded and an ill-thought-through waste of public money.<br/>
As I speak, the water level in Wheal Jane mine is rising. As it does so, it guarantees that that mine will never be reopened. It is an extraordinary, wasteful and despicable action that the Government have taken. I refuse to accept that it saves the Treasury money in any respect. It may save the Department of Trade and Industry money, but it simply costs the Department of Social Secirity and other Departments money.<br/>
If the Government seriously argue, as they argued this morning, that they do not justify their actions in such terms and that it is not for the DTI to consider other costs, perhaps it is time for the Prime Minister or someone more broad-minded and with a little more sense to reverse the decision that has been taken.<br/>
Lastly, the Government may argue that the tin price will not pick up, that current low prices will stretch far into the future and that Cornish tin mining will never be profitable. Where is the evidence for that? I do not believe


that the decision is based on sound reasoning. It is purely political, and bad politics at that. Most analysts predict that the price of tin will rise in the next year. It is hard to argue that it will not rise sooner or later, given that most mines around the world operate at substantial losses.<br/>
Even if Ministers are right, the company believes that if the rest of the loan had been paid, the investment would have allowed South Crofty to break even within the year and would have paid for Wheal Jane to be kept on care and maintenance until a rise in the price of tin occurred. Even if we accept that the current price will not increase, there is no logic in pulling out the investment because if it had been allowed to go ahead we could still have seen the company at least on an even keel for the foreseeable future.<br/>
The company's figures might have been wrong, but those involved with the company had a lot to lose personally if the figures were wrong. Surely the betting was good enough to put in &#x00A3;1&#x00B7;7 million of Government money, which had already been promised, especially when the cost of not doing so was to write off the &#x00A3;23 million Government investment so far and to put 400 or more people on the dole at a yearly cost in excess of the &#x00A3;1&#x00B7;7 million involved. The mines could have been kept open, men could have been kept in jobs and Cornwall's tin mining tradition could have been kept alive.<br/>
For a Government who claim to favour business-like practice, they have adopted an appallingly short-sighted and extremely unbusiness-like approach. I return to my original question: what possible justification is there for their decision? I believe that there is no possible justification.<br/>
In response to my Adjournment debate in March 1988, the then Under-Secretary of State for Industry and Consumer Affairs, the hon. Member for Coventry, South-West (Mr. Butcher), said:
<q>The Government are convinced that Carnon can win through&#x2014;that is why we have continued our support&#x2014;but it will require considerable&#x2014;and I emphasise 'considerable'&#x2014;efforts by all those concerned with the company. I feel sure that this effort will be forthcoming."&#x2014;[<i>Official Report</i>, 29 March 1988; Vol. 130, c. 1064.]</q>
The truth is that the effort was indeed forthcoming. The targets were met, but the Government let us down all the same. They did not stick with it when the company and the people there stuck with it through thick and thin.<br/>
Do the Government have the courage to make the change to help now? Will they help first and foremost by reversing the decision? If not, will they at least help by suspending the loan rather than pulling out of the deal altogether? Will they at least give the company and the men the chance to come back and make it work? They should not rule that out. I know that everything will be done to protect South Crofty so that it might open again if the price of tin revives sufficiently. Will the Government at least consider renewing support if that happens? Will the Government help not just the company but also all the men who fear for their redundancy compensation, as well as the supplying firms that fear for their debts, by guaranteeing tonight that the outstanding Government loan will not be called in?<br/>
At our meeting with the Minister this morning we learned that the Government have decided only for now not to call in the loan&#x2014;apparently to see if the company will survive, subject to a satisfactory scheme. Can the Minister suggest what such a satisfactory scheme might be? What is meant by the words "satisfactory scheme"? At this morning's meeting the Minister said, "At a point in

time, if the company failed, we would have to put in a submission"&#x2014;a submission to call in the loan. That would bankrupt the company, and it could also bankrupt many of its suppliers and rule out much-needed redundancy payments for the work force. That is a crucial aspect of the Government's position.<br/>
What we were told earlier today was more worrying than the indications that had been given publicly up till then. Can the Minister give a pledge that the loan will not be called in? If the jobs do go, will the Minister help by investing the money that the DTI has already set aside in new jobs in this area&#x2014;an area of high unemployment in a county where wages are already below the national average? Will the Minister pledge to invest the money withdrawn from the mines in job creation measures for the area?<br/>
In response to my Adjournment debate in March 1988, the then Minister, the hon. Member for Coventry, South-West, said:
<q>I think I can say that Cornishmen have a good friend in the Government, and that our generosity, while not necessarily unprecedented&#x2014;that would be too strong a word &#x2014;was certainly considerable".&#x2014;[<i>Official Report</i>, 29 March 1988; Vol. 130, c. 1060.]</q>
This week, the Cornish have found out just how lacking in generosity the Government really are. They have discovered the pain of betrayal. They have discovered that they have no friend in the Government.<br/>
All Cornwall Members feel outraged by what has happened. I know that the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne wants to speak, and I look forward to his contribution.</p>

<p>I shall not repeat the arguments that the hon. Member for Truro (Mr. Taylor) has put forward so eloquently and succinctly. I endorse his every word and his every sentiment. I must however, question some of the seeming inconsistencies in the reasons given by the Department of Trade and Industry over the past 10 days for its decision to end support.<br/>
It has been said that the depressed price of tin is a factor. Yet, as has been pointed out by the hon. Member for Truro, the Government's friends in the City&#x2014;the commodity analysts&#x2014;have come up with a totally different prediction. It is amazing that the DTI will accept some advice from these people but, when it suits, reject other advice.<br/>
It has been suggested that the DTI's precipitate decision was based on an unseemly scramble for safety when it was pointed out that, as Carnon Consolidated was technically insolvent, the Department would be acting illegally in making any more money available.<br/>
There are two basic tests of insolvency. The first is cash flow&#x2014;the ability to pay debts as they fall due. Certainly, for the last three years Carnon has paid all its bills on time, and it continues to do so. It therefore cannot be argued that Carnon is insolvent on that score. On the basis of the second test&#x2014;whether liabilities exceed assets&#x2014;the company is technically insolvent because it has &#x00A3;31 million of loans on the balance sheet. However, this peculiar status was arrived at through the DTI's suggested rescue package of 1986. So if that technical argument is put forward, the Department made it inevitable that the company would operate while insolvent and quite improperly advanced it


&#x00A3;23 million. Either way, it seems that over a period of four years there was a leisurely acceptance or accommodation of convenience, which culminated in a mad-dash disengagement decision&#x2014;a decision taken, and announced, on the evening of 22 February.<br/>
I may be a simple soul, but I see a possible scenario which might explain that strange situation. The Treasury wants immediate savings from the DTI; the DTI looks at its books, and Carnon emerges as the most convenient instant victim. The DTI does not want to pull the plug, but is reminded that the alleged failure to comply with the package gives it a let-out. Of course, if the DTI still wants to carry on with the finance, a word to the Public Accounts Committee might be awkward and embarrassing. Afraid of the Treasury heavies on one side and the PAC nasties on the other, the DTI rushes into instant disengagement. Whether that is fact or fantasy, time alone will tell&#x2014;I suspect that we shall not know tonight.<br/>
Something else nauseates me about the Department's attitude and position. It claims that, six months ago, it was beginning to consider suspending support to Carnon. In six months it could have at least prepared contingency plans to offset the predicted loss of jobs and the already recognised worsening economic situation in Cornwall, but it did not and still has not. It claims that since west Cornwall already gets every permitted form of assistance, everything possible is already being done.<br/>
Even now, I would like my hon. Friend's assurance that he will consider a few suggestions. First, that the withdrawal of finance should be regarded as a moratorium on payment rather than a cut-off. Secondly, that during that moratorium, the Department of Trade and Industry loans will be restructured to be of a low principal, high premium nature, thus getting the loan off the balance sheet and opening the door to external investment if that is what the Department wants. Thirdly, that during the moratorium, the Department will help meet the costs of keeping South Crofty's pumps operating. Fourthly&#x2014;the hon. Member for Truro (Mr. Taylor) touched on this&#x2014;if &#x00A3;1 million or &#x00A3;1&#x00B7;6 million is theoretically being saved, it is money that has already been allocated to jobs and industries in west Cornwall. I would like an assurance that that money will be allocated immediately to the regeneration, sustaining and attraction of more industrial opportunities in west Cornwall.<br/>
In the meantime, for reasons that have still not been explained to my satisfaction or that of many other people, two tin mines, more than 400 jobs, countless small enterprises and the communities that lie between Camborne, Redruth and Truro are under a death threat because, if I am correct, the DTI is scuttling away from what it fears could have been an embarrassing squeeze between the Treasury and the Public Accounts Committee.<br/>
As I waited to see my noble Friend the Minister for Industry, I picked up a brochure in the lobby of the Department of Trade and Industry. It lists its objectives, thus:
<q>Our objectives will be to produce a climate which promotes enterprise and prosperity. In all our work we will take account of the differing circumstances of the region and of the inner cities to enable those who live there to help themselves.</q>

Once, that remark would have caused a ripple of ironic laughter in Cornwall, but tonight, tragically, there is no laughter in Cornwall's mining communities.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Truro (Mr. Taylor) and my hon. Friend the Member for Falmouth and Camborne (Mr. Mudd) are much concerned about the state of Cornish tin mining and the effect on the local economy. I regret the current situation, and appreciate their concern. I pay tribute to the assiduous way in which they argue on behalf of their constituents. I also pay tribute to the assiduous manner in which my hon. Friend the Member for St. Ives (Mr. Harris), who is present tonight, acts on behalf of his constituents.<br/>
The Department has strongly supported the South Crofty mine in Camborne and the Wheal Jane mine near Truro since 1986. Geology has made Cornwall a land of great beauty. Likewise, geology gave it great mineral wealth. That has been exploited over the years for arsenic, copper, tin, and china clay. I understand the pride Cornishmen feel in their mineral industries, and the way "Cousin Jacks" have spread their mining skills around the world. Trade in metals has long been international. Today, international competition is at the root of the Cornish tin problems.<br/>
Hon. Members have expressed concern at the number of jobs lost. Until the recent redundancies, Carnon Holdings Limited employed 415 workers, 160 of whom were to be made redundant anyway from the closure of Wheal Jane announced last year and reductions at South Crofty. The extra number of tin miners losing their jobs is therefore about 255. Most of the workers live in the Camborne and Truro travel-to-work areas. We are advised that some 150 workers are being re-engaged temporarily to run down the South Crofty-related operations on to a care and maintenance basis.<br/>
These people have worked hard, justifying the position taken by the Department in 1986 when it offered Carnon, then owned by RTZ, a loan of &#x00A3;15 million. In 1988, at the time of the management buy-out, the &#x00A3;15 million loan was continued and a further &#x00A3;10 million loan was offered. Both loans are interest-free. Repayments are due only if profits rise above a threshold, so the management buy-out received further substantial advantages. The loans were for a project of capital works to lower costs, but they were not automatic. To safeguard the taxpayer, the Department had to be satisfied about the future viability of the company&#x2014;I stress those words.<br/>
As part of the management buy-out in 1988, RTZ offered an interest-free loan of &#x00A3;10 million. In all, the Department has lent Carnon &#x00A3;23&#x00B7;35 milion, and RTZ &#x00A3;7&#x00B7;7 million. Under the buy-out, a workers' trust received 20 per cent. of Carnon's equity. It also has a seat on the board. Two non-executive directors served on the board for a period. In spite of all this, the company has been unable to achieve what it set out to do when the loans were offered to the buy-out in 1988.<br/>
In January 1990, the tin price was &#x00A3;4,000 per tonne, although the previous year, 1989, it had averaged &#x2013;5,300. There was concern that the tin price had shown no sign of recovery even though experts had been taking bullish


views late in 1989. By the end of 1990, the price had not even maintained its January 1990 level. On the contrary, it had dropped to &#x00A3;2,900.<br/>
From early 1990 therefore, the company's officials sought to bring new equity and other finance into the Carnon group. Their aim was to gain a buffer to secure the tin business's long-term future. They sought our help in this. We agreed in principle that, as one element of any acceptable deal, we would restructure our loans.<br/>
In the middle of last year, it was apparent to us that, without additional finance, tin mining on the then proposed basis was no longer viable. I remind hon. Members of the stress that I laid on the viability of the company. We were therefore compelled to declare the project in jeopardy. Under the loan agreement, this meant that we were not obliged to make further loan advances. Nevertheless, despite serious and growing doubts about the project's future, we took the view that a prospect of loan repayment remained and, at the company's request, we advanced more money during the second half of 1990. We advanced another &#x00A3;400,000 to the company and RTZ more than &#x00A3;800,000 to give the company every chance successfully to finalise its negotiations to raise further equity finance. However, in spite of its efforts, it was, in the event, unable to do so.<br/>
Given this situation, and after careful study of Carnon's latest plans, we had to conclude that the project was not viable in the longer term. I stress that this was a decision that took account of all relevant facts, including payment of the remainder of the DTI and RTZ loans.<br/>
Today&#x2014;as I have shown, we have been here before&#x2014;experts expect the tin price to rise, a point made by the hon. Member for Truro. The question is when, by how much, and sustained at what average level. Brazilian producers increased their output from around 7,000 tonnes in 1978 to 44,000 tonnes in 1988. That was out of world totals of 200,000 tonnes in 1978 but only 155,000 tonnes in 1988. Prices have dropped. Other producers have had to cut their output. The upside for prices is limited by the ability of producers overseas to produce more if prices rise, and by the existence of sizeable stocks.<br/>
Costs are the other side of the picture. Tin is the company's only substantial revenue-earning activity. It

has a number of outgoings to support. Costs can vary depending on how much is spent on capital works and how much is spent on mine development necessary to replenish reserves of ore as they are consumed. It should be possible to cut costs per tonne in the short term at the expense of the longer term. The analysis of South Crofty's position is certainly not straightforward. Moreover, many other tin producers have been under the same acute pressure to reduce their costs. Carnon's efforts, including the wage deals accepted by the workers, have not therefore given Carnon the relative advantage for which one might have hoped.<br/>
All those and other factors were studied before we decided that it would not be a proper use of public funds to advance more money for the project. I hope that I have convinced the House that we have made every effort to secure the future of the Cornish tin industry&#x2014;short of spending taxpayers' money in a financially improper way.<br/>
Hon. Members raised some wider issues about Cornwall. Despite our five years of support, we have been accused in the local press and elsewhere of bad faith and of ignoring the needs of Cornwall&#x2014;a point made by the hon. Member for Truro. I accept that unemployment in parts of Cornwall is&#x2014;as regrettably it is elsewhere&#x2014;far too high. My hon. Friend the Member for Falmouth and Camborne made that point. Trying to keep unemployment down by sustaining jobs in uneconomic areas of activity is no answer. It has been tried before&#x2014;in steel, shipbuilding and the motor industry. Inevitably it failed.<br/>
The only answer is to provide jobs producing goods and services that people want to buy and to do so at a profit. For that reason, my Department tries to help business to improve its competitiveness. We have done much in Cornwall in recent years to that end. In the past two years, more than 1,000 Cornish businesses have sought our help under the enterprise initiative. More than 330 small companies have received a total of more than &#x00A3;2 million in support under regional enterprise grant schemes, and &#x00A3;3&#x00B7;5 million in regional selective assistance has been offered. We will continue to give all the regional aid help that we can.</p>
