<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2009-06-22a.629.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2015" speakername="Patrick Cormack" colnum="629"  time="015:17:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090622/debtext/90622-0003.htm#0906222000163">
	<p pid="a.629.1/1">Yes, I was there.</p>
	<p pid="a.629.1/2">Speaker Lenthall said, &quot;I have neither eyes to see, nor mouth to speak but as this House shall direct me, whose servant I am.&quot; An inconspicuous man, a man who rose to the occasion and who underlines in those famous words both the duty and the limitations of the Speaker, because so many things can only be done as this House directs.</p>
	<p pid="a.629.1/3">I would very much like to see the business of this House in the hands of a business Committee, with a majority from the Opposition Benches and with the Speaker presiding; but that can only happen if this House directs. I would like to see Select Committee Chairmen elected by the same system that we shall use later this afternoon; but that can only happen if this House directs.</p>
	<p pid="a.629.1/4">There are certain things that a new Speaker can, and in my view should, do. First, I would like to take a tighter grip of parliamentary questions, particularly&mdash;if I may say so in the presence of the Prime Minister and my right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition&mdash;Prime Minister's questions. Too much of Prime Minister's questions is taken up by the gladiatorial battle across the Dispatch Box. I would cut that down at a stroke.</p>
	<p pid="a.629.1/5">I would like to feel that Members of Parliament had more opportunity to call the Government to account by giving them more opportunity for urgent questions and emergency debates. In that regard, I agree very much with many of the things said by my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1613" name="George Young">the Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir George Young)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.629.1/6">I would like to be very tough with Ministers who spill the beans outside before coming to the Dispatch Box. I believe that if they do that they should be named. I believe that would quickly bring them to heel.</p>
	<p pid="a.629.1/7">We need an Executive who are better balanced with the legislature than at the moment. Perhaps it is time for a new Dunning's motion: &quot;the power of the Crown has increased, is increasing and ought to be diminished&quot;&mdash;for &quot;Crown&quot; read &quot;Executive&quot;. We have to redress the balance and I believe that there are things that the Speaker can do, just as I believe that it is the duty of the Speaker to protect minority parties and minority interests.</p>
	<p pid="a.629.1/8">The Speaker should have no political views, but he can adopt the stance of Voltaire: &quot;I dislike what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it.&quot; From my experience in the House, I know very well how much I depended on catching Mr. Speaker Wetherill's eye when I was speaking against the hated poll tax and when I was moving amendments to try to preserve the Greater London council. I know how much I depended on Madam Speaker Boothroyd allowing me to catch her eye when I was conducing an often unpopular&mdash;on my own side&mdash;campaign against the then Government's policy in Bosnia. I know what Back Benchers need from that Chair.</p>
	<p pid="a.629.1/9">It has been very sad to see Parliament so vulnerable in recent weeks. There was a time when Members of Parliament eagerly scanned the press to see if their speeches were reported. Now they apprehensively scan the press to see if their expenses are commented on. We have to redress that balance.</p>
	<p pid="a.629.1/10">I have a passionate belief in democracy. I have four grandchildren and I want them to feel that this place is indeed the ultimate defender of their liberties and the guardian of their hopes and future, because the real poor are those who have no hope. I hope that many young people from their generation will aspire to sit in this House, to serve the people of this country.</p>
	<p pid="a.629.1/11">I submit myself to the will of the House.</p>

	<p pid="a.635.4/1"><i> (standing on the upper step)</i>: Thank you. My first pleasant duty is warmly to thank on behalf of us all Alan Williams for the magnificent and good-humoured way in which he has conducted this election. It has been a very long day, and those of you expecting a customarily lengthy diatribe will be sorely disappointed.</p>
	<p pid="a.635.4/2">I should like to thank and pay a heartfelt tribute to all of the candidates who stood in this election. It has been a constructive debate that we have enjoyed over the last few weeks. I confess that I have the highest regard for all the other candidates; each brought something to the occasion; each had a contribution to make; and I can honestly say that each made that contribution in the most sincere and constructive fashion to the great and continuing benefit of this House.</p>
	<p pid="a.635.4/3">Colleagues, you will understand that my thoughts at this time are, above all, with my family: my wife, Sally, our three very young children, Oliver, Freddie and Jemima, not to mention my beloved mother, who has been keenly interested in the proceedings.</p>
	<p pid="a.635.4/4">Colleagues, you have just bestowed upon me the greatest honour that I have enjoyed in my professional life. I thank you from the bottom of my heart for the confidence that you have placed in me, and I am keenly aware of the obligations into which I now enter. I just want to say this about the responsibility of the office.</p>
	<p pid="a.635.4/5">I said only a few hours ago in my speech that. if elected, a Speaker has a responsibility immediately and permanently to cast aside all his or her previous political views. I said it&mdash;<i> [Interruption.]&mdash;</i>and I meant it. My commitment to this House is to be completely impartial as between members of one political party and another. That is what it is about, and I will do my best, faithfully and honourably and effectively, to serve this House in the period ahead.</p>
	<p pid="a.635.4/6">We have faced quite the most testing times. It has been a gruelling experience. Many Members feel very sore and very vulnerable, but large sections of the public also feel angry and disappointed. We do have to reform, but I just want to say that I continue to believe that the vast majority of Members of this House are upright, decent, honourable people who have come into politics not to feather their nests, but because they have heeded the call of public service. They want to serve their constituents, to make a difference and to improve the lot of their fellow citizens in this country, and for such people I shall always have the highest respect. It is on that basis, with that conviction, and in that spirit that I shall seek to discharge my obligations in this office, which&mdash;as I have said&mdash;I regard it as the greatest privilege of my professional life to occupy.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2009-06-22a.636.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1997" speakername="Gordon Brown" speakeroffice="The Prime Minister"  colnum="636"  time="020:37:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090622/debtext/90622-0004.htm#09062253000089">
	<p pid="a.636.0/1">Mr. Speaker-Elect, let me say on behalf of the whole House that it gives me the greatest pleasure to offer you the warmest congratulations on your election as the 157th Speaker of the House of Commons. You join a long and prestigious history of Speakers who have all shared this moment in the election process. For now, however, you await confirmation by the monarch.</p>
	<p pid="a.636.0/2">The House will know that, having received royal approval, the longest sitting Speaker held this great office for 33 years. Sir John Popham, however, was not so fortunate. He was the shortest-serving Speaker ever elected by this House. He might have been acceptable to his fellow Members, but he was not acceptable to the monarch. Let us hope that tonight you follow in the tradition of the longest-serving Speaker.</p>
	<p pid="a.636.0/3">In our election of the Speaker, the House is carrying out one of its most important responsibilities. The public are today looking to see whether we mean to change, and I believe that it was made clear in all the speeches made by all the candidates for the office of the new Speaker that we have taken an important step in that process of change. So let me also pay tribute, on behalf of all Members of this House, to all Members who were prepared to put their names forward as candidates for this great office, and to the high quality of their speeches today. We should draw confidence from the knowledge that all 10 candidates were clearly driven by their desire to do what is best for this House and, by so doing, to do what is best for the public and those who we serve, and I thank them all.</p>
	<p pid="a.636.0/4">Let me also thank my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1864" name="Alan Williams">the Member for Swansea, West (Mr. Williams)</phrase>, who ensured today that the election was carried out under new procedures, and did so with his customary charm, dignity and fairness.</p>
	<p pid="a.636.0/5">Mr. Speaker-Elect, all of us in this House know that you bring great personal strengths, and integrity and independence, to the office to which we have elected you. Your deep and passionate concern for children's issues, especially for those of children with learning disabilities, has been warmly welcomed right across this House. Your interest in helping those in greatest need, not only here in Britain but in helping some of the poorest people on our planet, has been a mark of your distinction in this House. In your co-chairing of the all-party parliamentary group on Burma, you have demonstrated your commitment to democracy in every part of the world. You said that you had now cast aside all your past political views; some of us thought you had done that some time ago. You are, of course, highly respected as a professional tennis coach; for ever now, you have moved to the position of umpire. Your commitment in your speech today was to change. You will bring strength of character and purpose to our House and all of us will wish you to succeed as you discharge your responsibilities in a spirit of fairness and responsibility.</p>
	<p pid="a.636.0/6">This House has faced great moments of difficulty and great moments of challenge. Today, we have the opportunity to begin a new chapter with a new Speaker. Today we have heard that every candidate for the office has understood that Parliament must reform. We have shown today also that we can cross party divisions in our choice of Speaker, and I believe this country will also want us to work together in the same spirit as we set about reforming and changing our politics in this great House and creating a new system of transparency and accountability that should take immediate effect.</p>
	<p pid="a.636.0/7">Undoubtedly, the road ahead will not be easy, but with your leadership and integrity, this House has begun along the path to renewal. Mr. Speaker-Elect, this House, I know, joins me in congratulating you on the highest of distinctions and thanks you for taking up the greatest of responsibilities in this House of Commons. Congratulations.</p>
