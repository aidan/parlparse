<p>Has the Minister any idea of how many married women there are who would gladly turn to teaching but who find it financially not worth while because of tax aggregation and the lack of suitable tax allowances for the additional expenses in which they would be involved?

<p>May I press this matter? Many of us who are in touch with organisations of professional women, university women, and so forth, are constantly told that this is a real problem. Does the Minister realise that it applies to teachers and to other persons working in education? Does he recall that I have on previous occasions suggested that something should be done, for instance, about the school dental service, which is, as he knows, so shockingly behindhand that, if there are any women dentists who could help, they ought not to be deterred, as they might well be, by the circumstances to which my hon.

<p>Can the Minister give us some idea how he is to conduct these inquiries, because it surely must be rather difficult to know how many parents in future will be liable? Therefore, should not he decide this on the matter of principle rather than on a matter of statistical computation?

<p>Has my right hon.

<p>Is the Minister aware that there is deep concern&#x2014;I hope, on all sides&#x2014;that this means that &#x00A3;1&#x00BD; million of public money has gone down the drain?

<p>The fact is that since the Iron and Steel Act, 1953, the offer by the purchasers, Messrs, Duport, Ltd., has been the only firm offer received by the Agency. I should have thought that it was generally agreed that what a company is worth, apart from its break-up value, is governed by what it can earn. The undoubted fact&#x2014;the right hon. Gentleman will know the figures&#x2014;is that over recent years the company's profit-earning capacity has been most unfortunate. Indeed, over the last seven years its average profit after depreciation but before interest and taxation was only just over &#x00A3;19,000 and in both 1958 and 1959 it made losses, in the first year of &#x00A3;176,000 and in the second year of &#x00A3;53,000.</p>

<p>I will not dispute that Duport's, a reputable firm, has paid what it thinks is a fair and full price for the purchase, but that does not absolve the Minister from being responsible for the fact that over &#x00A3;3 million of public money was put into this concern and that, therefore, we have lost &#x00A3;1&#x00BD; million.

<p>Certainly, if the right hon. Gentleman has any further specific questions to ask, I will do my best to answer them. The fact is that the purchase price was governed largely by


the trading profits and losses in the last two years of the company. I should have thought that this was one of the main factors to be taken into consideration.</p>

<p>Is the hon. Gentleman aware that there is grave public anxiety about the adequacy of the consideration not only in this case but in other recent cases?

by the end of this Parliament.<br/>
That certainly includes Richard Thomas &amp; Baldwins. But, as my right hon.

<p>As the Chancellor's Answer means that many firms now wholly owned by the Agency are to have a respite and will not be sold for same time to come, will he instruct the Iron and Steel Holding and Realisation Agency that it is the sole owner of these concerns and that it will not do for Ministers to say that they are selling them for a song because their profits have gone down?

<p>I am certain that the Agency is aware of its duties in this matter. In the matter of sales one has to pay regard to the interests of the concerns themselves, and in this case I believe that it is to the interest of the concern that it should be sold. In this case I think the Agency acted correctly. The point is that when these firms are handed back to private enterprise the State still gets over half the profits they make.</p>

<p>Do I gather from the right hon. and learned Gentleman that Richard Thomas &amp; Baldwins, under public ownership, is doing so well, and is expanding in contrast to its competitors in private ownership, that he has come to the conclusion that no national purpose would be served by disposiing of it?</p>

<p>No, that is not at all the inference to be drawn. The fact is that the company would have to find substantial sums for its development in addition to the figure of &#x00A3;150 million already mentioned. There is to be a loan of about &#x00A3;70 million from the Ministry of Power, and the Agency has other funds, but not enough to enable this development to take place.

<p>The projects concerned are part of the longer term expansion envisaged by the industry itself.

<p>Is the Minister aware that the industry's plan to treble output by 1962 is encouraging false hopes of prosperity in depressed areas, while deepening the anxiety of the workers in the older established areas whose jobs are already threatened?

In those circumstances, and in view of the fact that even today one worker in seven is unemployed, on short-time or on strike against redundancy, is it not right that the motor manufacturers' miscalculations should be re-examined in the light of present conditions in order to see whether the plans which are being made are realistic?</p>

<p>asked the President of the Board of Trade how many applications have been received from industrialists contemplating the erection of factories or workshops on the Isle of Sheppey under the Distribution of Industry (Industrial Finance) Act, 1958, and the Local Employment Act, 1960; how many of these were for loans; how many were for grants; how many were for both grants and loans; and with what result.</p>

<p>Twenty applications have been received for financial assistance in Sheppey under the Distribution of Industry (Industrial Finance) Act, 1958, and Local Employment Act, 1960.

<p>Is the Minister aware that in the opinion of the people of Sheppey the assistance given is not nearly adequate or anything like they have the right to expect? Is he also aware that unemployment there is running around 7 per cent. and is increasing while at the same time industrialists who want to bring employment to the Isle of Sheppey are being told that they can receive no assistance though assistance will be granted if they go to Scotland? Will the Minister try to reverse this policy which is having a very disastrous effect on the Isle of Sheppey and is quite opposed to the promises and undertakings given when the closure of Sheerness Dockyard was announced.</p>

<p>I admit that Sheppey has been unfortunate in the large number of applications which have been rejected, but there are projects coming along, such as Abbotts Laboratories and the Elmerd Manufacturing Company's factory, which should provide several hundred jobs.

<p>Would not the Minister consider whether there has not been a

case within the meaning of Section 3 (2) of the Monopolies and Restrictive Practices Act, 1948, whereby two people have deliberately restricted the supply of newspapers in this country&#x2014;one by a straightforward commercial enterprise and the other one I will not mention&#x2014;whereby there are now only two evening newspapers left in this country&#x2014;[HON.

Will he bear in mind that Section 3 refers to goods restricted as to one-third being in the hands of two people? We are now faced with 50 per cent. of the London evening newspapers being in the hands of two people.

<p>I certainly did not say that the whole subject was not one which could be referred to the Commission.

<p>I have ordered a preliminary inquiry into this collision under the provisions of Section 465 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, and this is proceeding as expeditiously as possible.<br/>
At this stage, it appears that late on Tuesday evening, 25th October, two oil barges missed the Sharpness harbour entrance in fog and collided. They were the "Arkendale H", carrying fuel oil from Swansea to Sharpness, and the "Wastdale H", carrying petrol from Avonmouth to Sharpness. The collision resulted in an explosion and fire and breaching of the Severn Railway Bridge which carries a single line railway between Berkeley Road and Lydney. Both barges are now stranded on a sandbank some three-quarters of a mile above the damaged bridge.<br/>
Rescue measures were carried out as promptly as possible by the Gloucestershire police, assisted by port workers and volunteers. Yesterday, a search was made by an R.A.F. helicopter.<br/>
Of the eight men on board, the skippers of both vessels and the engineer of the "Arkendale H" are survivors. Two bodies have been recovered. I am sure the House will wish to join me in expressing deep sympathy with the families of those who have lost their lives.</p>

said, particularly in his sympathy for the relatives of people who lost their lives? I thank him for the statement and I hope that the House will join with him in expressing that sympathy.<br/>

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. I do not know whether you observed that on Tuesday we had two Questions to the Prime Minister, and we had two yesterday and none today. This process of Questions seems to be becoming slower and slower. Is there anything that you can do about it?</p>

<p>I am obliged to the hon. and learned Member. He gives me a cue at the end of this Session to renew my standard plea to hon. Members

to help me in making progress with Questions. Today, I suspect that the fault was largely mine in allowing too many supplementary questions, but on no occasion when I stopped a topic was there any lack of hon. Members seeking to ask them.</p>

<p>Have I not on previous occasions suggested that the Prime Minister's Questions might be brought forward? I do not suggest that they should start at No. 1 or No. 10, but that they should start at a quarter-past three. That would be reasonable. I am sure that it must be embarrassing to the Prime Minister, who is anxious to furnish information to the House, that he is prevented from doing so by an out-of-date regulation. Surely something of that sort could be done. The Prime Minister could prevent this difficulty himself if he so decided.</p>
