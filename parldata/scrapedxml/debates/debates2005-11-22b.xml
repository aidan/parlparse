	<p pid="b.1358.5/1">Is it Government policy to close community hospitals and force patients to travel 40 miles to overstretched general hospitals? Is it Government policy for primary care trusts to issue grossly misleading consultation papers, which omit costings of replacement services, and to withdraw existing hospital-based services before even the most rudimentary community alternatives are in place? If none of those are Government policy, why is the Secretary of State allowing the West Suffolk primary care trust to do all three in my constituency now?</p>

	<p pid="b.1358.6/1">Walnuttree hospital has a building that was constructed in 1836 and has already had &pound;300,000 invested in it to bring it up to the standard required by fire safety regulations, albeit temporarily. West Suffolk PCT is dealing with that and it does not believe that the hospital can offer the quality of care that the modern NHS should provide. As the hon. Gentleman said, it is consulting about alternative proposals that will offer modern intermediate care and ancillary care to his constituents and others in the locality. The consultation has been extended at the request of the local overview and scrutiny committee until <phrase class="date" code="">12 December</phrase>. No final decisions have therefore been made.</p>

	<p pid="b.1363.7/1">Will my right hon. Friend issue instructions to the external panel on this issue? Many of us support having a review to save management and associated costs, so that the money can be passed to the front line. But given that the average number of patients in a west midlands PCT is 230,000, we regard with great difficultly the proposed figure of 730,000 patients for a shire county area. Such a PCT will not be local, and because we will need area managers, the funding savings that we are looking for will not be made.</p>

	<p pid="b.1371.1/1">With permission, Mr. Speaker, I should like to make a statement about seasonal flu vaccine.</p>
	<p pid="b.1371.1/2">Five years ago, we decided to give higher priority to protecting the health of the public from winter flu. We introduced the annual seasonal flu vaccination programme and we targeted those at increased risk from seasonal flu&mdash;people aged 65 and over, and younger people in certain clinical risk groups as identified by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation. This is an annual programme, because each year new strains of flu can emerge and therefore the flu vaccines need to be reformulated accordingly. In this way, each year's vaccine provides the best protection against the influenza virus currently circulating.</p>
	<p pid="b.1371.1/3">Since the programme was introduced in the winter of 2000&ndash;01, vaccination uptake in people aged 65 and over has increased year on year. In the first year of the targeted programme, just over 65 per cent. of elderly patients were vaccinated. Last year 71.5 per cent. of those aged 65 and over received the seasonal flu vaccine&mdash;some 5.2 million people&mdash;and in addition 1.2 million younger people in the clinical risk groups were vaccinated.</p>
	<p pid="b.1371.1/4">The responsibility for ordering seasonal flu vaccine and administering the vaccine has always fallen on general practitioners. GPs order their own supply of vaccine, based on the number of eligible patients on the register, and make contractual arrangements with any of the six manufacturers who supply flu vaccine to the UK. In addition to the GP orders, the Department of Health purchases a stock of flu vaccine each year as part of our contingency planning measures. We hold that for emergency use, in case GPs run into difficulties with vaccine supply.</p>
	<p pid="b.1371.1/5">We routinely meet representatives from the UK vaccine industry group at the beginning of each year to inform the industry of how much seasonal flu vaccine will be required in the UK. This is based on the numbers of people covered by the current Department of Health policy. This year, the estimated production total from all UK vaccine manufacturers was over 14 million doses&mdash;more than ever before, and sufficient to immunise 100 per cent. of those in the targeted groups, in other words the elderly and younger people in clinical risk groups, as set out in the letter from the chief medical officer to the NHS in July.</p>
	<p pid="b.1371.1/6">In late October, however, we began to hear anecdotal evidence that some GPs were facing a shortage of flu vaccine. In order to assess the potential problem, officials wrote on <phrase class="date" code="">3 November</phrase> to the flu immunisation co-ordinators of all the primary care trusts. That letter reminded them of the priority groups for flu vaccination and how additional stocks of vaccine could be ordered from the Department of Health contingency stock, should extra supplies be required by practices in their area.</p>
	<p pid="b.1371.1/7">The current problems may be due to a combination of factors, such as possibly the under-ordering of vaccine on the one hand, and possibly vaccination of the worried well on the other. It also seems likely that awareness of the need for flu vaccinations is higher this year, due in part to the very high level of media interest in the threat of avian flu in birds and of pandemic flu.</p>
	<p pid="b.1371.1/8">We do not, of course, expect seasonal flu vaccine to protect people against bird flu or pandemic flu, but I stress that seasonal flu vaccine is important for people aged 65 and over and for the clinical risk groups and that high uptake in those groups is to be welcomed. We need to ensure that GPs prioritise their remaining stocks of flu vaccine to help those who will really benefit most&mdash;in other words, people aged 65 and over and younger people in the clinical risk groups. Officials wrote to influenza immunisation co-ordinators to that effect yesterday.</p>
	<p pid="b.1371.1/9">The Department is also helping GPs by releasing flu vaccine from the contingency stock that we have purchased. We have taken orders against that stock, and deliveries are already being made and will continue into December. There is, of course, exceptionally high demand globally for flu vaccine, despite which the Department has been able to secure an additional 200,000 doses of flu vaccine on top of the 400,000 dose contingency reserve that we have already obtained. The additional 200,000 doses will be delivered in January. We are also discussing with manufacturers whether additional supplies can be made available, over and above those additional 200,000 doses, and if so, when those stocks would be available.</p>
	<p pid="b.1371.1/10">In previous years, the GP-led arrangement that I have described has, on the whole, worked well. In view of what has happened this year, however, I am reviewing the arrangements currently in place for the seasonal flu vaccination programme and will consider this matter urgently.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2005-11-22b.1372.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1476" speakername="Andrew Lansley" colnum="1372"  time="015:31:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051122/debtext/51122-05.htm#51122-05_spnew4">
	<p pid="b.1372.2/1">Happily, not everybody, but one person missed in the at-risk group is one person too many. The hon. Gentleman and the rest of the House should know that, even where that has not yet happened, it will happen because supplies are running out, and we have not completed the period during which the highest levels of immunisation occur.</p>
	<p pid="b.1372.2/2">The Secretary of State did not accept responsibility. She should have done so, but she did not. The delivery of the influenza immunisation programme is the Government's responsibility. It is not good enough that she has come to the House to blame general practitioners for the failure of the programme. Not only has she failed to apologise, she has not even remotely begun to explain what has gone wrong. If the House will forgive me, let us start with the actual figures.</p>
	<p pid="b.1372.2/3">First, the Secretary of State underestimated the success of the flu immunisation programme. Her own Department's figures suggest that, in 2004&ndash;05, a 71.5 per cent. vaccine uptake among the over-65 population in England amounted to 5.9 million people immunised&mdash;not the 5.2 million that she set out. However, she did not refer to the overall figures on vaccine uptake. Uptake was 71.5 per cent. in England, 68.1 per cent. in Scotland and 62 per cent. in Wales. For risk groups below 65 years old, the comparable figures were 42.6 per cent. in England, 39.3 per cent. in Scotland and just 25 per cent. in Wales.</p>
	<p pid="b.1372.2/4">The Secretary of State did not make comparisons clearly between what has happened in previous years and what is happening this year. On <phrase class="date" code="">26 October</phrase> last year, her noble Friend Lord Warner told another place:</p>
	<p pid="b.1372.2/5" class="indent">&quot;The Government made sure that there were around 14 million doses of flu vaccine available for this year&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="b.1372.2/6">he was speaking of last winter, not this&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="b.1372.2/7" class="indent">&quot;despite the problems in the Speke factory, which are well known&mdash;compared with 12 million administered last year.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> <phrase class="date" code="2004-10-26">26 October 2004</phrase>; Vol. 665, c. 1174.]</p>
	<p pid="b.1372.2/8">That implies that the number of doses that the Department of Health has made available this year&mdash;14 million&mdash;is the same as the number for the previous year.</p>
	<p pid="b.1372.2/9">The letter that the Department of Health sent to general practitioners yesterday referred on the one hand to 11 million people in the at-risk groups and on the other to the 14 million doses of seasonal flu vaccine that were available. Unfortunately, the 11 million people refers to England, but the 14 million doses refers to the United Kingdom. It would have been more accurate to talk of about 14 million people in the at-risk groups and 14 million doses of influenza vaccine.</p>
	<p pid="b.1372.2/10">The Secretary of State did not point out in her statement that, although the Department of Health met manufacturers early this year to agree that 13.4 million doses of vaccine would be available&mdash;it subsequently procured a contingency supply of 400,000, which I accept is routinely the same each year&mdash;it agreed at a later stage that the at-risk groups would include people with chronic liver disease, who had not previously been included. It also agreed that the recommended groups would include main carers with responsibility for the care of elderly and disabled people who would be at risk if their carers were to become ill. The Department has no figures on the likely number of such people, but it means that perhaps millions of carers might have gone to their GP surgeries this winter to try to get flu jabs and then received them appropriately, although that would not have been the case in previous years.</p>
	<p pid="b.1372.2/11">Those are the figures&mdash;the Secretary of State might have had the courtesy to tell us what they were&mdash;and the facts about the extension of recommended groups this year compared with previous years. The House will understand that, broadly speaking, the available vaccine supply did not increase, whereas the number of recommended groups did. The prospect of a great deal of speculation about avian flu in the autumn certainly should have led the Department to be aware at an earlier stage about the desirability of being prepared for a much greater take-up of flu vaccine among people in the recommended groups than in previous years.</p>
	<p pid="b.1372.2/12">Let me ask the Secretary of State several questions about what was done. When carers were added to the recommended groups for vaccination, was the number of doses of vaccine that was intended to be supplied increased from 13.4 million? When the British Medical Association told the Department of Health in October&mdash;this was not just anecdotal, as the Secretary of State said&mdash;that it had concerns about the availability of vaccine, what did the Department do?</p>
	<p pid="b.1372.2/13">The Secretary of State will recall that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1478" name="Tony Wright">the hon. Member for Cannock Chase (Dr. Wright)</phrase> made it clear on <phrase class="date" code="">17 October</phrase> that he, for one, had gone to his surgery and been told not only that he could not have his flu jab on the day of his visit, but that he would not receive it until the end of November, at the earliest. What did she do after <phrase class="date" code="">17 October</phrase>, given that we have now arrived at <phrase class="date" code="">22 November</phrase> and we have a crisis? When a manufacturing company ran out of supply in late October and told the Department about that, what did the Department do?</p>
	<p pid="b.1372.2/14">When did the Department find out the new figures on uptake? Responses to parliamentary questions said that the uptake figures were due in the Department on <phrase class="date" code="">14 November</phrase>. The Department talked to the UK vaccine industry group on <phrase class="date" code="">16 November</phrase>&mdash;six days ago&mdash;and asked for additional supplies. Health Ministers did not have the courtesy to tell the House about the lack of availability of supply, even though they had talked to the industry about it. However, they must have talked to the industry because they knew the uptake figures on <phrase class="date" code="">14 November</phrase>. What are the figures and how do they compare with those for previous years?</p>
	<p pid="b.1372.2/15">What is the Government's evidence that general practitioners have been vaccinating what the Secretary of State cares to call the worried well&mdash;people outside the recommended groups? The BMA certainly has no evidence that that is the case and the Scottish Executive do not tell the public and the BMA that it is the problem in Scotland. The Secretary of State might care to explain why general practitioners should vaccinate people who are not in the recommended groups, as they have no financial incentive from the NHS to do that&mdash;they are not paid by the NHS to do it&mdash;and would be out of pocket from buying the vaccine were they to do so.</p>
	<p pid="b.1372.2/16">The Secretary of State has not told the House the figures. She has not explained to the House when the Government knew about the implications of changes this year in the uptake of vaccine and in the number of groups recommended. The consequence of all those changes has been our constituents visiting GP surgeries seeking flu vaccinations and being unable to get them. What estimate does she have of the number of people who will at the end of this immunisation season be un-immunised? What justification does she have for coming to the House and instead of taking what is in truth her responsibility for the flu immunisation programme seeking to blame general practitioners?</p>

	<p pid="b.1379.0/1">My right hon. Friend will recall that I gave her some anecdotal evidence about the matter in this House on <phrase class="date" code="">17 October</phrase>, and she asked her officials to make sure that there was not a problem of the kind that I described, which was the appropriate ministerial response. As she has said, however, we still do not know what has happened, which is a problem and a puzzle. People such as me were asking whether it was likely that demand for seasonal flu vaccine would increase because of the attention paid to avian flu, but did the Department factor that point into its calculations? If there is a question about the vaccinating practices of GPs, is there any check on whether they are giving the vaccine to priority groups only?</p>

	<p pid="b.1379.1/1">My hon. Friend raises important points. He refers to the problem that he had encountered, which he mentioned to me on <phrase class="date" code="">17 October</phrase>. After that, I checked with the Department and established that there had indeed been delays because of production problems with one manufacturer. Those problems were overcome and the delayed supplies were then delivered to the GPs who had ordered them. We also put in place a national audit process so that we could track exactly what was happening. GPs regularly provide information to their primary care trusts, mostly through the computer system, on the numbers of people in the at-risk groups whom they have vaccinated. I gave those figures and proportions to the House.</p>
	<p pid="b.1379.1/2">If somebody who is not in an at-risk group asks for a flu vaccination because they think that it might be a good thing to have this year, perhaps because of the publicity that they have read about avian flu, that does not mean that a GP necessarily should or will give a vaccination to that person. GPs are not required to report to PCTs on vaccinations given to people who fall outside the at-risk groups, although those figures might become available later in the year when they claim reimbursement for such vaccinations. We have stressed&mdash;we did it again in the letter that went to GPs&mdash;the need to focus on the priority groups. Those people are most in need and will most benefit from the vaccine. Given the shortages that have arisen in so many GP practices, it is absolutely essential that supplies are reserved for those groups.</p>

I suppose that I qualify, having had a tumour removed and a heart bypass. I am having a tumour removed and I am having a heart bypass. I have a lot to thank the national health service for, and I rise to support it again. I have heard the figures. Will my right hon. Friend confirm that in the last year of the Tory Government there were 6 million flu jabs, yet this year there have been a record 14 million flu jabs?

	<p pid="b.1392.5/1">I did not say that there is no case for reform. Of course there is, as there would be for any other major innovation. I am saying that the Government have completely failed to meet that case; they have completely failed to deliver the policy that is required.</p>
	<p pid="b.1392.5/2">At the beginning of the year the Government announced a major new strategy, launched by the right hon. Gentleman who is now Secretary of State for Trade and Industry. That was two Secretaries of State ago; it is difficult to keep up, as the current Secretary of State for Work and Pensions will appreciate. On <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-02">2 February</phrase>, when the Department of Work and Pensions five-year strategy was launched, the Government announced, with the hype typical of them, that they were launching the</p>
	<p pid="b.1392.5/3" class="indent">&quot;biggest change in incapacity benefits since they were created&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.1392.5/4">That sounds pretty impressive, as though the Government were at long last getting to grips with the problem, yet when we looked at what it meant in practice we found three things.</p>
	<p pid="b.1392.5/5">First, we found that all that the Government proposed to do was to publish a Green Paper&mdash;not a White Paper. One might have thought that if they had already worked out how to implement the greatest reform in incapacity benefit it would have been followed by a White Paper, which could have gone out for consultation. But no, we were promised only a Green Paper.</p>
	<p pid="b.1392.5/6">Secondly, the new policy would be implemented&mdash;if it ever was&mdash;not in 2005, or even 2006 or 2007, but in 2008, three years from now. Thirdly, the most extraordinary part of the announcement, which is, I think, still Government policy, is that all the marvellous new benefits would not apply to a single one of the 2.7 million existing IB claimants but only to new claimants.</p>
	<p pid="b.1392.5/7">In their announcement the Government said:</p>
	<p pid="b.1392.5/8" class="indent">&quot;The reformed benefit will provide enhanced financial security for the most severely sick and disabled&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1392.5/9">Very good. None the less, not one severely disabled person currently receiving the benefit will have the ghost of an opportunity to enjoy any of the new benefits. The same announcement stated that there would be</p>
	<p pid="b.1392.5/10" class="indent">&quot;more money than now for all those claimants who take part in work focused activity&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.1392.5/11">More money than now, but not for anybody receiving the benefit now. For some reason best known to the Government, no advantage will be obtained by the 2.7 million people currently in receipt of IB.</p>

	<p pid="b.1394.6/1">I understand why hon. Gentlemen wish to deflect me, but they will not succeed. Let me share with the House what has happened since that grand statement in February, promising the greatest ever reform in incapacity benefit. We were told then that there would be a Green Paper&mdash;seemingly it had to be a Green Paper, but at least it would be published in the summer&mdash;and that remained the Government's position. Indeed, after the general election the Prime Minister repeated at his first press conference that</p>
	<p pid="b.1394.6/2" class="indent">&quot;there will be a Green Paper on reform of Incapacity Benefit before the summer recess.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1394.6/3">Well, what happened to it? It never appeared. And later, in July, we were told that the timetable had slipped, and that it would be published in the autumn. And then, when asked at oral questions on <phrase class="date" code="">31 October</phrase> why the Green Paper was four months overdue, the Minister for the disabled, the Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions&mdash;<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2013" name="Anne McGuire">the hon.

	<p pid="b.1394.6/5">Well, the difference between summer and autumn is not very different from four months, but we shall put that on one side.</p>
	<p pid="b.1394.6/6">Then we had a statement by the Prime Minister on <phrase class="date" code="">16 November</phrase> that the Green Paper is not now going to be published until January of next year.

	<p pid="b.1395.5/12">On <phrase class="date" code="">Sunday 30 October</phrase>, it was reported that, following a further memo from the Prime Minister&mdash;or it may have been the same memo&mdash;the previous Secretary of State had written to the Prime Minister saying that he could not accept the last-minute, hard-line changes to incapacity benefit that were being demanded by Downing street. Apparently, the demands in the Prime Minister's own memo to the Secretary of State included replacing part of the &pound;76 per week given to incapacity benefit claimants with tokens that could only be spent on job training courses, and that incapacity benefit would be paid at jobseeker's allowance rates, which are, of course, far less than long-term incapacity benefit.</p>
	<p pid="b.1395.5/13">We will expect the new Secretary of State to indicate what truth there is in those reports. Indeed, I am happy to give way to him now. Is he willing a this very moment to come to the Dispatch Box to say that neither he nor his predecessor has received representations from the Prime Minister or from No. 10 Downing street asking for the Green Paper to be changed to become more harsh with regard to incapacity benefit? Would he care to deny that those reports are true?</p>

	<p pid="b.1398.9/1">I agree with that. I pay tribute to the work of the right hon. Gentleman in those campaigns and the good progress that has been made, with many people in all political parties sharing the same ideal and objective. However, today's debate is about a slightly different issue: the fact that in the past few years, the progress that was made has slowed down and, in some cases, has not been delivered.</p>
	<p pid="b.1398.9/2">The policy over which the Secretary of State has been asked to preside has so far failed. I accept that that is a serious charge, but there are pretty important witnesses for the prosecution. The right hon. Member for Birkenhead, a senior Labour Back Bencher and former Minister, said:</p>
	<p pid="b.1398.9/3" class="indent">&quot;The Government has lost the plot on welfare reform&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.1398.9/4">If the Secretary of State wants the view of someone who has occupied his own post, I suggest that of his immediate predecessor, the right hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside, who admitted that the system over which he presided was, to use his own delicate word, &quot;crackers&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.1398.9/5">If those are simply the views of ex-Ministers and the Secretary of State will be influenced only by those of his current colleagues, he need look no further than the Minister for Employment and Welfare Reform, the right hon. Member for Barking&mdash;<i>[Laughter.]</i> I emphasise that that is a pure coincidence. She said in her own unforgettable words when referring to the welfare system no more recently than <phrase class="date" code="">1 November</phrase>, as quoted in <i>The Herald</i> in Glasgow:</p>
	<p pid="b.1398.9/6" class="indent">&quot;So far, we have done sweet nothing.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1398.9/7">If that is the view of the Minister, we on the Conservative Benches can be forgiven for endorsing her objective assessment of the Government's record so far.</p>
	<p pid="b.1398.9/8">I conclude with a tribute to the Prime Minister, who has put his commitment to welfare reform clearly on the line. He said way back in 1996 at a Labour party conference before he became Prime Minister:</p>
	<p pid="b.1398.9/9" class="indent">&quot;By the end of a five-year term of a Labour Government&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="b.1398.9/10">that would have been 2002, three years ago&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="b.1398.9/11" class="indent">&quot;I vow&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="b.1398.9/12">not I promise or I hope or I aspire&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="b.1398.9/13" class="indent">&quot;that we will have reduced the proportion we spend on the welfare bills of social failure . . . This is my covenant with the British people. Judge me upon it. The buck stops with me&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.1398.9/14">On that basis, we invite the House to approve the motion and to condemn the Government's abysmal failure.</p>

	<p pid="b.1401.1/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend and, if he will allow me, I would like to develop that theme in a minute.</p>
	<p pid="b.1401.1/2">We have taken action to improve the quality and efficiency of the services that we provide in the Department for Work and Pensions by establishing, for example, Jobcentre Plus and the new Pension Service. That adds up to a record of substantial achievement, and it stands in stark and plain contrast to the period in which the right hon. and learned Member for Kensington and Chelsea was in office. As I said, he singularly failed to refer to that record at any point, which was probably a wise decision on his part. However, I would like to refresh his memory of one or two matters.</p>
	<p pid="b.1401.1/3">When the Opposition were in power their policies meant that unemployment reached 3 million and there was a 300 per cent. increase in the number of people claiming incapacity benefit. Between 1979 and 1997, the number of people on incapacity benefit trebled from 700,000 to 2.6 million&mdash;the equivalent of 2,000 extra claimants every single week. The Conservatives' dismal record of incompetence and failure wrecked families and communities the length and breadth of the country. They managed the extraordinary feat of creating 3 million unemployed not once but twice during their period of office&mdash;a unique achievement in 20th-century history&mdash;not that they cared very much about it. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1587" name="Michael Howard">The right hon. and learned Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Mr. Howard)</phrase>, whose own contribution was to add 1 million to the unemployment figures as Employment Secretary was quoted as saying that &quot;unemployment never matters&quot;. He will soon have the opportunity to reflect on the accuracy of his observation.</p>
	<p pid="b.1401.1/4">The Conservatives were not content with raising the number of people claiming out-of-work benefits. Child poverty doubled, leaving Britain with the worst child poverty record in Europe. What did <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1938" name="Liam Fox">they make of that? The hon. Member for Woodspring (Dr. Fox)</phrase> told the House that</p>
	<p pid="b.1401.1/5" class="indent">&quot;all we hear . . . is poverty, poverty, poverty&mdash;la, la, la, always on the one note . . . It is just boring for Conservative Members.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="1992-10-22">22 October 1992</phrase>; Vol. 212, c. 636.]</p>
	<p pid="b.1401.1/6">Last month, 51 Opposition Members voted for the hon. Gentleman to be their next parliamentary leader.</p>
	<p pid="b.1401.1/7">By 1997, one in five families had no one in work, and one in three children were growing up in poverty. No one can claim that opportunity and security were more widely distributed during the Tory years. They were not&mdash;the reverse was true. The words of the right hon. and learned Member for Kensington and Chelsea this afternoon bear no resemblance whatever to the record of his party in government. Indeed, if there is any incoherence in the House today, it concerns the difference between his words and the actions of his party in government.</p>
	<p pid="b.1401.1/8">The right hon. and learned Gentleman has a unique record, because he was a Minister for the entire period between 1979 and 1997. He cannot claim, as many of his hon. Friends have done in the past few years, that the record of the previous Government had nothing whatever to do with him. His problem is that it has everything to do with him. It is on his record that he and his hon. Friends will always be judged, not on their words. Even if he wants to airbrush the record and forget his party's contribution, we will not do so.</p>

	<p pid="b.1402.1/1">Well, we shall wait and see how many times the present Government are re-elected. The right hon. and learned Gentleman may have the opportunity to resurrect his own leadership election campaign after the next election. He made a very good appeal for last-minute support this afternoon.</p>
	<p pid="b.1402.1/2">The right hon. and learned Gentleman said that he was deeply disturbed that the welfare reform Green Paper is to be published in January. I have difficulty reconciling the words of his motion and what he said today with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1932" name="David Cameron">the comments of the hon. Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron)</phrase>&mdash;briefly the right hon. and learned Gentleman's rival and soon to be his new boss. The hon. Member for Witney said on <phrase class="date" code="">8 November</phrase> in his speech to the Centre for Policy Studies:</p>
	<p pid="b.1402.1/3" class="indent">&quot;Conservative economic empowerment&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="b.1402.1/4">that is something of an oxymoron, of course&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="b.1402.1/5" class="indent">&quot;is a long term agenda to lift more people more securely from dependency to self sufficiency. The details of our agenda will take years rather than months to develop.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1402.1/6">So there we have it. We will be publishing our proposals for welfare reform within months of being returned to office, and we are accused of incoherence. The hon. Gentleman's proposals will not see the light of day for years, and we are invited to take the view that his party has a better alternative. What complete and utter rubbish.</p>
	<p pid="b.1402.1/7">We take a very different view of these matters. The difference between our approach and the approach of the right hon. and learned Member for Kensington and Chelsea could not be clearer. We believe in a modern, active, welfare state, able to help extend opportunities to people so that they can help themselves and their families, and we have put this new approach into practice in the face of opposition from both Conservative and Liberal Democrat Members in the House. His approach, by contrast, such as we are able to discern it, is all about limiting the support and help that is on offer.</p>

	<p pid="b.1417.0/1">The Secretary of State will know that the view among Liberal Democrat Front-Bench Members has been perfectly consistent, and that we have criticised the deals struck by the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry. If he wants to enlighten us in this debate, will the right hon. Gentleman say whether he thinks that the deal that the Government have struck with some major public sector unions has been helpful to him, and to Lord Turner's commission, in moving the debate forward on this key issue?</p>

We will find out then whether his views are in line with those of the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, or whether they are more in line with those of the Prime Minister. The latter seems to be very unhappy with the deal that has been struck.</p>

	<p pid="b.1427.3/1">No; I will not give way again. I have answered the hon. Gentleman's point.</p>
	<p pid="b.1427.3/2">What we had in February this year was a five-year plan. Despite its rather Stalinist title, it gave us some indication of how the Government wish to split incapacity benefit in two: one benefit more appropriate for those who will never work, and other benefit to become a pathway back into the world of work. We did not agree with all the substance in the February paper, but it was at least reasonably specific and somewhat detailed. So imagine our surprise when, on <phrase class="date" code="">7 October</phrase> this year, we went back to what are called the &quot;Principles of Welfare Reform&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.1427.3/3">Remarkably, in eight months, the Government have gone from fairly specific proposals to very general principles. The world was rather surprised that the new policy on welfare reform was summed up in various phrases. That document says:</p>
	<p pid="b.1427.3/4" class="indent">&quot;We will create a new relationship between the individual, the family and the wider community.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1427.3/5">It continues:</p>
	<p pid="b.1427.3/6" class="indent">&quot;The Government will tackle dysfunctional behaviour head-on, and use the wider strength of neighbourliness and community to provide support through a range of interventions.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1427.3/7">What support? What interventions? We have got beyond principles; we want to know what the Government are going to do. Of course the reason why the Government are now taking refuge in vacuous and general phrases is that No. 10 has vetoed the specific proposals that the Government announced back in February.</p>
	<p pid="b.1427.3/8">Another factor in all this, of course, is the purported discontent among Labour Back Benchers, but what we need from the Government now are some answers. We want to know how the Government want to put those principles into action. Will they still pursue the split in incapacity benefit in the way that they set out back in February? We also want to know what has happened to the promised review of housing benefit. That has not been mentioned in the debate, but in the Queen's Speech, Her Majesty read out the following sentence:</p>
	<p pid="b.1427.3/9" class="indent">&quot;My Government will introduce legislation to reform support for housing costs.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1427.3/10">Will the Minister for Employment and Welfare Reform tell us when she responds to the debate how that is progressing? Her Majesty may not want to know the answer, but the House does.</p>

	<p pid="b.1428.1/1">I hope that the hon. Lady will forgive me; I must reply to some of the points made.</p>
	<p pid="b.1428.1/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1951" name="David Laws">The hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Laws)</phrase> referred to pensions. We did not hear a word on pensions from the Secretary of State, although pensions form part of both the motion and the Government's amendment. Of course the truth about pensions is that the halving of the savings ratio under the Government has dealt a body blow to the entire concept of private sector provision. The reason for that goes back, again, eight years to 1997, when in almost the Government's first fiscal action, they removed dividend tax credits from private pension funds. The Government's siphoning of money from the private sector pensions into the Treasury has gone on year after year. If the Prime Minister wants to pick a fight with a Department, I suggest that he should do so not with the Department for Work and Pensions, but with the Treasury and the Chancellor, because that is where the damage to pensions has been done.</p>
	<p pid="b.1428.1/3">In 1997, our pensions system was an acknowledged international success. We had more private sector pensions under management than the rest of Europe put together. That fact has been alluded many times by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1410" name="Frank Field">the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field)</phrase> and other hon. Members of all parties. That policy is now in ruins. Instead, the Chancellor's contribution to welfare reform&mdash;and his main legacy from the Treasury&mdash;will be a vast extension of means testing. Again, that has been alluded to in the debate. Almost half of all pensioners are now subject to means testing and the proportion is increasing. So the Treasury is responsible for not only the policy, but the shambolic administration of child and pension credits, as we know from our surgeries and advice centres, and the developing, unresolved mess that that is producing.</p>
	<p pid="b.1428.1/4">In the debate, we have seen again the wide and growing gap between Labour's words and deeds. Despite repeated promises of reform, the welfare system is complex, badly targeted and sets up perverse incentives. It is prone to error, fraud and abuse. It lets down the taxpayer and those whom it is supposed to help. We should be having an open debate on how to change the system, instead of which it is a subject of repeated wrangles and leaked memos between No. 10 and the Department. It is time that the House expressed its displeasure and dismay about this continuing state of affairs, and I urge all my hon. Friends to vote for the motion.</p>

If the Minister is now telling me that achieving the 20 per cent. is not possible&mdash;I warned him that it would be difficult&mdash;will he understand that we shall keep him to it? It may be a voluntary target, but if this country does not manage to meet it, the rest of world will believe that we have let it down on the most important issue that confronts us. The Government will not stand up and say, &quot;We're going to do it. This is how we're going to do it. These are the tests that we'll use. We'll have independent checks every year.&quot; That undermines our belief in the Government's integrity and intelligence on the matter.</p>

	<p pid="b.1452.1/1">I should like to make some progress.</p>
	<p pid="b.1452.1/2">At this point, it is worth saying a few words about what we have done in relation to our international engagement. Just as we are proud of the progress that we have made domestically, we are proud of what we have done in terms of global leadership. Making climate change one of the two key themes for the G8 focused attention on it, and the Gleneagles summit agreed on a package of measures to combat the problem, together with a new dialogue between G8 countries and emerging economies such as China and India and a statement on the importance of climate change.</p>
	<p pid="b.1452.1/3">The first meeting on the dialogue was held in London on <phrase class="date" code="">1 November</phrase>. Significantly, it was attended not just by the G8 countries, but by the five big emerging economies: India, China, Brazil, Mexico and South Africa. That is an example of the use of our facilities and influence to build an international consensus and to establish how we can work together to deal with some of the requirements of countries such as China and India.</p>
	<p pid="b.1452.1/4">The round table for G8 Energy and Environment Ministers was the first of its kind and was very successful. We hosted a major international science conference at the Hadley centre in February, which informed some of the sceptics&mdash;who, I am glad to say, are becoming fewer and fewer&mdash;about the science of climate change. Under our EU presidency, we held an informal Agriculture and Environment Ministers' council on climate change. Such a council had never been convened before. Under our presidency, an EU-China summit was held that led to an agreement with China on the pioneering and developing of clean coal technology. Of course, the Chinese will use their coal because they have huge coal reserves. Then there was the EU-India agreement. We talked to India about renewables and about the possibility of co-operating with India on, in particular, the clean development mechanism. There was also an EU-Russia agreement, which was referred to by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1815" name="Paddy Tipping">my hon. Friend the Member for Sherwood (Paddy Tipping)</phrase>. It was agreed that Russia should become the next president of the G8 and that energy efficiency would become one of its key themes. We have been involved in important international work.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2005-11-22b.1459.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1680" speakername="Norman Baker" colnum="1459"  time="020:26:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051122/debtext/51122-32.htm#51122-32_spnew9">
	<p pid="b.1459.5/1">The honest answer is that there is a lot more work to do on the proposal. We are moving towards taking radical measures to tackle climate change. A number of economists have suggested the carbon allowances approach: implementing the allowances could be achieved in a variety of ways, but none of them is particularly easy. My suggestion is that we could start with the transport sector, which is self-contained and could be ring-fenced. However, if the hon. Gentleman is asking whether we have solutions that we can distribute around the House, the answer is no, we have not.</p>
	<p pid="b.1459.5/2">Another reason why too little is being done about climate change is that it is not high enough up the political agenda. By our actions, we are trying to correct that. We could do with some help from the media&mdash;a point that I regularly make&mdash;which insist on treating climate change, if they deal with it at all, as a purely scientific matter. They give the impression that no politicians of any party, including those in the Government, have anything to say about it. I, for one, am fed up with reports on the &quot;Today&quot; programme or stories in the broadsheets that go into great detail about horrendous and apocalyptic things going on in the world but which contain no comment from any politician. That means that no Minister is put on the spot and asked what is being done about the subject of the story, and the opinions of Members of Parliament are not sought either. Such stories and reports exist in a vacuum, outside the political process, so it is not surprising that politicians do not make progress on environmental matters. I hope that the media will reform their approach to these things.</p>
	<p pid="b.1459.5/3">What should we do about policies that, collectively, are failing to deliver domestically the reaction to climate change that we need? The motion has been tabled by both Conservative and Liberal Democrats Members, and follows on from earlier debates and initiatives undertaken by myself and the right hon. Member for West Dorset. It wants to deal with the problem of climate change by putting it higher on the agenda, and telling the media that the story is political as well as simply scientific. It is designed to make it easier for the Minister and the good guys in government to argue with people who are perhaps less enlightened in other Departments, such as the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. I hope that it will also help the Government to take difficult decisions in the knowledge that they will not be exploited for narrow party reasons.</p>
	<p pid="b.1459.5/4">That is how the motion attempts to help the Government. I want action on climate change, and I want the problem to be tackled. That is one of the reasons why I am in politics. I am trying to make it easier for the Government to take the right decisions. That is what we are collectively trying to do.</p>

	<p pid="b.1472.1/1">I thank my hon. Friend for that intervention; I could not agree more. I hope that the Minister responds on behalf of Sonning common.</p>
	<p pid="b.1472.1/2">There is much more room for the Government to send clearer market signals to consumers, businesses and investors about policy direction in terms of what kind of energy mix we want and the desire to grow markets for cleaner cars and cleaner fuels. They should set a much better example in terms of the standards that we expect from manufacturers of cars, electrical appliances and new homes. The Environmental Audit Committee produced a report that showed the Government's deficiencies in setting standards for public procurement. They are spending &pound;500 billion of our money&mdash;a serious amount.</p>
	<p pid="b.1472.1/3">The Government should be doing more to develop market instruments that will get them out of the business of picking winners. In the European Union emissions trading scheme, which was very diluted and weakened in its first phase, lies the key opportunity to set a real price for carbon that will change the framework of this debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.1472.1/4">All this is in our national interest and in the global interest. It is do-able with political will, and it would be helped by political consensus. I am therefore very disappointed by the Minister's reaction to our motion. The major breakthrough required is the inclusion of the United States of America and the giants, and the emergence of an American President who sees it as being in the interest of the United States to lead this debate, not follow it.</p>
