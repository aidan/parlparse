<p>asked the Minister of Labour whether his attention has been called to the case of Mr. Nemo Ermini, of Hemel Hempstead, who applied for registration as a conscientious objector on the grounds that he could not conscientiously take up arms on behalf of this country in view of the fact that his father, who had fought for the Allies in the war of 1914&#x2013;18, had gone down on the "Arandora Star," and that he, himself, had been refused admission to the Home Guard because his father was an Italian; and whether, in the light of the circumstances disclosed, he will take steps to give this man the exemption he seeks?</p>

<p>The position at present is that engagements of workers in the general engineering, the building and the civil engineering industries must be made through the employment exchanges or through approved arrangements with trade unions.

<p>This alien was detained under an Order made under Art. 12 (5A) of the Aliens Order, 1920, as subsequently amended, on the grounds that it was impracticable to enforce a Deportation Order which had been made against him, and that his detention was necessary or expedient for securing the maintenance of public order. His case was recently reviewed by the Advisory Committee appointed to consider the cases of persons detained in pursuance of this power, and, having considered the Committee's recommendations, I decided to release Tessler. He was set at liberty on 8th January.</p>

<p>I have already been considering this point.

<p>My hon. Friend's suggestion that 1,600 Greek seamen are on strike in British ports is mistaken. The situation has much improved lately, and there is no longer any widespread refusal of labour. I am informed that the wages of Greek seamen are fixed by the Greek Government, and understand from my right hon. Friends the Minister of Labour and the Minister of Shipping that the wages of Greek seamen are much in excess of those of British seamen or of seamen of other Allied nationalities. Greek seamen are mobilised by the Greek Government for service in the Greek Merchant Navy, and the Greek Government have asked that those Greek seamen who refuse to serve in Greek ships should be deported to Greece; but they have given an assurance that men thus deported will not be punished on arrival in Greece merely by reason of their refusal to accept employment. I have made Deportation Orders in respect of 12 men, about whom I was satisfied that they were engaged in activities prejudicial to the war effort; and the question of making Deportation Orders in other similar cases is at present under consideration. Four of the men detained went on hunger-strike for a time, but have since abandoned it. It is clear that a number of Greek seamen were misled into a position which I hope will be avoided in future by proper methods of explanation; but if in future others should be misled into refusing to play their part in the Allied war effort, I shall feel it right to use my powers of deportation in any case in which I am satisfied that a Greek seaman in this country has refused to accept employment which was open to him in a Greek ship</p>

<p>Does the right hon. Gentleman appreciate that there was a sincere and conscientious difference of opinion on the part of many of these seamen regarding the interpretation of certain wage scales?

<p>I think that my answer gave the facts. The Ministry of Labour is satisfied that the rate being paid to the men, which is materially in excess of British or Allied rates, is reasonable. In those circumstances, it seems that the matter is primarily one for the Greek Government. If sailors of that nationality are not willing to play their part in the Allied cause, I do not think we should be over-sympathetic.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 8, line 13, to leave out "or after."<br/>
In regard to the Amendment I have just moved, it seems to me that in the case where a cost-of-works payment is in practice to be made, and where works are in progress, that payment should be made when those works have been completed and that there should be no delay thereafter. The removal of the words "or after" make the Clause read that payment should be made on completion of the works. I had also put my name to an Amendment to leave out from "commission," to "be," line 11, because I thought it was desirable that anyone who had suffered damage by the destruction of property should know within a


reasonable time whether he was to receive a cost-of-works payment or a value payment, but in view of what the Chancellor said yesterday, namely, that the factors on which under Clause 5 a determination as to whether a value payment will fall to be made or not must be ascertained in relation to post-war costs and value, I can see that any such condition as is proposed in the Amendment would be impossible and I therefore do not feel like taking the responsibility of moving it. That is the ordinarily-understood phrase in commerce. It does not mean that the payment must be made the instant the works are completed. It means that on completion of the works payment shall be due, and that it shall be made at a reasonable time thereafter.</p>

<p>I do not think there is any difference between us as to our intentions. I can give the assurance that, as long as present conditions in regard to the supply of materials continue, it is the intention that the payment should be made as soon as possible after the completion of the works. If and when the conditions as regards the supplies of materials change, it may be necessary for the Commission to exercise their own control over the carrying out of works. I will examine the matter again in the light of what my hon. Friend has said.</p>

<p>While the right hon. Gentleman has been very reasonable, perhaps the matter is more serious than he realises. I am informed that every Government Department which has to do with the requisitioning or taking over of

land&#x2014;and indeed, many other Departments which are concerned with contracts and supplies and so on&#x2014;is very much behind. There are large sums owing by the Treasury to-day. The difficulty is to find means of enforcement without recourse to the courts or other such extreme measures. I believe that contracts in some cases are being financed by the banks rather than by the Treasury. I can quite believe that that is not intended by the Government, but there is no doubt that claims are being held up. For instance, I am told by those who should know that the Air Ministry is much behind with its payments, and that the machinery is blocked to a very great extent. Therefore, it would be helpful if those words were taken out. They seem quite superfluous.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman says that he desires to give a reasonable opportunity to check the works, and so on. I speak in the presence of the Attorney-General and the Solicitor-General, but I should have thought that a provision to pay on completion of the works would have been implied in the ordinary way that payment should be made in a reasonable time after the completion of the works; but in that case there would be a limit to the period allowed. They would, presumably, if the Treasury were extremely slow, take some action in the courts or elsewhere to compel payment. If it is permissive to pay after completion of works, that may be six months, one year, two years, or, for anything I know, 10 years. Therefore, I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will look closely into the matter and ensure, if possible, that payment is made on completion of works, or within a reasonable time thereafter.</p>

<p>I agree that any assurance which the Chancellor of the Exchequer might now give us would make it look as though this semi-socialist institution lacks decision. I was delighted to hear it said in effect that governments are slow and dilatory in these matters. Capitalists do not pay because they do not want to pay, and a Government does not pay because it is so incompetent that it cannot make up its mind to pay, or


how much it owes. It is as well that this should be said occasionally because the delays are incredible.</p>

The reason I suggest that this Subsection should be left out is on account of the last words in the Sub-section,

I suggest to the Committee that some dilatoriness or inability to complete the work in respect of which a claim has to be met is no ground whatever for the drastic provision of forfeiting the whole right of the claimant. It will lead to trouble as to who is responsible and so forth, and surely the safeguard that the money is payable after the work is finished is the best possible safeguard that anyone could have, and I suggest that the Sub-section should be omitted.</p>

<p>I have two Amendments on the Paper closely related to this point. They are in page 8, line 23, after "Commission" insert:
<q>if all payments have been made in respect of works already completed (including any temporary works)</q>
and in page 8, line 30, at the end to insert:
<q>unless the failure to complete was caused or contributed to by the non-receipt of payment in respect of works already completed or in progress or in any other circumstances beyond the control of the persons concerned in securing the execution of the works.</q>
These ask that in no case should there be any forfeiture if default is due to the failure on the part of the Treasury to pay compensation and so put a claimant in funds to carry on his work. If the Chancellor will look at that point it will save my formally moving these Amendments.</p>

<p>I beg to move in page 8, line 31, to leave out "two" and insert "four."<br/>
It will be observed that the rate of interest proposed where payment is deferred is 2&#x00BD; per cent. I can see what is in the mind of the Chancellor and his advisers. When they put in 2&#x00BD; per cent. to come out of the Treasury they did not want to suggest that it was worth more than 2&#x00BD; per cent. because the Chancellor has to raise a great deal of money. What is the general rate at which people borrow money on mortgage? It is 4, 5 or 5&#x00BD; per cent. according to the circumstances. Here we have a question which raises the very difficult position where


payment cannot be made at once. The owner of a house may have a two-thirds interest in his house covered by mortgage, on which he is paying 4&#x00BD; or 5 per cent., and the result is that on paper he will be seriously out of pocket. I want to suggest that this very difficult problem can only be solved if we realise that the kind of rate of interest applicable to the form of capital we are dealing with should be not 2&#x00BD; per cent. but something in the neighbourhood of 4&#x00BD; per cent. I believe this would solve the Chancellor's problem far more satisfactorily than in any other way and I do not think the difference between 2&#x00BD; per cent. and 4&#x00BD; per cent. will imperil the scheme.</p>

<p>The Amendment moved by the hon. Gentleman is one which, in our opinion, raises a point of considerable importance, because under this Clause we are threatened with a position which would affect a considerable number of people who have a mortgage on their property at a higher rate of interest than 2&#x00BD; per cent and who, if their house is destroyed, will be in considerable difficulties through being called upon to pay their mortgage interest while not receiving anything from the Government at the time. And when they do receive something, it is to be at 2&#x00BD; per cent., which will obviously be lower than the rate which they will have to pay That obviously raises very serious questions. I have thought myself of several ways in which the position might be remedied, apart from that mentioned in the Amendment; it might be done by persuading the mortgagee to take a lower rate of interest, or by postponing the whole matter until later on. It cannot be allowed to remain exactly where it is, because the Courts Emergency Provisions did not seem to meet the position It is one of the repercussions of the Bill in the field of mortgage which correspond with the repercussions in the field of landlord and tenant of which the Attorney-General was speaking just now. It therefore seems to me that we need some statement from the Government as to their intentions in regard to this matter, which is one which will affect very large numbers of people all over the country It is very important and these repercussions will be most

serious. I invite the Chancellor to tell us a little more of what the Government are contemplating in this regard.</p>

<p>May I add a word in support of what has been said by my hon. Friend opposite? The reason why I have my next Amendment on the Paper, suggesting that the cost-of-works payments should bear interest as well, is in order to try and deal with this great difficulty of mortgagors who have to go on paying interest yet who have not even 2&#x00BD; per cent. accumulating to help them. I hope the Chancellor will bear that in mind as well as the points which have already been mentioned.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1941-01-30a.768.1" hansard_membership_id="7445" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/27643" speakername="Sir K. Wood" colnum="768" time="">
<p>This matter, as has been said, is an important one. So far as the Amendment on the Paper is concerned, I would say that the reason we in fact chose the rate of 2&#x00BD; per cent. is that we regard the matter in the light of a Government responsibility towards the people who will ultimately receive the money, and it is proposed to pay a rate of interest conforming more or less to what the State pays on its other borrowings. My hon. Friend the Member for South Croydon (Sir H. Williams), with the ingenuity which characterises him, says that this is a good way of endeavouring to meet the position of the mortgagor under this Bill, who might find himself with his house in ashes but his liability under the mortgage still remaining.<br/>
I very much doubt whether this is in fact the best way of meeting this position because unless you look at the circumstances of the man concerned as well, you may find a case of a mortgagor probably much better off, and much more easily able to meet the burden, than the mortgagee who is entitled to the interest. There are very many cases of trust estates, as I know, for I used to advise people myself to make investments by way of mortgage on property, telling them, "Here is a safe security&#x2014;better than, say, stocks and shares or trustee securities." There are undoubtedly large numbers of estates which have lent money in that way, and whose beneficiaries are to-day looking solely to the interest that they are receiving in that way to maintain them. You cannot dispose of this matter by saying, "Well, the unfortunate mortgagor has to pay this money, what


is to happen about it?" You cannot use the words "unfortunate mortgagor," as against the mortgagee, until you know more about them. The mortgagor may be suffering the misfortune of having his property bombed and lost, but he may be better off in many other ways than many of us who are here to-day. He may have resources. Compare his position with that of, say, the beneficiaries of the trust. Let us take the case of the widow&#x2014;because the widow is so often mentioned in connection with the Treasury, and how they are imposing upon her&#x2014;who depends entirely upon the interest of the mortgage in which the trustees have invested for her.<br/>
When you think of the matter you are driven to the conclusion that, in order to deal justly, you must have some sort of machinery, not in this Bill, but in another Bill. If the matter is sufficiently pressed the Government can decide to bring in another Bill, which will deal with this matter very much on the lines of the other provisions. It seems to me that any machinery which may be devised must take account of such a case. But it is clear that when the Government introduced this Bill, as the Prime Minister said, we sought to deal only with actual physical damage caused by the war. My answer to my hon. Friend is that, at any rate, so far as this proposal is concerned, this is obviously not a practical way of dealing with it. One must have much more regard for the circumstances of the individual. Secondly, any cases of this sort would have to be dealt with on the lines of the legislation about which the Attorney-General has already spoken.</p>

<p>There is only one point in the right hon. Gentleman's speech which has rather alarmed me. He suggested that there might be another Bill if the matter was thought to be sufficiently important. I hope that that does not mean that the Government, when they have got this Bill through, are going to say that the matter is not terribly important, and that they are going to do no more about it. I feel that there will be points of this kind arising, and I hope that it is seriously the intention to tackle the problem at some early future time, otherwise I am afraid the situation will be very unsatisfactory.</p>

This will not alter any decision which the Chancellor of the Exchequer may make, but it will extend the power of the Chancellor of the Exchequer in respect of any decision he might want to make. I certainly think that &#x00A3;500 is too small an amount to cover some of the contingencies which might arise under this Clause. Any number of families might find their hereditament damaged and have to seek


housing accommodation, and &#x00A3;500 to-day or in the future will certainly not be enough to produce even the smallest type of house. Therefore, I think that up to &#x00A3;1,000 should be covered by this Clause under the powers of the Chancellor of the Exchequer as far as making a grant is concerned. It is a matter for the Chancellor of the Exchequer to agree to this extra power, or to restrict himself, as the Clause does. In my opinion &#x00A3;1,000 will fit the Bill far better than the &#x00A3;500 which is specified.</p>

<p>I want the hon. Gentleman to remember this in connection with a proposal of this character. Any advance that we make to anybody who is a beneficiary under the Bill has its consequences, and if, for instance, you make an advance to somebody on account&#x2014;in a large number of cases advances will be made for rent&#x2014;it means that the person to whom the advance is made cannot get it later on. This is particularly so in the case of a man to whom money is advanced by way of rent. Here you may not be doing him a service, because if he can continue without an undue amount of assistance he will ultimately get a sum of compensation which has not been reduced too much on account of any advance he may have previously received. There may be a number of cases where sums advanced are of too considerable a character and where the individual may regret it and say, "I wish I had pulled in a bit more so that later on I should have been able to purchase a new house," or something of that kind. That was the reason why we fixed the sum of &#x00A3;500. The hon. Gentleman suggested &#x00A3;1,000; perhaps we may go between the two figures, but if we make the amount too large the Commission may be unduly pressed. However, I will consult with the hon. Gentleman between now and the Report stage to see if we can come to some arrangement.</p>

<p>This also applies to the securing of premises to carry on trade or business, and that, I submit, is a more difficult case. Normally, &#x00A3;500 to secure premises ought to be adequate but for

carrying on a business there may be a stronger case. Perhaps the Chancellor may consider the two cases separately?</p>

<p>I was interested in the Chancellor's reasoning, but I imagine that what he says would be taken into account by the Commission before advancing anything at all, and that the only question was that of the power to have in reserve. I think in both cases the Commission might think it just to extend beyond &#x00A3;500. It may be far more convenient for a person to buy a house for &#x00A3;550 at the moment, and it may be convenient for the Commission to have the matter settled in that way. Yet under the Clause as it now stands they are barred from taking that very easy way out. However, in view of the Chancellor's decision to come to some arrangement, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</p>
