<p>The number of persons employed at Embassies and Legations and engaged on Information Services is 1,235, made up of 236 United Kingdom based and 999 locally engaged. In addition, there are 1,088 persons employed at Consulates and other Posts, of whom 120 are United Kingdom based and 968 locally engaged. The total of 1,967 locally engaged staff includes part-time workers and 530 employed on subsidiary duties, on messenger, cleaning and similar duties. The total annual cost of such work at overseas Posts, including operational charges, is &#x00A3;1,470,062.</p>

The "special notice" referred to in this order was, in fact, given under the Allied Kommandatura Order No. BK/O(47)16, dated 23rd January, 1947, as amended by Order No. BK/O(47)193, dated 30th August, 1947. Since the Kulturbund did not comply with these Allied orders, it was banned from the British sector of Berlin. Despite this fact, and a protest by the British Deputy-Commandant to his Soviet colleague, the Soviet authorities in Berlin held a meeting of this organisation on 26th November in a building in the British sector. A letter of protest was sent to the Soviet Commandant on 1st December. I have not yet been informed that a reply has been received.</p>

<p>Meals served in restaurant cars of British official trains in Germany consist solely of basic Army transit rations which are not pretentious. As these trains are run primarily for personnel entitled to free rations as part of their salary or of some overall payment covering food during the time of the journey, no separate charge has hitherto been made for meals taken by any passengers. A system of meal tickets, however, will shortly be introduced, for which a charge will be made to those not so entitled.</p>

<p>The allegations made by the ex-Chancellor of Austria in his book "Austrian Requiem" have been closely and fully examined and we have concluded that the account given in his book is inaccurate. However, it undoubtedly refers to a series of leakages from the Embassy in Rome before the war, of which we have been aware. This leakage was the subject of an investigation in 1944, which revealed that an Italian servant, I regret to say, had been able to remove documents from the Embassy in Rome over a considerable period. This servant, apprehended after the war, admitted what he had done and stated that he had received considerable sums of money from the Italian authorities.<br/>
We also believe that Count Ciano was in the habit of boasting that he had a


source in the Foreign Office which provided him with the contents of secret files affecting Italy. It is thought, however, that this was the device by which Ciano sought to cover up the actual source of information, which we now know to have been the Rome Embassy. I perhaps should mention that Ciano gives a clearer account of the leakages in his book.</p>

<p>I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."<br/>
No lengthy explanation or supporting argument is required about this Bill. It speaks for itself, and if there were any doubt about its purpose or meaning it would be removed by the Explanatory Memorandum. In 1852, Parliament conferred a Constitution on New Zealand creating self-governing institutions. The Act limited the power of New Zealand to amend the Constitution. Another Act in 1857 made some changes, but left intact some of the limitations on this right to amend the Constitution. Those limitations were still retained at the desire of New Zealand by Section 8 of the Statute of Westminster, which was passed by this Parliament in 1931. The New Zealand Parliament now desire us to remove these limitations, and to give full power to amend their Constitution in any way they please. A few weeks ago, they passed a Request and Consent Act to that effect, and it now remains for us to do our part by the adoption of this Bill.<br/>
The Bill comes to us from another place, where it was adopted in a single sitting, with the unanimous and warm approval of all who spoke from all quarters of the House. I cannot believe that any hon. Member of this House will desire to impede its passage or to refuse the New Zealand Parliament what they ask. The Bill removes what all now recognise to be an arrangement that is out-of-date. New Zealand is a member of the Commonwealth, equal in status and rights to all the rest. It is the proper business of the New Zealand people to decide what their institutions shall be and how they shall be made to work. No one in a foreign country, however hostile they may be, could pretend that this will weaken the ties that unite New Zealand and the other nations of the British Commonwealth.<br/>
In presenting their legislation a little while ago, the New Zealand Government laid before their Parliament a White Paper in which they said that the sole purpose of their act was to give them the full legislative capacity which every self-Governing member of the British Commonwealth possessed. The Paper went on to say that the people of New Zealand had proved, not only by the day-to-day actions of the Government and the attitude of New Zealand during two great wars, but also by the actions of private individuals and groups, the recognition of independence on the one hand, and interdependence in the Commonwealth on the other, as "part of our national way of thinking and feeling."<br/>
The Prime Minister of New Zealand said, in moving the legislation, that if it were to lessen the tie between New Zealand and the Empire, he would have nothing to do with it, but, in his opinion, if it were adopted, it would strengthen the tie to the advantage of all. We have seen, in two wars, New Zealand ready to stand with us against aggression to support the rule of law and to defend the principles of liberty and justice for which the Commonwealth stands. This Bill comes I think very opportunely at the present time. It is one more proof to the outside world that the British Commonwealth stands for Parliamentary democracy and for the full untramelled freedom of those who work for it. I hope that the outside world will mark, learn and understand that, as we now rectify an anachronism, we all feel that the bonds between New Zealand and ourselves are closer than they have ever been before.</p>

<p>Certainly, we, on this side of the House, will welcome and facilitate the passage of this small Bill. Clearly, it is something for which New Zealand has the right to ask, and, if New Zealand asks, we have a duty to give. As I understand it, this Bill is only necessary because, at the time of the Statute of Westminster, New Zealand herself asked that these limitations should be continued, and, of course, as we acceded to that request then, so we accede gladly to the opposite request today. I am sure that all of us will feel with the Prime Minister of New Zealand that this little bit of machinery can have no effect whatsoever upon the ties which bind New Zealand to us.<br/>
If we can throw our minds back over a long period&#x2014;95 years&#x2014;when the Constitution Act on which New Zealand still relies was first passed, I think that we can all feel that whatever high hopes the authors of that Measure had in 1852, the results have exceeded their wildest expectations. In two great wars we have received their loyal and courageous support, and also in time of peace whenever we have been in difficulties. All the affection they bear for us makes New Zealand one of the best loved in this country of our sister Dominions. We in this House, I am sure, will grant this small request, only wishing that it were in our power to give a more material and permanent token of the gratitude we bear to that country.</p>

<p>We get so very few opportunities in this House of paying our tribute to this very great and very gallant Dominion, that I personally am very glad to be able to add a few words in support of this Bill. It is with very deep feeling that I speak, because I have spent four periods in New Zealand, I know it pretty intimately, and I have had the very great advantage and privilege of enjoying the kindness and hospitality of New Zealanders throughout that country. During a period of illness, I was nursed back to health by their kind ministrations, and so I have, perhaps, special reason to thank them. I do not think that people in this country can realise, unless they have lived in New Zealand, the regard and affection in which this country and all its people are regarded by the New Zealanders. It is something very remarkable and it is, perhaps, not equalled anywhere else in the world; certainly it is nowhere exceeded.<br/>
This gallant little Dominion, with a population which, I think, is still less than 2,000,000, has stood by us valiantly in war and in peace. In the late war, she had no fewer than 205,000 men and women in the Forces out of that quite small population. Her casualties numbered rather more than 10,000 dead and nearly double that number wounded. In the matter of supplies, particularly food, she not only gave us of her best and of her bounty, but also helped us by a careful stabilisation of prices, so that the burden was not unduly heavy on us in those difficult years.<br/>
Since the war, she has similarly stood by us in all our difficulties; and, again, in the matter of food she has helped us enormously by control and by stabilisation of prices. She has to the utmost increased her exports to this country, and she has taken measures for the speedy turn-round of ships; and&#x2014;I think a very important matter at this time&#x2014;she has kept to a minimum her dollar expenditure, and deliberately done so to help the old country. I think that we should also remember the magnificent free gift of &#x00A3;10 million sterling which was made to this country at the beginning of this year. I understand that the assistance which she has given us in the way of food parcels&#x2014;very important in these days&#x2014;totals no fewer than 1,000,000.<br/>
I have two references to that distant period, 95 years ago, in the year 1852, which are apposite. In the Queen's Speech, opening the 1852 Session, Her Majesty spoke of the fact that
<q>no obstacle any longer exists to the enjoyment of representative institutions by New Zealand.</q>
It is also interesting to recall that in the Debate in 1852, Mr. Gladstone referred to the people of New Zealand as
<q>exceeded by none in their known worthiness to receive and their perfect competence to exercise political privileges.</q>
In conclusion I would like to re-echo those words of Mr. Gladstone's 95 years ago by adapting them and by saying that the people of New Zealand are "exceeded by none in their known worthiness to receive and their perfect competence to exercise" &#x2014;I would add these words&#x2014; "complete political freedom." I have the greatest pleasure in strongly and warmly supporting this Measure.</p>

<p>I should like to endorse everything that has been said by the hon. Member for Norwood (Mr. Chamberlain) about the Dominion of New Zealand, and I should like to call the attention of the House to the part New Zealand played in the dangerous and difficult times before the first world war in its concept of the responsibilities of our Dominions in regard to the maintenance of our sea power in the face of an expectant enemy. In those times when we were struggling to keep our sea power in such a state that it would be capable of meeting any enemy, no


Dominion made a more substantial or inspiring contribution than New Zealand. I happened to be Secretary of the Navy League at that time, and some of my hon. Friends will remember that in New Zealand we established branches of the Navy League in almost every small village and municipality. In those days we were fighting the battle of supremacy and were trying to secure an ultimate superiority.<br/>
New Zealand always made an immediate and responsive reply to the people of this country. I sent out to New Zealand in those days&#x2014;I am speaking now of 1912 to 1914&#x2014;something like 300 or 400 maps of the British Empire indicating the basis upon which our sea power could be maintained. No Dominion was more responsive in the maintenance of that fine principle of our existence than New Zealand. At the close of the first world war we had an immense demonstration to the people of this country in the contribution that the New Zealanders made for the welfare of our ex-Servicemen. They sent us, I think, nearly half a million pounds for the maintenance of our postwar services for discharged Servicemen, and in those days particularly the work of the British Legion enjoyed their support.<br/>
This House ought to be proud to acknowledge the part New Zealand played as a constituent part of our Commonwealth and we should be glad to pay her a tribute for the services rendered, her example, her leadership, her contribution to the success of our sea power and the loyalty and devotion of her people to everything that is best in the Commonwealth.</p>

<p>I am glad to assure my hon. Friend the Member for Moseley (Sir. P. Hannon), as one who is on the Executive Committee of the Navy League today, that New Zealand is just as keen now as she was in those days to which he referred. Since the first days when New Zealand was discovered by the Royal Navy&#x2014;it was by Captain Cook&#x2014;her people have appreciated the power of the sea. The original Colony, and later the Dominion, was helped and maintained by the Navy. There are only two points I should like to make in general appreciation of this Dominion which is shared by all parts of the House. The Minister gave two reasons why New Zealand came into the last two big wars to help. Was not the

reason that the Mother country was fighting and the Dominion of New Zealand wanted no other reason than that we were at war? That is the attitude of that wonderful Dominion and the wonderful people who live there.<br/>
I should like to make one other comment. I do not pretend to be so up to date in many of our Colonial and Dominion affairs as other hon. Members, but surely I am right in thinking that the political situation in New Zealand as between the original inhabitants of the land and those who come into it later is beyond compare in any other country. The Maoris have played a full part in the administration of the country and they have occupied some of the highest Ministerial posts. Can any other country in any land show such similar close cooperation between two races? I do not think so. Even if they could, New Zealand shows the way. If New Zealand wants some alteration in its code to govern its own land let it have it. It will make no difference whatsoever in its affection and respect for this country which is the Motherland.</p>

(Mr. Glenvil Hall)" colnum="802" time="">
<p>I beg to move in page 3, line 13, at the end, to insert:
<q>and, where the tax becomes due on or after the ninth day of December, nineteen hundred and forty-seven, shall not affect&#x2014;</q>
<ol>
<li>(<i>a</i>)electric dry batteries; or</li>
<li>(<i>b</i>)accumulators, being accumulators suitable for use with wireless receiving sets of the domestic or portable type."</li></ol>
The effect of this Amendment is that wireless and battery accumulators, which under a Budget Resolution of this Bill as it stands would fall to pay Purchase Tax at the rate of 50 per cent., will revert to the old rate of 33&#x2153; per cent. I should in all fairness to the House point out that this change cannot be dated to 13th November, but will run as from 8th of


this month. In the interregnum any batteries or accumulators disposed of by retailers will, I am sorry to say, have to pay 50 per cent.<br/>
The House will remember that on the Committee stage representations were made to my right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer from every quarter of the Committee that this tax should not be raised with the others, on the ground that, particularly in rural areas, there were many people upon whom the tax would bear very hardly. The right hon. Member for West Bristol (Mr. Stanley) said that if my right hon. and learned Friend met the House in this matter it would be the last demand that they would make under this Clause of the Bill. My right hon. and learned Friend undertook to look at it without making any comments or commitment, and I am delighted to think that he has agreed to make this change. The cost will be about &#x00A3;1 million in a full year.</p>

<p>We are very grateful to the Chancellor of the Exchequer for having met this point, which was put to him from all sides of the Committee and with particular force from those who represent agricultural districts. We quite understand that the complexity of the case prevents the dating back, and we are prepared to put up with the small hardship which may be incurred by some because of that. Normally I should have thought it unnecessary to say any more or to add any further embellishment or embroidery, but the Chancellor of the Exchequer has given us to understand that future concessions are to be determined not so much on the merits of each case as on the flattery which the Government receive. In fact, not guns but butter has got to be the weapon of Members in the future.<br/>
So in order to get the matter straight on the record, I should like to declare that the Chancellor of the Exchequer in accepting this Amendment has shown courage, wisdom and humanity, all the qualities of statesmanship. I should like further to say that the learned Solicitor-General, when he gave some strong reasons for resisting this Amendment, showed the same courage, the same wisdom and the same humanity, in fact, the same qualities of statesmanship. In order that there may be no ill feeling I should

like to add that we are all certain that had the occasion demanded it, the Financial Secretary to the Treasury would have shown the same courage, the same wisdom and the same humanity&#x2014;the same qualities of statesmanship&#x2014;either in accepting or rejecting the Amendment as the case might be.</p>

At the same time, I would once more direct his attention to the fact that I made the plea for removal of tax on these dry batteries on the first main Budget that came in at the beginning of the year. In making his statement during the Committee stage, the Chancellor said that between now and next year, he would review many matters with regard to Purchase Tax. I sincerely trust that, having regard to the shortage of amenities in the countryside, he will give his attention to the complete removal of the application of this tax to these batteries. I thank him for the consideration which he has already given to the matter.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 5, line 16, to leave out from "date," to the end of the line, and to insert:
<q>when the assessment or direction becomes final and conclusive.</q>
When we discussed this Amendment upon the Committee stage we were left in doubt about when the tax would be payable. The Financial Secretary promised to look at the matter again, and I think there is nothing I need do now other than to say that we want a clear definition of when the tax becomes payable. We think the words we propose would put the matter beyond all doubt, and we should be grateful if the situation could now be cleared up.</p>

<p>I beg to second the Amendment.<br/>
I am rather disappointed that the Financial Secretary has not seen fit to attempt to clarify the Clause at this stage. In the Debate in Committee he


said that the effect of the Amendment would be:
<q>that the date at which interest on unpaid tax becomes chargeable would be that at which the assessment of tax becomes final and conclusive.</q>
A little later on, he said that he would give an assurance:
<q>that if an appeal is lodged, the time will not begin to run until that appeal has been settled and agreement has been reached between the Inland Revenue authorities and the individual concerned."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 3rd December, 1947; Vol. 445, c. 447.]</q>
I submit that neither of those two statements appears in the Clause as it stands. If what the right hon. Gentleman said is a sort of administrative undertaking and is the way the Inland Revenue authorities will view the Clause, that is one thing, but the taxpayer has not the protection of the wording of the Clause, as it stands.</p>

<p>I cannot help thinking that hon. and right hon. Gentlemen opposite are under some misapprehension in this matter. My right hon. and learned Friend wishes to be fair to the individual taxpayer, who, under Schedule D, may find himself liable to pay interest on arrears which have been outstanding for mare than three months and are more than &#x00A3;1,000 at that time. Believe me, there is nothing which I said on the Committee Stage that I have to retract. The difference between "final and conclusive" and "due and payable" is clear. When an assessment is raised, 21 days are given for an appeal to be lodged. If no appeal is lodged at the end of that period, that assessment becomes, in law, final and conclusive, but that does not necessarily mean that it then becomes due and payable.<br/>
These demands are normally levied as at 1st January and 1st July and are split into two instalments. If we accepted the Amendment, it would mean that, more often than not, the amount would become due directly it became final and conclusive. If the tax is overdue, obviously the final and conclusive date might well coincide with the due and payable date, but normally the two are different, and the due and payable date is later than the final and conclusive date. I hope I have made that point clear. I would add that my right hon. and learned Friend has no desire to harry people who have not had their assessments made final and conclusive. If appeals are lodged, the time will not begin to run against them

until agreement has been come to between the individual or company concerned and the inspector of taxes in whose district that individual or company is situated. I hope that, with that assurance, the Amendment will not be pressed.</p>

<p>I am not sure that the Financial Secretary to the Treasury quite appreciates the reasons for which we have put down the Amendment again. It all depends upon a point which was raised later in the Debate by my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester (Mr. Joynson-Hicks). The Solicitor-General gave an assurance as to the way in which this matter would operate, and the assurance fully satisfied the desires of hon. Members on this side. My hon. Friend the Member for Chichester raised the simple point whether the legal effect of the words "due and payable" in the Bill was such that it might exclude the administrative interpretation which the Solicitor-General, to the satisfaction of all of us, was going to put upon them. The Solicitor-General promised to look into the matter before the Report stage. We have put the Amendment down in order that he might have this opportunity either to give us that assurance or to suggest other words.</p>

<p>I am sorry that I was not in the House when the Debate started on this point, as to which I have given an assurance. Since giving that assurance I have considered whether, within the wording in the present form, we can do &#x2014;and I am satisfied that we can&#x2014;what I said. I said that we have this arrangement for, in effect, a provisional set off, within which the tax will operate&#x2014;</p>

<p>That is right. I was asked by an hon. Friend of the right hon. Gentleman whether I was quite clear in my mind that we could operate this arrangement within the wording of the Clause. I am quite satisfied that we can, and my reason for saying so is that if there had been an arrangement for a provisional set-off of that kind the tax debt in question cannot be said to be payable within the meaning of the words "due and payable." It may be "due"


but it has not yet become "payable" because there has been an arrangement for a provisional set-off. [<i>Interruption.</i>] If I am talking about the same Amendment, I am quite clear that we can implement the arrangement I said would be implemented. If I have butted into the middle of another Debate and have misunderstood what is going on, I am extremely sorry.</p>

<p>With regard to this Amendment which deals with the words "due and payable," the Financial Secretary suggested a moment ago that if there was an appeal, interest would not begin to run until there had been agreement with regard to the assessment. Does that also include the case where there has not been agreement and the matter has gone right up through the normal channels of appeal? Is it correct that interest will not run until the date of the final decision, which may be that of the House of Lords?</p>

<p>That does not quite clear up the point of the undertaking given by the Financial Secretary on the Committee stage. When the Financial Secretary was speaking on the Second Reading I interjected a question to him to ask for greater clarification as to the interpretation of the time from which interest would begin to run. The right hon. Gentleman then said words to the effect that it would not begin to run until the assessment had been agreed between the Inland Revenue and the taxpayer. My right hon. Friend the Member for West Bristol (Mr. Stanley) confirmed that by an interjection at that moment. The Financial Secretary will see it in HANSARD. He said:
<q>When it is agreed?</q>
The Financial Secretary replied:
<q>Yes."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 25th November, 1947; Vol.
444, c. 1821.]</q>
He referred to the matter again on the Committee stage, and again the Financial

Secretary gave his interpretation to the effect that the words "due and payable" were synonymous with the intention of the Government that interest should not begin to run until the assessment and its pay-ability had been agreed between the parties. Our point was to obtain confirmation from the Solicitor-General that to the legal as well as the lay mind the words "due and payable" could be interpreted by the courts, and would be interpreted, as meaning when agreement was reached between the parties. To me, at any rate, the words "due and payable" do not necessarily connote the necessity of waiting until the parties have agreed as to the amount of the assessment.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1947-12-08a.808.0" hansard_membership_id="12665" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/20823" speakername="The Solicitor-General" colnum="808" time="">
<p>With the leave of the House I will reply to that. We were at cross purposes. The Amendment on which I was speaking is a subsequent Amendment put down by the hon. and gallant Member for Antrim (Major Haughton) which is designed to bring about, as it were, an inter-tax inter-year set-off. When I intervened I had in mind that Amendment. I am sorry that I spoke to the wrong Amendment; it was because I did not hear the earlier course of the Debate.<br/>
4.15 p.m.<br/>
The words "due and payable" quite clearly provide for this. Where there is no appeal, we must have a final assessment which in the ordinary course would be when the parties had agreed what the amount should be. Only when they have agreed and in consequence a final assessment has been made, will the interest begin to run. In cases where there is an appeal, the interest will not run in relation to any part of the tax which is disputed &#x2014;which is the subject of the appeal&#x2014;until the appeal has been finally disposed of. In other words, before any interest begins to run we must have a final assessment. In the event of there being any difference of opinion as to what the amount will be, the final assessment can obviously only be arrived at after the parties have come to agreement. If they cannot come to an agreement and a final assessment cannot be obtained and an appeal is begun, the interest will not begin to run until the appeal has been disposed of.<br/>
I think that answers the hon. Gentleman. I am quite clear in my mind that before money can be "due" or "pay-


able" there must be either a final assessment or a final appeal. If, therefore, any amount is still subject to an appeal it is not "due and payable." If it is subject to discussion and there has been no final assessment, it is not "payable," and it there is discussion between the parties and they cannot agree, obviously the assessment is subject to appeal and, therefore, the interest does not begin to run until the amount has been finally settled on appeal. What I said when I first rose was wholly inapposite as it was directed to a subsequent Amendment.</p>

<p>This is rather a technical point. I think I am right in saying that the definition of "final appeal" will have to be made more clear. Any district inspector furnishes the taxpayer with a final appeal with the words "final appeal" written across it, although there may be a dispute going on between the parties.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 6, to leave out lines 14 to 31.<br/>
This is a case where we slightly reverse the usual process. I am now moving an Amendment to which the Solicitor-General has already given an answer. This Amendment has been put down for the same purpose as the last one, to give the Solicitor-General an opportunity of reporting to the House a matter he promised to consider. He gave to us on this question of the "set-off" what appeared to be a perfectly satisfactory definition of how it was going to be used, but some of us, including myself, had considerable doubts whether lines 14 to 31 would not prevent him putting that reasonable interpretation into operation. He promised to consider the matter before the Report stage, and I gather from the answer he has already given that having considered it, he feels that these words are not contradicted by the interpretation that has been given and the assurances, which we were glad to receive.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 7, line 12, at the end, to insert:
<q>(8) The Commissioners of Inland Revenue may withdraw any claim in respect of interest on proof by the person by whom the tax is payable that non-payment of the tax or delay in payment of the tax was due to delays which were beyond the control of that person.</q>
This Amendment is a simple and, I hope, desirable one. It merely suggests that there shall be a measure of discretion given to the Commissioners to waive interest in those cases where they are satisfied that the delay is caused because of reasons for which the taxpayer cannot be responsible.</p>

<p>But there is a slight alteration, and I would repeat what I said then. If, and in so far as the tax is not assessed owing to causes which the taxpayer cannot control, or if for any other causes, whether he can control them or not, it is not assessed, no interest begins to run. The Amendment would appear to include the case of non-payment owing to any causes which were beyond the control of the person who is assessed. That is going a great deal too far. It would include the case of the taxpayer who, owing to circumstances which he cannot control, has not the money to pay, and that is a concession we could not possibly consider giving. In so far as there is delay in assessment, and whether or not that is the fault of the taxpayer or anybody else, the interest does not begin to run, but if the hon. and gallant Gentleman seeks by this Amendment to ask for something more extensive than that, we must watch carefully how we go, and we could not accept the Amendment in the general terms in which it is proposed.</p>

<p>I would point out to the Solicitor-General that this does not impose a duty on the Commissioners to make such a concession; it only gives them the right to do it if they so wish. Therefore, the Commissioners of Inland Revenue would remain fully masters of the position. As the learned Solicitor-General recognises, of course, this is a different Amendment from that to which he gave an answer on the Committee stage. In fact, it has been altered to meet the point he made and to cover a point which was made by my hon. Friend the Member for Bath (Mr. Pitman) but which the Solicitor-General pointed out would be outside the scope of the Amendment. The hon. Member for Bath instanced the case where a cheque or money order had been despatched, but had been stolen in transit, and asked whether that was not a case where the Commissioners might well say that this was beyond the control of the man who was to be charged with interest and they might, therefore, waive the claim. This is not mandatory, it imposes no obligation on the Commissioners; it merely gives them a discretion which they can use if a case arises where they think it should be exercised.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 2, line 24, to leave out from beginning, to end of line 27, and to insert, "by one pound."<br/>
This and the next two Amendments are consequential on this one, and it will be for the convenience of the Committee if we discuss them together. The purpose is very simple. Whereas under the existing Bill there is a differentiation made in the increase to Class I and II and Class III and IV governors, if this Amendment were accepted, it would mean that all governors of all four classes would be treated alike, and each would receive a pound a year extra for every completed month of service as a governor. I referred to this in the Debate on the Second Reading, and made the point, which I think a good one, that very often it is the Class III and IV governors, who never get to the big territories with big salaries and expenses, who on retirement are the worst off, and are most in need of this extra help. It is also very often in regard to governors of that class that the Secretary of State has the hardest decision to make between another appointment and putting them on the retired list. I hope the hon. Gentleman will see his way to accept this Amendment.</p>

<p>My right hon. Friend and I have considered this Amendment, which we think is a good one. We are grateful to the right hon. Member for West Bristol (Mr. Stanley) for raising this matter on Second reading. The change will mean an addition from the Exchequer of &#x00A3;500 a year, but we think the reasons the right hon. Gentleman has given far outweighs this small additional charge. I will give one or two cases showing how it will work out. A governor who serves the normal period of five years in Class III receives &#x00A3;240. Our original proposal would have raised it to &#x00A3;270, and the present proposal would raise it to &#x00A3;300 a year. A governor who serves five years in Class IV now receives &#x00A3;180; the original proposal would bring it up to &#x00A3;210, and this proposal would bring it to &#x00A3;240 a year. A governor appointed at 50 to a Class IV post, having already earned a pension of &#x00A3;850 a year in a Civil


Service post, will now qualify for a pension of &#x00A3;1,090. I think that will meet the views of the Committee as a whole.</p>

<p>I beg to move, "That the Clause be read a Second time."<br/>
This new Clause covers the same point as that contained in the Amendment which has been ruled out of Order, or substantially the same point. The ceiling which is the subject of this new Clause has always been calculated on two-thirds of the salary which a Permanent Under-Secretary of State in this country would get after some 40 years in the Service. The original ceiling which that calculation gave was &#x00A3;1,300, and, at a later stage, when the salary of the Permanent Under-Secretary was increased to &#x00A3;3,000 the new ceiling on the two-thirds basis became &#x00A3;2,000. Today the salary of the Permanent Under-Secretary is &#x00A3;3,500, which gives a percentage on a two-thirds basis of &#x00A3;2,333. So the governor today is being placed on the same basis, if the Committee accept this proposal, as a Permanent Under-Secretary, except for &#x00A3;33, and an ambassador. They are all equated together. We suggest that this increase will meet all the cases which the right hon. Member for West Bristol (Mr. Stanley) had in mind when he raised the point on Second Reading. We are very grateful to him for raising it, and feel that it will now obviate any case of a governor, serving, perhaps three or four years towards the end of his period of service, and getting no greater result as to his pension than if he had not served at all.</p>

<p>I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for the way in which he has met us on this point. I have no complaint to make that whereas my Amendment proposed to do away with the limit altogether this proposal will increase the limit in proportion to the increases which


have taken place in the pension. Quite clearly of the two the hon. Gentleman's method is the more logical, and I agree that it will cover most, if not all, the cases I had in mind. I am extremely grateful to the Government for accepting this suggestion.</p>
