<p>asked the Secretary of State for the Environment if he will undertake a study of the problems facing prospective owner-occupiers who find themselves unable to purchase due to high prices and interest rates.</p>

<p>The best way to help prospective home buyers is to take the steps necessary to reduce inflation and interest rates and the Government's fiscal and monetary control policies will achieve this. It is also essential to ease the constraints faced by house builders in, for example, the planning and land supply fields. Steps are being taken to meet this objective. In addition, the Government are encouraging local authorities to implement a wide-ranging programme to promote low-cost home ownership.</p>
</speech>
<speech hansard_id="1744014" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1980-04-30a.1349.8" hansard_membership_id="11612" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/31169" speakername="Mr. Ross" colnum="1349" time="">
<p>The Secretary of State might think that that is an adequate answer, but is he aware that I do not? If owner-occupation is the cornerstone of the present Government's policies on housing, is it not up to the Government to inquire why house building starts are at their lowest ebb since the 1920s? Is he aware that increasing numbers of prospective owner-occupiers are being priced out of the chance of buying, and are having to turn to local authorities and housing associations to seek accommodation which is not available because of cuts in the housing investment programme?</p>
</speech>
<speech hansard_id="1744015" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1980-04-30a.1350.0" hansard_membership_id="102" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2817" speakername="Mr. Heseltine" colnum="1350" time="">
<p>We do not need an inquiry to establish that public expenditure demands are taking too much money and causing interest rates to be too high. Until we redress that balance we shall never restore the growth in the economy on which prospective house purchase depends.</p>

<p>Is my right hon. Friend aware that I accept the strategy of his answer? However, is there not a problem with local planning authorities and local government in general in relation to the release of land and the easing of planning permission for those projects that private builders wish to pursue?</p>

<p>Is the Secretary of State aware that there is an acute housing crisis? Is he aware that many people who wish to buy are unable to do so because of property price inflation and the record mortgage interest rate? Is it not a tragedy that so many people who would stand a chance of being re-housed by local authorities are now the victims of the Secretary of State's actions, under which council house building has come to a virtual stop?</p>

<p>The hon Gentleman was not in the House when his Government ran down the level of council building to such extraordinary levels. I dare say that he was prepared to defend the record of that Government when he stood at the last election. Of course, I am aware of the crisis in house building, which was precipitated by the appalling economic circumstances which we inherited.</p>

<p>Does the Secretary of State agree that if house prices are rising by 18 or 20 per cent. a year and mortgage interest is at 15 per cent., with tax relief, that is a good bargain for owner-occupiers?</p>

<speech hansard_id="1744021" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1980-04-30a.1350.6" hansard_membership_id="102" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2817" speakername="Mr. Heseltine" colnum="1350" time="">
<p>My hon. Friend will also remember that house prices rose by 30 per cent. in the year before we took office. I understand that they are not now rising at all.</p>

<p>Is it not a fact that the overwhelming majority of the 1 million families on council house waiting lists cannot afford to buy in any circumstances, and even less so with higher prices and interest rates? What will happen to such people? Are not they in an impossible position in view of the virtual ending of council house building which is coming, and the sale of existing council houses?</p>

<p>I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will have borne in mind the difficulties of council house building&#x2014;which declined to such an extent under the last Government&#x2014;against the background of the programme which he supported in the Lobby time and time again. The overall position is, broadly, as the House knows, that unless we restore the economy to strength and real growth we shall not achieve the growth in real disposable income on which home ownership depends on an increasing scale.</p>

<p>Is the Minister aware that many American athletes wish that their Olympic Committee had had the guts of the British Olympic Committee and stood up to the Government who are using sports men and women as political pawns in a presidential election campaign?

<p>What a disgraceful supplementary question and one not untypical of the hon. Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan). I hope that he will realise what is actually happen-

<p>Is my hon. Friend aware that in a free country such as ours there is a little local difficulty in raising the money for the Olympics? Will my hon.

The Lake Placid games, which have now taken place, cost one-third of the total of the Olympic budget.</p>

<p>The Government have given clear advice to the nation about the Moscow Olympics and I hope that those considering subscribing to the appeal will bear in mind what we have said. In the early part of the year we accepted, and welcomed, subscriptions to the Olympic appeal for the Winter Games at Lake Placid. We give absolutely no encouragement&#x2014;indeed we offer the maximum discouragement&#x2014;to subscribers to the appeals for the Moscow Games.</p>

<p>Is it not absolutely scandalous that the Government should seek to advise British industry not to give money to British athletes, who have freely exercised their democratic right to take a decision that the Government do not like? Does not that put the Government in the Russian mould? The Government are saying " Unless you do what we wish we shall impose economic sanctions on you ".

<p>Is my right hon. Friend aware of the public fury at the rate of increases of these water charges? Is it not totally illogical not to have a rebate scheme for water charges, particularly for the elderly, when a large part of those water charges is composed of sewerage charges which used to appear under the domestic rates, where they could qualify for a rebate scheme?

<p>I assure my hon. Friend that I am well aware of the concern. Knowing the constituency that he represents and the scale of the increase in that water authority, I well understand the representations that he is receiving. It is true that, before 1974, it was possible to get a rebate. Since then it has not been possible to get a rebate for sewerage services. Successive Governments have held the view that this is in the nature of a public utility and that the charges should not, therefore, be assisted in that way, but that help for low income families should come through supplementary benefit and other assistance that is possible. That is the position that the Government have supported.</p>

<p>With permission, Mr. Speaker, I will make a statement about the present situation in the prison system in England and Wales and about the action that I am taking on the main recommendations of the report of the committee of inquiry into the United Kingdom prison services&#x2014;the May committee. We shall also within the next few weeks publish a detailed reply to the 15th report from the Expenditure Committee for Session 1977&#x2013;78, and we shall publish proposals for changes in the powers of the courts in relation to young offenders later in the summer.<br/>
As the May committee made clear in its report, this country has for many years paid too little attention to its prisons. The result is that our prisons are chronically overcrowded and the prison service operates under severe strain. In the period since the report was published last October, the prison population in England and Wales has risen from 42,500 to a total of 44,000 on 18 April. The figure continues to fluctuate, but the present level is dangerously high. Exceptional measures by way of legislation or administrative action would be unpalatable and frustrating to those whose task it is to administer justice, but they cannot be ruled out if the situation demands them. Our primary task must, however, be to prevent such a situation from developing.<br/>
The following action is being taken. First, we must ensure that the prison estate is adequate for the job that it has to do. We have every sympathy with the May committee's recommendation that the building programme should be increased. The present programme, together with a considerable maintenance commitment, is substantial. Work already in progress will produce about 3,400 new or refurbished places by 1985, including a major new dispersal prison, which should come into use next year. Firm plans are being made to start two new major projects in both 1981&#x2013;82 and 1982&#x2013;83, which will provide 1,500 further places by the later 1980s. I hope to continue the programme on that basis in 1983&#x2013;84, and preliminary planning is now proceeding.<br/>
Secondly, we shall continue our efforts to develop alternatives to imprisonment. The Government believe that the outside community must play an increasing part, whether through statutory or voluntary agencies, in the treatment and containment of offenders, particularly those who have not committed violent offences. We shall give full support to non-custodial methods, and we recognise the major contribution that the probation and aftercare service must make to them.<br/>
The mentally disordered offender presents particularly difficult problems. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Social Services and I accept that it is undesirable to detain in prison persons whose mental disorder permits them to be detained in hospital under the Mental Health Act. We shall continue our efforts to have such persons transferred to hospitals with the appropriate levels of security. My right hon. Friend will continue to give priority to the establishment of regional secure units. The programme that has been planned will make a valuable contribution to the provision for these offenders.<br/>
A new development is that we are making public funds available to enable voluntary organisations to make a start in providing simple overnight shelter for people who would otherwise be charged with offences of drunkenness.<br/>
Measures of this kind may not individually achieve a substantial reduction in the prison population, but taken together they can have a significant impact.<br/>
Thirdly, the Advisory Council on the Penal System, the Expenditure Committee and the May committee have all emphasised the need for shorter sentences. I have already said that the Government would welcome shorter sentences for nonviolent offenders, and it should be possible to bring about a significant reduction in the general level of sentences without sacrificing the protection that the public is entitled to expect. I believe that such a reduction can be achieved by the exercise of judicial discretion, and recent judgments have suggested that there is an increasing awareness among judges that the less serious type of non-violent offence can properly be met by a shorter term of imprisonment than has been imposed previously.

I turn now to the May committee's vitally important recommendations on prison reorganisation. Like the committee, I fully support the principle of preserving direct ministerial responsibility for the prison service and for the treatment if individual prisoners. Subject to that, I endorse the May committee's objective of a structure which will give the prison services a greater corporate sense and enable those in charge to be more directly responsible for its own affairs. I am, therefore, instituting a major change in the prison department's position in the Home Office and in its internal organisation. The prison department will be given wide delegated authority within the Home Office for the management of its staff and for the control of its finance. Special attention will be paid to improving the system of financial information and control.<br/>
The present director general will remain in his post. A new post of deputy director general will be created and the membership of the Prisons Board will be expanded to include the four regional directors and two outside non-executive members whose appointments I shall announce shortly.<br/>
I accept the May committee's crucial recommendations for an inspectorate separate from the prison department, and for the publication of its reports. A new Crown appointment of Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons will be announced as soon as possible. He will inspect and report to the Home Secretary on prison establishments in England and Wales, conducting regular inspections of individual establishments and investigating particular incidents or situations on the Home Secretary's directions. He will submit an annual report, which will be published, and other reports, which will be made publicly available as appropriate.<br/>
I endorse the May committee's objective of a reconstructed regional organisation, which will enable regional directors to concentrate more closely on the supervision of individual establishments, reporting directly to the deputy director general. As the committee recommended, most specialist functions will be concentrated at headquarters.<br/>
I will, with permission, circulate further details of these organisational changes in


the <i>Official Report</i>. Copies of this information are now available in the Vote Office.<br/>
I endorse the May committee's views on the need to achieve better industrial relations, to make the best possible use of staff and to improve staff accommodation and amenities. I am pursuing these matters with the staff associations concerned, with priority for improvements in the procedures for handling industrial relations and for the design of a new attendance system and the associated conditions of service. I accept the committee's recommendation for a comprehensive review of training.<br/>
I believe that the changes that I have announced will provide a framework in which members of the prison service, of all grades, will be better able to perform their difficult tasks. I shall do all that I can to help them to maintain their high traditions and to develop new and constructive methods in the context of the concept of positive custody as put forward in the May committee's report. Work will be put in hand to translate it into the design of prison regimes and the development of prison industries, and I will lay the necessary amendments to the prison rules in due course.<br/>
All the measures that I have announced have a common objective&#x2014;to ensure an effective prison system and an efficient and confident prison service.</p>

<p>I note what the Home Secretary said about the Iranian embassy. The less said about that the better at present, but no doubt we shall have a full report when appropriate.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman's statement on prisons was a long one, which requires far more discussion than is appropriate now. It was our impression that we should have the opportunity to debate the May report before anything was said. I know that the Expenditure Committee report is to be debated shortly, as the Home Secretary said.<br/>
The latter part of the statement was concerned with the organisation of the prison service. As its terms of reference show, I set up the May committee to look into the organisation of the prison service. Is the right hon. Gentleman aware that it is my view&#x2014;a view that I quickly reached as Home Secretary&#x2014;that not enough thought had been given to the

prisons themselves, whatever the size of the prison population, and certainly not enough thought has been given to the wider and more important question of penal reform? The structure of the prison service was and is wrong, and needs change. Although part of the Home Office, relations between the prison department and the Home Office were not good, and industrial relations were bad, as we saw last year. I welcome all that the right hon. Gentleman says concerning changes in the internal structure and in finance and management. I approve of the changes announced in the Prisons Board and of the sharpening of responsibilities of the prison organisation regionally.<br/>
Is the right hon. Gentleman farther aware that his acceptance of a separate inspectorate is a significant change? However, will he accept that without an improvement in the relationship between the trade union organisations, any changes will fail to have maximum impact? Without the full co-operation of the Prison Officers Association, which itself needs change, there will be further industrial troubles.<br/>
I set up the May committee to deal with organisational changes, but will the right hon. Gentleman accept that it was and is my strong view that there must be a radical reduction of the prison population? That needs political will. I do not believe that I was short of that, but I certainly did not have the strength of this House to implement the idea.<br/>
I welcome what the right hon. Gentleman says on alternatives to prison and what he says about the mentally ill. Money was provided for regional secure units a long time ago. The Health Service administrators have much to answer for over the delay, and the attitude of some staff is also responsible. The right hon. Gentleman's statement about what I understand are called " wet " shelters, which in this case are for alcoholics and not for dissident Cabinet Ministers, is an improvement, but little more.<br/>
Does the right hon. Gentleman really believe that the judiciary will oblige over shorter sentences? All Home Secretaries have asked for shorter sentences, yet more and more people are going to prison, which is not so in the remainder of Europe. The number of people on remand for


longer periods, about half of whom are then released, needs judicial action. Is the right hon. Gentleman aware that there is only one way forward, if variable in application? The one-third remission of sentence must be replaced by the half remission that I introduced in Northern Ireland and that this House approved. It will require changes in the parole system. The Home Secretary has a majority in this House to implement that radical change, or variants of it. I wish that I could have implemented the change. Without that change any proposals about prison organisation, and so on, will not go to the root of the matter. We are sending far too many people to prison. The judiciary will not oblige. We can deal with the problem only in this House.</p>

<p>I readily recognise that the opportunity to make the necessary changes in the organisation of the prison department within the Home Office and the various proposals that the right hon. Gentleman welcomed stem directly from his decision to set up the May committee. I applauded that decision at the time. I believe that it was entirely correct. It has helped in these changes. I also welcome what the right hon. Gentleman said about my reaction to what the May committee said about organisation.<br/>
I do not agree with the right hon. Gentleman over the question of shorter sentences and the judiciary. Recently there have been signs of an increasing feeling among judges that in many cases shorter sentences are appropriate. I hope that that feeling will develop.<br/>
With regard to the right hon. Gentleman's view about remission as in Northern Ireland, with changes in the parole system, I have made it clear that I am ready to consider many of these changes. However, I believe that they will be frustrating to, and disliked by, many who administer justice. There will therefore be opportunities for those people, in turn, to frustrate such changes if they are made, and it is important not to make them unless it becomes absolutely clear that they are essential.</p>

<p>The right hon. Gentleman's proposals for the Prisons Board and the inspectorate are welcome, but does he accept that the general response to his statement will be great disappointment over the opportunities that he has missed to make a radical inroad into the crisis in our prisons? He has not addressed himself to the problem of numbers, with about 45,000 prisoners occupying space designed for 37,000. About 11,000 prisoners are crammed two and three at a time into cells built for one. This year already, 150 prisoners have had to sleep in corridors and a further 150 have had to be held in police cells. The right hon. Gentleman's statement, fine words though it contained, is no solution to the problems of numbers, the mentally ill, alcoholics, drug addicts


and petty offenders. Will the Home Secretary accept that the judiciary is not looking after our prison system, and that this House and the Government must do so? A significant impact on the population can be made only by the immediate introduction of 50 per cent. remission.</p>

<p>That may be the hon. Gentleman's view. He says that the prison population is 45,000, but my figure of 44,000 was for 18 April, which shows that there has been a small downward trend. I said that the number fluctuated and that it was right to watch it carefully. I must tell the hon. Member that the measures that I have introduced, taken together, can have a significant influence on the prison population. Some of the measures that he puts forward would have considerable repercussions on the administration of justice. Such measures may be necessary, but I do not wish to take them in a panic, which is what the hon. Member is trying to make me do.</p>

<p>May I return to the issue of the figures? It is perfectly clear that we shall not have a prison population similar to that of Holland unless we change the sentencing strategy of the judiciary. We can do that only after clear consultations between the Lord Chancellor and the judiciary about the kind of sentencing tariff that the judiciary has. Meanwhile and urgently, will the Home Secretary look again at the question of 50 per cent. remission? He mentioned " panic ". We have been talking about this problem since Roy Jenkins was Home Secretary in 1974. That is not panic. There have been clear delays by successive Governments in getting to grips with a very thorny problem. However, it is a problem that must be tackled.</p>

<p>On the first point, the hon. Member will agree that there have

recently been signs, in some of the sentences and the way in which they have been imposed, that there is an increasing awareness that shorter sentences are appropriate for some offenders. The hon. Member will have seen evidence of that in the papers recently.<br/>
On the second point, of course I will consider the question of half remission, but I do not believe that it is necessary that I should accept it until it is absolutely certain that we will not succeed by other means.</p>

<p>While welcoming my right hon.

<p>The position of violent offenders is very much appreciated in the country, and certainly among the judiciary. It is not for me to comment on particular sentences, but I would have thought that the attitude of members of the judiciary to non-violent offenders shows that they are increasingly aware of the value of shorter sentences. From the judiciary's point of view, it is fair to say that it is seen to be very well aware of the need for long terms of imprisonment for violent offenders.</p>

<p>I welcome the Home Secretary's changes in administration and the devolution of power in the Home Office. I echo what has been said about his needing to be far more radical in his attitude to the prison population, if he wishes to cut that population. The May report dealt with many matters of substance, particularly in respect of prison officers and their role. In the statement nothing was said about the inconvenience or locality allowance. Will the Home Secretary tell us something about that? Also, will he help the voluntary associations that can assist in keeping people out of prison? Will he consider giving them some financial aid, which has not been available up to now?</p>

prison is the wrong place for the alcoholic and that help should be given to people through the " wet shelter " system, but does he not realise that that is only a small part of solving the problem of alcoholism?

<p>I have said that, as far as expenditure on these various measures is concerned, at a time of economic stringency I am continuing a prison building programme which, I readily recognise, was in many cases started by the right hon.

<p>Will my right hon. Friend bear in mind that the alternative to long prison sentences is not necessarily

short prison sentences, and that the possibility of taking other action, such as having the convicted criminal report three times a day to a centre, is worthy of being considered as a way of dealing with the problem?</p>

<p>Is the Home Secretary aware that many who will welcome his statement this afternoon find it somewhat quixotic that penal reform should be motivated by the need for economy? Does he accept that cutting sentencing for crimes not involving violence will not have a major impact on prisons such as Strangeways prison, in Manchester, which in the main caters for long-term offenders, many of whom have been involved in crimes of violence? In those circumstances, will he assure the House that money will continue to be found for improving conditions for both prisoners and staff at Strangeways?</p>

<p>I must not particularise on one prison or another, but I made it clear in my statement that in spite of a need for financial stringency, thanks to my colleagues I have been able to preserve a prison building programme which, while it may be modest, is certainly more substantial than for a very long time. I have also entered into considerable maintenance commitments. I recognise what the hon. Gentleman says, and I am able to spend some money. Naturally there is not enough; there has not been enough for many years. However, I am making some improvements.</p>

Projects such as Consortium, for detoxification units, have capital sums, but insufficient revenue to provide these services. Also, while Claiming that it is important to keep people out of prison who need not be there, could the right hon.

<p>My hon. Friend's first point would be more properly drected to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Social Services. For my part, I was making a particular point about money that I can provide on the prison front.

<p>I note my hon. Friend's view. I acknowledge her considerable experience in this matter. I still believe that if judges, by their own decisions, opt for shorter sentences, that will be a great help. I repeat that I see evidence that that is what they are doing.

In relation to the building programme, does he agree that it is clear that although he is doing more, perhaps, than others have done before him, it is inadequate? The intolerable conditions in our prisons&#x2014;for both inmates and officers&#x2014;must be dealt with, and dealt with rapidly.

<p>Chapter V of the May committee's report made a number of recommendations designed to improve the administration of the prison service in England and Wales. These recommendations covered the status and independence of the prison department within the Home Office; the structure of its senior posts; the arrangements for inspection; the organisation of regions and establishments; and the functions of boards of visitors. The following paragraphs set out the conclusions which I have reached.</p>

<p><i>Enhanced responsibilities of the Prison Department</i>.
<q>2. Under the Permanent Under-Secretary of State, the prison department will assume delegated authority for manpower and staffing matters affecting prison governors, prison officers and administrative and specialist staff serving in prison service establishments and regional offices, and certain professional, technical and other specialist staff serving at headquarters. These groups comprise virtually all those non-industrial staff who expect to spend a full career in the prison service. The prison department will also assume delegated responsibility for the day-to-day management of its finance. Work is in hand on the improvements in management accounting methods and financial information systems to which the May committee attached importance.</q>
<q>3. As the May committee recommended, there will continue to be a single principal establishment officer, responsible for manpower and personnel matters affecting the Home Office as a whole. A single principal finance officer will exercise similar responsibilities in relation to finance, and there will be a single accounting officer for all Home Office Votes.</q></p>

<p><i>Structure of Senior Posts</i>.
<q>4. The post of director general of the prison service will continue at deputy secretary level. The principle will remain that this and all senior appointments should always go to the best available candidate: it will continue to be held by the present holder of the post.</q>
<q>5. The deputy director general will occupy a position between deputy secretary and undersecretary. As head of the operational service he will be responsible to the director general for the operations of the prison service in the


field. The present controller (operational administration) will be appointed to the post.</q>
<q>6. Other senior posts will be the director of regimes and services, responsible for the planning and co-ordination of prison regimes, the prison building programme and the provision of services; the director of operational policy, responsible for policy and casework on the treatment of prisoners, the director of personnel and finance, responsible for personnel management, industrial relations and staff training, and also for manpower and financial control, including accounting and financial information systems; and the director of prison medical services, whose responsibilities will be unchanged.</q>
<q>7. The holders of these six posts will be members of the Prisons Board. The board will also include the four regional directors, in view of their operational responsibility for the prison service in the field; and two non-executive members, as recommended by the May committee, to bring to the board an independent viewpoint as well as their own particular knowledge and expertise. The appointments of the outside non-executive members will be announced as soon as possible.</q></p>

<p><i>Inspection</i>
<q>8. Appointments to the new post of Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons will be made directly by the Crown on the advice of the Home Secretary. The widest possible field of candidates will be considered.</q>
<q>9. The chief inspector will report to the Home Secretary and will be a member of the Home Office, but he will not be a member of the prison department or have any responsibility to that department. His terms of reference will be</q>
<q> To inspect and report to the Secretary of State on prison service establishments in England and Wales, and in particular on:</q>
<q>
<ol>
<li>(<i>a</i>) conditions in those establishments;</li>

<p><q>10. The chief inspector will conduct regular inspections of individual establishments and he will investigate particular incidents or situations on the Home Secretary's directions. He will submit an annual report, which will be published, and other reports, which will be made publicly available where appropriate. In accordance with the May committee's recommendation, individual grievances will continue to be dealt with under existing procedures.</q>
<q>11. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland has asked, and I have agreed, that the services of the Chief Inspector should be available to inspect prison establishments in Northern Ireland.</q>
<q>12. The chief inspector will be supported by a deputy chief inspector and by a small team, most of whom will be drawn from the prison service. Other professional or specialist support will be provided as necessary.</q></p>

<p><i>Regions and Establishments</i>
<q>13. The primary tasks of regional directors will be to secure the application of national

policy and to contribute to its formulation; and to ensure the proper functioning of their establishments and of the prison system as a whole. They will assume full management responsibility for their establishments, with direct accountability to the deputy director general and with the full support of headquarters. The casework at present done at regional offices is for the most part closely associated with the supervision of establishments, and most of it will remain, but specialist functions will for the most part be concentrated at headquarters as the May committee recommended. I recognise the value of the work which many of the staff have done while they have been at regional offices and their contribution to the prison service, but I am satisfied that their contribution can be made as effectively from headquarters in the future.</q>
<q>14. Establishments for women and girls will for the first time be brought within the regional structure; regional boundaries will be redrawn to remove some of the present anomalies; and the internal organisation of regional offices will be reviewed and standardised.</q></p>

<p><i>Boards of Visitors</i>
<q>15. I accept the recommendation that boards of visitors should continue to exercise both an adjudicatory and an inspectorial function. In respect of the latter they will continue to be concerned both with inmates and with members of the staff, but I share the view which most boards have expressed that their links with staff should remain informal. I shall give boards every encouragement to extend where practicable their establishment's involvement in its local community.</q></p>

<p><i>Further Action</i>
<q>16. The changes to which I have referred will be carried out within the existing staff resources of the Home Office. Those at headquarters should be largely completed by the end of July; those at regional offices will take longer. Organisational change cannot by itself provide a solution to the more fundamental problems of overcrowding and prison regimes, but the decisions which I have announced today should produce the more cohesive and effective management structure which is an essential basis for the wider but inevitably more gradual changes which are now required.</q></p>

<p>I beg to ask leave to move the Adjournment of the House, under Standing Order No. 9, for the puropse of discussing a specific and important matter that should have urgent consideration, namely,
<q> the forecast of a doubling of unemployment in Wales.</q>
This matter is specific, because a specific report was published yesterday, commissioned by the BBC and undertaken by the Institute of Economic Affairs at


the University College of North Wales, Bangor, which, incidentally, has been adviser to the Welsh Office on economic matters. It forecast that unemployment in Wales would increase to 172,000 by 1983. That compares with a figure of between 80,000 and 90,000 now and of 125,000 as the highest forecast which the Welsh Office has so far admitted.<br/>
This matter is important because we in Wales have grim memories of unemployment, and we have them in all parts of Wales. The forecast sees an increase in unemployment to as high as 29 per cent. on Deeside, with an average approaching 15 per cent. over the whole of Wales. The matter is important because we need policies that can respond to these needs, and it is interesting to note that 10 years ago this week my party published an economic plan for Wales which forecast a need for 177,000 jobs over the following decade.<br/>
This matter is urgent because decisions are now being taken on economic strategy which need to be reconsidered in the light of this report. It is urgent because factory closures are imminent in all parts of Wales and the Government are committed to reconsidering the development area status; and these decisions will be taken over the next few weeks. Not least, the matter is urgent because of the report this week that the British Steel Coroporation, in response to objections by two unions to the slimming down

proposals for the Llanwern and Port Talbot steelworks, is about to announce the total closure of one of those two plants. Finally, it is urgent because we had two months ago the annual Welsh day and we certainly cannot wait another six to 12 months before we have an opportunity to debate this matter and bring pressure on the Government to change their policies before it is too late.</p>

<p>I beg to move,
<q>That leave be given to bring in a Bill to amend the Land Drainage Act 1976; and for connected purposes.</q>
Although that long title has very wide scope in relation to land drainage, the proposed Bill has one very simple and narrow purpose, which is concerned with the amount of money which water authorities can raise each year to spend on land drainage.<br/>
The importance of land drainage is well known to all hon. Members who have constituencies in low-lying areas which receive water flowing down from upland districts. Heavy precipitation in recent winters has brought flooding to several parts of England and Wales, with rivers bursting their banks and much farmland remaining waterlogged.<br/>
Any expenditure incurred by a water authority for land drainage purposes is raised by precept on the county councils for the area in question in accordance with arrangements laid down in section 46 of the Land Drainage Act 1976. Perhaps I should point out that these arrangements are entirely separate from the charges which a water authority makes for water supply, sewerage and sewage disposal, for which in many areas general ratepayers are now receiving separate bills direct from water authorities, and nothing in this Bill will affect the level of those charges.<br/>
However, under section 46(5) of the 1976 Act, the amount which a water authority can precept on a county council for land drainage purposes is limited to 1&#x00B7;7 times the penny rate product for the area concerned. This limit can be exceeded only with the special consent of the local authority members of the relevant local land drainage committee. It is not surprising that in the present financial climate in local government such special consent is increasingly unlikely to be given. Consequently, the 1&#x00B7;7 factor written into the legislation now in force is beginning to impose an absolute cash limit on the land drainage expenditure of water authorities. I understand, for

example, that the 1&#x00B7;7 ceiling is already restraining expenditure on land drainage in Somerset and that without some legislative action that ceiling will be reached in many other counties in these times of high inflation. So the real value of land drainage expenditure will be reduced in inverse proportion to the rate of inflation.<br/>
Of course, the whole position would be changed if there were a general revaluation of hereditaments throughout the country, because experience suggests that such revaluations approximately double the product of a penny rate in any area. However, there is, at present, no prospect of such a revaluation while the Government are looking at the future of the general rating system as a whole. Consequently, the 1&#x00B7;7 factor written into the 1976 Act is, in effect, a rigid cash limit imposed by law, and inflation makes a nonsense of such a limit.<br/>
I have raised the problem with the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, whom I am glad to see on the Government Front Bench, and I was pleased to note what he said to me in a letter on 28 March:
<q> I accept that this is a real problem, but the difficulty is that it cannot be solved without legislation. I can only promise that we shall bear very much in mind the possibility of amending the present statute at the first suitable opportunity.</q>
My Bill is designed to provide just such an opportunity and I am hopeful that the Government will give it their blessing.<br/>
The detailed content of the Bill will give the Minister power to vary the 1.7 factor by order, subject to annulment by either House of Parliament. While I am not always in favour of extending ministerial powers, I think that the provision for such varying orders is the only sensible way of dealing with the problem that I have described.<br/>
I hope, therefore, that the Bill will be supported by the Government and by hon. Members on both sides of the House.</p>

<p>We spent a long time in Committee arguing the technicalities of the clause and I shall try to avoid doing so again at length, but it is essential that the whole House should have an opportunity to express its view on some aspects of what I regard as one of the meanest and most petty-minded clauses in this thoroughly obnoxious Bill.<br/>
We have listened on Report to many speeches by Conservative Members on the theme of the alleged oppression by trade unions of individual workers' rights. I do not pretend that things do not go wrong, that mistakes are not made and that wrong decisions, of which sometimes no one can be proud, are not taken. However, the case in that respect is grossly, indeed wildly and mischievously, exaggerated, and the legislative way is not the best way of resolving such problems<br/>
Throughout our debates there has been scarcely a peep from Conservative Members about the most retrograde and reactionary aspect of the Bill, namely, the insidious attack on individual workers' rights that the Government are callously and determinedly inflicting on working people.<br/>
We see it in the proposed repeal of schedule 11 and the removal of the limited statutory protection that the schedule


offered to low-paid workers, a large proportion of whom are women. One Conservative Member had the courage to speak out against the Government on that matter and, although he did not vote with us, it is to his credit that he did not appear in the Government Lobby either.<br/>
We also had an argument about the unfair dismissal proposals. Once again, the proposed changes will hit especially hard at low-paid workers, which again means many women. One might ask where the Tory voices were then in defence of individual workers' rights. Not one of the pin-striped Tory lawyers, who had been so vocal in other debates on workers freedom, could find his tongue to denounce the situation in which the freedom to exploit is being underwritten by the Government.</p>

<p>Clauses 10 and 11 hang together as part of an overall package that the Secretary of State should be ashamed to put forward as we enter the 1980s. Taken one by one, the changes to individual rights that are contained in the Bill could be camouflaged as having no great significance. But together they reveal an inescapable affront to working people and clause 10 is a prime example of the disastrous course that the Government&#x2014;the first in this country to be led by a woman&#x2014;are following on equal rights generally and women's rights in particular.</p>

<p>No doubt the Prime Minister feels that she has made it without recourse to statutory protection or assistance and has done it by, to use the old phrase, standing on her own two feet. That is back in fashion as a Tory catch-phrase. It is worth reminding the House that the

phrase was last made fashionable by the right hon. Member for Sidcup (Mr. Heath)&#x2014;and we all know what happened to him. This morning's broadcast illustrated again that the Prime Minister has an " I am all right, Jill " attitude to these matters.</p>

<p>The right hon. Lady and her Government show scant concern for the women who need protection and help in our still unequal society. The clause illustrates the Government thinking that a woman's place is in the home. That was perhaps best expressed by the Secretary of State for Social Services with that splendid quote:
<q> If the good Lord had intended us to have equal rights and to go out to work and to behave equally, he really would not have created man and woman.</q></p>

<p>I leave that to the House to judge. Of course, that attitude may be convenient for the Government. Their deliberate actions are forcing up the level of unemployment and they can argue that with more women at home there will be more jobs for men. That line is peddled irrespective of what women want or believe is best for them or, more important, what are their needs. It ignores rocketing inflation, soaring bills and family needs. It subscribes to the outdated view that most women go out to work for pin money, when we know that most women work to balance the family budget and that that is becoming an increasing necessity because of Government policies.<br/>
4.30 pm<br/>
I do not know why the Secretary of State should join in an attack on women. Perhaps he was overridden in Cabinet and had to go along with the majority. Perhaps events in recent months in the Cabinet have soured him towards women and turned him chauvinistic. I should not be surprised if that were so. That would be understandable, if not pardonable. Hard cases do not make good law and he has been dealing with a hard case.<br/>
I do not understand how the Secretary of State can pretend that he seeks to protect job opportunities for women when the Government's public expenditure cuts slash savagely child minding facilities,


play groups, nursery education and training courses for women. I do not understand how the Secretary of State can pretend that job opportunities are being protected or created.<br/>
An International Labour Organisation conference is planned for June to discuss measures to ensure equal opportunities and treatment for workers with family responsibilities. That will affect men but it will affect women to a greater degree. I hope that a British Minister attends that conference. I wonder what line the Government will take. Such a conference must be a huge embarrassment to the Government who will be able to offer little more than an apology or, more likely, a false prospectus.<br/>
The changes in the clause are in line with the Government's dismal approach to equal opportunity. They pay lip service to that concept while indulging in wrecking tactics. Ample research is available. Research from the Department of Health and Social Security and the Royal Commission on the Distribution of Income and Wealth, which the Government stupidly abandoned, show that working wives' wages have prevented a massive number of families from sliding into poverty.<br/>
The Government's case is that many employers are put off employing women because they believe that the provisions giving rights to working women who become mothers are too burdensome and lead to uncertainty. One must ask on what evidence the Government base their approach, which was outlined originally in the consultative document. In Committee the Under-Secretary of State gave us his supporting sources. He picked on aspects of the report from the Low Pay Unit. He was shot to pieces on that because the unit's overall evidence was adamantly against the Bill's proposals. That was a piece of ill-advised selectivity which I doubt that he will wish to repeat.<br/>
The Under-Secretary of State was selective when he referred to one aspect of the clause in relation to the Equal Opportunities Commission. The Commission firmly opposes this part of the Bill. The Under-Secretary also referred to his constituency postbag. He could produce nothing from it, not even on a non-attributable basis. However, he produced a curious letter from a headmaster. It is

best to draw a veil over that letter because it did not stand up to examination.<br/>
The Under-Secretary referred to the Association of British Chambers of Commerce in support of his case. However, on examination we discovered that the association produced not a scrap of evidence. It expressed pure opinion. With great difficulty the Under-Secretary of State scraped up a few facts which he did his best to distort in a vain effort to boost his case.<br/>
Not only have the Government no evidence to explain why they seek the changes in the Bill, but even the flimsy support upon which they fall back in their desperate attempt to justify their case emerged well after the presentation of the so-called consultative document which proved that their minds were already made up. Consultation was a sham.<br/>
There is evidence aplenty the other way. We produced it in Committee and I do not intend to go over it in detail today. There is evidence from the Opinion Research Centre study, commissioned by the Government and the Equal Opportunities Commission. A more recent survey based on questions to 261 organisations in the public and private sectors, showed that 83 per cent. of employers found that the maternity provisions worked well in practice. The few who thought otherwise had not experienced the provisions.<br/>
The clause will cause major complications for the woman who seeks to take maternity leave. In particular, the cumbersome notification procedures are bound to cause confusion and uncertainty, not only for employees but for employers. More and more women will safeguard their position when they understand the law. They will write to their employer and say that they are returning to work even when they know that they are not likely to return. Ultimately, employers will have little to thank the Government for in that respect. A consequence will be more form filling, more letter writing, more bureaucracy and more red tape for employers and employees.<br/>
Women represent well over 40 per cent. of the work force. For many women, especially for the ethnic minorities with language problems, there will be major difficulties in understanding the law.


Many such people could lose their rights by default. The Government have given no indication of the steps that they will take to deal with the problem. We have heard nothing from the Government except the pathetic suggestion, or pious hope, that the changes will somehow help employment opportunities.<br/>
One could use that argument to sweep away all protective legislation. We could use it to abolish health and safety laws and to get rid of the wages councils. Perhaps the Government are edging us along that path and this is the first step. One hears disquieting rumours about the future of wages councils, the wages inspectorate and the fair wages resolutions. We have questioned the Government in our debates on the Bill, but we have received no answers. They have maintained a studied silence.</p>

<p>Amendments Nos. 76 and 77 are an atttempt to tilt the balance back a little towards the woman employee. Perhaps the Under-Secretary of State will argue that 14 days' notice is unnecessary because of the phrase:
<q> or,... as soon as reasonably practicable ".</q>
I understand the argument, but it leaves the door open to further controversy. It would be preferable to formalise the extra week.</p>

<p>The Bill changes the final notification period before return to work from seven to 21 days. The Under-Secretary of State made a great meal of the EOC's arguments on this aspect, perhaps because he did not have much else to get his teeth into. The Commission's initial view was that the first notification before absence should not be tied to a loss of rights and that, as the final notification might be the only one, 28 days would be appropriate. That was the earlier proposition of the EOC.</p>

<p>The Bill now demands two mandatory notifications and another optional one. In view of that, I do not see the grounds for increasing the length of time before final notification.

<p>I think that seven days is quite enough for the employer who may now have two affirmations of a woman's intention to return to work. In Committee I argued

for the retention of the seven-day period and the Under-Secretary of State said that it was a matter of judgment as to what was reasonable notice. He rejected my view. I asked him to reflect and perhaps he has done so. If he is prepared to revert to seven days that will be fine. However, on the basis that it is unlikely that he will agree to that that the suggestion of 14 days is a compromise which the Government might be prepared to accept. However, I have to recognise that the Government are in no mood to make concessions even at the margins and I do not have much hope of them.</p>

<p>I return to my original question&#x2014;why are the Government proposing these changes? Of course, maternity benefits cost the Exchequer about &#x00A3;30 million a year. It may be, I suppose, that in the present penny-pinching atmosphere the Chancellor of the Exchequer has been scratching around in order to save a few million pounds. Perhaps he has been in touch with his right hon. Friend with whom he has such a cosy relationship. Perhaps it is also as well that the wife of the Chancellor of the Exchequer is no longer the deputy chairman of the Equal Opportunities Commission. One could say that she got out just in time to avoid embarrassment or, perhaps, she saw the writing on the wall.</p>

<p>For all that, I find it difficult to believe that public expenditure is the real reason for the proposed changes. I think we come back to the point about helping the employer at the expense of the employee. I do not believe that there is much in it for the employer, but this all fits into the Government package aimed at kidding the small employers as to where their political friends are while at the same time


hitting them as hard as possible in every other way. It is a con trick, but it is in line with the Government's dogmatic anti-worker approach which runs through this Bill.</p>

<p>The amendment to which we are speaking deals with a narrow point. I accept that. I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, Central (Mr. Grant) for presenting so cogently the difficulties which will face women generally as a result of the maternity and other provisions in the Bill that affect women. He highlighted the general attack on women which is being perpetrated by the Government.<br/>
There may be only 19 women Members of Parliament out of a total of 635 hon. Members and we may be in a minority. However, I remind the House that we are not in a minority in the country. We are a majority in the country because over 50 per cent. of the population are women. I am sick to death of being eternally referred to as being part of a minority group in the country. We are not and while I have no desire that we should take a stand or an attitude as a majority I wish that women were not lumped together in that way.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Islington, Central has already said that women represent over 42 per cent. of the nation's work force. That is true, but it is an unfortunate fact&#x2014;despite the rights we gained under the Labour Government&#x2014;that many of those women in the work force are in low-paid or part-time jobs.<br/>
I had hoped that, if there had been a Labour Government following the general election, we might have taken further steps towards providing better job opportunities and better job training for women. That would have made it easier for women to play their proper role. I am sure that I echo the feelings of my female colleagues in opposition when I say that I am grateful to our Conservative women colleagues who so stoutly opposed the attack on women's rights contained in this Bill during the Committee stage. I confess that I am always a little surprised that, when a Bill affects some aspects of women's rights, a woman Member is seldom put on to the Committee. It seems that when it does happen that it is an accident that a woman is on such a Committee.<br/>
One would have thought that the Committee of Selection would have thought it appropriate&#x2014;since there was a fair amount of fuss about the maternity rights provisions of the Bill&#x2014;to have put a woman on the Standing Committee considering it. I am not saying that I wanted to be that woman.</p>

<p>Indeed, I understand that. I am not suggesting that there have not been women on Committees considering Bills which affect women. I well remember, going back to 1974&#x2013;75, and the Sex Discrimination Bill, that a number of women were on the Committee considering that measure. It is remarkable that, when Bills closely affecting women are to go through the House, the Committee of Selection does not always think that it should appoint women Members to serve on them. There was one Bill, the exact title of which I have forgotten, but it concerned nurses and midwives&#x2014;an area

which involves a large number of women workers&#x2014;and no woman Member served on the Committee. However, I digress from the amendment.<br/>
The maternity provisions and other provisions in this Bill militate against and bear heavily on women not only in the work force, but in general. They severely limit the position and the protection of individual women workers. As we are in a vulnerable position in the work force, both as employees and trade unionists, the provisions in clauses 10 and 11 and in other parts of the Bill&#x2014;notably schedule 11&#x2014;are discriminatory.<br/>
I agree that this Government were not brought in on a mandate to force women back into the home. The Bill shows a definite policy trend and intention to do just that. Coupled with other actions of the Government over the past 12 months, including a number of policy speeches by Government Front Bench spokesmen&#x2014;which have resulted in a number of women being forced back into the home&#x2014;it begins to come through loud and clear to women that the Government believe that the woman's place is in the home, not in the workplace, whether she is in the workplace for economic reasons&#x2014;and many women are&#x2014;or because she wishes to pursue a career and life of her own.<br/>
I do not know whether the Government are aware of the fury not only of the EOC and of other organisations which specifically watch this kind of thing, but of the anger of a large number of women's groups about this attack on their rights. That fury is real.<br/>
The existing provisions regarding maternity pay and the right to return to work are very limited. In 1974&#x2013;75, when the Employment Protection Bill was on Report&#x2014;again, I did not serve on the Committee considering that Bill&#x2014;I remember sitting on the Government side with some of my then hon. Friends&#x2014;hon. female sisters I shall call them&#x2014;notably Mrs. Hayman and Mrs. Wise, who, both, regrettably, lost their seats, and the late Mrs. Millie Miller. We tried desperately to get our own Government to make the maternity provisions in the Employment Protection Bill, as it then was, more generous than they were. For example, we tried to get them brought more into line with the maternity provisions which prevailed in European countries.<br/>
I am sure that the figures that I am about to give are familiar to those who served on the Committee, because they must have been quoted time and again, France grants 16 weeks' leave with 90 per cent. basic wage. Italy has 20 weeks' leave with 80 per cent. basic pay. Neither has any qualifying period. In Hungary, women are entitled to five months' leave on full pay and a further three years with monthly cash allowances, followed by reinstatement wihout loss of seniority or penson rights. The <i>Employment Gazette,</i> from which I got these figures&#x2014;there are many others&#x2014;shows that no other EEC country treats small firms differently.<br/>
I see the hon. Member for Lancaster scribbling furiously. As she is an elected member of the European Parliament, we shall be glad to hear what she finds in her sojourns in Europe as regards the rights of women in those countries in this respect compared with the rights that we enjoy here.<br/>
Large numbers of women are excluded from the maternity provisions by the requirements of continuous service for two years with a 16-hour week or between 18 and 16 hours if continuously employed for five years. In 1975, 9 per cent. of women worked fewer than 16 hours a week. I am still talking about what we had before this Bill was introduced.<br/>
The present legislation makes no provision for paternity leave. There is a growing demand&#x2014;it will be even greater in future&#x2014;for paternity as well as maternity leave. Some firms already grant paternity leave. I understand that some of the smaller firms, perhaps with a more personal touch, tend to think about paternity as well as maternity rights.<br/>
The general provisions under the Employment Protection Act are quite small. For this Government to make them as mean as they are proposing is rotten. I re-read some of the debates at that time. I remember my own Front Bench&#x2014;we were then in government&#x2014;telling us that if in the following five or 10 years matters improved, they hoped that it would be possible to make the provisions more generous. I do not think that any Labour Member ever envisaged, whatever the economic situation, that those small maternity provisions in the Employment Protection Act would be decreased in the way that is now proposed.

The amendment relates to the mechanics of taking maternity leave. They are already cumbersome. One has to read carefully the small print regarding the date to make application and so on. It seems that the mechanics will be made more cumbersome and restricted. As I read the Bill, a women has to advise her employer in writing 21 days before she intends to be absent due to pregnancy. If she wants to return to work, she has to inform him three weeks before that she intends to do so. So she has two letters to write. She has to reply within 14 days to a letter written at any time 49 days after the birth asking whether she intends to return to work and then write three weeks before her expected return giving the date of her return and so on.<br/>
I can imagine a woman approaching her confinement, with all the other things that she has to do, trying to remember that, not later than 21 days before her expected absence from work, she has to write a letter to her employer. It may be that she wants to work an extra week. That is why we are trying to make these provisions less tough than they are. Why should the woman be tied so tightly in the way that the Government now intend?<br/>
When the woman has had her baby and has begun to settle down and to think about when and whether she wants to return to work, she has to think about all these various statutory periods within which she has to make application, to write to her employer, and so on. Such provisions underline the obvious fact that no man has gone through the trauma of having a child and the difficulties facing a mother after the birth of her child. I can imagine the difficulty in most households, with notes being pinned up on the kitchen wall reminding the woman not to forget to write to the managing director or personnel manager, or whoever, so many days after this or that, and at the same time coping with nappies, and so on.<br/>
It must also be borne in mind that before and after a birth a woman is often in a tense and emotional state, and she should not have to be put to the trouble at that time of making a decision within such a short time about whether she wishes to return to work.</p>

<p>Does not the hon. Lady also accept that


the employer has to make certain arrangements with the temporary staff that he may have taken on during the time the pregnant lady has taken off to have her baby? Is there not some obligation on the employer to make sure that he looks after the temporary staff? An employer in a small company may find it difficult to find temporary staff. Is it not right that he should know when the pregnant lady will return to work&#x2014;if she returns to work&#x2014;so that the temporary employee can make appropriate arrangements?

<p>The hon. Gentleman is making a mountain out of a molehill. The statistics show&#x2014;obviously the hon. Gentleman has not looked at them&#x2014;that the take-up of the existing provisions is very low. There has not been any hassle in small firms, as he suggests. Between April and September 1979 55,139 women were eligible to take maternity leave. Only 1&#x00B7;9 per cent. of women who take maternity leave receive maternity pay. Only 3 per cent. return to work. A recent Department of Employment survey showed that of 300 small firms, only 4 per cent. had granted maternity leave, and that none of those firms had found it troublesome. A decent employer who carries out the provisions of the law properly will be able to obtain temporary&#x2014;I stress temporary&#x2014;assistance during the time that the pregnant woman is away. Surely we do not have to stick to 49 days before or 21 days after in the tough way that the Government propose.<br/>
There is no justification for treating small firms differently, and for making women's rights dependent on something as arbitrary as the size of the firm. Why a work force of five? Why not a work force of 10, or one? It is purely arbitrary. It creates two classes of women workers&#x2014;those who work for small firms and those who work for large firms. There is enough discrimination without that. Some women will have maternity rights, and some women will have no maternity rights, depending on the size of the firm in which they are working. No other European country operates in that way.<br/>
The maternity fund was set up to ensure that all employers share equally the cost of a woman's right to take maternity

leave and to make sure that the burden does not fall on small employers or firms that employ mainly women. Apart from the additional harassment of women under the provisions of clause 10, the notification procedure will undoubtedly make it more confusing, and administratively difficult and cumbersome for the employer, particularly in a small firm where there are few people doing many jobs. These new provisions, with their tight timetables, will make it more difficult for small firms to obey the law properly. Surely that is the opposite of the Government's intentions.<br/>
I have been reading some of the reports of the debates on maternity provisions during the Report stage of the Employment Protection Act. I noted that the present Secretary of State for Employment showed a good deal of sympathy for treating women equally and without discrimination. I hope that that is his present attitude. I hope that he will not want to be seen to be discriminating against women. He showed a distinct thread of sympathy at that time.<br/>
As my hon. Friend for Islington, Central said, it is a bitter irony that the first woman Prime Minister of this country should be the first Prime Minister to snatch back so quickly and greedily those rights which women have won so hard. I remember a line in the woman's page of <i>The Guardian</i> which has stuck in my mind, and which I have quoted often. It said:
<q> Mrs. T. may be a woman, but that does not make her a sister.</q>
That may be right. She has shown no sympathy for the rest of her sisters.<br/>
I would have expected the right hon. Lady, as a woman Prime Minister&#x2014;or for that matter, any woman who is Prime Minister&#x2014;to have paid particular attention to the fact that women are so underprivileged in this country and so much in need of a helping hand to get them to a basis of equality with men. Tory Members do not seem to understand that once we achieve genuine equal opportunity and genuine equality of job opportunities, we shall hear no more about women's rights over men's rights. Only while women are so much the underprivileged half of the community will there be constant uprisings of women's groups demanding their basic rights as


human beings and women. Until Governments recognise that, and make considerable strides towards genuine equality, there will always be bitterness and frustration in at least half of the community. I hope that the Secretary of State will reconsider clauses 10 and 11 and show again his thread of sympathy&#x2014;the small amount of sympathy which I think he showed recently&#x2014;and not be overridden by the Prime Minister.</p>

<p>I rise to speak in support of amendments Nos. 76, 77 and 79. My hon. Friends have already referred to their suspicions about the reasons for the reduction in the maternity leave rights for women. Their suspicions are justified. Reference has been made to the speeches by Ministers in which it has been said that a women's place is in the home and that there is a need for the women to return to the home. Perhaps that should be tied up with the Chancellor's prediction to a Select Committee this week that there will be 2 million unemployed in the near future.<br/>
It would be extremely convenient for the Government if women were encouraged to return to the home, since they are aware that many women do not register and claim unemployment benefit, and, therefore, do not appear in the statistics showing the numbers of people unemployed. It would save the Government considerable embarrassment during their period of administration if women could be encouraged to remain at home and not to swell the ranks of the unemployed.<br/>
We know the kind of encouragement to women to return home that is made in the speeches of Conservative Members, and this is strengthened by legislative action of one sort or another. The Bill is an example of this. We can only believe that their actions result from fear and prejudice when we note the lack of evidence in favour of changes of this sort in the maternity leave provisions of the Employment Protection Act passed by the previous Labour Government. Neither the Department of Employment's own survey nor other surveys which have been carried out provide a single shred of evidence to justify these changes in the legislation. When the Department of Employment commissioned the Opinion Research Centre to carry out a survey in

reply to the first general question about which pieces of Government legislation impeded the progress of small businesses, only one out of the 300 or so firms questioned referred specifically to the maternity leave provisions of the Employment Protection Act.<br/>
There is no evidence, therefore, for changes of the sort which are embodied in the Bill. We can only, therefore, refer to fear and prejudice as the Government's reasons to justify the changes that they are seeking to introduce.<br/>
We have heard already from my hon. Friends how few women avail themselves of the maternity leave provisions. Between July 1978 and July 1979, out of over 10 million working women, only 11,600 took maternity leave&#x2014;about three women out of every 1,000. There is other evidence, in the surveys carried out by the Equal Opportunities Commission and by other institutions, suggesting that very small numbers of women take up the maternity leave provisions. I do not think that this is a good thing, and the reasons for it are not hard to find.<br/>
They are to be found in two areas, the first of which is the lack of provision for paternity leave. In passing, I emphasise the need for paternity leave, because the birth of a child into a family should be regarded not simply as the responsibility of the mother; the care of the child is a matter for both parents. It is important for both parents to be closely involved in the birth and in the first few weeks of the child's life. The lack of paternity leave and the lack of child care facilities make it impractical for many women to return to work after the birth of a child, however much they want and need to do so.<br/>
Reference has been made to the fact that working women provide wages which lift large numbers of low-paid families out of poverty. The survey of the DHSS indicates that the wives of low-paid husbands are generally more likely to contribute between 36 per cent. and 60 per cent. to the joint income than are the wives of higher-paid husbands.<br/>
I remind the House that we continually hear from Government spokesmen of the need to provide incentives for people to remain in work. The Government, by the Bill, are putting another obstacle in the way of those who may wish to return to


work. They are hitting particularly hard at the low-paid family and forcing that low-paid family to fall back on State benefits in the form of family income supplement and rent and rate rebates. Had the wife been able to return to work after the birth of her child with greater ease and security than the provsions allow, her wages could have lifted the family's income above the need for recourse to the family income supplement or to rent and rate rebates.<br/>
Once again we find that the Government's words about the need to provide incentives for work are a lot of hot air. The Government's aim is, to hit at the most vulnerable in society, in order to protect those whose interests they feel the need to protect, namely, the employers&#x2014;and particularly, as they claim, the interests of the smaller business man.</p>

<p>As the Government are seeking particularly to protect small firms and to encourage small firms to take on more employees, it would be interesting to know from the Government how many women of child-bearing age are employed in small firms of five or fewer than five people. Can the Minister provide us with the figures? Can he assure us&#x2014;since, no doubt, these provisions will go through unchanged tonight&#x2014;that his Department will set up a monitoring unit which will be able to tell us, say, this time next year that the numbers of women of child-bearing age employed by the small firms, as defined in this part of the Bill, have increased, and that therefore the changes have been successful? Or is this merely another piece of prejudice on the part of the Government, with the Government being unwilling to provide the information for which I have asked, or to carry out any monitoring system to find whether their claims about small firms being discouraged, by the maternity leave provisions, from taking on female employees are correct?</p>

<p>It would be interesting to have some hard information from the Minister on these points.

kind of fig-leaf justification for the changes to be introduced by this legislation.</p>

<p>My hon. Friends have, quite rightly, referred to the legislation as attacking the rights of women. They have expressed their surprise that a Government headed by a woman are determined to attack and to reduce the rights of women, for which some of my hon. Friends fought so hard during the latter stage of the previous Government. Yet ever since the Prime Minister's party came to power, everything that she has said and done has indicated her total lack of concern&#x2014;indeed, her contempt&#x2014;for women who have to use these statutory provisions in order to protect their rights.</p>

<p>I remember that, shortly after the Prime Minister's party was returned on 3 May, during Prime Minister's Question Time in the House she told us with great glee that she had had no need of the work of the Equal Opportunities Commission, and that she had managed to make her own way without the support of any organisation of that kind. Indeed, she turned then on other women who require the protection of the EOC and the protection of legislation of this kind, seeking to override that protection in every possible way.</p>

<p>The legislation will achieve two things. It will worsen the position of British women as compared with women throughout virtually the whole of the Community. Only West Germany requires, as a qualifying condition for reinstatement, that a woman must advise her employer at least four weeks before maternity leave begins of her intention to continue working. Even there the requirement is only to inform her employer of that intention on one occasion. None of the other member countries of the EEC has any such requirement. Indeed, they provide for return to work, and, in general, the maternity pay is better while the woman is away from work.</p>

<p>To raise our standards to those in the rest of the Community and to protect women from the activities of this Government we shall have to fall back on the provisions of the EEC directive adopted in 1978. Article 2 states:
<q> For the purposes of the following provisions, the principle of equal treatment shall mean that there shall be no discrimination whatsoever on grounds of sex either directly or


indirectly by references in particular to marital or family status.</q></p>

<p>In the context of rights at work, a woman's right to return to work after maternity leave should perhaps be compared with an illness. To ensure that a woman has those rights in a small firm, as defined in clause 11, and that she is not discriminated against through lack of knowledge of the provisions of clause 10 as they stand, the best that we can do is encourage women, through the Equal Opportunities Commission, to take their case to the European Court of Justice at Luxembourg. As with discrimination against immigrants, women will not be able to look to their Government to protect their rights but will have to appeal beyond that Government to the European Court of Justice. Once a case is judged in their favour in regard to that directive, the judgment will overrule the provisions of the Employment Bill and ensure that women have the required employment protection at law. I am consistently opposed to our membership of the Common Market, and I regret to say that women will have to turn to the European Court for the necessary protection. However, there is no point in looking to this Government for their rights, even though it is headed by a Prime Minister whom at first they might have regarded as a sister.</p>

<p>I have listened to my hon. Friends and to the eloquent silence on the Conservative Benches, and I shall be brief.<br/>
In the progress of reactionary regimes in the past three important points have been highlighted&#x2014;attacks on ethnic minorities, the trade union movement and women, and women working. I do not suggest that the Government are treading the path of pre-war reactionary Right-wing parties. It is for others to draw their own conclusion. However, they are following a path that is discriminatory in every sense of the word.<br/>
The Government should explain the demand that they say comes from small firms. In my constituency there are probably more small firms, factories and employers than in most others. I have endeavoured to find out whether these small firms are in difficulties because the small number of women of childbearing age whom they employ take advantage of the provisions that are to be eliminated. No one has complained.

I believe that what my hon. Friend the Member for Thurrock (Dr. McDonald) says is about the size of it. It is an attempt to discourage women from working. Although the provisions for maternity leave and return to work are isolated, their removal must be seen in the context of the Government's general policies. It is part of a campaign to remove from women the confidence that they have been gaining over the years that they can be the mothers and also work&#x2014;and many of them have to&#x2014;and still their children and homes will not suffer. It also gives the Government the opportunity to reduce the unemployment figures by making it more difficult for women to return to work and even actively discouraging them from working.<br/>
The Bill is more about that than protecting the interests of small firms. My hon. Friend the Member for Barking (Miss Richardson) has already given us the statistics for women returning to work and taking advantage of the benefits. If there were more women Members of this House, particularly women of child-bearing age, the Government could not get away with this. I am not in any sense anti-man. I almost took exception when my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, Central (Mr. Grant) said that possibly the Minister was so disillusioned with a woman in power that he had become anti-woman. Many of us have seen men in power and it has not made us anti-men, in spite of our views on the way that the Government have conducted our affairs. However, the men in this House who have wives and children and whose wives pursue careers are failing in their duty and being less than honest if they endorse the removal of these provisions.<br/>
Viewed in conjunction with the closure of day nurseries and the failure to expand nursery schools, which have been a basic provision so that women could go out to work, this can be seen as an attack on women's rights. There is no demand from the small employer to abolish the provisions. It is also a further insidious attempt to cloak the unemployment figures, which we know will soar in the next few months.</p>

<p>There were no women in the Committee which considered this Bill. We drew


attention to the absurd fact that those most affected by the maternity provisions were not able to object. That balance has been more than rectified today by the three excellent speeches of my hon. Friends. I am a man, and I know that my hon. Friend the Member for Eton and Slough (Miss Lestor) does not dislike me. It would be wrong for me not to add one or two words. For no good reason the Government are making it more difficult for women to benefit from the maternity leave provisions, which were included, after a long and hard-fought battle, in the previous Employment Protection Act.<br/>
These provisions will add to the bureaucracy and the difficulties that women face when they wish to return to work after taking maternity leave. They face considerable difficulties. Why should a woman have to write three times to her employer? Why should an extra burden be placed on her? This suggestion comes from a Government who are supposed to be against form-filling and bureaucracy.<br/>
5.30 pm<br/>
This tatty and unworthy measure will make matters more difficult for the woman who has a family and who wants to work, or is forced to work, for a small, local firm. The more skilled woman worker, who can work for a larger firm, will have greater rights. She will have, perhaps, the protection of employment legislation introduced by Labour Governments. The woman who has to work for a small firm locally will have fewer rights. Her disadvantages will be twofold. She will find that the Bill, when enacted, will be discriminatory against her. It will mean that the small firm that wants to recruit more skilled labour, especially more skilled female labour, will be unable to do so because women will be unwilling to work for such a firm if there is a possibility of working for a larger firm, even if that means travelling a greater distance.<br/>
For all these reasons I believe that the Government have unworthy motives. They wish to suggest that they are doing something to help small employers when in reality they are not doing so. They are introducing a measure that will add to the disadvantages that women face. The Government should be honest and with-

draw the clause. They should acknowledge that it should never have been in the Bill. It is tatty, unworthy and of no value to employers who, according to the Government, will benefit from it.</p>

<p>It is remarkable that not one Conservative Member has chosen to defend this attack on women's rights. It is especially remarkable that Conservative lady Members who were present have left the Chamber. No doubt they are ashamed of the clause and are not willing to defend it.<br/>
Surely the House should adopt the bipartisan view that we are here to protect the weaker sections of the community. I can think of no more vulnerable section than women having babies. Surely it should be a section that has cross-party support. I find it repugnant that a Parliament composed primarily of middle-class, middle-aged men chooses to reduce the rights of women in childbirth.<br/>
As my hon. Friends have said, it is necessary for a woman in childbirth to write three letters. If her employer writes 49 days after the birth of her child and if she fails to reply within 14 days, she will lose her rights. There will be no equality for women in industry unless they have these rights. Surely six weeks after confinement is far too early for a woman to make such a decision.<br/>
For example, the woman might have had a difficult confinement. If so, she will have other things on her mind. It may be that she is overwhelmed by the new life which has come into the family. Although as men we do not experience childbirth, we experience the wonderful event of the new child coming into the family. It may be that the woman is completely overwhelmed, especially if it is her first child. The new life will take precedence over everything else. In such circumstances, it is surely reasonable to accept that the woman may be uncertain at such an early stage about whether she wants to return to work.<br/>
There are many practical problems. For instance, will she be able to get a child-minder? Will it be possible to make suitable arrangements? It is intolerable to foist such a decision on a woman within six weeks of childbirth. We like to call ourselves honourable men, and I do not think that what I have described is an

<p>We have had a debate upon a clause that makes the most modest of adjustments to the rights of women to resume their work after they have had a baby. It has been spoilt by the extravagance of the language that has been used not only by the hon. Member for Islington, Central (Mr. Grant)&#x2014;rather uncharacteristically&#x2014;who spoke from the Opposition Front Bench, but by the hon. Members for Barking (Miss Richardson), Thurrock (Dr. McDonald) and Eton and Slough (Miss Lestor).<br/>
I remind the House of the nature of the protection that is given to women in these circumstances. If they have met the qualifying period of two years' employment&#x2014;I take this from the Act introduced by a previous Labour Government&#x2014;and if they wish to return to their work after they have had a baby, they must give notice not less than three weeks before they commence their absence, and again give

notice not less than one week before they wish to return to work, which may be up to 29 weeks after the date of confinement.<br/>
If they meet those conditions and the employer does not take them back into the original job, they will have a claim for compensation for unfair dismissal. That is the structure of the protection given by the current Act. It is against that background that we must consider the effect of clause 10.<br/>
Does the clause take away anything significant? Does it diminish in any significant particular the right of women to return to work? It does not. It merely states that we have to take account of the concerns of the employer and those of the replacement worker, permanent or temporary, when the employer may have taken on to fill the gap left by his female employee when she goes off to have her baby. That is the Government's sole purpose in introducing the clause.<br/>
I wondered whether it was in some spirit of burlesque that Labour Members spoke of a sexist attack upon women and a deliberate attempt to strike at those who are most vulnerable.<br/>
I remind the House of two things, one of which the Government have done and the other of which the Government have taken power to do in the Bill. Those two things are directly relevant to the debate. The Bill introduces a new right for women. [<i>Interruption</i>.] It is one thing for Opposition spokesmen to propose, when they have no ability to dispose. They did nothing about this provision when they were in power. It is another thing for the Government to make proposals. The Government have proposed that women should have time off from work, with pay, for as long as may be reasonable so that they may then go to a pre-natal clinic, where that is medically advised. How can that be said to be consistent with a sexist attack on women at their weakest?<br/>
I invite hon. Ladies on the Labour Benches to address themselves to reality. I admit that it is possible to put up some quite good arguments against the two clauses. However, any speech is disfigured that attacks the clauses&#x2014;despite the evidence&#x2014;in such extravagant language. We have already increased the maximum amounts of compensation for unfair dismissal. We have increased not


only the component which must be reviewed annually, but the component upon which there is no statutory obligation to do so. They have been increased by about 10 per cent. this year.</p>

<p>The previous Labour Government did not make the annual review of compensation awards a statutory requirement. However, they were reviewed last year and again this year. I do not wish to take a long time answering a point which answers itself. However, I do not wish it to be supposed that I am passing over the type of language that has been used in the debate. It is deeply offensive to the Government. That will not worry Opposition Members, but it is offensive to the Government and to those who have regard for the truth. I therefore ask the House to look at the effects of clause 10.<br/>
The present Act requires that the first notice should be given not less than three weeks before the woman begins maternity absence. The Bill makes a profoundly important change and states that that notice must be given in writing. If Opposition Members believe that that represents an attack on a fundamental human right, they have been leading pretty sheltered existences.<br/>
The clause states that the notice, which under present law has to be given not less than a week before the woman intends to come back, must now be given in writing. It must now be given in writing not less than three weeks before she intends to return. Does that represent a desperate attack on women at their weakest? The purpose of the clause is to bridge an enormous gap. A woman may take maternity leave 11 weeks before her confinement and she must give notice three weeks before that absence commences. It is then not until 28 weeks after confinement that confirmation of return is needed.<br/>
We must have regard to the interests of those who are taken on as replacements. We must also consider those who need to plan their businesses, and who need to know how they can fill a post. We are

not concerned simply about employers as employers. We have always made clear that we are concerned that we want employers to be able to take on more staff, including more female staff. Where possible, we wish to create more jobs and to encourage the establishment of new businesses.<br/>
5.45 pm<br/>
In our manifesto we said that we would review those parts of the Employment Protection Act that endanger the viability of businesses, particularly small businesses. I remind Opposition Members that a Minister in the previous Labour Government, the present Lord Lever, issued a warning a couple of years ago against allowing the Employment Protection Act to become an employment destruction Act. He gave that warning for just that reason.</p>

We must mitigate those anxieties, as far as is compatible, with the protection that we support.</p>

<p>It is nonsense to denounce an opinion as " rubbish ", just


because it conflicts with one's own point of view. As the House knows, my hon. Friend is a very conscientious and experienced Member of Parliament. Her remarks accord with a great deal of the opinion that we have received. One does not have to be hanged to hold the opinion that hanging is a disagreeable experience.

<p>Opinions have been expressed that have rightly caused anxiety. Those opinions became the subject of careful, independent research. However, there is no evidence to substantiate those opinions.

Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston (Mrs. Knight).</p>

<p>I have already mentioned that the ORC report indicates that 20 per cent. of the 301 companies polled considered that difficulties would arise from the obligation to grant up to 40 weeks' absence before reinstatement. This is not at the head and forefront of anxieties that affect small businesses. However, we cannot disregard it.<br/>
Our views have been borne out by the overwhelming support that we have received in our consultations. The measure has not been put forward without consultation. Indeed, I doubt whether any Bill in modern times has been the result of more consultation. There were working papers in July, September and February. If any hon. Member is interested, I shall gladly write to him, giving him an analysis of the response and support that we have had for this proposal.<br/>
The third and last thing that this clause does is to provide that if an employer so wishes, he has not less than seven weeks after the confinement in which to write to the employee and ask for confirmation of her intention to return to work. Then, within a fortnight, the employee must write back and say " Yes " or " No ". If she does not reply, she loses the right to reinstatement.<br/>
I acknowledge that a helpful suggestion was made by a number of Labour Members during Committee stage, when it was pointed out that there was a danger that that could constitute a trap unless the written request from the employer gave an explanation of what would happen if the employee did not reply&#x2014;that she would be put on notice that her rights would be lost. We accepted that, and we are putting that matter right in our next amendment. That is all the clause does. It does not remove a woman's right to return to work; it simply gives the employer a more reliable guide as to whether the right to return will be exercised. Unless that kind of assistance is given, it is our firm belief that fewer jobs will be available to women in these circumstances.<br/>
It has been said that while this provision does not actually take us back to the dark ages, it puts us in a position that is far worse than that to be found anywhere else in Europe. That is not true. With the possible exception of West Germany, we have by far the best record for the duration of maternity leave. In most European countries, and certainly within the EEC, female workers are expected to go back to work about the same time after confinement that we confer on an employer the right to send a letter asking whether the right to return will be exercised&#x2014;about seven weeks. Also, in many European countries, there is a requirement for notification in one form or another&#x2014;mostly in the form of a certification of confinement or pregnancy. Therefore, it is with some sadness that I note the extravagant language that has been used to condemn what is really a useful and moderate adjustment.<br/>
I was asked what sort of numbers were likely to be affected. If we assume that the proportion of women leaving to have a baby and qualifying for the right to return, which is about 1&#x00B7;33 per cent., is the same in very small firms of five or fewer employees as in the economy as a whole, then about 5,000 women in such firms will be affected each year. These matters are subject to considerable speculation and uncertainty.<br/>
I hope that I have said enough to indicate why these amendments, which interfere in a most marginal way with


the provisions of the clause, should be rejected.</p>

<p>I am sorry to disappoint the hon. and learned Gentleman, but I do not intend to say more on this matter. He talks about the modesty of the changes that the Government propose. He reminds me of the story of the wife who caught her husband in bed with the au pair girl. The wife complained that the husband made it all sound so darned reasonable. That has been the Minister's approach all along. He soft-soaped us all through the Committee, and he did so pretty effectively. He tries to make out that this clause is innocuous. But this is just part of a package, and that is our primary objection. The Minister even tries to persuade us that the clause is good for working women, and that it will create more jobs. That is patently dishonest. He also argued that it was good for employers, and to that extent there is an arguable case.</p>

<p>The hon. Member has just said that there is an arguable case from the employers' point of view. The more I listen to this Government, the more I am convinced that they know little about running small businesses. If a woman has time off from a small business to have a baby, the employer will not be communicating formally with her by letter. He will be in touch with her every week about income tax rebates and so on. He will want to know how the baby is, and he will probably want to help her during her pregnancy. She will probably pop into work to see her colleagues and tell them about the baby's progress. People running small businesses do not need these formal procedures or the exchange of letters. The Government have got it all wrong.</p>

<p>I agree with the hon. Member, but at least there is a more arguable case for the help given to the employer than that for the help given to working women. Until tonight I thought that there was only one woman&#x2014;the Prime Minister&#x2014;who was in favour of this clause. Now we find that there is another. The hon. Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston (Mrs. Knight) intervened briefly to express her approval.

But her intervention was based on hearsay and opinion, not hard evidence. Throughout the Standing Committee we received no evidence and no actual facts. I do not know why the hon. Lady did not make a speech and give us some evidence. We do not want to hear any more opinions and hearsay about small employers being adversely affected in this way.<br/>
I agree entirely with my hon. Friend the Member for Eton and Slough (Miss Lestor). I have had exactly the same experience in my constituency of small firms which have had no complaints at all about the operation of the maternity arrangements. If this clause is good for working women, why is every organisation representing working women against it? I am surprised that the Minister has not conjured up an association of Conservative women trade unionists to support his case. If he did, he would have to hire the proverbial Liberal Party taxi in which they could hold their meeting. The Minister has not provided us with any worthwhile evidence. He said tonight that he would provide an analysis of evidence based on the consultative document. Why did he not do that before? We should have had that sort of analysis during our Standing Committee debates. The Minister knows that there is no detailed evidence.</p>

<p>Perhaps I could give the hon. Member some evidence as an employer of female labour. I agree with the point put forward by the hon. Member for Rochdale (Mr. Smith) about the friendliness in small businesses. However, I like to have records, and all the clause does is to require notice in writing. That is very sensible, and it matters only if the employer and the employee fall out. It is not much good if an employee goes to a tribunal and says that when she went into the office to collect a woolly hat for her baby, she said that she hoped to come back.<br/>
6 pm<br/>
Of course, it helps the employer. To assist my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston (Mrs. Knight), certainly it is the case in my practice that we are pretty reluctant to take on girls to be typists or secretaries who are likely to have babies in the near future. It is


sad but true. It may be thought that I am terribly cruel, but if I lose one-twelfth of my labour force, which is one secretary, for 40 weeks or more I cannot cover that; I cannot get the experience or the continuing knowledge that a girl acquires. If I do that I suggest that there are thousands of others who do it as well.</p>

<p>I take the hon. Gentleman's point, but what he has not done is to provide us with any evidence or indeed confirm that he has actually experienced difficulty. That is the point I was trying to make. We have not, in fact, had any evidence of difficulties experienced by employers as a consequence of existing legislation.<br/>
The small employer argument is little more than a con trick. I accept what my hon. Friend said&#x2014;indeed it is what I said earlier&#x2014;that this is very much a method of helping to cloak the unemployment figures by trying to keep more working women at home.

<p>I beg to move amendment No. 83, in page 12, line 8 leave out ' five ' and insert ' three '.<br/>
The essence of clause 11, although by no means its only objectionable aspect, is the creation of a two-tier system. In dealing with this matter in Committee, I went into considerable detail about the great weight of evidence against the Government's case. I do not want to repeat that this evening. However, I ought to mention some of the bodies which have criticised the Government in respect of this clause, because they are many and varied. They include the Equal Opportunities Commission, the Royal College of Nursing, the National Council for Civil Liberties, the Low Pay Unit, the Conservative trade unionists, the Equal Pay and Opportunities Campaign and the Institute of Personnel Management.<br/>
Perhaps I can refer to what the latter body said, because the Institute took the view:
<q> It is potentially the most damaging of all the proposed amendments to existing maternity rights and deserves the strongest opposition ".</q>
Of course, the Department of Employment had the benefit of the results of the Opinion Research Centre survey, which has already been referred to in our debates. I think the findings indicated that there should be no change. The evidence from various employers' associations on the effects of employment legislation produced precisely nothing to indicate that the maternity provisions were damaging to recruitment, employment or to the conduct of their businesses.<br/>
The Association of Independent Businesses, the Forum of Independent

Businesses, the National Federation of Self-Employed and Small Businesses all carried out surveys of one kind or another, or submitted documents of one kind or another, which had no real criticism based on actual evidence of the harmful effect of the maternity provisions. Of course, a survey by the Small Businesses Bureau supported the Government's view, but I think that even the hon. and learned Gentleman accepts that that asked somewhat leading questions. Of course, we know that that is an organisation which is closely linked to Conservative Central Office.<br/>
Therefore, there has been no independent view that these provisions should be changed in the way in which the Government propose. There has been no worthwhile evidence at all to support the exemption of small firms or the other changes which are envisaged. Far from encouraging employers to take on more women, as the Equal Opportunities Commission has pointed out, I think that women of childbearing age may be much more reluctant to work for small firms. Thus, the employers' range of potential employees will be reduced.<br/>
Quite apart from the two-tier aspect, this clause is riddled with a number of unsatisfactory phrases, and they are important phrases. There are the terms " suitable " alternative employment, " not substantially less favourable " and " not reasonably practicable ", all of which would cause problems of interpretation for industrial tribunals making judgments and would very probably lead to inconsistencies in their decisions. Indeed, I think it would be very difficult for tribunals to reach consistent decisions on the basis of the legislation as it will stand if the Bill goes through unamended.<br/>
The Equal Opportunities Commission said this of the Bill:
<q> The changes in maternity rights put forward in the Bill erode the principle that the


maternity rights package was intended to protect women from disadvantage in employment when they took time off to bear children. This principle has been breached by allowing employers to offer women returning to work jobs which could be less favourable than their original jobs.</q>
The Equal Opportunities Commission is very clear about its attitude to these clauses of the Bill, and of course it does include employer representatives as well as trade union representatives, which ought to be borne in mind by the House.<br/>
In Committee I referred to a special survey of small businesses carried out by the Conservative-controlled Greater London Council, and subsequently my hon. Friend the Member for Newham, North-East (Mr. Leighton) referred to an updated version of that survey when we pursued our debates on this on the Floor of the House. Again, there was no evidence at all in that survey that any of the small firms were really bothered at all about maternity rights.<br/>
I have said that the two-tier argument is the essence of this clause, and of course it is. The Government's consultative document conceded that a two-tier system was undesirable&#x2014;that is what it actually said&#x2014;yet this clause creates this special category of firms with five or fewer employees which have this special exemption. The employer has only to show that it was " not reasonably practicable " to offer the same job back or to offer one " not substantially less favourable ".<br/>
We on the Opposition side of the House want the whole clause to go but, recognising that there is scant chance of the Government budging in that respect, we are trying by amendment No. 83 to minimise the damage as much as possible.<br/>
As the Government have moved since the publication of the consultative document from the figure of 20 or fewer down to the current figure of five or fewer employees, we are now seeking to reduce the figure still further, to three. I accept at once that that is an arbitrary figure, but so is the Government's figure. They have never at any stage, so far as I am aware, sought to justify the figure of five, and the reason is, of course, that they know full well that no such distinction should be drawn at all.<br/>
I have referred to the small firms exemption, but the rest of the clause is

equally objectionable, and it all hangs together. In particular, there is the part about reinstatement, which talks about the offer of " suitable " and " appropriate " alternative work. The conditions here are very loose and ill-defined, and I think they will worry any woman leaving work to have a baby and hoping to go back to her job. They would create very considerable insecurity. At least if our amendment were accepted fewer women would be disadvantaged in that way.<br/>
There is also the word " substantially ", which, again, will offer opportunities for endless wrangling between the employer and the employee, and ultimately cause difficulties for the tribunals. The Government keep telling us that they do not want to create uncertainty, yet in this Bill they have gone on creating more and more uncertainty, clause by clause. They are hiding behind the tribunals and saying " Leave it to them ". The hon. and learned Gentleman made that his theme for much of the Committee stage of the Bill. " Leave it to the tribunals, which are experienced in these matters," he said. In practice what the Government are doing&#x2014;albeit the experience of the tribunals is considerable and we have great faith in them&#x2014;is making the tribunals' job very much more difficult.<br/>
We do not know what all this would mean in terms of job opportunities. Again, the hon. and learned Gentleman has come back to that tonight and given it as the reason for the changes. But there has been no real research on that and no attempt, as far as I am aware, to estimate the effects on job opportunities. I would have expected there to be some such research if the Government were seriously trying to make out a case instead of just groping along. Nor, until tonight, have we had any estimate from the Government of how many women would be adversely affected. I am a little surprised by the figure of 5,000 which the hon. and learned Gentleman gave, although perhaps we are not making quite the same comparisons. I did remind the Standing Committee that when the present Government, then in opposition, were proposing to exclude from the requirements of the Employment Protection Act 1975 employers with fewer than four employees the Department of Employment advised Ministers&#x2014;and I am indebted for this information to my right


hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster (Mr. Walker)&#x2014;as follows:
<q> The right is an individual one and it would be wrong to deprive an employee of these rights just because she happens to work for someone who has very few employees. To apply such an exclusion could deprive a large number of women, perhaps as many as half a million, of those rights.</q>
That was the advice which the Department of Employment gave to Ministers in the previous Government.<br/>
That figure of half a million was based on the exclusion figure being four, so I would have thought it must now be more because the figure the Government have picked on is five. We know also that both the percentage of women at work in terms of the total work force and the actual number of women at work have increased, and I would have thought it would not be unreasonable to talk about three quarters of a million women at least being adversely affected&#x2014;or potentially so; perhaps that is the difference between the figure the hon. and learned Gentleman gave and what I am trying to establish, which is the number of women potentially adversely affected as a consequence of these two clauses of the Bill.<br/>
I wonder what advice the Minister has had from his officials this time, whether officials have changed their tune and, if so, why. It seems rather unlikely. I would have thought it much more likely that the advice the officials have given has been disregarded. I would not pretend that an employer will never experience difficulty when an employee takes maternity leave. It would be silly to suggest that. But the Government have, as always in this Bill, chosen an arbitrary figure. I think it is fair to ask whether an employer with five workers who has one absentee on maternity leave will be more disadvantaged than an employer with 10 employees who has two of them on maternity leave, which is a quite possible situation. So it is an arbitrary figure, and the fact is that employers have overcome these difficulties, in so far as they are difficulties, in the past and can continue to do so. But I think they are minimal difficulties and have been unfairly and indeed grossly exaggerated by the Government in trying to make their case. They should not be going along this road of a two-tier system at all. We are talking

here about individual rights and they really cannot be denied simply to suit the convenience of a particular employer at a particular time.<br/>
In Committee the Under-Secretary claimed, in connection with this clause:
<q> wide support for what we propose in the Bill". [<i>Official Report, Standing Committee A,</i> 13 March, 1980; c. 1234.]</q>
He gave a very full response to the debate, which I read very carefully subsequently in the <i>Official Report</i> and in that response he did not offer a jot or tittle of evidence for that particular phrase claiming support. I think that if ever the Government have scraped the barrel to justify legislative change they have certainly done so on clause 11.<br/>
I have spoken of a two-tier system but I think we can really talk about three tiers. First, there are women with reinstatement rights who will be aware of those rights and will use them whether or not they intend to return to work. They will use the situation to safeguard their position, and this will create uncertainty, not least for the employer. Secondly, there will be those who simply will not understand the complication and they will be deprived of their rights for that reason, so that effectively they will lose them by default. Thirdly, there will be those in the small firms who will effectively again be without rights at all. I must say this is very strange behaviour for a party which proclaims itself so often as being in favour of the individual. That claim is exposed as being phoney and a sham.<br/>
6.30 pm<br/>
It is not maternity rights or any other provisions in the Employment Protection Act that are hitting job opportunities or small businesses; it is the policies of the Government and high interest rates. We have seen today the latest CBI survey on industrial confidence. Those, and all the other problems reflected in plummeting business confidence, and the forecasts of startlingly high unemployment, which are made with increasing regularity, are hitting firms, not least small firms, hardest.<br/>
The Government are not fussy about the scapegoats they pick. In the Bill it is not just the unions, but, far more important, individual working people. In this clause, the Government have picked


on working women. In view of that, it is not unreasonable to suggest that Conservative Members are a hollow and hypocritical bunch and I do not know how they can call themselves freedom fighters.</p>

<p>I find it obnoxious that the Government should legislate for inequality before the law and to create two classes of citizens, one group with one set of rights and another with fewer rights.<br/>
The Under-Secretary said that no previous piece of legislation had been canvassed more widely or had been the subject of wider consultations, but my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, Central (Mr. Grant) has given us a long list of organisations, including Conservative trade unionists, who oppose the clause.<br/>
I wish to return to the survey, conducted by the Department of Employment, of 301 firms employing fewer than 50 employees. Two-thirds of the sample employed 10 or fewer workers. Only 4 per cent. of that sample had experience of holding a job open for a pregnant woman for 40 weeks and only 2 per cent. had given maternity pay. It is clear that only a miniscule proportion of women claim these rights. No firm had found any difficulties.<br/>
The Under-Secretary relied on the fact that 20 per cent. of the firms in the survey thought that holding a job open for 40 weeks could prove troublesome for the future. The hon. and learned Gentleman rested his whole case on that. But surely that finding is based on speculation and not on experience. Not one of the firms with experience of this matter believed that it caused any problem.<br/>
Another fact shown by the survey was that only 11 per cent. of those polled knew that there were any maternity provisions. Only when prompted and asked whether holding open a job for 40 weeks might cause problems did they reply " Yes, perhaps it could." That is not really convincing evidence. There is no evidence from small businesses that the maternity provisions are worrying them. What concerns those businesses are interest rates, VAT, lack of orders and so on. They are not concerned about the maternity provisions. It is unworthy for the Government to legislate on such slim evidence.</p>

<p>Under the present law, a woman who qualifies for the right to return must be given her original job back unless it has disappeared for reasons of redundancy. If she is not given her original job back, she may put in a claim for unfair dismissal.<br/>
The clause is intended to tackle the difficulties that employers face in holding open the woman's original job for up to 40 weeks, and the problems that they face on her return. Of course, many employers cope with the problem by taking on temporary replacements who can be readily dismissed on the woman's return, because they will not have served long enough to qualify for unfair dismissal compensation.<br/>
As I said in our previous debate, we have to spare some thought for the women who can be dismissed with little warning, no matter how good a job they may be doing. Although the employer is likely to be merely uncertain about the woman's return, much more turns on the matter for her replacement. The main point of the clause is to cater for those situations in which it is not possible to recruit a temporary replacement and when permanent employment has to be offered to the person covering the absentee's job. At present an employer has to choose between facing an unfair dismissal claim from the woman on maternity leave or breaking the undertaking that he has made to her replacement.<br/>
The clause sets out to do two things. As for the reference to suitable alternative employment, any employer who finds it not reasonably practicable to take the woman back in her original job can offer an alternative, provided it is suitable.<br/>
The hon. Member for Islington, Central (Mr. Grant) expressed anxiety about the wording, but the formula in the clause is taken from the previous Government's 1978 Act, which replaced a provision in the 1975 Act concerning the right to return to work in the case of redundancy. Section 45(4) of the 1978 Act sets out the description of the alternative job that has to be found. I am advised that it has not caused difficulties to tribunals and we believe that it is important that the same formula should be applied in the Bill.<br/>
The formula will give employers who have alternative jobs to offer much more flexibility in making their arrangements


and, at the same time, keep the employees' links with their old jobs. I emphasise that an employer can take advantage of that flexibility only if he or an associated employer has suitable alternative work to offer.<br/>
I turn to the limited exception for very small firms, with which the amendment is concerned. There is only one exception to the general rule. If a firm with five or fewer employees cannot keep open the original job and has no suitable alternative to offer, either in that firm or with an associated employer, it may be exempted altogether from the obligation to reinstate the woman. However, if that is to apply the employer will have to be able to show, first, that it was not reasonably practicable to offer the woman her original job and, secondly, that it was not reasonably practicable to offer a suitable alternative.<br/>
It is only right that the small firm that is genuinely in that position should be relieved of the burden of the reinstatement provision. Those who say that our proposal is damaging to the interests of women employees must surely ask themselves what the position would be for a small firm. Its choice would be either to pay perhaps substantial compensation for unfair dismissal, which it might be unable to afford, or to take the woman back in her original job when that was not reasonably practicable.<br/>
When dealing with a firm employing only five or fewer employees, which will therefore probably be among the most fragile of firms, compelling it by law to do something that is not reasonably practicable and that would have a significant effect on its operations would create great danger to the future viability of the firm and the viability of the jobs of those whom it employs.<br/>

<p>heeding what has been said to them and, in forming their judgment, the question whether, by making the adjustment for very small firms, they will be encouraging the creation and maintenance of jobs in those firms and the creation of new firms. The arguments on that aspect of the clause are the same as the arguments put forward on the previous clause. I heard what the hon. Member for Islington, Central said and he heard what I said. I suspect that neither of us will convince the other by repeating what has been said.</p>

<p>We believe that our proposal will stimulate employment. The figures that I was asked for are based on an assessment of the number of employers with five or fewer employees. About 1 million people are employed in small firms. About 40 per cent. of them&#x2014;about 400,000&#x2014;are women. The 1&#x00B7;33 per cent. figure that I gave in the last debate amounts to 5,000. The 500,000 referred to by the hon. Member for Islington, Central is derived from the same assessment that produces the 400,000 figure that I have just given. The 1&#x00B7;33 per cent leads to the 5,000 figure.</p>

<p>Of course, we wish to avoid two classes of employee. As a result of heeding what was pressed upon us strongly, we reduced the application of the special exemption from firms employing 20 people to firms employing five. I agree that five is an arbitrary number. However, it is the number adopted by the last Government in their application of the Sex Discrimination Act. We feel that it is sensible. We stand by that judgment. We believe that three would confine the special exemption too closely. For those reasons, I advise my right hon. and hon. Friends to resist the amendment.</p>

<p>I beg to move amendment No. 16, in page 15, line 32 at end insert
<q>'and in section 15(3) (which specifies the number of relevant days for the purposes of the said section 15(2) for the expression " not exceeding five " wherever it occurs there shall be substituted " not exceeding two ".'.</q>
The amendment concerns the subject of guarantee payments. It is a simple, moderate and sensitive measure, and as the Government are a moderate, if not to say simple and sensitive, Government I hope that they will be able to accept it.<br/>
On both sides of the House and in the country there has been concern for a long time about the different conditions of employment between white-collar and blue-collar workers. The situation has been divisive, discriminatory and to an extent degrading, in that whereas white-collar workers&#x2014;in nineteenth century terms&#x2014;have been looked upon as valued members of the company, some blue-collar workers have been looked upon as a brutal and inconsequential group of hired hands, liable to be picked up and put down at the whim of management.<br/>
The previous Labour Government introduced the concept of guarantee payments and I believe that many people had sympathy with the measure at the time that it was introduced. Of course, circumstances change and the period that was initially envisaged was five days. There are now problems, because industrial and commercial circumstances are changing and the Government, being aware of those problems, have made a change in the provision. The five days does not now apply for three months from the start of any particular month. The measure stipulates five days within any 13 consecutive weeks. That means that the liability for guarantee payments will be slightly less than it was before.

No doubt the Government are introducing this proposal for good reasons and no doubt there is secure logic behind those reasons. I seek to extend the logic of what the Government are attempting to do by reducing the guarantee payment period in any consecutive 13 weeks from five days to two days. I shall explain why.<br/>
At the moment some of our industrial companies are faced with severe problems. Over the last year sterling has increased in value against other currencies by about 20 per cent. At the same time, our cost of living has risen at a higher rate than the cost of living in other countries. Therefore, for many of our manufacturers&#x2014;some of whom are threatened by import competition and some of whom are operating in overseas markets, as important exporters&#x2014;this is a difficult time for marketing their goods.<br/>
In those circumstances the companies most likely to be affected by guarantee payments are the very companies now in difficult circumstances, because they have not got the markets and the throughput. In many cases they also do not have the cash. If, given that unfavourable state, they need to lay people off because there is no work and at the same time have to find guarantee payments out of their limited resources, at a time of high interest rates&#x2014;though it looks as though they will come down&#x2014;some of those companies will go under. Some of them are bound to die, though others are viable and will recover. The additional burden of having to make guarantee payments will tip some of those companies over the edge and some potentially viable companies&#x2014;which would last out the storm, recover, grow and create more jobs&#x2014;will, unfortunately, be destroyed.<br/>
I accept that the original measure was a sensitive and humane one. People less charitably disposed to the Opposition than I am might say that that measure was the Danegeld paid by the previous Labour Government to the industrial vandals at Congress House. I believe that it was a humane and sensitive


measure. However, continuing with that measure in its present strength could be destructive and damaging. This, after all, is an employment Bill.<br/>
There are great pressures on some of our fine, young, small and medium-sized companies, which have great potential. Those companies could, in a short time, topple over the edge of the ravine into that area presided over by the liquidator and the receiver. As this is an employment Bill I think that the Government would wish to prevent that happening wherever they could.<br/>
I await a sympathetic hearing from my right hon. Friend. I await what he has to say before deciding whether I wish to press the amendment to a Division.</p>

<speech hansard_id="1744358" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1980-04-30a.1455.0" hansard_membership_id="3744" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/32564" speakername="The Secretary of State for Employment (Mr. James Prior)" colnum="1455" time="17:15:00">
<p>My hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, North (Mr. Marlow) moved his amendment in a reasonable and sensible manner. With him, I entirely take the point that until recently there was a great difference between blue-collar and white-collar workers. There were many instances where white-collar workers were covered by some form of guarantee payment. A number of blue-collar workers were covered, but by no means all.<br/>
The basis of guarantee payments&#x2014;let us face the fact that we are talking of five days in a three-month rolling period&#x2014;is to try to move towards a concept of single-status companies. I am a great supporter of single-status companies. One of our industrial relations problems is that we have differing degrees of status for different types of employee in a company. That quickly creates bad blood. I am glad that my lion. Friend supports the concept of the single-status company.<br/>
7 pm<br/>
We believe that five days of guaranteed pay in any one three-month period is not an unreasonable burden for a company to bear, particularly since the current maximum daily rate is set at &#x00A3;8 a day. It is not by any means high. That is the maximum that could be claimed.<br/>
My hon. Friend referred to a company getting into difficulty and going on to short time or otherwise having to make people redundant because it could not

afford to employ them. That situation could be covered by the temporary short-time working scheme. From what my hon. Friend said, I think that it would be better if such cases were dealt with in that manner.<br/>
As for the reduction from five days to three days in a three-month period, we believe that a good employer will want to give his employees that sort of basic protection. It is pretty basic. It is not a great protection. Of course, it does not apply when there is a lay-off, or when the short time results from a trade dispute involving any employee of his employer or of any associated employer.<br/>
It seems to us, and from what my hon. Friend said, that many good companies would regard cutting back on the guarantee payments in this way as a retrograde step and would not wish to support it. I believe that for these reasons it is wise for us to stick to the five days in three months.<br/>
As my hon. Friend said&#x2014;I think that I should tell the House again&#x2014;we made a change in the arrangements. At one time the year was split into four quarters. We realised, particularly during the lorry drivers' and steel disputes, that as the quarter ended at the end of January and the next quarter began at the beginning of February, it enabled a guarantee payment to be made for 10 days in a comparatively short period. We thought that was going too far. Therefore, we have now made it a rolling three-month period.<br/>
At one time employers were not happy that there should be a rolling period. They wanted a fixed period. We consulted widely on the point, and from that consultation it became clear that there was almost complete support among employers for the rolling period proposal. That is why we inserted it into the Bill this time round.<br/>
I hope that my hon. Friend will not feel that he ought to press his amendment to a Division. We believe that five days in any three-month period is not an unreasonable period to be covered by guarantee payment provisions. Many employers already have considerably higher guarantee pay arrangements than that. This is setting a fair, reasonable minimum.<br/>
Despite what Labour Members have said, we have been trying to be fair as


between the rights of employees and employers. Because we felt that the balance was wrong, we have been, as it were, shifting the balance of bargaining power back in favour of the employer. The Government believe that to go to the extent of reducing the lay-off guarantee payment from five days to two days in three months would be shifting it too far back and too much against individual employees.<br/>
For those reasons, I hope that my hon. Friend will not press his amendment.</p>

<p>We come now to the important provision relating to picketing. This part of the Bill causes the greatest concern. There are parts of the Bill which I find squalid, such as the maternity benefit. Somewhere, on balance, the judgment might find favour with the Government. But on this matter there is a clear division of opinion. I find the provision about picketing very suspect.<br/>
What concerns me most is the matter that I have raised in amendment No. 19. My concern in amendment No. 18 is to ventilate and discuss the issue. I do not intend to press the matter. But amendment No. 19 is at the very crux of the dispute that I have been having with the Secretary of State since Second Reading. I feel that there is considerable danger for the future implicit in the wording of clause 15&#x2014;a danger which so far the Secretary of State has not accepted. However, as I shall seek to indicate, the Attorney-General seems to agree with me.<br/>
First, I should put the matter in context. The right to strike is an inevitable part of a free society. If we were forced to go to work against our will, it would be a slave society. We pride ourselves on the right to strike. But the right to strike would be an empty charade if there were not also the concomitant right to picket.<br/>
The argument that is going on about clause 15 concerns how extensive the right to picket should be. The Government accept that there should be a right to picket one's own place of work. The question is whether it should go further.<br/>
There is some ambiguity in the present position on the Bill since the Government have outlawed secondary action outside the first customer's premises. Yet, it is not possible within the context of clause 15, as drafted, to picket the first customer's premises. That seems a little odd. It suggests that the Minister has some difficulty in combining all the factors which have been in his mind in trying to limit the right both to secondary picketing and secondary action.<br/>
What ought to be clear now, after all the discussion, is that the right to picket did not have any particular geographical restraint before the introduction of the Bill. The so-called secondary picketing, which has caused so much concern in the past 12 months or so, was a phrase which came into being only in that period of approximately 18 months. Before that it had always been accepted that people could picket places other than their place of work if that seemed to be a proper exercise of the power in furtherance of a trade dispute. For many good reasons, into which I shall not go now, there are reasonable grounds for accepting that it is in furtherance of a trade dispute to picket somewhere other than one's place of work.<br/>
The right to picket has never been drafted in English law as a right. Indeed, very few of our rights are drafted as positive rights. We are entitled to do anything that we are not prevented from doing by law. The right to picket has been a statutory immunity since 1906. It is an immunity from prosecution or from civil suit in relation to the activity that one is pursuing. It has been so drafted in all legislation since 1906 until this Bill. Indeed, in this Bill it is declared to be lawful to do something which otherwise might be unlawful.<br/>
In the leading case of Hunt v. Broome in the House of Lords, Lord Salmon said that but for the appropriate section which was being considered at that time
<q> The mere attendance of pickets might constitute an offence under... the Act of 1875 or under the Highways Act 1959, or constitute a tort, for example, a nuisance.</q>
Therefore, the section gives a narrow, but nevertheless, real immunity to pickets. Clearly, it does no more. I had always understood the law to be so, until I heard the Secretary of State claim

on Second Reading that there was no such thing as immunity from criminal prosecution under the preceding law, because it was not unlawful to picket peacefully.<br/>
The House must be clear as to what is lawful and what is unlawful. The immunity has never extended beyond the right to persuade others peacefully of the justice of a cause. A person is not entitled to use violence or unlawful intimidation. The gathering of a great number of people designed to intimidate by fear, is unlawful, and always has been unlawful. The only question is whether it is possible for the police to enforce such legality in the presence of hundreds of people. That is a difficulty of enforcement.<br/>
The chief constables told the Select Committee that there is no reason why there should be any further law on picketing because there is no doubt about what is unlawful. It is lawful to attend a gathering and to try to persuade a person who wishes to move across a picket line that it would be wrong for him to do so, and in doing so a person can use expressions which would help him to persuade the other person, and which might indicate that if he were to enter the factory he would lose his union card. That is not unlawful intimidation. As that is all that is permitted by picketing, I am surprised that the Government have included this clause. They simply want to try to cut down the area of picketing because it is thought that secondary picketing has led to an abuse by creating situations of potential violence.</p>

<p>Amendment No. 18 relates to a more desirable way of proceeding. When I was a Minister at the Home Office in 1974 I sought to persuade the then Government that this was a better approach. If the number of pickets outside a place of work was limited to no more than six, and those pickets were then given the right&#x2014;in the sense of a legal immunity&#x2014;to stop a vehicle from crossing the picket line for long enough to speak to the driver and seek to persuade him, that would be a proper balance of interest. The picketing law is no more than a balance of interest between those who are on strike and those who are not. That balance of interest would avoid any possible conflict, because wherever picketing has been limited to very small numbers there has been


very little evidence of any abuse of that right. For that reason, I have tabled amendment No. 18. I know that it will not carry conviction with this Government, any more than it caried conviction with my Government, because the police and the trade unions are opposed to it for various reasons. Both are wrong, and in time they will learn that it will be wise to adopt this practice.</p>

<p>Will the hon. Gentleman clarify what he has in mind? He is contemplating six people standing on a picket line, and those persons being protected by the provisions in these amendments. If one other person joins, bringing the total to seven, will they all lose their statutory protection, or will only the most recent arrival lose his protection?</p>

<p>The police would have the right to reduce the number to six, and they would be entitled to tell the pickets that only persons who were there by authority of the union should be included in the picket line. Those persons would have immunity, because they were authorised, and the others would not. The detail will need further discussion. In my view, the adoption of these amendments is the right way to proceed. The Government have not proceeded in that way. They have said that secondary picketing is so wrong that they will stop people from picketing anywhere else but outside their place of work. However, they do not want a confrontation with the unions, because that would lead to people being sent to prison&#x2014;and we are all conscious of what happened in 1971.<br/>
The trouble with the Government's solution is that they are potentially putting themselves in that position. On Second Reading, the Labour Front Bench tried to warn the Government of that position, and the Minister claimed forcefully that we were wrong. I wrote to the Minister, and it became clear, through an exchange of letters, that there is a fair difference of opinion between his legal advice and my view of the law. The legal advice given to the Minister is that it is not unlawful for a person to stand in the highway, provided that his standing there is not regarded as an unreasonable use of the highway. My view is that to stand in the highway is potentially a

breach of the law, because it is potentially an obstruction. If the police ask that person to move on, he must move on.<br/>
When the chief officers of police gave evidence to the Select Committee on Home Affairs I asked them whether that was their view of the law. It was. It is clear from subsequent interventions by the Attorney-General in Committee, and in a statement in February, that he takes my view. I am happy to have his assurance that I was right, but perhaps we are both wrong, and perhaps we have both misunderstood the law.<br/>
I am simply saying that there is potential doubt. If the Attorney-General and I are right, there is an immunity from prosecution for obstruction, or for failing to obey the instruction of a police officer to move on. That is a narrow, but important, immunity. If the pickets picket peacefully and a policeman tells them to move on, and they do not move on because they have a right to stay, that is a potential source of conflict and possible violence. It is essential that both sides should know their rights in that situation.<br/>
The Secretary of State says that that is merely a triviality. What would happen in a heated situation outside the factory gates where a person who was not employed there said that he was picketing as he had always picketed, and the Secretary of State said that no police officer could deal with the situation and that an action would have to be brought before the Divisional Court? What would happen if a policeman told that person that he was not employed at the factory and that he must move on? If the person said that he would not move on and was prosecuted, a very dangerous industrial situation might follow. The incident may be trivial. It may be brought up at the local magistrates court, but it may lead to another dockers' situation in which the country is brought to a standstill because the Secretary of State has got it wrong.<br/>
By amendment No. 19 I seek to give the Secretary of State the opportunity to confirm the meaning of clause 15. All it says is:
<q>Nothing in the section shall affect existing immunities from criminal prosecution ".</q>
That is what he says the clause means. He has been telling his Back Benchers and the trade unions from the beginning


that this has no effect upon the criminal law and will not cause any further arrests, and that the police have no greater powers under it than they had before.<br/>
I say&#x2014;and to some extent the Attorney-General agrees with me&#x2014;" Yes, they do, because you have taken away the criminal immunity in relation to those who are secondary pickets in the sense defined in the clause&#x2014;those who are not employed at that place of work ". Those people can be moved on, and they will think that they need not be moved on because they have heard what the Secretary of State says. I appeal to him as a reasonable person. Surely it does no harm to the principle of his Bill. If he accepts the amendment, it will only confirm what he says about the Bill. I should have thought that there could be no real dispute between us about it.<br/>
I shall not enlarge on the other amendments, because time is pressing, but this is a matter of fundamental importance and is potentially of considerable danger. I hope that the Minister will agree.</p>

<p>I hope that the hon. Member for York (Mr. Lyon) will forgive me if I do not follow his argument on his amendment. As my own amendment is grouped with his, I shall speak to it at once.<br/>
This in no sense a hostile or a rebel amendment; on the contrary, I trust that it is a friendly and amicable one. I do not agree with the whole of my right hon. Friend's approach to the Bill, but I agree with nearly all of it. I am grateful to him for having, with my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State, courteously received the Police Federation&#x2014;in which I declare an interest&#x2014;to discuss my amendment.<br/>
In terms of its general drive and purpose I believe that my amendment is absolutely consistent with the manifesto of the Conservative Party at the last general election and with all the related statements on party policy by the Prime Minister and by my right hon. Friend, on which all of us on the Government Benches fought and won that election. I also believe that it expresses, as far as I have been able to discover, not only the views and the hopes of the very large number of people who voted for a change

of Government precisely because they wanted&#x2014;as they still want&#x2014;an end to violent picketing; I believe that it expresses what this large number of people and the public generally are fully entitled to expect, and do expect, from this Government.<br/>
I need not upset the House by raking over the ugly scenes of mass picketing that disfigured the face of industrial Britain during the winter of discontent. We all recall it vividly. I start instead with a quotation from today's issue of <i>The Guardian,</i> which describes what is now happening outside the offices of the <i>Express and Star</i> newspaper in Wolverhampton. I quote the report of Mr. Paul Johnson&#x2014;not, I should have thought, a particular union basher. [<i>Interruption</i>.] He may have seen the light, but I would not have called him that. He says:
<q> Sixteen print workers were arrested yesterday when 300 pickets clashed with the police... National Graphical Association members drafted in from Liverpool, Cardiff, Chester and Bristol were trying to prevent vans laden with newspapers from leaving the offices. The pickets were held in check by about 150 policemen and the vans were escorted out after a street strewn with metal tacks had been cleared.</q>
I do not think that anyone in the House&#x2014;certainly not the hon. Member for York&#x2014;could possibly describe that as peaceful picketing in the terms of the clause that we are now discussing.</p>

<p>The right hon. Gentleman, for whose knowledge of these matters I have a good deal of respect, is exactly 10 minutes too early, because I shall get to that point at the end of my speech.<br/>
The incident at Wolverhampton goes to the heart of the amendment, because


it raises the question whether sheer numbers create a problem. I believe that they do, and I cite to start with the evidence given to the Select Committee, of which the hon. Member for York is a member, by the chief police officer. I shall draw the factual matter from their statements.<br/>
In the case of the Saltley affair of some years ago, they told the Committee that 800 police officers were employed to control upwards of 15,000 pickets and demonstrators.<br/>
In the case of Hadfields, they said that
<q>on 14 February 1980 it was estimated that 1,500 ' pickets ' were present in the Vulcan Road area and 680 police officers were deployed to contain the situation.</q>
The report of the Select Committee went on to state that in the case of Grunwick
<q>Between 13 June and 7 November there were 51 days in which large-scale picketing occurred. The total number of pickets during this period was estimated at 52,000; the largest number on any single day was 20,000... During this period 37,000 police were employed... 347 injuries to police were recorded and 17 to members of the public.</q>
I do not think, on this evidence, that there can be any doubt that numbers are a problem. I do not think that there can be any doubt, either, about the public's deep concern about numbers. I need not go into the question of the election campaign, but there is no doubt on the Conservative Benches that there was real public anger about the impact of numbers on the picket line.<br/>
Lest there be any doubt about this, let us consider what happened in the House. At the height of the Grunwick affair there were exchanges in the House&#x2014;I shall not detain it with quotations&#x2014;when both the former Prime Minister and the present Prime Minister, both the former Home Secretary and the present Home Secretary, and both the former Secretary of State for Employment and the present Secretary of State for Employment, all agreed on one thing, namely, that numbers can intimidate and that numbers do obstruct.<br/>
The former Prime Minister said:
<q> those who latch on to this in order to turn an industrial dispute into a political battle&#x2014;[HON. MEMBERS: " Hear, hear."]&#x2014;that applies to the National Association for Freedom as well as to the International Socialists&#x2014;can be kept clear of this industrial dispute... the situation is getting extremely serious."&#x2014;</q>

[<i>Official Report,</i> 23 June 1977; Vol. 933, c. 1735.]<br/>
7.30 pm<br/>
I can fairly summarise those exchanges by referring to a report of the political editor of <i>The Times,</i> who wrote this:
<q> Mr. Callaghan in the Commons made no attempt to conceal the Labour Cabinet's deep anxieties about the demonstrations outside the Grunwick factory. Senior Ministers are profoundly disturbed about the impression created at home and abroad by television reports showing day after day fighting between large numbers of demonstrators and the police.</q>
All hon. Members, all political parties and the British public as a whole, share my concern about numbers. That is right, so what do we do about it? We are pledged to do something about it.<br/>
The Police Federation originally proposed a specific limit. It proposed that the number of those on any one picket line should be confined to six. It then thought that it might be better to limit the numbers in a single dispute to 50. But in the case of large and complex firms, six is not enough. Fifty may not be enough. It is unrealistic to suggest any specific limit, because circumstances vary enormously between one firm and another.<br/>
The police then considered whether a limit should be placed on the proportion of the work force involved in picketing. They suggested a limit of 5 per cent., but again, I rejected that notion. It was&#x2014;and is&#x2014;wholly impracticable. One would find, for example, that 5 per cent. of the work force of British Leyland or Ford was an entirely different thing to 5 per cent. of the work force of a small firm that employed only 40 workers. In addition, such a suggestion would place the police and shop stewards in great difficulty. They would have to determine whether 5 per cent. meant 5 per cent. of the total work force or 5 per cent. of the work force at a particular branch or plant, or 5 per cent. of the union in dispute. For those practical reasons, the Police Federation dropped its suggestion for an absolute or proportional limit. I think that that was wise.</p>

<p>Presumably, the Police Federation is a different body from that of chief constables. The hon. Gentleman quoted from <i>The Times</i>. I have a copy of <i>The Times</i> of 21 February. In that copy


five chief constables gave evidence. They stated:

<p>I shall turn to the subject of police powers shortly. However, I have made plain for whom I speak&#x2014;for the federation in this instance, and also for myself.<br/>
My amendment avoids absolute and rigid limits. They would do more harm than good. I hope that my friends in the legal profession will not object if I say that the amendment has a common law-style approach. It has three prongs, which seek to deal with the mischief done by numbers.<br/>
The first prong suggests that the numbers should not be so great as to cause intimidation. The second prong suggests that the numbers should not be so great as to create a physical barrier to lawful movement in and out of the premises. The third prong ensures that the numbers should not be so great as to cause a breach of the peace.<br/>
Do numbers intimidate? The evidence is to be found in recent examples. I shall quote some of the statements that were made to the police by those workers at Hadfields who had voted in favour of continuing to work. When they tried to go to work, some of them found that they were unable to reach the premises. <i>The Times</i> states:
<q>The statements told of men and women employees being spat upon, kicked, sworn at and jostled as they went to work. Women described how they had been called scabs, bastards and whores... One statement told of police stopping a busload of workers so that they had a walk of 500 yards to the factory gates... There was one policeman only on duty... Our party consisted of about 35 to 40 people; we were immediately met by pickets in large groups... We were called various names, spat at, and forced off the causeway by means of kicks and pushes... The women in the party were very brave to keep going on in these circumstances, and the men kept their patience in the very explosive situation.</q>
Surely no hon. Member would doubt that that represents intimidation. The House cannot accept such intimidation.</p>

<p>I agree with my hon. Friend and shall comment further towards the end of my remarks.<br/>
The second prong of the amendment deals not so much with intimidation but with the question whether numbers can and do constitute a physical barrier to those who lawfully seek to go in and out of the premises being picketed. I have no need to quote examples; I can refer to my own experience. I did not have the same number of opportunities to visit Grunwick during the picketing as my right hon. Friend the Member for Hen-don, North (Mr. Gorst). However, I did go there to observe what was going on.<br/>
There is no question but that when one is faced with 10,000 to 20,000 people, jostling, shouting and fighting with the police, and occasionally with one another, in a confined space, other people are physically impeded from lawfully going in and out of the premises. The need for the second prong of my amendment is demonstrated on the evidence.<br/>
The third prong concerns the question whether numbers can lead to a breach of the peace. All hon. Members are concerned when an industrial dispute is latched on to by large numbers of people who have no part in the industrial dispute, and who have simply gone along to make as much trouble as possible. Large numbers of those who took part in the picketing at Grunwick were not trade unionists. I am thinking of many of those who are on the extreme fringes of politics&#x2014;on the Right and on the Left


&#x2014;of various student bodies, and others who came along for the punch-up. When numbers on a picket line swell to such a point that they cause a major breach of the peace, the law should take a clearer view.</p>

<p>I shall answer my hon. Friend's question in my own way in the brief time that I want to take.<br/>
I made it plain at the outset that I do not regard the amendment as in any sense hostile to my right hon. Friend's Bill and general philosophy. That is why I do not propose to press it to a Division. I am well aware that the Government have chosen not to go down the road of criminal sanctions. They have chosen to adopt civil injunctions. If I were to succeed in inserting the amendment, it would be a proposal without the sanction that I judge that it requires to have. And as I believe that this would be technically defective, I shall not press the amendment.<br/>
However, there is real concern about these matters. It is maintained by some lawyers, by some chief officers of police and by the Attorney-General that there is already sufficient power for the police to take action. That is partly in the form of statute law and partly in the form of a great deal of case law that has been tried by the courts.<br/>
I accept immediately that there are powers for the police to act provided that they have the resources and the will. However, there is value for the public, pickets, the press and the police to be able clearly to understand exactly what the law is, what their powers are. and the limits of picketing. It is for that reason that I see merit in there being on the face of the Bill a declaration that sets out the limits of picketing, namely, that pickets should not intimidate, they should not constitute a physical barrier, and they should not cause a breach of the peace.<br/>
Bearing in mind the way in which the Bill is structured and the philosophy that my right hon. Friend has adopted, with which I broadly agree, I think it advisable for the matters to which I have referred to be spelt out in the code of conduct that will accompany the Bill when it becomes law.<br/>
If the Government accept that these are matters of grave public concern and that it is necessary to make all concerned well aware of what the law is and what its limits are, I ask my hon. and learned Friend to confirm that the code of conduct should spell out the issues and make them plain to all concerned. If he is prepared to do that, I ask for a further undertaking that he will consult not only the Police Federation and the chief officers but all others concerned, so that what appears in the code of conduct will be clearly understood.<br/>
7.45 pm<br/>
I ask for a further undertaking. The Government have decided, rightly or wrongly, to avoid the criminal law. If that works, so be it. However, if it is found, after a period, that it is not working, I ask the Government to think again.<br/>
If my hon. and learned Friend is able to give those undertakings I shall not press the amendment to a Division. His own and my right hon. Friend's ready willingness so far to discuss the matter with the police service has been appreciated, and I hope that we can continue in that way.</p>

<p>At one stage I felt that I should have to rebut some of the charges made by the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Griffiths). However, I recognise that he has taken a great deal of the time of the


House to justify his position as adviser to the Police Federation. I am well aware that the House wishes to make progress, and it is not my intention to speak at length on the amendment.<br/>
Everyone, both inside and outside the House, including the overwhelming majority of trade unionists involved in industrial disputes, recognises and pays tribute to the work that the police have to do, often in extremely difficult situations, when industrial disputes occur. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept that we all recognise that until such time as Governments clearly write the law&#x2014;invariably Governments have refused to do so&#x2014;it will be left to the police at the scene of the action to interpret the law and public order as best they can. The hon. Gentleman's amendment does not make a great deal of sense. Presumably it would be left to the officer in charge at the scene of the action to define how many were allowed to attend.<br/>
In common with my hon. Friend the Member for York (Mr. Lyon)&#x2014;I speak as a sponsored Member of the AUEW&#x2014;I have been involved in industrial disputes. I recognise the force behind the argument that any attempt to limit the number of pickets attending a dispute would be doomed to failure for a variety of reasons, not least because many works establishments, especially the larger ones, have many entrances. I presume that it is sought to allow only a certain number of pickets to attend irrespective of the number of entrances.<br/>
I shall concentrate briefly on amendment No. 114, which I am sure the House will recognise is a serious and thoughtful attempt to define the difficult area of mass picketing. I do not think that anyone welcomes the sight or the actions of mass picketing. It is important for the House to understand the reason and thinking behind it when it occurs. The overwhelming majority of industrial disputes involved only two or three pickets. They are settled amicably and reasonably and there is no " aggro " at the works. It is only occasionally, in well-publicised cases, that mass picketing takes place.<br/>
At such a time it is invariable that problems occur. We are seeking to give the power to the police to alter the law to give them the right to stop a lorry at the request of the official in charge of

the picket to allow the picket peacefully to put the argument to the driver. The policeman would be there. He would decide whether the necessary time had been taken to put the arguments to the driver. If at the end of the pickets' argument the driver decided that he did not wish to listen to the argument, he would be free to enter or leave the works.<br/>
When pickets feel that their actions are being circumvented by lorries driving in and out to deliver materials it causes bad feeling, and mass pickets will physically try to stop these lorries. The men and women involved are forced to feel bitter and decide to stop the lorry by one menas or another. If hon. Gentlemen realise the bitterness of those feelings, they will recognise the force of our amendment. The Minister endorses the argument. On 30 July 1975 he said:
<q> I would be prepared to consider very carefully whether we ought not to confer upon the police what they have not got at present&#x2014;the right to stop a vehicle for a limited period so that the picket may have the right to do that which he has the right to seek to attempt to do; namely, to persuade."&#x2014;[<i>Official Report,</i> 30 July 1975; Vol. 896, c. 1904.]</q>
It is impossible to persuade a lorry driver travelling at 30 miles per hour. Deaths and serious accidents to pickets have been caused by lorries. Our amendment attempts to assist the Government in a difficult situation.</p>

<p>Clause 15 could lead to mass picketing instead of preventing it. I do not want to go over all the arguments raised in Committee, but one is important. If a convener or shop steward visits another establishment to seek support and presuade those workers to join the strike, he can be easily identified and sued. In a nutshell that is the effect of clause 15. In future he will take the whole of his factory to seek that support. It will be impossible to identify 200 or 300 or even 2,000 or 3,000 workers. There is a grave danger that clause 15 will lead to mass picketing.</p>

<p>The amendment would give the police the right to make a decision which in many circumstances they already take. In most industrial action a strong rapport exists between pickets and police. Without that, the majority of strikes would end in punch-ups and anarchy. We wish to prevent mass picketing occurring through the determination of the work force to stop


lorries entering or leaving the establishment, and instead give the police the right to stop a lorry at the request of a picket. There may still be the odd occurrence such as Grunwick, which was more of a mass demonstration by the trade union movement to express its detestation of a particular employer. However, in the average industrial situation mass picketing may occur because the workers are upset and seek to stop lorries entering or leaving the firm by interposing their bodies. The police would not necessarily stop the lorry. The pickets could express their opinion through the policeman, but if the driver rejected it he would drive on.</p>

<p>In view of the lateness of the hour, I shall advance only one criticism of the amendment put forward by my hon. Friend the Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Griffiths). It will deprive a perfectly law-abiding picket of the statutory protection afforded by clause 15, not because of any action on his part but because of the actions of those with whom he is keeping company. In particular, he will be deprived of the statutory protection merely because he belongs to a demonstration which happens to be, because of the numbers, an obstruction or cause of intimidation. It is not right to deprive someone of a statutory protection merely because of the company that he keeps. I therefore oppose the amendment.</p>

<p>I shall not detain the House long. In Committee we spent six sittings on what was then clause 14 and is now clause 15. However, it will be useful to give the Front Bench advice on the amendments.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for York (Mr. Lyon) does a great service in highlighting the issues and asking the Government to clarify the position, which was far from clear on Second Reading. It emerged more clearly when we debated the matter in Committee, but in amendment No. 19 my hon. Friend gives the Government the opportunity to state their intentions clearly:
<q> Nothing in this section shall affect existing immunities from criminal prosecution ".</q>
On 17 December last year, which is a long time ago, when I asked about the

police getting involved in picketing, as outlined in the Bill, the Secretary of State strongly refuted that the Bill was anything to do with the police, and said:
<q> This has absolutely nothing to do with the police. It has nothing to do with criminal law. It is entirely a matter for the person who believes that his contracts are in some way being broken to take action through the civil court. The police are in no way involved m this."&#x2014;[<i>Official Report,</i> 17 December 1979; Vol. 976, c. 75&#x2013;6.]</q>
If the Secretary of State is right and wishes to confirm that, I see no reason why he should not accept amendment No. 19.<br/>
I cannot advise my hon. Friends to support my hon. Friend's other amendment, No. 18. My hon. Friend probably realises now that to some extent it is impracticable to try to lay down that not more than six persons attend a picket in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute. My hon. Friend the Member for Rotherham (Mr. Crowther) explained in Committee the difficulties that could arise at Rotherham steelworks, which stretch for about three miles, certainly out of Rotherham and nearly into Sheffield. From the evidence given to the Select Committee on Employment we know that the police are opposed to that limit.<br/>
We are content to stand by the description of picketing set out by the present Attorney-General on 19 February. The police in their evidence say that the existing law on picketing is adequate. It relies to a great extent on the common sense of those who are picketing and the police who are trying to see that no disorder takes place. Mr. Alan Goodson, chief constable of Leicestershire and president of the Association of Chief Police Officers was reported in <i>The Times</i> on 21 February as saying that he ruled out as impractical any new legislation laying down a precise limit on " the number of people who can constitute a peaceful picket. I think that is absolutely right. There is a great weight of evidence that suggests that the House should not consider anything like that.<br/>
Of course there is the problem of large numbers of pickets. The hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Griffiths) is right. I do not know whether he has looked recently at the TUC guides on picketing, but these are a blueprint for industrial peace. It is a great tragedy that the Government have discarded these


guides, rather than seeking to build on them.</p>

<p>The hon. and learned Gentleman says that the Government have not discarded them, but I have seen some of the correspondence between the Department of Employment and the TUC. The emphasis laid on the guides by Mr. Len Murray is that these were part of a package, and certainly the other part of the package has gone.<br/>
On the question of mass picketing the TUC says:
<q> In any situation where large numbers of people with strong feelings are involved, there is a danger that things can get out of control, particularly in a confined area, such as access to a factory. It is therefore particularly important for any such demonstrations to be well conducted in a well organised and disciplined manner. It is also important that demonstrations of this kind do not convey the impression that the object is to blockade the workplace.</q>
Another sentence within this guide says of the trade union officer in charge:
<q> He should ensure that the number of pickets is no larger than is necessary ".</q>
It is rather a tragedy that the Government have not at least talked to the TUC about these guides, rather than moving straight to legislation.</p>

<p>Of course what the right hon. Member says is in every way a good approach. Will the TUC discuss this with the Government in an open way before the Government make their own code of practice known? I believe that it would be very sensible for the TUC to help in that way, if it will.</p>

<p>I have seen the correspondence between the Secretary of State and the General Secretary of the TUC. The TUC places great emphasis, not only on its guides but on the other documents that it produced at that time&#x2014;for example, those on the question of the commitment to reduce inflation, and to support certain industrial policies, and so on. I cannot speak for the TUC but I suspect that the Secretary of State, when he produces his new codes of practice later in the year after the Bill has reached the statute book, will invite the TUC to discuss its guides again. I do not know what the TUC's reaction will be.<br/>
When we come to Third Reading I shall have something to say about the way in which Government should proceed on trade union matters. My judgment is that these codes of practice are a much better way of trying to conduct industrial disputes, rather than moving straight to the law and getting the courts involved, as they inevitably will be.<br/>
I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for York will not pursue amendment No. 18, but that he will press amendment No. 19 if he is called to do so. On that basis we shall support him.</p>

<p>Perhaps it will be convenient if I deal first with the amendment proposed by my hon. Friend the Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Griffiths) and then deal with the two amendments proposed by the hon. Member for York (Mr. Lyon). I fully understand the anxiety that lies behind my hon. Friend's amendment. He said at the outset that the terms of the amendment were entirely consistent with our manifesto. I accept that. I also accept that the amendment is not in any sense hostile to the theme of the Bill or to the task that the Government have adopted.<br/>
My hon. Friend also said that there was no doubt that numbers were the problem. That is true. We are all familiar with the most recent illustrations of mass picketing and the great burdens that they impose on the police and upon many members of the public, as well as those who are anxious only to get on with their work. In recent years we have all seen the violence and disorder which have occurred as a result of mass picketing. Nothing can justify that sort of behaviour. I do not believe that anyone in this House would believe that it was justifiable, but we must all recognise that it is more likely to occur where there is mass picketing than where picketing is confined or is limited to small numbers. Mass picketing deeply offends most decent people, who find it extraordinary that the scenes commonly associated therewith should take place in this country without any control. This has done more than anything in recent years to alienate public sympathy and to tarnish the reputation of the trade unions in whose names it is carried out. That is serious because all sensible people want the trade union movement to have a good name.<br/>
Above all, mass picketing imposes an enormous burden of enforcement on the police, whose job it is not to take sides in an industrial dispute but to try to maintain the Queen's peace against sometimes imposible odds. Indeed, it is important that the police should be seen not to take sides. That is a job that they do with great judgment, courage, restraint and good sense. We should compliment them on, and thank them for, their work in tackling such a difficult and unpleasant task. I gladly do that.<br/>
I wish to make it clear that, in the words of my right hon. and learned Friend the Attorney-General&#x2014;&#x2014;
<q> The criminal law of the land applies to pickets as it does to anybody else. Let there be no illusion that the immunity provided under the civil law enables pickets to break the criminal law.</q>
Of course that is right. The immunity conferred by section 15 of the Trade Union and Labour Relations Act 1974 does not permit a picket to break the criminal law. Later my right hon. and learned Friend says:
<q> If pickets by sheer numbers, seek to stop people going to work or delivering or collecting goods they are not protected by the law since their purpose is to obstruct rather than persuade."&#x2014;[<i>Official Report,</i> 19 February 1980; Vol. 979, c. 238&#x2013;39.]</q>
It is small wonder that the Police Federation, whose interests my hon. Friend represents so faithfully, and whose members have recently had to confront 1,500 pickets at Hadfields, wants to write into this clause an expression of the limitations that the criminal law already imposes upon numbers. The purpose of this amendment is to withdraw immunity from civil action from those who picket in such numbers that they intimidate persons by their very numbers or constitute a physical barrier to lawful movement or create a breach of the peace. I can well understand why the federation wanted that written into the clause.<br/>
However, my hon. Friend with his close knowledge of these matters has made it clear that he understands that picketing which has those consequences is already criminally unlawful. What is more, such pickets are not protected by immunity from action under the civil law. The Attorney-General made that clear as well. Nevertheless, I entirely agree with what my hon. Friend said in concluding his speech. He claimed that there is a

need for the law relating to picketing, particularly the criminal law, to be clearly understood and known by everyone who is potentially affected by it. That means people who want to picket, those who organise them, those whose premises are affected and workers who want to go to work but who are affected by the action of the pickets.<br/>
That, I know, is the purpose of the amendment, and to most people it is far from clear at present. It needs to be made clear so that not only pickets and those who organise them but everyone else concerned are in no doubt where they stand under the law. However, it is very difficult to do this in the language of a statute, especially one which has to use the complicated device of granting immunity from civil action, and which is a concept of great complexity in which we have been locked since 1906.<br/>
I do not think we will get clarity or simplicity or anything like that as long as we persist with it. The language of a statute is necessarily technical and compressed and there is always the risk that what is intended to clarify will in some unforeseen way create new uncertainties. For example, an amendment of this kind could lead to confusion between the civil and the criminal law. Section 15 of the 1974 Act, which the Bill seeks to amend, deals primarily with, the civil law. The effect of this amendment would be to emphasise that the civil law immunities are put at risk if criminal offences are committed. The clause already has that effect.<br/>
Rather than trying to achieve this necessary purpose by adding to this clause, therefore, the Government think it wiser that there should be an authoritative code of practice on picketing in which the law can be explained in whatever detail and with whatever illustrative examples may be necessary. I entirely agree with the right hon. Gentleman that the TUC made a valuable contribution in its guide of February last year. It followed upon a valuable contribution by the National Union of Mineworkers a few years earlier. However, neither is enough. The TUC guide certainly forms a foundation upon which an up-to-date code could well be built, but it is not enough, for one reason alone, that it permits picketing at a place other than the place of work, which is contrary to the Govern-


ment's policy. I acknowledge its value and, as my right hon. Friend has said, we would be pleased if, in co-operation, we could build upon that foundation an up-to-date and sufficient code of practice.<br/>
There would, of course, need to be very wide consultation, and my right hon. Friend has asked me, in response to the two questions that my hon. Friend asked me, to give the assurance that it would be his intention to consult very fully with the police, including&#x2014;naturally&#x2014;the Police Federation. By reason of their special position, experience and responsibilities, there can be none with more important advice to offer, although there will be others with equally important advice to offer.<br/>
I am glad to be able to give the assurance today that we will so consult when it comes to considering what the code of practice will contain. That only reiterates what my right hon. Friend told the leaders of the Police Federation when they visited us on 8 February.<br/>
I was then asked by my hon. Friend whether if the approach which the Government are adopting&#x2014;avoiding a change in the criminal law&#x2014;does not work, the Government would think again. It will certainly do so, but I give no assurance that we will consider adding to the criminal law, although we would not rule it out, for the reasons given by my hon. Friends the Members for Grantham (Mr. Hogg) and for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Budgen), that if there is a criminal offence on the statute book already which will enable the mischief to be dealt with if only it can be enforced, one does not really diminish the difficulties simply by writing another criminal offence into the statute book. That is the difficulty. I hope I have made the Government's position clear to my hon. Friend and I hope that, on the assurance I have given, he will feel able to seek leave to withdraw his amendment.<br/>
I come now to the amendment proposed by the hon. Member for York (Mr. Lyon). There are two major grounds upon which I have to say that we cannot accept it. The first is that it defeats the principal purpose of the clause, which is to restrict lawful picketing to the picket's own place of work. The second is that it confers upon pickets the right to stop

vehicles for the purpose of picketing peacefully. This is something which has never been conferred upon pickets. The law always upheld the right of everyone to pass freely along the highway.<br/>
As the Attorney-General said on 19 February:
<q> Each one of us is free, as an individual, to come and go as he pleases to his home or to his place of work.</q>
<q>The law specifically protects our enjoyment of those rights."&#x2014;[<i>Official Report,</i> 19 February, 1980: Vol. 979, c. 238.]</q>
The Government propose to ensure that it continues to do so. The need in today's conditions to communicate one's own side of the case in an industrial dispute cannot warrant, we believe, an incursion into the right of free passage of such fundamental significance. It is perfectly easy to indicate where a picket line is established. Anyone approaching a picket line today knows that the pickets are anxious to persuade him, if they can, not to cross the line, or at least to explain their case. The decision whether to stop and listen must be left to them.<br/>
8.15 pm<br/>
This point of principle is not avoided by the variant to this amendment which is contained in amendment No. 114 argued by the hon. Member for Newton (Mr. Evans), which would give the police power to stop any vehicle leaving or entering the place of work at the request of pickets. It may be slightly less offensive that someone should be stopped by a police officer at the request of pickets than by a picket himself, but it does not alter the main objection in principle, which I have already mentioned, that we do not believe that someone's personal liberty to decide whether or not to stop should be infringed at the request of someone who wishes to put his point in relation to a dispute that he is carrying on with his employer. We do not, therefore, believe that 114 is possible.<br/>
I also agree with the last point made by the hon. Gentleman that to write in any number, be it six or 16, imparts a rigidity to this statute which is at odds with the essential need for flexibility that the police have always identified and insisted upon. That would be a mistake.<br/>
I turn now to the contention that clause 15 significantly enlarges the ambit of the criminal law and will make more pickets liable to imprisonment. I am very


conscious of the time constraints, but I am also conscious of the correspondence that has taken place between himself and my right hon. Friend and of the importance of the point he makes, and I hope to have the indulgence of the House if I take a few minutes to deal with the point of law he has raised. I would not wish to skirt round it.<br/>
My right hon. and learned Friend the Attorney-General said on 19 February:
<q>the law on picketing does not in any real way change the criminal law.</q>
In answer to the hon. Gentleman, my right hon. and learned Friend went on to say:
<q> So far as I can see, the only way in which the immunity given in the existing law on picketing changes the criminal law is that it permits an obstruction of the highway. That is not a serious obstruction. The law permits one to stand on the pavement or in the road outside the place of work where ordinarily one would not be permitted to do so because the highway is meant for passing and repassing. That, I think, is the limit. It is only to that extent that the immunity would be removed if clause 14 became effective."&#x2014;[<i>Official Report,</i> 19 February 1980; Vol. 979, c. 555.]</q>
What he was referring to was the technical wrong of not using the highway for passing and re-passing but for standing in a static position as a picket. The offence under the Highways Act is as follows:&#x2014;
<q> without lawful authority or excuse in any way wilfully obstructing the free passage along a highway ".</q>
The test of obstruction, as the hon. Gentleman will know, is whether the use of the highway is unreasonable. Whether it is unreasonable depends on all the circumstances, including its duration, position and purpose and whether it causes actual as opposed to potential obstruction. The hon. Gentleman said, when moving his amendment, that even to stand still on the highway was, as I understood him, to commit a criminal offence because it was potentially an obstruction. I must take issue with him there: one cannot commit a potential offence.</p>

<p>This is the very crux of it. The argument I put forward&#x2014;and I think I have solid legal basis for it&#x2014;is that one can. The hon. and learned Gentleman and his legal advisers have taken the view that one cannot. Very well. But if I am right then a police officer can come to a picket and say " You are not employed

at this place of work. You must move on."<br/>
Because of the assurances which the Secretary of State has given, the picket thinks that the police have no right to move on a person even if he is a secondary picket, and he resists. What is the position then? It is no good talking about differences between legal authorities, which I can cheerfully swap with the hon. Gentleman. Is it not right that this clause should make it clear that the police officer has no power to move on a picket even in those circumstances, merely because he is not employed at that place of work?</p>

<p>I do not believe that this clause should concern itself with the criminal law, nor do I believe that the hon. Gentleman is right when he says that perhaps the Attorney-General supports him in the contention that he has just expressed, namely, that it is possible to commit a criminal offence merely by standing in one position in the highway and obstructing no one. I shall explain why. The Attorney-General had in mind the test that it would have to be an unreasonable user of the highway to constitute an offence of wilfully obstructing it under the Highways Act. He said, during the 25th sitting of the Committee:
<q> If, by contrast "&#x2014;&#x2014;</q>
that is to say, by contrast to actual physical obstruction&#x2014;&#x2014;
<q>all a person does is to stand on the pavement on the side of the road, without interfering with the rights of others to pass and re-pass, and peacefully communicates information&#x2014;perhaps by holding a placard or by speaking&#x2014;or tries to persuade others not to enter their place of work, that does not amount to obstruction, even in the technical sense ".</q>
I pause to remind the hon. Gentleman that the only possible criminal offence can be obstruction. That is permitted under the common law. It needs no statutory protection. That was first decided in 1906, and again by Lord Widgery in 1974 and Lord Denning in 1976. Therefore, in those circumstances, the amendment of section 15 of the Trade Union and Labour Relations Act, which this clause will affect, has no effect on criminal liability at all.<br/>
But the Attorney-General went on to deal with a situation in which a peaceful picket does interfere with the rights of others to pass, not deliberately but incidentally, not causing, to use his words


on 19 February a " serious obstruction ", but preventing from moving along the pavement people who are trying not to get into the works but to the bus stop or the shops. He said that that would seem to be a very rare occasion but that
<q> if there were an obstruction under the Highways Act, where it was a lawful picket, it is open to argument that section 15 might provide immunity. Some say that section 15 is declaratory; others say that it would go further and provide an immunity in that case.</q>
But he continued
<q> whatever the precise legal effect of section 15, its practical consequences are not in doubt. It confers no immunity from prosecution for obstruction in the sense in which that term is normally understood: that is, physically preventing a person from going where he wants to go, not only into the works, but also along the pavement to the other end of the road. If pickets go beyond peaceful persuasion and obstruct the passage of workers or vehicles, everyone knows that there is no protection for that sort of act.</q>
<q>It follows that the limitation on the scope of lawful picketing proposed in clause 14 does not in any real terms extend the ambit of the criminal law. It does not create any new criminal offence and it does not affect the powers and duties of the police in any way ".&#x2014;[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee A,</i> 18 March 1980; c. 1347&#x2013;48.]</q>
I think that the House will therefore agree that my right hon. Friend was entitled to say, in his Second Reading speech, that the Bill does not create any additional burden on the police because it does not create any new criminal offence. Similarly, I believe that I was entitled to say:
<q> The criminal law is not being affected."&#x2014;[<i>Official Report,</i> 17 December 1979; Vol. 976, c. 169.]</q></p>

<p>On the basis of the explanation given by the Attorney-General, which I have just read, a picket who is not preventing or obstructing in any way the passage of anyone along the pavement would not be committing the offence of obstruction.

<p>I am about to explain why I do not believe that amendment No. 19, which says that existing criminal immunities are not affected&#x2014;I have paraphrased it, but that is the guts of it&#x2014;ought to be accepted. It refers to existing immunities from criminal prosecution. Even if that is an accurate expression, which in law I do not believe it is&#x2014;at any rate, I doubt whether it is&#x2014;I do not believe that there are any criminal immunitites, except in respect of the technical offences of obstruction, which I have mentioned. It would not dissolve the doubt to which the Attorney-General referred, when he said that some say one thing and some say the other. It would have the defect of introducing a reference to the criminal law in a clause that deals with the civil law.<br/>
If the amendment were accepted, it might lead pickets and others to think that they had immunity from criminal prosecution for criminal offences other than obstruction. Indeed, the very reference to " immunities "&#x2014;in the plural&#x2014;suggests that more than obstruction is involved. Yet I know of no offence other than that of obstructing the highway that could be relevant.<br/>
The courts themselves would not necessarily know what existing immunities the Act was referring to. Also, I very much doubt whether it is accurate to speak of immunity from criminal prosecution. I believe that the true way of expressing it would be to say that in those circumstances the picket has not committed a criminal offence. I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for the careful way in which he argued his case, but I believe it to be misconceived and I must advise my right hon. Friends to resist it.</p>

<p>I am happy to ask leave to withdraw amendment No. 18, although I do not accept the arguments, either in relation to numbers or to stopping the vehicle. The fact that there will be a limited number of pickets at any factory gate would make it perfectly possible to cope with the situation. The fact is that


to allow an immunity for stopping a vehicle is the only way in which one will prevent great numbers of strikers, who feel deeply that those lorries are breaking their strike, from trying to interfere physically in order to stop them. The only way in which we shall get rid of violence is by allowing a right, in the sense of an immunity, to stop a vehicle.<br/>
I should like to deal with amendment No. 19. I come back to what I have said about the potential of considerable conflict on future picket lines, when the police say to pickets who have attended from other places of work that they should move on and then arrest them, either for obstruction or for failing to obey the instructions of a police officer in the execution of his duty. Because that is against what the Government intend, surely it would be possible to accept this amendment.<br/>
The hon. and learned Gentleman conceded my argument. If there is a criminal offence which is now capable of being committed if this clause passes unamended&#x2014;even if it is the relatively trivial one of an obstruction, of somebody not involved in getting into the place of work&#x2014;surely it is better that we should remove that doubt from the criminal law by allowing this amendment to pass. The fact that the hon. and learned Gentleman refuses to allow it to pass suggests that all along this Government have recognised that this will extend the power of the police to intervene in an industrial situation and that although they purport not to want that, that is really what they are after. I hope that the Opposition will vote heavily against this provision.<br/>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<q>at the place of work of another member of the same trade union who is engaged in the same or a related dispute, or</q>
<q>at the premises of any employer engaged in the dispute, or</q>

<q>at the premises to which work has been transferred either immediately preceding the dispute or during the course of the dispute, or</q>

I must tell the House that I had this morning prepared some very powerful and persuasive arguments in favour of all the parts of this amendment but I have been sitting here watching the digital clock tick away and I sense an anxiety to make sure that we not only have a Third Reading debate and a Division but finish at a reasonable hour. So, with the greatest reluctance and, I am sure, to the delight of the House, I shall dispense with the argument and merely rest on the fact that the amendment is self-explanatory in all its details and makes its own case.<br/>
We have learn sufficient by now, particularly after the long hours during which we debated this clause of the Bill in the Standing Committee, to anticipate the Government's reaction. I know that they are extremely unlikely to accept this amendment, so I am going to save the time of the House by saying that I urge my hon. Friends, when the Minister has replied, to divide the House on this amendment.</p>

<p>I too had prepared a long speech on this amendment and I am very happy not to have to deliver it to the House. All I must say to the right hon. Member for Doncaster (Mr. Walker) is that I believe that this amendment would wreck this particular clause and the purpose which underlines it. What we have sought to do is take secondary picketing, say that it is a particularly odious form of industrial action and seek to make it unlawful. There are too many cases nowadays in which not only does an employer find his business disrupted by secondary picketing, but employees who feel they have absolutely nothing to do with the dispute in question are afraid of going into work. They find themselves in a position in which, even after having voted to continue working, they are still not working, partly because of the things we have been discussing under the previous amendment but also because of the effects of even peaceful secondary picketing.<br/>
Having considered the arguments put forward by hon. Gentlemen in Committee stage&#x2014;and they cited in particular picketing of premises to which an employer has transferred work during a dispute and the picketing of other premises or companies associated with it&#x2014;I still believe that there is a perfect case for saying that this picketing should not take place.


There are many methods open to employees in dispute of explaining the situation to, and gaining the support of, other workers, and secondary picketing is not necessary for that purpose. It may start out as a means of persuasion but too often it turns into an indiscriminate blockade of the employer's premises, which can have damaging effects not only for that employer and his employees but</p>

<p>I hope that I might earn the gratitude of the House by being as brief in moving this amendment as I was in moving the last.<br/>
The provision in the clause is absurdly restrictive. As the clause is drafted it would, for example, expose Mr. Len Murray to a civil action if he had to do what I am sure the Secretary of State would love him to do in one of the situations described. He might pop along and say to the lads " Lads, just cool it a bit ". The mere act of doing that, under this provision, would expose Mr. Murray to action in the courts.<br/>
8.45 pm<br/>
The same would apply if the secretary of the local trades council wanted to pop along to the chaps on the picket line and say " Lads, there's a cup of tea for

you at the trades hall when you are ready." Again, it seems to us that he will be caught by the provisions of the Bill and exposed to civil action. I do not intend to inflict on the House any more examples of the absurdities that have been created by the Government, despite the fact that I could quote an endless list of them. I hope that that, of itself, will convince the Secretary of State, and the House, of the good sense of this modest little amendment.<br/>
I am quite sure that the Secretary of State will say, when he moves his own amendments, that he has gone some way towards meeting the arguments we advanced in Committee. I confess that I cannot understand the right hon. Gentleman's amendments. I hope that, with the same brevity with which I have moved amendment No. 88, he will tell us exactly what the amendments mean and indicate whether he has responded in any degree to the persuasive arguments advanced in Committee.</p>

<p>Amendment No. 88 would considerably increase the number of people who could attend on a picket line and would allow any trade union official


to picket anywhere. We think that that is far too wide-ranging a measure. We do not see why officials should be able to picket where there is no dispute or, if there is a dispute, where they do not represent the workers on the picket line. We have tabled amendments Nos. 26 and 27 which will make it clear that trade union officials may accompany the members of their union whom they represent. That provides them with complete scope to carry out their normal duties.<br/>
I turn to the amendments which the right hon. Gentleman finds it difficult to understand. The effect of amendment No. 26, which adds the words " and whom he represents ", provides that it should be lawful for a trade union official to picket alongside his members only if he represents those members. Amendment No. 27 which comes at the end of line 40 explains what this means. Those officials&#x2014;that is to say shop stewards&#x2014;who have been elected, or appointed, to represent a specific group of employees are to be regarded for the purposes of this clause as representing only those employees and no others.<br/>
Other trade union officials&#x2014;that is to say national officials&#x2014;who do not represent a specific group of members are to be regarded as representing all the members of a trade union. Hence, they are able to join a picket line of any members of their union.<br/>
During discussions in Committee my hon. Friend the Member for Fareham (Mr. Lloyd) pointed out that the clause as drafted allowed wide scope for picketing by trade union officials whose members were picketing, whether or not those officials represented members of the</p>

<p>union on the picket line or those who had a direct interest in the dispute. For that purpose my hon. Friend tabled an amendment to narrow that scope. The Opposition pointed out that the amendment might be, and probably would be, unnecessarily narrow as it could prevent people such as a branch chairman or the lay president of the union from attending a picket line. Our amendments take account of those two arguments and make it lawful for a branch chairman or secretary to picket at any place where members of their branch are picketing lawfully. The lay president&#x2014;in so far as he is likely to want to join a picket line at all&#x2014;will be able to attend alongside any of his members who are picketing.</p>

<p>At the same time the amendment will prevent officials who do not represent those who are actually picketing from being drafted in to swell the numbers on that picket fine or to act as a prime picket. Therefore, in some respects, we have narrowed the definition as my hon. Friend suggested. On the other hand, we have widened it to the extent that the Opposition asked us to do in Committee.</p>

<p>I beg to move, That the Bill be now read the Third time.<br/>
This is without doubt, a much better Bill now, both in substance and in detail, and we are grateful for the manner in which its provisions have been scrutinised and debated both in Standing Committee and on the Floor of the House. It is worth looking back, in a brief speech, to its origins. At the general election and for some years before, I think that there was no subject that the whole country found more important than industrial relations. Nearly everywhere people could be found who believed that in one respect or another our country was getting the balance wrong. Millions, I believe, thought that the unions were allowed to get away with things that were unfair to ordinary working people. Millions of people&#x2014;I shall be frank&#x2014;were worried as to what would happen if a Conservative Government sought to curtail those privileges. Many more millions of people were deeply afraid of what would happen if a Labour Government did not try to curtail those privileges&#x2014;as they knew would be the case.

My right hon. Friend, when in opposition, gave years to exploring how a fairer balance might practicably be obtained, and I can think of no political task making greater demands upon good judgment. Its consequences were that our manifesto set out an unusually detailed programme. That programme's scheme was to make changes that were limited, certainly, but which were none the less vital. It seemed to find some useful approval. We were supported at the general election by not far short of 5 million trade union members. That scheme is now implemented in the Bill.<br/>
I doubt whether any Bill in modern times has been preceded by more detailed consultation. Its final form incorporated features reflecting views which had been pressed upon us from very many quarters, including the TUC. The stakes that we are playing for surely warranted that degree of deliberation. We want the Bill to stick. The heart of it lies in the proposals for public funds for secret ballots; the proposals for mitigating the injustices caused by the closed shop&#x2014;yet without outlawing that all too deeply-rooted institution; for controlling secondary picketing; and for restricting trade union immunity for blacking and other secondary industrial action.<br/>
I do not place much faith in polls. However, these measures seem remarkably popular among trade unionists. The support for these measures is not surprising. People want secret ballots. To have them paid for is hardly to suffer a crippling attack on a fundamental human right.<br/>
We have widened the scope of the Bill to take account of valuable points raised by the Opposition in Committee. People want sensible safeguards and exemptions in closed shop agreements. They are frightened of the power of expulsion that their unions hold. Why should they not be compensated for unreasonable expulsion, when a card torn up a is a right to work denied? Why should religion provide the sole ground for conscientious exemption?<br/>
People are frightened by secondary picketing. It is intended that they should be frightened. They see it as a bullying intrusion by outsiders. Lawful picketing should be restricted to the place where the picket works. However, we have improved clause 15, so that appropriate union officials can take part.<br/>
People are resentful of secondary blacking, and are often gravely harmed by it. The new clause restricts immunity in a way that accords with industrial reality and industrial expectations. Beyond that line, it restores the protection that common law has always afforded. It is up to employers affected by secondary blacking to make use of the common law rights that are now being returned to them.<br/>
The Bill owes much to comments that we received from industry on secondary blacking, during consideration of the February working paper. It represents our immediate response. We had to make an immediate response to the McShane decision given in the House of Lords, which was made after the Bill had been published. However, immunities are immensely difficult. We shall discuss them further in a Green Paper to be published later this year.<br/>
The function of the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service in recognition issues, and of the CAC in awarding terms and conditions, has given rise to great difficulties in practice. In Committee, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State was pressed strongly to consider any further representations that might be made about the CAC. He agreed to do so. On both these issues the Bill reflects our view that, on balance, these matters are best left to negotiation and conciliation between the parties. We think that that is right.<br/>
I turn lastly to the job protection provisions in the Bill. Two years ago, Lord Lever said that we should take care that the Employment Protection Act did not become an employment destruction Act. We cannot afford to neglect any means that can be achieved&#x2014;without seriously restricting the job protection rights that we support&#x2014;of encouraging employment and of encouraging the small business in particular to expand. That is the purpose of the useful and practical adjustments that we are making. Our good faith is illustrated by the new clause&#x2014;widely welcomed&#x2014;which gives pregnant women a right to a reasonable amount of time off with pay, for the purpose of visiting a prenatal clinic, where that is medically advised.<br/>
The purpose of the Bill is to help to establish a practicable and balanced framework of law, within which people may bargain with each other within in-

dustry upon a fair legal footing. The Bill is practical, balanced and fair. Its Third Reading is deserved.</p>

<p>I shall not take up much time, as several hon. Members wish to address the House. The Bill has been before Parliament for four and a half months. During that time the Opposition have tried to expose its provocative and damaging nature. We have also tried to expose its irrelevance. We could not have done that without the support of my right hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster (Mr. Walker), my hon. Friend the I Member for Islington, Central (Mr. Grant), and the other members of the Standing Committee.<br/>
We have exposed the fact that it is a damaging measure, which fails to deal with the economic problems that face the nation. I suspect that the Secretary of State has not derived much satisfaction from our proceedings over the past few months. Day after day he has had to face the insults and goading of the Tory press, especially the <i>Daily Express</i>. That, in turn, has encouraged some of the extremists who sit on the Conservative Benches. I see that the hon. Member for Reigate (Mr. Gardiner) is in his place. No doubt the hon. Gentleman will seek to catch your eye, Mr. Deputy Speaker. It is the hon. Gentleman's opinion that at least 100 Tory Back Benchers will not be satisfied with the Bill. Last weekend the <i>Sunday People</i> stated:
<q> the dogs having tasted blood are unlikely to stop now.</q>
It has amazed me that over the past few months not one of the Secretary of State's senior colleagues has taken the trouble to support him in any speech made outside the House.</p>

<p>There may have been one or two, but they have been largely silent outside the House. I shall give way to the hon. Gentleman if he can tell me which senior Cabinet colleague has supported the right hon. Gentleman in any weekend speech on this measure. The hon. Gentleman's reaction indicates the isolation of the right hon. Gentleman.</p>

<p>That must have been one of the few Tory speeches that was not reported. All the so-called moderates in the Cabinet&#x2014;for example, the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the Secretary of State for the Home Department and the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs&#x2014;have been silent. That is to be deeply regretted.<br/>
It worries me that some of the right hon. Gentleman's colleagues may be afraid to incur the displeasure of the Prime Minister. At Bournemouth on 22 March the right hon. Lady used the same platform as the right hon. Gentleman to undermine his approach. She said:
<q> We shall be making further reforms ".</q>
That indicates that the Government will be introducing further measures.</p>

<p>It is customary on Third Reading to make some introductory remarks before turning to the measures included in the Bill. Conservative Members&#x2014;[<i>Interruption</i>.] I can understand the difficulty of Conservative Members. They are trying by their frivolity to disguise the great divisions within the Conservative Party. The hon. Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst) called the Secretary of State a coward, or referred to a cowardly act. It was something of that sort. I shall, of course, give way to the hon. Gentleman if he wishes to intervene.</p>

<p>Surely there is no dispute that the hon. Member for Reigate said in a speech during the weekend&#x2014;it was well reported&#x2014;that 100 Conservative Members in one way or another do not support the right hon. Gentleman. Indeed, they have defied him on more than three occasions. It is surely legitimate for the Opposition to say that that is the position and that there are great divisions within the Conservative Party.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman is wriggling.<br/>
I say all this to point out the divisions. Hon. Gentlemen may laugh now, knowing that they will escape to their Division. However, if the Prime Minister has her way, we shall be back here before too long with further legislation.<br/>
The Secretary of State does not want to bring forward further legislation on industrial relations. Last week, in answer to one of his hon. Friends, the right hon. Gentleman said that although he would produce a Green Paper there was no guarantee that legislation would result. That is not what the Prime Minister is saying. The House will be faced with a further measure before the year is out.</p>

<p>I shall not give way again. Other hon. Members wish to take part in the debate, and I understand that we are anxious to move to a vote.<br/>
Free trade unionism is a right to be enjoyed and exercised responsibly. Having listened to debates, I have increasingly formed the impression that a sizeable proportion of Conservative Members regard trade unionism as a crime to be punished. The Bill has started the punishing process. It will have a far-reaching impact on trade union and individual rights. Most of its provisions are a recipe for trouble making and legalistic formulae. The courts, particularly the Court of Appeal, will have a field day with this legislation. That is why the trade unions and some sensible employers' associations oppose it. The weakening of the Employment Protection Act by clauses 10 and 11, which relate to women's rights, maternity pay, and the right to return to work after having a baby, is petty, spiteful and mean. History will record with disbelief that a Government headed for the first time by a woman approved such squalid measures.<br/>
The Secretary of State has been thumbing through the Conservative Party manifesto. I am sure that he will say that the Bill had the approval of the electorate, but I defy the right hon. Gentleman and any other hon. Gentleman to point out where in any of their publications prior to the Election it was stated that they would take away women's rights to maternity pay and the right to return to work. Without strong backing from a strong trade union no woman will have a hope of getting her job back after having a baby. The Prime Minister will be able to boast that her Government reduced employment rights for women in Britain and that they became far worse off than most of their European counterparts.<br/>
The proposals for so-called secondary picketing and secondary action will mean that more industrial disputes go before the courts than ever in the past. I do not believe that a judge should be asked to inspect all the complexities of trade union-employer disputes. It will certainly not improve industrial relations. Experience shows that when the courts are involved industrial relations deteriorate. The Government's record on industrial relations is already disastrous. I have given chapter and verse for disputes in previous debates. At the last count 27 million working days had been lost. The <i>Employment Gazette</i> has not yet been published, so we do not know the up-to-date figures. That is twice as bad as the performance in the period of the last Conservative Government, headed by the right hon. Member for Sid-cup (Mr. Heath).<br/>
In this short debate I can only highlight a few of the far-reaching implications that this Bill will have for industrial relations. The Government have missed an opportunity to win the support of the trade union movement. They have missed the chance to persuade the trade unions to implement their own voluntary guides and build on them. Only a couple of hours ago the Minister was paying tribute to those guides, but the Government have missed the opportunity. If they say, as they have, to the trade union movement " We will not take any notice of your guides&#x2014;we do not regard them very highly and we will move immediately to legislation ", the trade union movement will say " Get on with it, and do not expect any help from us." That is precisely what is likely to happen.<br/>
I do not remember a period in the last 20 years when co-operation with the trade union movement was more important and more urgently required. With inflation running at 20 per cent. and going higher, with investment and business confidence at the lowest ebb for many years, with unemployment rising to 2 million, and with young people leaving school only to be told that society has no use for them, we are debating a measure that is a great irrelevance. This is a Bill to satisfy the irrational emotional vendetta that the Prime Minister has against the trade union movement.<br/>
When this Bill becomes law, it will be a failure. It will cure no industrial disputes, but it will cause many. Along with many other measures that the Government are putting on the statute book, it will cause ill feeling and contribute further to our relative industrial decline. That is why we shall vote against it tonight.</p>

<p>I cannot help feeling that when the right hon. Member for Chesterfield (Mr. Varley) reads his speech in <i>Hansard</i> in the morning, he will be rather ashamed of it. We are entitled to believe that he knows something about industrial relations, but tonight he did not contribute one iota to the debate on Third Reading. Coming from the Labour Party, there can be no doubt that he is an expert on the question of party splits. He certainly tried his hardest to make what he could of the fact that not all members of the Conservative Party, or of any party, agree completely with everything that is in this Bill. There are some things in it that I do not agree with, but I shall unhesitatingly vote in favour of the Third Reading tonight.<br/>
Having said that there are parts of the Bill with which I disagree, I wish to congratulate my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State very sincerely, because he has done a Herculean task. From the very start the Bill was bound to cause opposition from all parts of the House for all kinds of different reasons. After all, this is an extremely difficult and sensitive area and there is no place for a bull in the china shop of industrial relations.<br/>
That view is not imcompatible with the honourable intention of carrying out our election promises, nor with adhering


to certain basic principles for which the Conservative Party stands. A major part of my political philosophy is a deep and passionate love of freedom. I could not live in a country where individual freedom did not exist. I accept that, paradoxically, there cannot be true freedom without some restrictions, notably the restriction that one must never infringe the rights and liberties of others in pursuing one's own freedom. However, that does not arise in this context.<br/>
In a free country it cannot be right to compel people to join trade unions against their will, or to stay in them in contravention of all they believe. I would no more seek to force a pacifist to fight than force a man or woman with fundamental objections to what a union is doing to belong to that union. It is monstrous that a man should be denied the ability to earn his living in his chosen trade unless he joins the union and does exactly what he is told. We are dealing with a very important freedom here. A man has the right to pursue his trade and if he may only pursue it as a union member, then there is something very wrong because some union rules are quite unacceptable. I have had a very interesting time reading some of the rules of our trade unions and I find that almost all of them have rules pledging the union and its members to political ends. The NUR, in rule 4(<i>a</i>)&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>

<p>I do not, Mr. Deputy Speaker, with the greatest respect, think that I can be faulted in this matter, because I am talking about the fact that individuals must join unions and, within the context of the Bill, I am worried that there is insufficient freedom to avoid union membership. Surely it is perfectly relevant and, I submit, most important, to point out that, if one can work only by joining a union and the rules of the union say what they do, some of us should be concerned that the Bill itself does not in all degrees protect people from&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>

<p>None the less, I think you would agree, Mr. Deputy Speaker, that one is perfectly entitled to answer questions put from the opposite side of the House. I was specifically asked which parts of the Bill I did not agree with. I shall pass on, of course, and take your guidance, save only to say that it cannot be right only to have very limited protection from being forced to pursue a certain political end.<br/>
I want to ask my right hon. Friend whether he will let me know about certain constituency cases I have and whether his Bill will or will not protect these people. I raise the case first of a man named John Carney, a quiet, decent. hard-working man, an uncomplaining member of the ASTMS for many years. In fact, he has had to be, because if he had not been he would not have worked. I am not saying for a moment that the membership did not confer benefits, and the Bill itself recognises all the way through that this has been the case.<br/>
This man has paid his dues for many years but felt very strongly about a particular issue of conscience, namely abortion. Because of the complexity of this Bill I have been unable to find out whether he will be protected when it is passed. Whichever side of that argument his beliefs fall does not alter by one iota the case I am putting forward. As a Roman Catholic&#x2014;which I am not&#x2014;he believes very strongly that this particular union's activities in pushing the cause of abortion on demand is something that he cannot support. His dues also support that campaign. He has tried very hard within his rights, to leave the union. I am most anxious to know what the Bill will do for him.</p>

<p>No, I will not give way.<br/>
If a member of a trade union has a perfectly legitimate conscientious objection to membership of that union, will he still be forced to be in it? This particular man has been trying for five years to be allowed to leave that union. He was told that he could not leave the union. The firm has an agreement with that union that if there are religious objections the person can pay his union dues into a charity. He has tried to do this and has nominated a charity, because he has no wish to avoid paying his union dues.<br/>
In January he completed the official form of resignation. Now I come to the thing that worries me, and to what I want to know about with regard to this Bill There was actually a vote within the union, which decided that he could not leave the union. So he has had to leave his job. Can I tell him that this Bill will help him or not?<br/>
Last month the Transport and General Workers Union branch at Davenports in Birmingham voted for a 24-hour official strike. The engineering department voted unanimously not to strike and the management said there would be work for the engineering branch, but it had to back down because force was exerted by the union. Can I tell my constituents that this Bill will not stop situations of that kind and protect their right to work?<br/>
In Birmingham there is a scandalous state of affairs in the printing industry. All recruitment must be done through the union office. No person is allowed to apply for or accept a job except under the terms laid down by the unions&#x2014;that is either SLADE or NGA. This can, and indeed does, give rise to all sorts of coercion of individuals and companies and gives the unions a monopoly in the supply of labour, which, there can be no

doubt at all, strikes at the very roots of individual freedom.<br/>
What I am asking is whether the Bill will help the widow who came to me for advice. She had taken on her husband's printing firm and had to recruit to replace him and also another person who had retired. She had been told by the unions that they would not permit her to take on any new labour unless the unions&#x2014;and the firm was not unionised&#x2014;were allowed to nominate the people she should employ. Will the Bill stop that? To my mind the closed shop is an evil. The Bill encompasses the closed shop and does certain things to help people with regard to sackings through closed shops.<br/>
But what of the situation of the person who cannot move because of the diktat of the unions? Will the Bill help that person? The closed shop is an evil. Managements may find it convenient and I know that this has been a very important point to my right hon. Friend in weighing up the Bill's content, but it is still an evil. The unions are, I think, the most powerful estate in our land, and to operate such force on the backs of bound men cannot be right. Certainly, it is not compatible with freedom. My reservations about the Bill lie in that area. However, as I have said, I shall have no hesitation in supporting it.<br/>
I want people to have freedom from coercion, violence and fear with regard to union membership and the use of their labour. But I well understand my right hon. Friend's difficulties. He has tried to reach, through the prickly and easily offended topsoil, to the strata of reason and moderation of the ordinary trade unionists. However, the man to whom I referred has experienced the kind of terrorism of which I have spoken. He looks to us&#x2014;there is no glimmer of hope for him in looking to the Labour Party&#x2014;to protect him, his jobs, his wife and his family from fear. Does the Bill do that?</p>

<p>I was beginning to think that we were back at Question Time. That was a most remarkable Third Reading speech. It consisted of a series of questions to which, no doubt, the right hon. Gentleman will reply in due course. However, it would have been appropriate to use a different occasion for putting questions.<br/>
What has worried me ever since the Bill began its tortuous course is that the public, who are dependent on the press, television and radio for their information, know very little about its contents or about its implications.&#x2014;[HON MEMBERS: " They are on strike."]&#x2014;Well, the press has not been on strike for the last three months. I do not wish to be unduly critical of the press, because I realise that with the plethora of Bills which the Government are pushing through in their headlong rush to create a new record for the amount of legislation in one session&#x2014;I am sure they are aiming to get into the Guinness Book of Records&#x2014;it would be impossible for any newspaper to give more than cursory attention to any Bill. But even the most avid reader of the national daily press&#x2014;I notice that the press is sparsely represented in the Gallery at present&#x2014;is unlikely to have any knowledge of what the Bill is about.<br/>
The 32 sittings of the Committee received hardly any coverage at all, and press descriptions of the Bill have been generalities. It has described it as a Bill to curb trade union power, to reduce trade union immunities and things such as that. The impression has been assiduously cultivated that it is a fairly moderate measure, that the Secretary of State is a very moderate chap and that this is all part of the " softly, softly " approach. That just is not true.<br/>
I appreciate what my right hon. Friend the Member for Chesterfield (Mr. Varley) said about the right hon. Gentleman's difficulties in Cabinet, but it is all a matter of relativity. It simply means that those who are against him are even more extreme than he is. The fact is that this is an extreme measure. There should be no doubt about that in people's minds. It is clearly calculated not merely to curb powers but also to shackle the trade union movement by placing many traditional practices beyond the protection of the law. It goes very much further, and this is a point which the public have not yet grasped. It is also a measure to erode the rights of individual employees, whether trade unionists or not, by taking away rights which in many cases they have enjoyed for generations. Sooner or later, people will realise what is happening.<br/>
Many Conservative Members are fond of telling us that they have a mandate for this and that they were elected on their manifesto. But, in large measure, the contents of the Bill were not foreshadowed in the Conservative manifesto. Its provisions were not spelt out. I accept that in principle the Government have a mandate so far as mandates exist under our constitution, and I accept that they promised to reduce the power of trade unions. But so far as I can recall, they did not promise to launch an onslaught on the hard-won rights of individual citizens. That is what the Bill will do.<br/>
I do not remember the Conservatives promising in their manifesto that they would make it much more difficult, and in some cases impossible, for a woman to get her job back after she had left work to have a baby. I do not remember their promising that millions of people employed by small firms would lose their rights to claim compensation for unfair dismissal if they were sacked within the first two years of employment.<br/>
I am sure that they did not promise the electorate that they would do away with the right of every worker to receive the recognised wage for the job that he does. That right has existed for centuries in one form or another. If Conservative Members doubt that, they should read their history books, because they will find ordinances from the Crown in the Middle Ages on the question of fair wages. The whole concept of fair wages will be destroyed, at a stroke, by the Bill. That right of individual citizens is being taken away.<br/>
There will be a considerable backlash from thousands of people who thought that they were voting for a party that would curb the power of trade unions and will find that they have elected a Government who are taking away the rights of individual employees. Many people failed to understand when they were carried away on the wave of antiunion hysteria in May that trade unions came into existence solely for the purpose of protecting individual workers in a society in which all the organs of power were weighted against them. Trade unions still exist for that purpose and no other.<br/>
Every time that we debate these matters, Conservative Members show that they do not understand the nature of trade unionism. That is largely because of the different social backgrounds of those Members. I do not blame them for not understanding; I do not criticise anyone for ignorance. But I criticise them for using their ignorance to make attacks on the rights of those in different social classes.<br/>
Conservative Members seem to think that a union is separate and apart from its members. A union is not a machine, controlled by robots, which exists to oppress and tyrannise human beings. A union consists of its members.<br/>
It has often been claimed that the Government have learned the lessons from the terrible mistakes that the previous Conservative Government made over the Industrial Relations Act. However, the Bill proves that they have learnt nothing. In some ways, the Bill will be even worse. It will certainly provide lucrative employment for the legal profession. Perhaps that is why it is called the Employment Bill. Lawyers are the only people to whom it will give any employment. The Bill will certainly increase the decision-making powers that will be left in the hands of learned judges, instead of being left to experienced representatives of employers and workers who know something about what they are discussing.<br/>
The Secretary of State, who has now left the Chamber, and the Under-Secretary have spoken more than once about the desirability of finding common ground for the legislative framework of industrial relations. But while proclaiming a belief in a consensus approach, they have recklessly pushed through a measure which, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Chesterfield pointed out, is opposed not only by the whole trade union movement, but by the more enlightened employers' organisations.<br/>
The inevitable result of the Bill will be more industrial strife, more strikes, more disruption and more lost production. Such is the Government's animosity to the trade union movement that they have concentrated on finding ways of defeating workers who take industrial action instead of concentrating on preserving, developing and improving the machinery that would make industrial action unnecessary.

The Government's philosophy and approach is wrong.
<q> They have sown the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind.</q>
Unfortunately, the country will suffer the consequences of the Government's monumental folly.</p>

<p>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak briefly in support of the Bill. I have had the pleasure of listening to the speech by the right hon. Member for Chesterfield (Mr. Varley) on at least half a dozen occasions in Committee. I listened with particular interest on this occasion to see whether he criticised any particular provisions of the Bill. I assumed that he did not disapprove of anything that he did not mention in detail. I do not blame him for using generalities.<br/>
The secret ballot, closed shop, secondary picketing and trade union immunity provisions will make a fair and balanced contribution to putting into proper perspective the grossly excessive powers and privileges of the trade unions.<br/>
The hon. Member for Keighley, (Mr. Cryer), who contributes to debates on numerous occasions, will be aware of one of the Bill's provisions. When trade unionists, who frequently speak of democracy, come to contemplate the Bill, can they do anything but approve the provisions which make secret ballots easier on issues which are important to trade union members? Too frequently do hon. Members opposite say that secret ballots are an expensive and cumbersome method of ascertaining the views of trade unionists. The Bill rules out that expense. I hope that ballots will be used when there is divided opinion among trade unionists on important issues, whether they involve questions of union control or a decision to call a strike.<br/>
Few of my hon. Friends do not have an instinctive feeling that the closed shop is contrary to their principles..</p>

<p>The hon. Member would be wise to remember that the legal profession is open to anybody with the ability to join it. If it were true that the right to work in businesses where closed shops prevail is open to anybody who is willing


to work, and do the job, the problems of the closed shop would not loom as large as they have recently.<br/>
The provision to restrict new closed shops to those who have the support of the overwhelming majority of trade unionists who are affected by them must be applauded. We must look with interest to see whether there is not a further call for the same measures to be applied to existing closed shops so that people have the opportunity to vote upon them.<br/>
I applaud the Bill's strategy in not pushing that extra measure at this stage. The skill of the Secretary of State is that he has introduced measures which are exclusively beneficial, but the country will wait to see whether further measures are needed. That is why I welcome the Green Paper on immunities as a whole.<br/>
The issue of immunities is genuinely an exceptionally difficult problem. One looks forward to seeing what the right hon. Member for Doncaster (Mr. Walker) has to say on this particular aspect because he must have, at least, considered the whole question of immunities when he was in a position of responsibility in the Department of Employment.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman must have agonised about whether his own party had not gone too far in removing all immunities and granting unrestricted privileges. He may find it inconvenient during this short Third Reading debate to make any particular comment but I should have thought that the whole country believes that the blanket&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>

<p>I am grateful for your guidance, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I was concentrating, I hope correctly, on the point which the Bill sought to cover within the context of that which it might have sought to cover.<br/>
To coin a phrase, the most striking feature of the Bill is its restriction of picketing to the place of work and to those who are involved in the industrial action. Recalling the excesses at the Saltley coke works&#x2014;and I suspect there are only two Members of this House who

did not regard that as disgraceful&#x2014;and having seen, more recently, the effects of secondary picketing at Hadfield's, in Sheffield, and at Sheerness, the whole country will applaud the fact the such picketing has now been restricted to an employee's own place of work.<br/>
Furthermore, the whole country will applaud the fact that it has now been recognised that the existing criminal law provides considerable protection if only it is properly applied and enforced. The combinations of the reasonable restriction of secondary picketing and the realisation&#x2014;as has often been said by Labour right hon. and hon. Members&#x2014;that the criminal law should be enforced, along with the new measures and the three points that I have mentioned, demonstrates how important it is that this Bill should receive the support of the whole House.</p>

<p>If this Bill is, as the Under-Secretary said, a better Bill now than when it started its life, that fact does not owe much to the hon. Member for Hemel Hempstead (Mr. Lyell). During almost 100 hours of debate in Committee the hon. Gentleman firmly maintained a Trappist silence. Having heard him this evening, I understand why that was the case.<br/>
Since I have mentioned the Under-Secretary I am going to say something that may surprise my right hon. and hon. Friends. I wish to express my thanks and appreciation to him for the way in which he did his share of the work of getting the Bill through the House.<br/>
Inevitably, in Committee it is the Under-Secretary rather than the Minister who has the biggest job to do. Although I, of course, disagreed with about 90 per cent. of what the Under-Secretary said in every speech that he made, I think that all members of the Committee, whether they agreed with him or not&#x2014;and there were hon. Members on both sides of the Committee who disagreed with him&#x2014;should be grateful to him for the patience and the clarity with which he advanced his own arguments and sought to rebuff the arguments of those with whom he disagreed.<br/>
This is a pernicious Bill. To steal a phrase from the French, it is worse than a crime; it is a mistake. From the Government's point of view, it is worse


than a crime; it is a mistake&#x2014;because it will succeed brilliantly in achieving objectives that are precisely the opposite of what the Government had in mind when they introduced the Bill. I think that that will happen in four ways.<br/>
First, the Bill is aimed at trade unions and trade unionists. It is absolutely clear that it will adversely affect the interests of all workers&#x2014;trade unionists, non-trade unionists and anti-trade unionists alike. That is the first way in which it will achieve an objective different from what was sought.<br/>
Secondly&#x2014;I speak from some little first-hand experience of these matters as a result of sitting through 100 hours in Committee going through the Bill with a small tooth comb and discussing it with management and worker friends in industry&#x2014;the effect of this measure will be to increase the number of unofficial strikes. There will be more unofficial disputes, they will be longer and more bitter, and they will be more difficult to resolve. That is the second way in which the Bill will achieve exactly the opposite objective from what the Government want.<br/>
The third objective was to try to clarify the law once and for all. Of course, we can never clarify the law once and for all, but the Bill was supposed to make a big advance in that direction. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Chesterfield (Mr. Varley) and my hon. Friend the Member for Rotherham (Mr. Crowther) said, there will be more industrial relations matters in the courts as a result of this measure.<br/>
That will lead to a fourth problem. I prophesy that ere long somebody will be imprisoned as a result of the Bill. It is no good talking about taking the criminal law out of it. One day someone will refuse to pay a fine, will refuse to be distrained, and will be imprisoned.<br/>
I have considerable regard for the Secretary of State&#x2014;much more than some of his hon. Friends have for him&#x2014;but he should now be getting his right hon. and learned Friend to increase the staff of the Official Solicitor's Department, because many more official solicitors will be needed&#x2014;[<i>Interruption</i>.] The hon.

Gentleman has obviously dined very well. When he gets on a bit, he will learn to take his roast beef better without being the worse for it. I suggest that the right hon. Gentleman will need more official solicitors because he will have more Pentonville fives. He will be on the same hook as was his predecessor in a previous Conservative Government, and he will have the job of getting off that hook.<br/>
I said that this was a pernicious Bill. It is a mean Bill, too. Although it is aimed in general at all workers and will adversely affect them, three groups will be most adversely affected. They are the three groups who are most vulnerable. I worry about this matter, because I have an inner city constituency where there are many workers who fall into these three groups. The three groups are the low-paid, the women workers and the employees of small firms. On average, they will be more adversely affected than other workers. In inner city areas, such as the one in which my constituency is situated, that effect will be felt very sharply.<br/>
When we came out of Standing Committee&#x2014;where we had good debates with very good arguments&#x2014;and got on to the Floor of the House, most of the stuff that we heard from the Government Benches was highly theoretical and grossly uninformed.<br/>
The speeches that we heard were based not on reality but on mythology. We heard the sort of chit-chat that goes down very well over the brandy and cigars in an expensive city luncheon club. We heard the sort of chit-chat that goes down well over the pre-Sunday lunch gins and tonics at the nineteenth hole of a Surrey golf club&#x2014;or, if one looks to the female of the species, the sort of chit-chat that goes down well under the dryer&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>

<p>I was saying that the females of the species employ the same sort of mythology when they sit under the dryer in the luxury beauty salons in Mayfair.<br/>
This mythology derives a great deal from Conservative Members reading the newspapers. Most of this uninformed anti-trade union talk is fostered by the newspapers. I am always amazed that members of the newspaper industry&#x2014;with, perhaps, one exception, the worst record on industrial relations of all industries in Britain&#x2014;believe that that record authorises them to tell other people how to run their industrial relations.<br/>
An example of the worst brass-necked impertinence and the worst presumption in the world is that of the <i>The Times</i>. That newspaper was off the streets for a year, because its management badly mishandled an industrial dispute that, if it had been handled properly, could have been settled much earlier on the terms that were eventually conceded. As soon as <i>The Times</i> returned, its journalists started writing pontifical leading articles telling people how to run their industries. That reminds me of the motorist who was convicted of dangerous driving and who had his licence taken away for a year. As soon as he got his licence back he opened a school of motoring to teach people to drive in the way that he drove.<br/>
We have heard passionate speeches about the wickedness of trade unions

from the throbbing heart of British industry represented on the Conservative Benches. We have listened to the hon. Member for Winchester (Mr. Brown). Winchester's blast furnaces light up the night sky, right across the New Forest and down to Beaulieu Creek. We have heard about industrial relations from the hon. Member for Reigate (Mr. Gardiner). Reigate's busy shipyards emit the clang of metal on metal that reverberates right up St. John's Hill, over the North Downs, and hits the stockbrokers below their belts. [HON. MEMBERS: " More ".] Those 100 samurai on the Tory Benches are not merely anti-trade union. The trade unions and the workers are their secondary target. Their first target is the Secretary of State for Employment, and he knows that. They want to be rid of him. That would not be serious if it were not for the fact that they have the support of the leader of their party, the Prime Minister.<br/>
When on television the right hon. Lady publicly humiliated the right hon. Gentleman&#x2014;who is a man of spirit and character&#x2014;I wondered why he stood for it. I think I know why he stood for it&#x2014;because he knows jolly well that he will still be there when she has gone. He knows jolly well that when the Tories run into really rough weather they will do what they did to Anthony Eden, to Alec Douglas-Home and to the right hon. Member for Sidcup (Mr. Heath). They will drop her, and that is when the right hon. Gentleman will come into his own.<br/>
I look forward to the day&#x2014;and may it be soon&#x2014;when we shall have a Labour Government to repeal this nasty, miserable Bill.</p>

<p>I wish that I could be as polite about the right hon. Member for Chesterfield (Mr. Varley) as was the hon. Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Mr. Mikardo) about my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Employment.<br/>
I have listened to the right hon. Member for Chesterfield with great interest on Second Reading, in Committee, and during the debate this evening. He reminds me slightly of a junior shop steward, recently elected, who knows nothing about industrial relations and is serving his apprenticeship by being rude to the people on the other side.<br/>
The right hon. Member said that industrial relations law, when it had come into effect in this country and dealt with the trade unions, was generally an unmitigated disaster. He said that it was a disaster because it brought the law into those areas that would be better confined to people negotiating one with another. He seems to forget that the law on industrial relations has been with us, in regard to employers, for generations&#x2014;and there is nothing wrong with that. I would not necessarily disagree that it is right for the law to have some effect on regulations at work and to ensure that proper standards are set for employers in this country.<br/>
But this is a very one-sided argument. When it is a matter of law to deal with specific abuses on the other side of the equation, such as the trade union side, Labour Members throw their hands in the air and say that this is an aggressive and dreadful attack on the rights of ordinary working people, that they cannot in any way support it, and that it will do nothing but harm and damage&#x2014;except for assisting my right hon. and learned Friends to get even more fees than they have already.<br/>
That cannot be the right way in which to proceed. Initially the law was changed in order to restore the balance in society at a time when it was very much in favour of the employers, at the expense of workpeople, but consistently over the last 60 or 70 years it has gone the other way.<br/>
The hon. Member for Keighley (Mr. Cryer) said in the House the other day that there was a conflict between capital on one side and workpeople on the other,

and that the law must be brought in more and more strongly to defend workpeople against the force and power of capital. My submission is that the Bill is needed because the interests of capital and of workpeople are becoming more and more similar.<br/>
There is no point in having a machine costing &#x00A3;1 million if the man who works it can withdraw his labour and bankrupt the company. But increasingly, in an integrated and automated society, that is what happens. We are not dealing with the industrial society of the 1920s or 1930s. [Hon. Members: " They are."] Certainly, Labour Members are, but we on the Government Benches know that we are not dealing with that sort of society; we are dealing in the Bill with the problems that face a modern economy when small groups of people can wreak on society tremendous damage&#x2014;damage that was never previously foreseen.<br/>
I accept that the balance that we seek in this country is a balance in which the law has a small part to play and in which people can get on and negotiate sensibly. But there is no point in denying that the power of the trade union movement&#x2014;the negative power to make life difficult&#x2014;has dramatically increased over the years, otherwise, why was it that a previous Labour Government had to introduce " In Place of Strife "? Why was it that the Labour Government faced such appalling problems in the winter of 1978&#x2013;79? There is no point in denying that any Government will face these difficulties.<br/>
Does this Bill set sensible parameters to the extreme abuses of one side? Previously, the House would not accept such parameters. However, through the provisions of secondary action, secondary picketing, the provisions governing SLADE, and the encouragement of secret ballots, this Bill has succeeded. It represents a sensible and reasonable starting point.<br/>
What would the Opposition have us do? Perhaps they would do nothing and allow the problems to continue. Sooner or later these problems will arrive at their door, just as they appeared after the war, in the 1960s and the latter part of the 1970s. What will they do? Either they will do nothing or they will strengthen further the power of the trade union


movement at the expense of the other side of industry.<br/>
Several of my hon. Friends argue that the Bill does not go far enough. Arguments can be put forward in favour of compulsory ballots and the abolition of the closed shop, and in favour of an individual's right to leave a trade union if he feels, at the end of the day that it does not serve his interests. We face difficult times. Management will face great problems. Our management already spends more time dealing with industrial relations than any of our competitors. If we listen to the advice of some of my hon. Friends, even more time will be spent.<br/>
If people have the right to leave a union at will and to set up on their own, our industrial relations system&#x2014;developed over many years&#x2014;will be undermined. There are more unions per industry in Britain than elsewhere, and that is one reason why the closed shop has arisen. My hon. Friends' suggestions will undermine management's basic ability to survive. Many of my hon. Friends say that management must manage. If they believe that, they should consider the issue carefully before supporting ideas and motions that will undermine management's ability to manage.<br/>
The Bill seeks to establish that certain areas now outside the law are brought within it. The employer will make use of those provisions only if he knows that his employees are with him. The Bill will not be used by the gaffers against the workers. Those who are not involved in disputes, together with their employers, will be able to get injunctions and to go about their everyday purpose. It marks a fundamental beginning in the restoration of a basis on which the law can operate sensibly and even-handedly.<br/>
Britain desperately needs this Bill. It may not work in every instance, and it may need amendment as time goes on. Of course, it may be argued that we shall have to look at it again. Basically, it is a good Bill that has been well thought through. It takes advantage of an expertise in industrial relations that the Conservative Party has not always had. Provided that it is given a chance, it will set us on the way ahead.</p>

<p>I supported the Bill on Second Reading, and I shall do so

again tonight. I should like to join the hon. Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Mr. Mikardo) in praising the Under-Secretary for the way in which he conducted himself in Committee. On occasions, I found his sense of humour a relief. I found his clarity worth listening to, and I appreciated his patience. I appreciated that he was clearly the master of his subject. I pay tribute to him for the way in which he conducted himself throughout the proceedings in Committee.<br/>
I have no doubt that the pendulum of industrial affairs and employment law swung too far in favour of the trade union movement. Those of us who were in the House in 1974 and were employment spokesmen for our parties argued that the measures being enacted by the Labour Government were pushing the pendulum too far in that direction. Experience over the past four or five years has demonstrated clearly the need to try to rebalance the pendulum&#x2014;in other words, to bring it back to the centre. I believe that the Bill is a fair attempt to do just that.<br/>
I have never argued&#x2014;I do not do so now&#x2014;that the trade unions are above the law as it now stands. The issue is not whether they are above the law but what is the law above which they are not. We have to strike a fair balance. The House must be as much concerned with a man's right to work as with his right to strike. It must be as concerned with his right to go about his daily task in peace as with his right to persuade others to his point of view. It has to be concerned with a worker's right to a fair deal and with the right of workers to influence the decisions of those who seek to lead them. The Bill is about all those things.<br/>
The Bill has aroused three principal areas of public discussion&#x2014;ballots, the closed shop and picketing. I voted for stronger action on ballots and the closed shop. In the House, one has usually in the end to choose between Government proposed action or no action. As I believe that no action is unacceptable in the present circumstances, I have tended to opt for the actions proposed by the Government. I have expressed my doubts about the effectiveness of the clauses on picketing and blacking. We shall soon see in reality whether I am right. There


are those in my party who take the view that a code of conduct would have been better. I do not subscribe to that argument, and I have not propagated it during the passage of the Bill. However, time will soon tell whether others in my party are right or whether the Government are right in introducing the measures contained in the Bill.<br/>
I am delighted that the Government accepted the proposal for time off for ante-natal care. However, I am sorry that they proceeded to worsen rights for pregnant women. I do not take the view that their rights have been totally desecrated or denied as a consequence of the Bill, but I do not think that anyone can doubt that they have been worsened. Had I been able to intervene earlier, which I intended to do until I was thrown by the Minister's wrong use of procedure, I should have drawn attention to the rights of immigrant women. I am seriously concerned about the effect that the Bill will have on those women.<br/>
The Government are requiring immigrant women to sign letters, to write letters and to understand the provisions of the Bill when enacted if they are to protect themselves. I am extremely concerned about their rights. That is why I supported the official Opposition in their opposition to the Government's proposals on maternity law.<br/>
I take the view that those who work for small companies are entitled to the same protection in law as those who work for large companies. That is why I supported the official Opposition in their opposition to clause 7.<br/>
I do not believe that this Bill is the answer to our industrial problems or to industrial relations. Long-term solutions lie in full worker participation in industry, works councils, two-tier boards, with employee representation, profit sharing, and the general creation of team spirit. Many of our problems in industry are concerned not with industrial relations but with high interest rates and their effect on the value of the pound. In the past seven days in my constituency hundreds of redundancies have been announced by Turner and Newall Limited, on the basis of the effect of Government policy on the value of the pound. The Bill does nothing to deal with that problem. However, I repeat

that something had to be done in the short term to bring the pendulum on industrial realtions and law back to the centre. The Bill is a genuine attempt to do something.<br/>
During the passage of the Bill in Committee and in the House, I have tried to have regard to individual liberty and freedom and minority protection. I feel that that is my proper role as the minority party spokesman on the Bill. I hope that the Bill does what the Secretary of State intends, namely, provides a stable basis for future industrial relations.<br/>
In passing, I hope that the TUC will think again about its proposed posturing on 14 May. That demonstration will do nothing to halt or alter the Bill, create jobs or help our economy. It will not even do anything for the image of labour and the trade union movement in this country. I hope that all sensible people will ignore the call to strike on that day.<br/>
As has been said, the Secretary of State has worked hard on this subject over the years. He has consulted and listened. He has tried 10 persuade, and it would appear that at least at Cabinet level he has so far persuaded. He therefore deserves to succeed, and I very much hope that he will.<br/>
I do not believe that the Bill is the great and terrible ogre that it is made out to be. If I may say so, I do not believe that the official Opposition believe that. Their actions, attendance and speeches do not give the impression that they believe that. The fight over the 1971 Act should be compared with the attitude to this Bill. I do not object to the weakness of the official Opposition's fight; I merely express the hope that it might be indicative of their ultimate attitude and the attitude that they try to persuade the trade union movement to adopt.<br/>
The Bill has its faults and weaknesses, but it is at least an attempt to do something, which is better than doing nothing, especially when the mass of people in this country want something to be done. I wish the Bill well, and I shall vote for its Third Reading.</p>

<p>As the hon. Member for Rochdale (Mr. Smith) said, the Bill is nothing like as contentious as had been imagined. It has not aroused the great


controversy anticipated in this House or outside. That is partly because it is shorter in length than the 1971 Act. Also, many of the clauses are voluntary and require action by employers, employees, or both, to bring the provisions into force. It does not seek to disturb existing good industrial relations practice. It positively encourages the good parts of our industrial relations that already exist.<br/>
I welcome clause 1 and should like to know when the scheme for ballots will be introduced. In the various parts of the clause whereby public money is given for the calling of ballots, the subsection that provides that unions can claim money for ballots for the amending of their rules is particularly important. I hope that unions will look carefully at some of their rules and especially their procedures before calling industrial action.<br/>
On clause 2, in spite of the remarks of the right hon. Member for Doncaster (Mr. Walker), the Secretary of State will not introduce codes of practice until ACAS has been consulted. I believe that ACAS will welcome the fact that the Secretary of State will introduce the codes after consultations, because there are certain subjects, such as picketing, industrial democracy and grievance procedures, in respect of which ACAS, because of its composition, cannot easily bring about such codes.<br/>
On the closed shop provisions, I particularly noticed that in our debate on Second Reading my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State said that the Department of Employment had done a survey on existing closed shops and had found that when people had a genuine conscientious objection to joining their anxieties were taken into account. In the Bill, we are trying to strengthen that I hope that the Department will publish a regular report on the way in which the closed shops are working. Some closed shops have come about as a result of ballots many years ago, and it would not be right or sensible to insist that there should be a re-run of that procedure.<br/>
On clause 7&#x2014;the small business clause&#x2014;I welcome the fact that we have altered the law over unfair dismissal. However, I have one reservation. We have wiped out of the Bill subsection (1)(<i>c</i>) of the

new section inserted in the 1978 Act whereby a dismissed employee must be informed in writing of the effects of the clause. Someone must inform would-be employees when they take employment in a small business that this part of the 1978 Act does not apply to them. This is particularly so when one considers that many of those employees are young people seeking their first jobs.<br/>
I welcome clause 12, on ante-natal care. I hope that we have got it right on the question of the time allowed before one can put in an appeal to an industrial tribunal if one's employer has not paid for time off. I assume that there is an automatic right of appeal to the employment appeals tribunal if one does not get justice in the industrial tribunal.<br/>
On the question of clause 17 and the alteration that wipes out ACAS's role in recognition procedures, there are a number of cases that ACAS has in mid-stream on recognition procedures. Will they now be dropped, rather than proceeded with?<br/>
In Committee and on Third Reading, we have asked what will happen now. All I would say on the Green Paper on immunity is that the consultation must be wide and meaningful and must pay special attention to those in personnel on both sides of industry&#x2014;shop stewards and personnel managers&#x2014;who spend every waking moment of their working day dealing with this problem. I am not sure whether further legislation will be necessary, and I suggest that it will be impossible to say for some time. However, I think that we have got the balance right in this Bill. We now need a period of industrial stability and peace in order to get legislation working. My right hon. Friend certainly deserves the support of the House in putting it on the statute book.</p>

<speech hansard_id="1744482" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1980-04-30a.1528.0" hansard_membership_id="3056" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/3203" speakername="Mr. Giles Radice" colnum="1528" time="22:28:00">
<p>The Second Reading of this Bill was more than four months ago, and since then we have spent 32 sittings and more than 100 hours in Committee. An amazing number of words have been uttered about this Bill, mainly from Labour Members. I congratulate the Under-Secretary on the way in which he piloted the Bill through.<br/>
What kind of Bill do we have on Third Reading? On Second Reading I called the Bill " more mean that modest ", and


certainly it is still mean. It takes away rights. Clause 5 still removes from the employer the onus of proof. Clause 7 still takes away the right to claim for unfair dismissal for employees in small businesses. Clauses 10 and 11 still weaken maternity rights. Schedule 11 of the Employment Protection Act, which gives some protection to the low-paid, will still be removed. Far from protecting the rights of individuals, the Bill actually reduces them.<br/>
If the Bill was ever a modest one, it has long since lost all its modesty. Clause 6 introduces major changes in the closed shop arrangements which will lead to endless litigation. Clause 14 bans secondary picketing and is very tough and restrictive; it will certainly cause disruption. The new clause on secondary action will bring judges right back into industrial relations.<br/>
On Second Reading and in Committee, the right hon. Gentleman said that his purpose was to restore the balance in industrial relations by introducing a new law. Our contention is that law in these areas&#x2014;closed shop, picketing, secondary action&#x2014;will, in fact, make matters worse and that the best way to proceed is by voluntary means, such as in closed shop arrangements, as the Department of Employment survey shows, with TUC advice and a code of practice on picketing and secondary action.<br/>
On Third Reading, it is not in order to discuss what is not in the Bill, and that has been a good thing, because we have heard from most of the hon. Gentlemen who have been speaking on Report&#x2014;those people whom the Secretary of State has beaten off night after night. The only trouble is that this means that the Bill is merely a first instalment and that we shall probably get more later, if the Prime Minister has her way.<br/>
Whatever we say tonight, however, the real point of decision is not in this House but elsewhere. In one of his rustic phrases, the right hon. Gentleman said that he thought that his Bill worked with the grain of industrial relations. We think that the opposite is the case; we think that it works against the grain of industrial relations. The only test of that will be in factories and companies throughout the land.

This Bill, like the ill-fated Industrial Relations Act 1971, will fail. Far from improving industrial relations, it will make them worse, and in doing so once again it will bring industrial relations law into disrepute. In the end, this House will have to adopt a different approach&#x2014;an approach based on industrial democracy. Whether we or those on the Government side of the House are right, only time will tell. I believe that events will prove us to have been right, rather than them.</p>

<p>On Second Reading, I said that I believed that the Bill would be one-third of a loaf. I am glad to say that a few crumbs&#x2014;perhaps it is ungenerous to call them crumbs, and I should say " a few slices "&#x2014;have been added to the size of the loaf and it is now larger than it was, but it is still less than half a loaf.<br/>
Will the Bill work? Is it sufficient? Has it got the teeth to bite on those occasions when damage or disobedience may occur in industrial disagreements? I believe that it will work, not because of its intrinsic strength but solely by permission of the trade union movement, that is to say, the TUC and the trade unions that comprise it. The question is whether that permission will be granted. I believe that it will be granted only as long as it suits the trade union movement. Industrial power for the unions is needed; but it is, I believe, only for political purposes that the extra immunities for the trade unions have in recent years been obtained. Their power has grown, is growing and ought to be diminished; but it has not been sufficiently diminished by this Bill.<br/>
Why do the trade unions resent the removal of any immunities that have been taken away by this Bill? After all, if one looks back, one sees that provisions concerning safety, health, factory conditions, minimum wages, unfair dismissal and redundancy have all been introduced at a time when the unions were less powerful than they have been since the days of the 1974 Act, which the previous Government introduced.<br/>
Why do the trade unions resent the removal of their immunities in the small ways that have been provided for by this Bill? The only reason that I can see


is that, although they plead that they are becoming weaker in relation to employers, the reality is that they are able to boast that they can bring down Governments. It cannot be a consistent argument to say, on the one hand, that they are weaker in relation to employers while, on the other, they say that they have demonstrated that they are precisely the reverse in relation to Governments.<br/>
If this reform is to take place step by step, will a second step at trade union reform be practical? I offer to my right hon. Friend the gloomy prospect that public opinion in favour of trade union reform will evaporate if this lot does not work. Disenchantment with legislation will grow, union clamour against any further reform will mount, the political will to achieve any further change will be non-existent, and election fever will then become the order of the day. This Bill is to be the only Bill, and for that reason it must succeed. For that reason, even though I believe it to be half a loaf, it will have my support.</p>

<p>I understand that there is a general feeling in the House that we should rise at a reasonable hour. [HON. MEMBERS: " No."] Therefore, I wish to speak very briefly. If I echo some of the things that have already been said, I do so deliberately, because I think that some of them deserve emphasis.<br/>
In their speeches tonight, Conservative Members have confirmed what some of us have believed all along&#x2014;that they do not mind people having rights in industrial relations, such as the right to belong to trade unions and the right to strike, just so long as they do not try to practise them and make them effective.<br/>
I thought that the hon. Member for Hemel Hempstead (Mr. Lyell) was shooting from the hip and that he let the cat out of the bag when he referred to the grossly excessive powers of trade unions. He went on to speak of the abuses of picketing, and so on. I commend to him and the House some recent words from perhaps the best-known tyre salesman in Britain, Sir Robert Mark, who said on television:
<q> Those who frame new laws sometimes give insufficient weight to enforcement. They devote such care and time to debating the moral

implications but assume, often quite wrongly, that people can be made to obey them".</q>
I again remind the House of words uttered to Conservative Members that laws can be effective only if they have the tacit acceptance of those to whom they apply.<br/>
My right hon. Friend the Member for Chesterfield (Mr. Varley) referred to extremists on the Conservative Benches who are pushing the Secretary of State along a path that I believe he is reluctant to take. None the less, he has been forced along it step by step, to use his own phraseology, by the ultras and the bully-boys&#x2014;not only those who have taken part in our debates but those who have not participated&#x2014;who reflect the strength of the extremist view on the Conservative Benches. I noticed that several hon. Members jeered at my hon. Friend the Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Mr. Mikardo) when he forecast that as a consequence of the Bill some workers would eventually finish up in gaol. It seems that there is a view among Conservative Members that pickets should go to gaol.<br/>
I hear voices of dissent, but I should like to quote from an article in the <i>Sheffield Morning Telegraph</i> headed " Prison urged as curb on unions ". It says:
<q> One of the leading Tory back benchers on law enforcement and penal reform is urging that trade unionists found guilty of offences connected with picketing be prohibited from attending further demonstrations, under pain of imprisonment ".</q>
It goes on about the hon. Member for Paddington (Mr. Wheeler), a former Home Office crime researcher&#x2014;and a former assistant governor at Brixton and Wandsworth prisons, by the way. This was in a report published by the Conservative Central Office, which says also that powers should be given to ban all demonstrations and assemblies in certain areas&#x2014;and all this in the context of a report on crime.<br/>
That is not the first time that we have had the clear impression from hon. Members on the Government Benches that, somehow, the exercise of basic trade union rights is to be identified with the commission of criminal offences.<br/>
I say that the right hon. Gentleman is being pushed along this road in a step-by-step process that I described in Committee as the salami tactic of cutting the


trade unions down to size slice by slice. It has already been made quite clear that this is only one in a whole series of instalments, leading us back down the road towards the days of the Industrial Relations Act.<br/>
During the passage of the Bill, we heard from right hon. and hon. Gentlemen opposite literally torrents of words of abuse of trade unions and trade unionists for allegedly forcing people out of jobs or denying people access to work, yet throughout the whole of the many hours&#x2014;I think, in all, between 125 and 130 hours&#x2014;I cannot recall a single right hon. or hon. Gentleman on the Government Benches uttering a word of criticism of employers who unfairly dismiss; not a word of sympathy for the employees, the workers, who are arbitrarily, peremptorily, unfairly dismissed; not a crumb of comfort, not a word of sympathy for the 1&#x00BD; million people unemployed. Their numbers will grow, largely as a direct consequence of the policies of this Government.<br/>
The Government talk about their approach being fair and balanced. They might show a little balance by seeing that occasionally there is room for criticism of employers, room for sympathy for people who have been sacked and room for sympathy for those deprived of their jobs and very often their basic employment rights.<br/>
I believe that this Bill, like the Industrial Relations Act before it, irrespective of what it does in direct terms, is already inevitably souring and poisoning the climate in which industrial relations in this country are conducted. I believe that, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Chesterfield said, it will destroy such good will as this Government might have sought from the TUC and individual unions. No Government in the history of this country ever needed the support of working-class organisations as the Government do at present.<br/>
I believe that the Bill will have a similar effect to that of the Industrial Relations Act. My right hon. Friend referred to 27 million working days lost owing to disputes in this country. I ask the right hon. Gentleman to contrast that with the performance of the last Labour Government. If my memory serves me aright, 27 million working days is a number in excess of those lost in the year

of the General Strike, and probably the highest number lost in a single year in this century&#x2014;and that is the position before the measure gets on to the statute book.<br/>
I believe that it is already having the same effect as that disastrous Act&#x2014;that is not my word; it was the Director General of the CBI who said that. It will have that effect and of course it will in due course suffer the same fate as the Industrial Relations Act: it will be swept from the statute book.</p>

<p>There will be few more important Bills and few more controversial Bills going through the House during the course of this Parliament, and yet the whole atmosphere has been so different for those of us who were in the House in 1971. I think that this is due as much as anything to the fact that the Opposition now recognise that it is time that the law on industrial relations was clarified, and that something has to be done.<br/>
The question running through all these debates has been, what should be the role of the law in industrial relations? The Opposition's view, as we have heard it this evening and on a number of occasions, at least in speeches, is that the law has no place. They are happy to see the law place obligations on employers, and they have been happy to see the law give special rights to trade unions, or to suppress the rights of individual workers in a closed shop, but at the same time they argue that it should never be used to limit the damage that can be caused by industrial action, however reckless and however tenous its connection with a trade dispute.<br/>
Instead, the Opposition have told us that the voluntary approach, by itself, is all that is needed; that we have a stark choice between the voluntary and the statutory, and that if we choose one we must forgo the other. That has been the gist of what they have been saying throughout this evening.<br/>
I tell them frankly, though I suspect that they already know it, that the British people no longer believe that. The Opposition have played that record for too long. The needle has stuck, and the results have caught up with them. More important, the results now threaten our industrial performance as well.<br/>
Because of the emotions, history and prejudices of the whole of this century, this is an area in which we are wise to move with caution. We have always welcomed the efforts of trade unions to put their own house in order. Nothing in the Bill removes ultimate responsibility from them. But issuing guidance is not enough. It has to be made effective. Trade unions must accept responsibility for ensuring that their own guidance is made to stick and that those who flout it are brought to book. Without that acceptance of responsibility, the currency of voluntary guidance is devalued, and that is what we have seen over the past 10 years.<br/>
If the trade union movement had used the past decade to do what it promised in 1969, namely, to put its own house in order, I do not believe that we would have spent so much time debating changes in the law as we have over the past four months.</p>

<p>Is the Secretary of State trying to persuade us that the TUC, which now represents more workers than ever before, will accept the major concepts of the Bill? Is the right hon.

<p>I shall come to that aspect later. I want to ask the Opposition some questions. Is it really their view that no changes in the law are necessary? Do they believe that no protection is required for individual workers against the abuses of the closed shop, or that secondary picketing and the ability to spread industrial action far and wide, beyond the parties to the original dispute, are essential for trade unions to be able to do their job?<br/>
Do the Opposition believe that no changes are needed in the unprecedented volume of employment protection legislation that has gone through the House in recent years, or that nothing needs to be done to protect workers from the bullying tactics of a union such as SLADE?<br/>
Those are the questions that the nation is asking. Some of my hon. Friends have

asked them of me, because they want me to go further.</p>

<p>The Opposition have failed to solve the problems themselves, yet, having put 160 clauses and 23 schedules of trade union and employment legislation


on the statute book in 1974 and 1975, they tell us that the law has no place in industrial relations. If the Opposition hold to that view, it is tantamount to saying that at no time may any Government or Parliament pass a law or take action that is considered necessary and right, simply because a powerful group, operating independently of Parliament, says that it will not, or cannot, obey the law. That is dangerous talk, and it strikes at the heart of parliamentary sovereignty and democracy.<br/>
If there were other occasions in our history&#x2014;as there were&#x2014;when power left Parliament, paradoxically it was the industrial barons of the last century who occasioned the need for the privileges which the unions subsequently secured from Parliament to protect their proper rights.<br/>
We have a duty to pass legislation and to ensure that it is enforceable. We also have a duty to make as certain as we can that the legislation is fair and just to all sections of the community. I believe that the Bill fits and passes that test.<br/>
I have said that I do not rule out the possibility of further legislation. Whether we have more legislation, what it does, and when it comes, will depend above all on the response of unions and management to what we are passing tonight. Some have been quick to say that the Bill will not work and that they will do all that they can to prevent its working. The people who say that must recognise the implications of what they are saying. The Bill takes an essentially reasonable approach to remedying abuses that the vast majority of people&#x2014;and the majority of trade unionists&#x2014;want stopped. They are not prepared to see the purposes of the Bill frustrated or subverted. If that were to happen there would be great pressure to take much stronger action. Who is to say that that would be unreasonable?</p>

<p>An awesome task of leadership lies ahead for those who are responsible in the trade union movement. I know that some accept that, but to others&#x2014;still too many&#x2014;it still seems easier to indulge in the luxury of opposition than to bring about reform. The course of blind opposition is not the course that will serve the interests of trade union members. Let there be no doubt in the minds of those who are affected by the Bill's provisions. The Bill provides a framework. What happens within that framework is up to unions and management. They alone can forge the better relationship in industry that will restore our economy, rebuild our industry and produce employment for our people. It will also help to restore our self-confidence as a nation.</p>

<p>The last Administration tilted the balance too far towards the unions, and often towards unofficial groups acting in defiance of official union leadership. The Bill tips the balance back towards responsible management and responsible union leadership. Management and unions are responsible for the day-to-day conduct of industrial relations. Ultimately, they alone can bring about the improvements that we need. Laws can shape behaviour over time, but they will not transform deep-rooted attitudes overnight.</p>

<p>I beg to move, That this House doth agree with the Lords in the said amendment.<br/>
This is a technical amendment. Like the other amendment that we have before us tonight, it was moved by the Government on Report in another place and it was unopposed, so there is no reason why it should detain us for long.<br/>
The House will remember that clause 1 deals essentially with the vesting of the property, rights liabilities and obligations of British Aerospace, the corporation, in a company nominated by the Secretary of State. It ensures, in effect, that that company will become a full successor to the corporation.<br/>
Subsection (3) provides that in all agreements and documents, with the exception of enactments, all references to British Aerospace after the appointed day will refer to the successor company. It is in connection with that exception that a small problem has arisen which the amendment seeks to rectify and which I hope will meet with the approval of the House.<br/>
Under section 31 of the Aircraft and Shipbuilding Industries Act 1977, British Aerospace has been enabled to seek compensation for onerous transactions undertaken by one of the vesting companies before nationalisation. At the moment, arbitration proceedings under that section

are in hand in respect of one alleged onerous transaction. After the day appointed for the vesting of the undertaking in the successor company, the right to continue those proceedings under section 31 will vest, along with all other rights, in the successor company.<br/>
However, section 31(9), which enables the arbitration tribunal to make an order for compensation in respect of an onerous transaction, provides that the order may be made only in favour of the corporation and not of the successor company.<br/>
As I said, subsection (3)(<i>c</i>) specifically exempts enactments from the general provision in the subsection that references to the corporation are to be taken, after the appointed day, as references to the successor company. This would have the effect that, if proceedings in the case to which I have referred were still pending after the appointed day, they would be carried on by the successor company, but any order for compensation could be made only in favour of the shell corporation.<br/>
An amendment to section 31 is therefor necessary to ensure that, after the vesting, an order for compensation is made in favour of the successor company and not the corporation, so that the right to compensation will vest with all other property, rights, liabilities and obligations of the corporation in the successor company.<br/>
This narrow amendment adds a new subsection to clause 1. We believe that it is necessary, because the arbitration proceedings to which I have referred are of uncertain duration and there is a risk that an order for compensation would not be made until after the appointed day.<br/>
I hope that hon. Members will agree with me that this is a sensible and equitable amendment. As I said, it is a technical one and is fully in accordance with the Government's overall policy that the company should be the full successor to the corporation. It is not a controversial amendment, and I hope that the House will agree with the Lords in it.</p>

<speech hansard_id="1744525" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1980-04-30a.1546.0" hansard_membership_id="6398" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/16392" speakername="Mr. Les Huckfield" colnum="1546" time="23:05:00">
<p>We note that the Minister of State is up to his usual tricks. On this Bill, he always says that everything that he is proposing is of really minimal consequence and does not make much difference one way or the other. When we begin to look at it, we


find that it is of great significance and that it conceals a great deal more than he pretends to the House.<br/>
When the hon. Member wrote to me on 2nd April&#x2014;I am grateful that he did so&#x2014;he put at the end of his letter the words
<q> I thought you should know of these amendments in advance; you will agree that they are not points of substance.</q>
I knew then that something was up, because that is exactly the technique that he has used to ply and plough his way through the Committee stage. Having read the debates in the other place, and having just heard his performance here, it is clear to me that nothing has changed.<br/>
A great deal of my hon. Friends' time has been spent on the Bill. That is why they have come to hear what the Minister says tonight. They are very concerned. The Opposition are not whipped. My hon. Friends are here because they want to be, and not because they have to be. But we know that the hon. Member for Preston, North (Mr. Atkins)&#x2014;I dignify him with that title&#x2014;is here only because he wants to see how his share applications are likely to go. It is well known&#x2014;he will be interested in these compensation issues&#x2014;that he has only one interest in seeing the passage of the Bill on to the statute book: he wants to buy as many shares as he possibly can.</p>

<p>That is an unparliamentary remark.</p>

<speech hansard_id="1744527" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1980-04-30a.1547.1" hansard_membership_id="6398" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/16392" speakername="Mr. Huckfield" colnum="1547" time="23:05:00">
<p>It cannot be unparliamentary, because the hon. Member for Preston, North said that he wanted to buy the shares. I cannot help it if the hon. Member for Grantham (Mr. Hogg), who does not come to this place very often, did not hear his hon. Friend the Member for Preston, North say that, but it was said, and my hon. Friends can testify to it. The hon. Member said that he wanted to buy the shares. I have news for him. The flotation of the new company is apparently to be put off yet again, and may not now take place until the autumn. I hope that he will be able to stay in this House that long.<br/>
But it is, of course, to the amendment from the other place that I wish to turn. The Minister would have us believe that this is simply a matter of transferring any compensation benefits from the current

statutory corporation to the shell company and then to the fully publicly quoted and properly fledged successor company. He said that it was a simple matter of ensuring that any benefits from arbitration landed in the lap of the new successor company.<br/>
11.15 pm<br/>
The Minister has failed to tell us that an almighty argument is going on about compensation. I wonder when arbitration will end. Perhaps the company will be renationalised before it has been concluded. The Minister knows that the Labour Party will renationalise British Aerospace without compensation. The Government should get themselves up to date about the position of those proceedings.<br/>
The Minister told us that the issue of compensation would take a tiny bit longer than anticipated. In his letter to me, he wrote:
<q> We had previously understood that a settlement would be reached before the appointed day.</q>
I have news for him. Has he read the <i>Financial Times</i> of 16 January? There is an article in that paper by Robert Cottrell, who is supposed to know what he is writing about. Presumably he would not have been given a job with the <i>Financial Times</i> if he did not. [<i>Interruption</i>.] If hon. Members are unhappy about using quotations from the <i>Financial Times,</i> I can quote from other journals and newspapers. I thought that they trusted the <i>Financial Times</i>. If they do not, they should tell us whom they do trust.</p>

<p>Conservative Members are making the usual sounds of whipped men. We know that they have been whipped. They would not be here if they did not have to attend. If the hon. Member for Preston, North knew how his shares would go, he would be off. He is staying only to find out what will happen to them.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman is not doing the House a service by tackling the amendment in this way. Is he aware that some Conservative Members are here because they


have Hawker Siddeley or British Aerospace factories in, or close to, their constituencies? Those factories employ many people. We are here to ensure that the Bill safeguards a satisfactory future for the new company. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will treat this issue seriously. Many Conservative Members hope that the Bill will be given serious consideration. We are concerned about the future of the new company and the employment that it will provide.</p>

<speech hansard_id="1744531" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1980-04-30a.1549.0" hansard_membership_id="6398" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/16392" speakername="Mr. Huckfield" colnum="1549" time="23:05:00">
<p>Perhaps I can intervene in my own speech. Although the hon. Member for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton) claims to represent a peripheral British Aerospace constituency&#x2014;more peripheral than that of the hon. Member for Preston, North, who is not allowed to speak&#x2014;he should know that the Bill was first mooted on 24 July 1979. It received a Second Reading in the middle of November 1979. Nevertheless, this is the first time that I have heard the hon. Gentleman speak on this subject. Perhaps he was ill. Perhaps he is still ill. If he was ill, he must have been ill for a very long time.</p>
</speech>
<speech hansard_id="1744532" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1980-04-30a.1549.1" hansard_membership_id="312" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/3497" speakername="Mr. Nicholas Winterton" colnum="1549" time="23:05:00">
<p>The hon. Gentleman will appreciate that hon. Members cannot intervene on every subject relating to their constituencies. Is he aware that although some Conservative Members may not speak, they take an active interest in such issues? They follow debates in the House and in Committee. Again, is the hon. Gentleman aware that although I represent a constituency in which British Aerospace is " peripherally " of interest&#x2014;I consider that it is of great interest&#x2014;I have met representatives of the company on a fairly regular basis. Indeed, I have made representations to the Government about the areas in which they are concerned. I hope that the hon. Member will withdraw his rather unfortunate remarks.</p>

<p>I want to focus attention on the amendment, but I ask my hon. Friend to forgive the hon. Member for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton), who has outside interests.

<p>My hon. Friend has put the matter in proper perspective. The hon. Member for Macclesfield appears to feel strongly about aerospace, but it is the first time in this Parliament that I have heard him speak on the subject.<br/>
I hope that you will forgive me, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I was side-tracked because I dared to indicate that I was about to quote from the <i>Financial Times</i>. I referred to compensation, which is the subject matter of the amendment. Before I was distracted by Conservative Members, I was about to quote from the <i>Financial Times</i> of 16 January 1980. The Minister of State would have us believe that we are dealing with a simple issue&#x2014;merely transferring any benefits from the compensation arbitration to the new successor company. I hope that the Minister will tell us how long the compensation proceedings will take.<br/>
The article in the <i>Financial Times</i> to which I have referred states:
<q> GEC and Vickers, for example, have received a &#x00A3;40 million down payment for BAC. The two companies mooted compensation in the order of &#x00A3;200 million at the time of nationalisation. Vosper has received &#x00A3;1&#x00B7;3 million whereas it is believed to be seeking up to &#x00A3;25 million.</q>
<q>Those companies now moving into arbitration must steel themselves for further delays of some two years before final settlement is reached.</q>
You will note, Mr. Deputy Speaker, that Conservative Members are leaving the Chamber. The great interest in aerospace on the Conservative Benches is waning already.</p>

<p>My hon. Friends are here because they want to be. The article continues. I refer to a passage about three


or four paragraphs after the one that I have quoted. Reference is made to the procedures that may have to be followed to the Court of Appeal and other courts. It states&#x2014;I hope that the hon. Member for Macclesfield, who for the first time professes an interest in aerospace matters, will listen:
<q> The upshot is that some companies will have waited more than eight years for compensation by the time settlement is reached.</q>
If they have to wait that long, British Aerospace will have been renationalised. There will not be any compensation that time round.</p>

<p>The Minister tries to pass this over as a matter of little significance. Does he thing that by some crude sleight of hand he can dismiss the issue?<br/>
The House cannot dismiss the fact that some companies might have to wait eight years before their compensation is settled. If the hon. Member for Macclesfield does not like that&#x2014;he should be interested in compensation, as some of his constituents might still be awaiting compensation&#x2014;he should address himself to the circular that was issued by Vosper on 12 February. It was sent to a number of shareholders. I hope that my hon. Friends will listen to me quoting from the circular, because I know that they follow these matters assiduously. The letter is signed by Sir John Rix, MBE, the chairman of the company.</p>

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. The hon. Gentleman has been discoursing on compensation in general, which is dealt with under sections 35 to 41 of the 1977 Act. This amendment refers only to section 31, which is a different matter. It involves the safeguarding of assets, and so on.<br/>
I seek your guidance, Mr. Deputy Speaker, whether it is in order to deal with general questions of compensation in discussing this amendment? Secondly and specifically, I cannot see that Vosper-Thorneycroft, which is a shipbuilding company, has anything to do with the aerospace industry.</p>

<p>That is the phrase that I was about to use.<br/>
I was trying to concentrate on section 31 of the Aircraft and Shipbuilding Industries Act 1977, with which the amendment deals. It is with that section that the letter from Sir John Rix is concerned. The letter was sent to all shareholders.<br/>
I see that the hon. Member for Macclesfield has crossed the Floor. Perhaps he has been persuaded by my arguments. [<i>Interruption</i>.] Mr. Deputy Speaker, you will appreciate that I have to put up with a great deal of distraction from the Conservative Benches&#x2014;and some of the distraction has now crossed to this side of the House.<br/>
The letter says:
<q> We do not understand how virtual confiscation can be condoned by a Conservative Government, particularly when it is considering the sale of a part of a confiscated industry on a willing buyer/seller or open market basis. Furthermore "&#x2014;</q>
and this is the chairman of one of the companies, who is acutely concerned about what will happen to these arbitration proceedings under section 31&#x2014;
<q> the Government's present stance is in stark contrast to the statements on the subject of compensation by Conservative spokesmen when in opposition.</q></p>

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. The hon. Gentleman is talking about a shipbuilding company, which has nothing to do with aerospace. Secondly, despite what he says, he is not dealing with the matter covered by section 31 of the 1977 Act; he is dealing with a matter totally separate from tonight's amendment or anything to do with the Bill and one that involves the payment by Government for assets nationalised


by the previous Administration. The amendment that we are discussing involves compensation that might be payable to British Aerospace or, as the amendment would allow, to the successor company. I submit that these are totally different matters and that the hon. Gentleman is out of order.</p>

<p>Further to that point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. It is a difficult, complicated and highly technical amendment. I was following my hon. Friend's comments with considerable interest.

<p>Further to that point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I am now in some difficulty. The hon. Member's own letter to me of 2 April refers to section 31 of the Aircraft and Shipbuilding Industries Act. He should know that when the last Labour Government nationalised aircraft and shipbuilding they did so in the same Bill. He should also know that the argument that is currently being advanced by Vosper-Thorneycroft is exactly the same as the argument of GEC and Vickers. In fact, it is all the same kind of argument. The Minister knows that, as aircraft and shipbuilding were nationalised together, all those who need compensation, all those who still fear that they may have to go to arbitration, are putting exactly the same case. Because of that, I am bound to cite one of the companies that have been most vociferous in demanding compensation. Just as the shipbuilding company has been very vociferous in demanding compensation under section 31, to which the hon. Gentleman refers in this letter,

so also have GEC and Vickers been equally vociferous. It is the same argument&#x2014;that is why I have sought to make it tonight.</p>

<p>Further to that point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I was on the British Aerospace Bill Committee, and the 1977 Act was widely referred to exactly in the terms that you mentioned&#x2014;by way of reference, in order to illuminate the proceedings on the present legislation. However, because the 1977 Act is altered by the British Aerospace Bill, it must involve some references that my hon. Friend the Member for Nuneaton (Mr. Huckfield) will have to go into in some detail because of the technical nature of the Act that is mentioned in the amendment.</p>

<p>Obviously I shall be bound by your ruling, Mr. Deputy Speaker, because I always appreciate the wisdom that you bestow on our proceedings, but here we have a company that stands in need of compensation and is accusing the present Conservative Government of the near-confiscation of assets. That is the accusation that is being advanced&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>

<p>On a point of order. May I repeat what I said a few moments ago about this amendment and section 31 of the 1977 Act? It is not correct to say that the matter that the hon. Member for Nuneaton (Mr. Huckfield) is trying to raise falls within the scope of that section.


It does not. Compensation for the companies that were nationalised by his Government was dealt with under other sections. Section 31 deals with compensation that might be payable to British Aerospace or to the corporation. It is a totally unrelated matter.</p>

<p>I am being placed in exactly the same utterly intolerable position as that in which the Opposition were placed all the way through the Committee stage. Time and time again the Government sought to railroad the Bill through the Committee because they want to flog the company off to their supporters. We are witnessing the same again tonight.<br/>
We cannot find out the truth about the new company. Even the memorandum and articles of association were placed in the Library only at the beginning of this month. We have engaged in some consultations. We have found that the memorandum and articles of association are not technically complete, but are deficient, so we cannot find out what the new company is all about.<br/>
We are not satisfied with the memorandum and articles of association that have been placed in the Library. We cannot find out when compensation will be paid. We cannot find out when the arbitration proceedings will be concluded. We have a major private company that is accusing the Government of virtual confiscation, yet the hon. Gentleman keeps saying that we cannot even ask questions about it.<br/>
If we cannot find out about the sucsecssor company&#x2014;the successor company is relevant, because it is mentioned in the amendment&#x2014;if we cannot find out about the arbitration proceedings, if we cannot find out when the compensation issues will be settled and if we cannot ask questions about those matters, what is relevant? What is germane to the arguments on the amendment? That is precisely what people want to know. They

want to know when they will get their money. They want to know when the compensation proceedings will be completed. They want to know when the arbitration tribunal will be wound up.<br/>
Companies are actually talking about going to the European Court of Human Rights because they cannot get any sense out of the Government. The hon. Gentleman comes to the House and, with a mere sleight of hand, says " It is all right. It is just a bit of technical redrafting ".<br/>
The way in which the hon. Gentleman has treated the Bill and the way in which the whole denationalisation matter has been treated is an insult to the House and to the workers in the industry. The hon. Gentleman has not enlightened any of us tonight by the way in which he has tried to dismiss the amendment and to cover up what is actually taking place at present in the matters of compensation.<br/>
We are far from satisfied about the way in which amendments such as this are being treated. We cannot find out what kind of successor company we are talking about, because we believe that the memorandum and articles of association are deficient. We cannot find out about the compensation. It is questions such as these that must be answered before we can agree to take further any amendments like this.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman goes on to talk about the successor company and its possible flotation. People in the City are beginning to wonder whether the company ever will be floated. It is not our fault that the minimum lending rate stands at 17 per cent. [<i>Interruption</i>.] The hon. Member from wherever it is takes a very scant interest in our proceedings, anyway. Perhaps he wants to buy the shares as well. I should have thought that hon. Members on the Government Benches wanted to see the passage of this denationalisation legislation and the flogging off of British Aerospace. If so, they should be very concerned about the fact that their Government are dragging their feet on denationalisation. I quote from the financial page of the <i>Sunday Telegraph</i> of 6 April. It is headed&#x2014;rather appropriately&#x2014;" Sale of the Century ". It says:
<q> Now aerospace offer grounded.</q>


This is very germane to the successor company, because it is the successor company which is being talked about in this amendment. The article goes on:
<q> The Government's plans to sell off British Aerospace to the public have crashed into a solid wall of record breaking interest rates. I understand that the Bank of England and the Department of Industry are now resigned to a postponement of British Aerospace flotation until Autumn at the earliest.</q>
Some questions must be answered before we can take the amendment further. When will this new company be floated? It is not only that the previous private owners want to know when they are likely to receive their compensation; it is that the country as a whole is entitled to know when the Government intend to carry out their election pledges. As far as we can see, there will be delay after delay. It is possible to imagine a situation in which we may never have a successor company. Before we can take anything further forward tonight, we want to know about the flotation.<br/>
While I am talking about the successor company&#x2014;the hon. Gentleman will recognise that the successor company is entirely relevant, because it is mentioned in the amendment&#x2014;I ask whether the hon. Gentleman has looked at the memorandum and articles of association of the new successor company? Whilst we are talking about some of the benefits of the arbitration proceedings possibly passing to the successor company, I hope that my hon. Friends&#x2014;I know that they will be very concerned about this&#x2014;will take note of the fact that the Secretary of State has allowed himself to be almost completely deprived of any powers that he might have wished to have to control this new company. That is the kind of successor company that is mentioned in these amendments tonight.<br/>
We want to hear from the Secretary of State exactly what powers to appoint directors he intends to exercise. Article 72, on page 30, says that the Secretary of State may reserve to himself the right to appoint two directors. The trouble is that if he is reserving to himself the right to appoint only two directors out of a board of six he is, in fact, reserving the right for himself to have a permanent minority influence.<br/>
Furthermore, the directors whom he appoints will not be entitled to be the chairman or deputy chairman of the company, will have no casting vote, no vote

on any contracts between the company and the Crown, and no power of veto. If that is the kind of condition to be imposed on the Secretary of State's own appointments to the board of the company, I have to ask what is the use of the Secretary of State's even bothering to appoint directors. It seems that he has reserved to himself powers that will be so minimal as to be virtually meaningless.<br/>
What does the hon. Gentleman think that the Secretary of State's appointed directors will be able to do? As far as we can see, all that they can do is to ask for a meeting and speak at it. That is all. If that is the way in which the Government intend to preserve the vital strategic interests of the nation, they ought to have said so in the defence White Paper. Vital defence equipment manufacture will be at stake, and the Secretary of State has allowed himself to be manoeuvred into a position in which he may possibly reserve the right to appoint two directors, who cannot really do anything once they are on the board.<br/>
It is issues such as this that we really must have settled to our satisfaction before we take the matter further. I must ask the forgiveness of the House for raising these matters at this late stage, but, as the hon. Gentleman did not put the articles in the Library until 2 April, and as this is the first chance that we have had to refer to them, this is the only way in which we can find out what we want to know.<br/>
Article 100, on page 39, provides that the minimum borrowing powers of the new company&#x2014;presumably that will have to be private borrowing, because as far as we can see none of the nationalised industries in future will be allowed to do any Government borrowing&#x2014;will be at least &#x00A3;450 million. I should have thought that that would vitally threaten the survival of the successor company and could, at certain times, render it vulnerable to fluctuations on the private market.<br/>
What I have said demonstrates the need for much more information before we can take further either of these amendments tonight. It is particularly unfortunate that the hon. Gentleman always comes before this House and tries to dismiss anything that he introduces as merely a technical and drafting amendment, when what he has tried to do is to skate over the fact


that, although the new memorandum and articles of association have been placed in the Library, when we study them they give rise only to even more worries.<br/>
11.45 pm<br/>
For example, I cannot see for the life of me how article 40, on page 19, is supposed to prevent British Aerospace passing into foreign ownership. Yet that is suposed to be the most technically perfect example or variant that the Government have produced to prevent British Aerospace passing into foreign ownership. Having taken legal advice on this matter, I am advised that it is absolutely impossible for British Aerospace to police in whose names the shares will be held.<br/>
If the hon. Gentleman really means that these articles are intended to prevent the new company passing into foreign ownership, I must tell him that on the basis of my legal advice they do nothing of the sort. Therefore, we could well end up in a situation in which any benefits from the arbitration proceedings in compensation terms, which might ultimately be paid to the successor company, will not end up in this country. They might end up in foreign hands. As far as we can see, there is nothing in article 40 to prevent that happening.<br/>
Far from being a technical, drafting amendment&#x2014;this is why my hon. Friends are showing such great concern about it&#x2014;[<i>Interruption</i>.] At least my hon. Friends are taking an interest, which is more than Conservative Members are doing. Far from being a simple drafting or technical amendment, which is necessary because the Government forgot something when the Bill went to the other place, we are discussing matters of great moment. We are talking about when the compensation might finally be paid. We are talking about the fact that we may have to go to the Court of Appeal, or even to the European Court of Human Rights. We are talking about whether all this might take as long as eight years. As I have said, we hope that by then the companies will have been renationalised. All that is involved in this argument.<br/>
We must also raise&#x2014;because it is only appropriate to do so&#x2014;the question of the memorandum and articles of the new company. Now that those have been placed in the Library&#x2014;of course, it was

not our fault that they were put in the Library so late&#x2014;I hope that we will be forgiven if we ask what kind of company the new successor company will be.<br/>
Unless we get some satisfaction on these points, I am afraid that we shall have to detain the House even longer. I know how strongly my hon. Friends feel. We want some answers. We were not given many answers in 19 Committee sittings, or on Report. I hope that the hon. Gentleman or his hon. Friend will try to give us some answers now.</p>

<p>I shall be very brief. Although the hon. Member for Nuneaton (Mr. Huckfield) may not think that we are interested in this matter, I can assure him that we are, as I tried to imply earlier. Although the hon. Member for Keighley (Mr. Cryer) brought in the fact that I happen to have some outside interests, which do not detract from my parliamentary duties or take me away from the House, they perhaps assist me in understanding commercial matters. In fact, this is a commercial matter, and I have been involved in the formation of a new company. Therefore, I share some of the concern which has rightly been expressed by the hon. Member for Nuneaton about the memorandum and articles of association of the company.<br/>
I want to direct my remarks particularly to that, because I am concerned about how the compensation to the successor company might well be affected if there were a heavy foreign interest in that successor company. From the answers that my hon. Friend has given me in response to letters that I have sent him and to private words that I have had with him expressing my concern about certain aspects of this Bill, I am not sure how the new successor company could deal with that situation.<br/>
If there are substantial sales of shares to foreign investors or their nominees&#x2014;the hon. Member for Nuneaton rightly mentioned this matter&#x2014;perhaps, ultimately, with the risk of the appointment to the board of foreign directors, how in the long term, if the compensation to which the hon. Gentleman has referred could take up to eight years to be finalised and passed through to the successor company, will that going distributed, and what effect will it have upon a company that might at that time have a substantial foreign investment?<br/>
I say to my hon. Friend on the Front Bench that I want to see the company denationalised, but at the same time I want to see that a guarantee is written into this legislation, or the articles or the memorandum, whereby not only this House but the people who work for British Aerospace can be assured that the company will remain predominantly British for all time.<br/>
There is one other matter that I want to raise. It relates to the anxiety that many members of the company feel that British Aerospace could be divided up and that the more profitable elements of British Aerospace might well be sold off separately in due course. How, then, would this compensation, which is very much part of this Lords amendment, be effective if there were separate companies to which compensation would ultimately have to be allocated and distributed?<br/>
While I do not agree with some of the remarks of the hon. Member for Nuneaton about the lack of trust that the Government have shown and the way in which they have bulldozed the Bill through&#x2014;I would not have thought that 19 sittings, on a fairly straightforward Bill, indicated that the Government have sought to bulldoze the Bill&#x2014;certainly there are some unanswered questions.<br/>
That is one of the reasons why I am here. I remain somewhat dissatisfied with the assurances and guarantees that the Government have been able to give, because, as I have indicated, I want this company to remain British. I believe that it is vital that a company in this strategic area of our economy&#x2014;and it is an important defence industry&#x2014;should remain predominantly British. There should be a minimum only of overseas investment and interest in this company, because this is a very important matter for Britain and for our defence.<br/>
I also believe that it is important that those who work for the company should not be messed about by nationalisation and denationalisation. I am strongly opposed to the way in which the Opposition have said that they will nationalise the company again when they come back to power&#x2014;if they ever come back to power&#x2014;and that they will do so without compensation. I hardly think that that will give confidence to the very skilled and basically responsible work force

employed by British Aerospace.<br/>
I am concerned that this company should remain one unit. There is no point in selling off the profitable elements. I do not wish to get out of order and therefore suffer criticism from you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, but I must ask my hon. Friend how this amendment and the articles of the new company could operate if it broke up and compensation had to be allocated in some way to two or three companies that on vesting day were part of British Aerospace Ltd., the new aircraft corporation that we are forming.<br/>
I hope that my hon. Friend can be a little more forthcoming. Certainly, ploughing through the memorandum and articles of association of the company that are in the Library and that were placed there, as the hon. Member for Nuneaton said, only on 2 April, is hardly the best way of proceeding with a very important matter. I understand the urgency and the difficulty, but perhaps even at this late stage my hon. Friend can be reasonably forthcoming with the assurances that I seek. I know that hon. Members on the Opposition Benches seek these and other assurances and, perhaps more important, so do those many thousands of people who work in this important industry.</p>

<p>I follow the remarks of the hon. Member for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton) with some enthusiasm. However, the hon. Gentleman spoke of not " messing about " with this important industry, and I have to ask who has messed about with a success story in terms of public ownership, high technology, worker participation and management involvement in a new industry.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman raised an important matter, and those who are messing about with British Aerospace sit on the Treasury Bench. Like the hon. Member for Macclesfield, I want a satisfactory future for British Aerospace Ltd., but it is significant that, after all the inquiries made in Committee, a Conservative Member should express doubts about foreign involvement in this key industry. The hon. Gentleman still doubts whether the Government can give the necessary guarantees.</p>

<p>I appreciate that, Mr. Deputy Speaker. Even at this late stage, when we are discussing Lords amendments, a Conservative Member is still worried and seeks reassurances from the Minister about the dividing up of British Aerospace Ltd. How glad we are that the hon. Gentleman has taken up the arguments that the Opposition put week after week in Committee.<br/>
Some of my constituents who work in British Aerospace told me today that they would like to hear the debates on the Lords amendments. They said that they had heard that another place had taken on a new, robust attitude and was defending people's interests and putting a check on the Government.<br/>
My constituents had read the sort of articles that appear in <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> explaining that when Labour Governments are in power their Lordships check abuse by the Executive and when Conservatives are in power they look after the interests of the workers. I had to show them the amendments&#x2014;the rather mediocre effort of another place to defend the interests of those who have worked hard to make common sense of a high technology industry. British Aerospace reports for 1979 show a success story during a depressing period for British industry.<br/>
The Minister of State has tried to finesse us on the problems of British Aerospace by talking about this amendment being a technical problem, a problem of compensation for " onerous transactions ", " orders in favour of the corporation ", " successor companies " and so on. But the hon. Member for Macclesfield still has doubts, and the hon. Member for Preston, North (Mr. Atkins) has fled the field. Only the Government spear carriers are left.<br/>
Many of us work with and for those in British Aerospace. Throughout our debates, the Minister of State has never carried the workers or the management. The only people whom he has carried are the ideological spear carriers on his Back Benches. He has not even carried the hon. Member for Macclesfield.<br/>
The Minister has much to answer for in going through with this terrible, meddl-

ing, ideological Tory manifesto commitment. He should be ashamed of himself.</p>

<p>I am grateful for the opportunity to make one or two comments. Clearly the technical nature of the amendment indicates the rushed nature of the legislation put to the Commons and the lack of information which horrified even the hon. Member for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton). Even when the Minister has written to the hon. Member, and no doubt begged him to read what was there, the hon. Member is still not satisfied. That is an indication of the rushed nature of the legislation.<br/>
12 midnight<br/>
The amendment remedies an oversight which, because of the absurd process which the Government adopted to pursue the denationalisation measure, they overlooked. The Minister argues that the amendment is necessary, although it was not recognised before, because some arbitration might result in money being awarded to British Aerospace&#x2014;a public body. The Minister wants any such money to be awarded to the successor company. The successor company is not clearly defined because of one of the more obscure parts of the Bill. Whether the successor company relates to the transitional company or the final company is not clear from the amendment. It rests on the words " successor company ".<br/>
If the award is made to the corporation, that might delay clause 10(9) of the Bill under which the Secretary of State may, by order,
<q> after consulting British Aerospace and the successor company, dissolve British Aerospace on a day specified in the order, as soon as he is satisfied that nothing further remains to be done by British Aerospace under subsection (3) or (6) above.</q>
I am not too concerned that the successor should be denied the money if it helps to keep British Aerospace alive and prevents its winding-up by instrument.<br/>
I assume that " the successor company " means the final company and not the shell company. The minister mentioned the shell corporation and said that the money should not go to it. I assume that if money did go to the shell corporation&#x2014;that is, British Aerospace which is at present vigorous, healthy and profitable&#x2014;when the profits are transferred, the money awarded under the arbitration procedure would go to the Consolidated


Fund. I am all in favour of that If arbitration awards are made, they should go into the public purse rather than to the successor company.<br/>
During debates on the Bill, the successor company was held to stand on its own feet with sturdy private enterprise entrepreneurs making independent decisions. That is utter nonsense. It is a fabrication. The Bill contains a number of provisions which set up a company in a partial way.<br/>
I like to take the Minister at his word. If the successor company takes on the task against my wishes and against the wishes of the majority of workers, it must accept that arbitration claims are proceeding, that they are for the previous corporation and that it pushes out the boat on the private enterprise venture as it stands now. It should not pick up awards in future years which arise as a result of British Aerospace activities.<br/>
I am not keen on letting this clause through at all. It seems to me&#x2014;given the economic circumstances that the Government are creating, including the climbing rate of unemployment&#x2014;that they cannot recover, and will not be able to recover, by 1984&#x2013;85 in any convincing way. Therefore, there will be a Labour Government. That Labour Government will be committed to renationalising and activating the British Aerospace corporation, and if that corporation is still in existence it will be so much easier for that task to be carried out. Therefore, it seems to me that this technical amendment, indicating as it does the rushed, sloppy and careless nature of the legislation, is being pushed through by a Government motivated by a doctrinaire drive which would not disgrace any Right-Wing Government in Western Europe.<br/>
The Government have been sloppy in their approach, and the Lords have brought forward this techncal amendment to make sure that the successor is guaranteed a position free of any sort of encumbrance. I take the view that they should take the position as it stands and push the private enterprise boat out without any encumbrance and without any possibility of income from any award. That might well help keep British Aerospace in existence&#x2014;I shall be interested to hear the comments of the Minister if that is so&#x2014;so that it can be resurrected and once again be a source of pride to the nation.<br/>
Conservative Members know that the corporation is currently a highly profitable public enterprise. That is why it is being attacked. The Tories cannot stand public success because such success means that their own dogma is thereby diminished.</p>

<p>I start immediately by disclaiming any interest which I have pursued in this Bill as it has passed through its previous stages.<br/>
When I noted the Lords amendments, I began to pay particular attention to them. I thought that I understood what they meant until I heard the Minister's explanation of what they meant. I then became puzzled once more, and I have had to refer back to the Aircraft and Shipbuilding Industries Act 1977. I promise that I will refer to that Act only by way of illustration, or history, in my speeeh.<br/>
I have observed, both as a result of my involvement in the various stages of the Transport Bill and also at a greater distance in the other denationalisation measures brought before the House by the Government, that one of their major objectives has been to relieve the State corporations, as they pass into private ownership, of any onerous burdens. The objective has been to pile on to those corporations as many assets as possible to make them more attractive to prospective purchasers. This amendment&#x2014;not the product of any ingenuity on the part of the Lords, since it was a Government amendment introduced in the House of Lords&#x2014;is intended to do just that.<br/>
I propose to take the House back, as I think anyone must who is trying to explain this amendment, to the Aircraft and Shipbuilding Industries Act 1977. Section 31 refers to " onerous transactions ". The onerous transactions referred to are transactions which some of the private companies might have entered into prior to nationalisation in order to stymie nationalisation, or to worsen the position of such enterprises as the British Aerospace corporation once they were nationalised. One of the provisions was that a tribunal should be established which would consider whether any loss was incurred, in this case, by British Aerospace as a result of the transactions entered into. The purpose of this provision in the 1977 Act was to protect the public corporation against any unscrupulous or ridiculous activity on the part of the private companies which


were to be nationalised. It therefore seems reasonable that the British Aerospace corporation should be compensated for that kind of action.<br/>
There seems to be no logic in carrying those rights forward to the private owners who now want to buy the British Aerospace corporation because it is a worthwhile asset. For that reason, unless the Minister can convince me that my understanding of the 1977 Act and the Bill and the Lords amendment is entirely erronous, I feel that I cannot support the amendment. It is yet another case of laundering and gilding and making more attractive a State corporation before it is sold to the private sector.</p>

<p>The interesting thing about this debate is that their Lordships, who adopted a critical attitude towards the Bill and fulfilled their duty, as would be expected, accepted the amendment unopposed because they saw it for what it was and were able to comprehend what was behind it. On the other hand, this evening we have had the sort of speech from the Opposition Front Bench which those who served on the Committee got used to and bored with because of its repetition.<br/>
Tonight, because I judge them to have been largely irrelevant, I do not propose to answer all the points made by the hon. Member for Nuneaton (Mr. Huckfield). It would be wrong for me to answer the point that he made regarding compensation because, as I made clear on a point of order, the compensation referred to in the amendment falls under section 31 of the 1977 Act and has nothing to do with the compensation to be paid to the previous owners of the companies which are nationalised. Further, there is nothing in the amendment which has any relevance to the articles of association.<br/>
References were made to the company directors. As always, the hon. Gentleman misquoted. Therefore, I shall correct him on this point. He will be aware that the directors are precluded from voting only on contracts between the company and the Government as customer, but in all other respects will act as full directors of the company.<br/>
There is some small relevance in the point about the flotation. In the case to

which I referred, which is undergoing arbitration, the question was whether the corporation would be fully active when that case was settled or whether the successor company would have been set up. There was a possibility that the limited company would have been set up before the arbitration proceedings closed&#x2014;and, when we looked at this matter some months ago, we thought it likely that they would have concluded quickly&#x2014;but, when it became apparent that that was not so certain, we decided that it would be wise to introduce this amendment in another place on Report, which we did.<br/>
On the other hand, my hon. Friend the Member for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton) related the amendment to two specific points. He questioned whether, if under section 31 compensation were to be paid as an outcome of the present case, it was likely to be paid to a company which was foreign owned or was split up into separate bits. In both those possibilities he saw some complication and sought my guidance.<br/>
The articles of association of the new company will ensure, provided they are not altered, that the maximum foreign shareholding of British Aerospace Ltd. will be kept to 15 per cent.</p>

<p>It is outrageous for the Minister to persist in perpetrating that myth before the House. Even in Committee, on the minimal amount of legal advice that I was able to obtain on a


non-commissioned part-time basis, we put to the Minister amendments which he was forced to incorporate in the Bill because he agreed that they were technically more proficient.<br/>
Having given the articles and memoranda of association a cursory glance and a cursory legal examination, I am advised that the draft article to which he refers will have nothing like the effect that he claims it will have. He knows that as well as I do. There is no way on earth that British Aerospace Ltd. directors can police who really owns or who is the governing force behind the ownership of shares. He cannot prove that.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Nuneaton has admitted that he has given the matter only a cursory look. That is typical of his attitude throughout. The superficiality with which he has dealt with the Bill has shown his real purpose in opposing it, which has been deliberately to stir up anxieties about the future.<br/>
It is true that we received some suggestions from the hon. Gentleman, and we altered the articles on foreign shareholding to a small extent following his advice, which we welcomed. If he shares the view of the Government and those in the industry that the company should not fall under foreign control, and if he really believes that the articles are not foolproof in this respect, I ask him to let me have, as a matter of urgency, the legal advice of which he claims to be aware so that we can examine it. We have taken not a cursory look at the matter but full legal advice, financial advice, and so on.<br/>
It is important that the articles of association should not be changed in this respect, and the Government have stated clearly&#x2014;the hon. Member for Nuneaton may remember it&#x2014;that we shall not let the shareholding of the Government fall below 25 per cent., which is the minimum necessary to block any change in the articles of association, and we shall vote our shares to protect the articles. That is a firm Government assurance.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Macclesfield was concerned about a split. I am sure that if he were to look back through the reports of the Committee proceedings, and if he had been able to join us on Report, he would remember or he would have read clear statements by Ministers to the effect

that it is not the Government's intention to split up the company. For that reason, we chose a single successor company and wrote that into the Bill so that it would not be possible to split up the company.<br/>
If I have to give an assurance again from this Dispatch Box, I am glad to do so. It is not the Government's intention to split up the company. It is not the management's intention to split up the company. I know that it is not the union's wish that the company should be split up. It seems to me, therefore, that it is certain that it will not be. I hope that my hon. Friend will accept that assurance from me.</p>

<p>If the hon. Gentleman is so concerned to give the House that kind of assurance, why have the Government insisted, in the articles which have been placed in the Library of the House, on specific provision for hiving off parts of the new company? They have put in the articles provision whereby the new successor company can hive off. Why do they do that if they do not intend to break it up?</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman simply demonstrates his ignorance of company matters which he has displayed so many times before. Is he really suggesting that no limited company should be in a position to form subsidiary companies, if necessary to dispose of assets and if necessary to acquire assets? That is exactly the sort of rigidity that he and his hon. Friends, if they were in government, would wish to impose on industry. Indeed, it is one of the reasons why so much of the nationalised sector of British industry is in the state that it is.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Macclesfield raised two points which were in line with the amendment. The hon. Member for Stockport, South (Mr. McNally) made a " Fourth Reading " speech, so there was nothing there to answer. The hon. Member for Keighley (Mr. Cryer) tried to draw me&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>

<p>There is one matter that the Minister might explain, even at this stage, although the hon. Member for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton) has collapsed like a deck of cards.

with him the trade union movement&#x2014;the workers in British Aerospace? That is an important question, and he should give some explanation to the House. With all the consultations they have had, the workers still have doubts, and some of the Minister's explanations tonight will increase those doubts.</p>

<p>The reason for there still being some doubts is the campaign, led by the hon. Member for Nuneaton, deliberately to stir up anxieties among people who wish to go on working and earning their living in British Aerospace. I have spent a great deal of time in going round British Aerospace sites to try to undo the damage that the hon. Member has been doing. The unions are very much behind the Government's plans on the two points that my hon. Friend the Member for Macclesfield raised. They welcome the Government's policy of not splitting up the industry and share the Government's wish that the company in the future should not fall under foreign control. I assure the hon. Gentleman that the unions are totally behind the Government on those two very important points of policy.<br/>
The hon. Member for Keighley tried to lead me off into giving definitions and descriptions of the successor company.

<p>It seemed to us to be absolutely right, therefore, that if the corporation, under section 31 of the 1977 Act, was likely to receive compensation as the outcome of some tribunal proceedings, then, if the new company had been formed, that compensation should go to it rather than to the corporation because all the assets, liabilities, property and rights of the corporation are transferred under clause 1 of the Bill to the successor company. The amendment amends clause 1. As I have said, it makes it possible to make compensation payments under section 31(3) to the successor company. It is a wise and sensible amendment.

<p>I beg to move, That this House doth agree with the Lords in the said amendment.<br/>
After the Opposition's synthetic indignation over amendment No. 1, measured by the 18 votes that the hon. Member for Nuneaton (Mr. Huckfield) was able to muster, which is either a reflection on his failure to draw the crowd or perhaps a lack of enthusiasm for the argument that he claimed was boiling up on the Labour Benches, I hope that even the hon. Gentleman will realise that this is purely a drafting amendment which in no way affects the purpose of clause 8.<br/>
The need to make the amendment arises because of the inclusion of the words " by execution ", which, while perfectly correct in English law, could lead to difficulties of interpretation under the law of Northern Ireland. The Government believe that the best way of avoiding that possibility is to remove the words from the Bill, together with the words
<q> or (in Scotland) by diligence ",</q>
which become redundant if the preceding words are taken out. As amended, the wording clearly encompasses enforcement under all these systems of law.<br/>
As I have said, the amendment does not change the meaning of the clause. Indeed, by avoiding ambiguity it clarifies it. I am sure that the House will agree that that is a wholly desirable aim and,

because this is not a controversial point, will not seek to disagree with the Lords in this amendment.</p>

<p>The Government always put on the Under-Secretary when they want a bit of progress made. They know that he treats the Opposition more courteously, and genuinely tries to be helpful.

<p>I agree that the Minister of State is also rather boring.<br/>
I believe that we can accept a great deal of what the Under-Secretary says. He has done a good job in trying to shed light on these matters. We always found in Committee that we made faster progress with the hon. Gentleman. Indeed, one day, when his hon. Friend was in Brussels, we got through two whole pages of the Bill in one sitting. That takes some doing. We knew that, with the Minister of State in Brussels, we could make that progress.<br/>
We appreciate the research that the Under-Secretary has done and the legal advice that he has received, which we hope is right on this occasion. The legal advice that the Government receive is not always right. Having said, I am not exactly in control of what happens on these Benches tonight. I have always believed in spontaneous uprisings of the people. I shall have to be guided by my hon. Friends and their reactions. I know that my hon. Friend the Member for Keighley (Mr. Cryer) always feels strongly about all these matters and may well be moved to catch your eye, Mr. Deputy Speaker. My hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras,


South (Mr. Dobson) has similar feelings. My hon. Friends may feel even more strongly than I do. I pay tribute to the manner in which the hon. Member has proposed this amendment Unlike the Minister of State, the Under-Secretary actually tries from time to time to be helpful.</p>

<p>May I raise one or two questions on this drafting point? First, I found it vaguely annoying that in Committee the Government accused us of trying to delay the Bill by protracted examination when in fact we merely wanted to give it detailed and scrupulous consideration. We were absolutely right to do so. Quite clearly, drafting amendments of this sort would not have been necessary if the Government had got it right in the first place.<br/>
Line 31 of page 7 of the Bill, which is altered by the amendment, includes the words
<q> or (in Scotland) by diligence ".</q>

Frankly, I am not aware what " diligence " is in Scotland&#x2014;[<i>Interruption</i>.] If hon. Members wish to make comments, I am quite willing to give way, especially to the hon. Member for Welwyn and Hatfield (Mr. Murphy), who was singularly silent in Committee and showed a distinct lack of interest, understanding or care for the Bill. [<i>Interruption</i>.] I suggest that hon. Members express their views in their own time and with their own speeches. Many of us have shown great interest in this Bill over very many hours.</p>

<p>I was speaking for myself. If the hon. Member for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton) wishes to make a speech, he is entitled to do so.<br/>
Why were the words
<q> or (in Scotland) by diligence </q>
included in the first place? Now that they are to be excluded, because that seems to be the most suitable way of dealing with the word " execution " which would cause trouble in the Northern Ireland courts, what will be the effect of that deletion? I assume the words
<q> or (in Scotland) by diligence </q>
were inserted because they were designed to make it clear that a particular Scottish legal process applied. If that was a requirement when the Bill was drafted and that requirement has now been removed, what is the position in Scotland now, and will the Bill be effective? In other words, in trying to remove an area of doubt in Northern Ireland, have the Government created another area of doubt in Scotland? Or were the words superfluous, redundant, or otiose in any event?<br/>
It concerns me that this amendment should be necessary at all after the amount of time that we spent on this wretched Bill in Committee.</p>

<speech hansard_id="1744605" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1980-04-30a.1576.2" hansard_membership_id="12423" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2648" speakername="Mr. Dobson" colnum="1576" time="00:45:00">
<p>Ordinarily, I should welcome the deletion of virtually any words from any Bill which the present Government might propose. If Government Front Bench Members were to put forward a manuscript amendment whose purpose was to delete the whole Bill, I should welcome it.<br/>
However, I am surprised at the curious wording which is to disappear. As my


hon. Friend the Member for Keighley (Mr. Cryer) said, if the words were worth putting into the Bill in the first place, why are they being taken out, and what will be the consequence of their removal?<br/>
Presumably, the draftsman put the words into the Bill in the first place because he felt that it was necessary to make clear that the judgment or order became enforceable by execution in England and in Scotland " by diligence." If it is thought right to remove the phrase, it should not have been put into the Bill in the first place. If that is the position, it was a bit of shoddy and superfluous drafting. On the other hand, if the phrase is deleted, it will have some consequences.<br/>
I am struck by the phrase
<q> or (in Scotland) by diligence ".</q>
One normally associates the Scots with assiduousness and diligence, but I still did not understand what the phrase meant although I had a sneaking feeling that it referred to horse-drawn carriages. Sure enough, I discovered from the Oxford English Dictionary that to travel by diligence in France means travelling by a public stage coach. I cannot think that that is what it means. I had to plough a long way through the Oxford English Dictionary before I discovered a meaning which apparently had any relation to this clause from which it is sought to delete the words.<br/>
The only definition I can find which might apply is
<q> the process of law by which persons, lands or effects are attached on execution or in security for debt or "&#x2014;</q>
I do not think this can be it&#x2014;
<q> a warrant issued by a court to enforce the attendance of witnesses.</q>
I think that what that really means is that in Scotland " by diligence " means by execution in England. The Minister did not explain that.<br/>
Therefore, I am still not clear whether there is any difference between the words " by execution " in England, Wales and Northern Ireland and " (in Scotland) by diligence ". I still think that we have not had any explanation of why, if these words were felt to be necessary when the Bill was originally drafted, they are not necessary now. If there is some complication about what the words " by execution " might mean in Northern Ireland.

I should have thought that the draftsman could have come up with something which would retain words which were apparently thought to be necessary at the outset.<br/>
I want to know whether the Government have any precedents for either including or omitting these words. If the Government cannot quote any sensible precedents, although it seems a trivial matter, we may once again have to divide the House.</p>

<speech hansard_id="1744606" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1980-04-30a.1578.0" hansard_membership_id="8954" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/32703" speakername="Mr. Michael Marshall" colnum="1578" time="00:45:00">
<p>The hon. Member for Nuneaton (Mr. Huckfield) opened the debate in his usual cordial vein. I shall respond in like manner. I shall try to meet some of the genuine questions which have been put to me.<br/>
The hon. Member for Keighley (Mr. Cryer) was perhaps seeking to understand the basis upon which these various terminologies arose in the first place. I do not claim to enter into these legal matters with any great expertise, but the fact is that one is here referring to the practice of law under the different codes, particularly as they relate to Scotland as opposed to other parts of the United Kingdom. The change which has been brought forward here arises simply from the fact that the use of the term " by execution " is deemed to be inappropriate in the case of Northern Ireland. The House will recognise that from time to time the terminology within the legal profession itself and the way in which these matters are looked at comes under review. Those words are deemed to be inappropriate in the case of Northern Ireland. It therefore follows that, since the term " by execution " is being removed, there is no need to retain the phrase " or (in Scotland) by diligence ", which was originally included merely to allow for the different terminology in Scotland.<br/>
The hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South (Mr. Dobson), having parked his stagecoach, asked a perfectly fair question about the precedent. I am happy to be able to give him the precedent, because the effect of the amendment is, in fact, to revert to the situation which would apply under section 53 of the 1977 Act, which this clause reflects. We are always very happy when we find precedents set under another Administration which so happily meet the point.</p>

<p>I am not in a position to give the hon. Gentleman an answer about the whole of our legislative framework, I regret to say. I think that, if this is

a matter which he is keen to pursue, he may wish to consider other ways of obtaining that information. What I am concerned with in this Bill is the effect of the amendment, which is to put the words in exactly the same terms as under section 53 of the 1977 Act, which makes no mention of " diligence ". The Bill, like the 1977 Act, can work without it. I hope that the House will feel able to agree with the amendment.</p>

<p>I am very pleased to have the opportunity on the Adjournment to speak on this very important topic. I should make clear at the outset that I am raising this issue with the full concurrence of the constituency Member, my hon. Friend the Member for the City of London and Westminster, South (Mr. Brooke), who is precluded by his membership of the Government from speaking in the House on this subject but is present in the Chamber for this debate.<br/>
I have two interests in raising this matter. First, I have the honour to be a co-opted special trustee of Westminster hospital. Secondly, for many years, Westminster hospital has enjoyed a very close and fruitful association with Queen Mary's hospital, Roehampton, in my constituency, a relationship which my constituents and the staff of Queen Mary's wish to continue. Obviously my purpose in raising this issue is to try to ensure that that happens.<br/>
We are concerned with two different reports: first, the Flowers report of London university on the future of university medical education, which, among other things, recommends the closure of the Westminster hospital medical school; and, secondly, the report of the London Health Planning Consortium on the reduction of the number of acute beds in London hospitals, which recommends, <i>inter alia,</i> the deletion of about 400 acute beds at Westminster hospital so as to reduce the hospital to one of about 100 beds only and to turn it into an annex of St. Thomas's hospital.<br/>
I should say straightaway that I accept that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary has had no part in the preparation of either of those reports, and that he inherited the consortium report from the previous Government. However, he is now in the unenviable position of having to decide, with his colleagues, the proper course to adopt.<br/>
I turn to the Flowers report. As I have indicated, the recommendation is that a hospital medical school with one of the finest traditions of any medical school in London should be closed. Last year, it

had the best academic record in the university at the lowest cost per student. It is said that the benefit would be a substantial saving in funds. Obviously, I do not object to savings in funds, but I rather think that even the least inquiring of minds would be unconvinced by the reasoning in the Flowers report. Even if savings of the order proposed were to be found, if it means the closure of such a medical school, one might think that it would be bought at too high a price.<br/>
I turn to the consortium report. In effect, if it were implemented, it would amount to the destruction of this fine hospital. Of course, it can be said that it will continue to exist, but only in so emasculated a form as to be a pathetic attempt to prove that there is life after death.<br/>
This hospital has been a national, if not a world, leader in many branches of medicine and one to which many dedicated men and women have devoted their fives. It is a hospital of international renown, and it is a matter of bitter regret to me that its future should be called into question in the manner in which it is.<br/>
In the limited time available, I do not want to embark on the merits of the policy of RAWP. I shall content myself by saying that I am an opponent of RAWP, and I regret very much that the Government seem to have embraced that concept. It is equally right and fair to say that the right hon. Member for Norwich, North (Mr. Ennals), to whose work on behalf of Westminster hospital in recent months I pay tribute, is himself an adherent of RAWP. However, in some of the time available, I hope that he will argue that, even if one embraces the principles of RAWP, it is possible to pursue that policy while retaining Westminster hospital in its present form. I believe that that is crucial to the argument.<br/>
It may be said that it would be a good thing if resources were to be allocated out of London and if the real effect was that a centre of excellence similar to Westminster was established somewhere else. But a Labour Member, coming from a constituency in the North-West which is badly served by NHS facilities, indicated to me at lunchtime that he was unconvinced, although he would wish it to be otherwise, that the closure of a hospital such as Westminster would be of benefit


to the people in his part of the country. Therefore, one is driven irresistibly to the conclusion that, whatever view one takes of NHS policy and however one approaches this problem, the proposal to remove this hospital from the map is neither sensible nor tenable.<br/>
There is one essential point I want to advance tonight before I sit down so that other hon. Members may have the opportunity of expressing their views. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has indicated that the Flowers report is a matter for the university and that no imminent decision is to be expected from the Government on the consortium report. Indeed, he indicated to the right hon. Member for Norwich, North in a letter that I have seen that it might even be slightly premature for some of us who are concerned about the matter to go to see him. However, the problem is that those of us who have had meetings with people from London university hear them say that one of the fundamental reasons for the Flowers report proposal is that it was believed that the consortium would recommend the dismemberment of the hospital, and there was no point in retaining a medical school in a hospital that would lose 80 per cent. of its beds.<br/>
Flowers is to be decided and determined by the university within the next three or four months. If the Government do not speak out now, the decision may well go against Westminster medical school. If it does, how much easier it will be for people in the DHSS to say " Westminster has lost its medical school, so why do we not chop it up altogether in accordance with the consortium, and what would be the loss?" That is why I say to my hon. Friend that it is imperative that the Government speak out on this issue, particularly for the reason I have given. But there is another pressing reason why it is essential that the Government should speak out. Many senior staff, men and women with other important duties to perform, are finding that an increasingly dominant part of their lives is taken up by having to act as agitators on behalf of the hospital&#x2014;a position in which, in my respectful submission to the House, they should never have been put in the first place.<br/>
I appreciate that my hon. Friend has an unenviable task, but I must tell him quite frankly that I should not care to be in the position of any Minister who had the blood of this fine hospital on his hands, and I should not care to have to try to justify this to a public which will rightly look upon it with extreme scepticism. I could not personally accept such a position and would both vote and campaign against it, although what I do is perhaps not a matter of great significance. But I have been greatly heartened by the support I have received both from hon. Members present tonight and from others who are not present but have told me of their great misgivings. This applies throughout the House, among senior and junior Members alike.<br/>
I do not think that there is a majority in the House for this proposal, and I hope we shall be able to avoid quite unnecessary bloodshed and strife on this issue. I hope that, if not tonight at least soon, we shall have some words of comfort from the Ministers at the DHSS so that we can all turn our attention to more fruitful matters and not find ourselves in the invidious position of having to defend a hospital that should not need any defending in this House, having regard to the services it has rendered to its Members over the years.</p>

<p>I am most grateful to the hon. Member for Putney (Mr. Mellor) for raising this subject and for the way in which he has done so, and I want briefly to support everything that he has said. I must declare a personal interest. I am a patient at the hospital and have been one for a considerable time. I have no doubt that I owe my life to Westminster hospital, but that is not the point.<br/>
I believe that there is great strength of feeling on both sides of the House and in both Houses of Parliament, about this proposal. Westminster hospital has a world-wide reputation. Its academic excellence is recognised by everyone, and not only does it produce the best results in terms of a medical school but it does so at less cost than any other in the country.<br/>
I want to touch on the central point that was made by the hon. Member for


Putney. The vice-chancellor of the university yesterday met a group of us who are deeply concerned about the future of the hospital, and he made it clear that there would be no question of closing the most efficient and cost-effective of all London teaching hospitals unless it was understood that there would be a loss of 410 beds. Obviously, if it is a hospital of 100 beds, there is no possibility of a medical school. This is why it seems to me that the hon. Member for Putney is absolutely right in saying to the Department that it must take a decision first. I think it would be quite wrong for the university, in view of the difficult position in which it is placed, to take a decision on Westminster hospital on the assumption that 400 beds will go when no decision has been taken about whether 400 beds will go. I hope that the Secretary of State will receive a deputation, that the Under-Secretary will concern himself with the matter and that any final decision will be postponed.<br/>
Not only is there opposition in the House, but the area health authority opposes the closure, and it would be a tragedy if a hospital with such a reputation and a medical school of such academic excellence were to close. I am grateful to the hon. Member for Putney for giving me the chance to add my weight to what he has said.</p>

<p>I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Putney (Mr Mellor) for giving me the opportunity to participate in the debate. I support his view that the Westminster hospital should not be run down and that the Westminster medical school should not be closed.<br/>
I oppose the proposals for several reasons, first from a philosophical point of view. The hospital and the medical school are centres of excellence, and it is surely no part of the Government's policy to close such centres. Secondly, I oppose the proposals on grounds of size. Surely we have learnt by now that big is by no means beautiful. Part of the plan for closing the Westminster medical school would be to enlarge other schools. We need to learn that lesson and not go down the road where mistakes have been made before with nationalised industries and local government in schools.<br/>
Thirdly, I oppose the proposals because

of the record of the medical school. Not only was it top last year in terms of academic record, but the Westminster is top of the list over a 10-year period, and those high standards have been achieved economically. Figures will help. It costs &#x00A3;14,500 to train a doctor at the Westminster. At St. George's the cost is &#x00A3;29,000, and the average cost is &#x00A3;22,000. I suggest that the school is an economic jewel in a rather costly crown.<br/>
For the Westminster medical school, the demand for places is up 70 per cent. over the past eight years, against a slightly falling market for medical school places overall. That reflects the stated desire of students to learn in a small, personal environment where close relationship can be established among students, patients and staff.<br/>
One of my constituents originally alerted me to the problem that he faced as a student currently at the school. He wrote of the qualitative aspect of the school:
<q>This aspect is probably best appreciated by a visit to the medical school. I think that it is sufficient to say that when I was choosing which medical school to train at, I chose Westminster above all others very much because of the atmosphere which even on a cursory visit can be seen to be one of warmth and friendship amongst students, staff and patients.</q>
I turn to the future of the hospital. It is not enough for the Under-Secretary to tell us that the Flowers report is not his responsibility. The recommendation of the report has to be taken in conjunction with the proposals in the discussion document " Towards a balance ".<br/>
I suggest that that document should be considered with much caution, considerable scepticism and very thorough probing. It is unsigned, we have no way of knowing whether it is an agreed document, and the consortium, whatever that term may mean, appears to have been composed of two-thirds bureaucrats and one-third academics. The weight of practising medical opinion was horrifyingly lacking. Despite the title " discussion document ", the paper makes a clear recommendation for the rundown of the hospital, as has already been described most graphically, from 520 beds to a 100-bed hospital acting merely as a support unit.<br/>
Relatively, the Westminster hospital is up to date. It was built in 1938. It is cheap to run. heat and maintain. Many


modern buildings cause great cost headaches. The tower at Guy's hospital is an example.<br/>
High-grade medical developments are going forward in the Westminster hospital. The accident and emergency department is new and heavily utilised. The operating theatres are being completely modernised at a cost of more than &#x00A3;1 million. Some rationalisation of existing London hospitals might be necessary, but surely it has never been, nor should it be, Conservative Party policy to take out a centre of medical and teaching excellence such as this hospital represents.</p>

<p>I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Putney (Mr. Mellor) for allowing me to intervene. I shall concentrate on the Flowers report, which was the basis of the decision to do away with the medical school which is linked to the proposals for the hospital.<br/>
The report does not bear examination. I shall deal with three aspects of it. We are told that it is proposed to save &#x00A3;3 million. But, in the next sentence, the report says that it is impossible to judge how much money, if any, will be saved by the implementation of the report. I learnt today that the university is not prepared to give to the advisory committee, for its Friday meeting, any financial evidence from the report That means either that no financial evidence exists or that it is so weak and paltry that it would be an embarrassment to reveal it. There is no financial nor academic basis for the report. The report recommends closing the pre-clinical schools at King's and the Royal Free, of which I am a member of the academic staff. The two schools represent the epitome of the multi-faculty institution type of preclinical education and integrated education. Yet both are to be disbanded. There is no academic thread running through the report.<br/>
The effect of the report is to increase the size of class to the detriment of academic teaching. We no longer believe that big is beautiful, and yet the organisation envisaged by the report is of mammoth groupings with super-deans and sub-deans galore. That is inimical to the education process.

Why should any of the medical schools be put at risk on the basis of a report which does not stand examination on a financial, academic or organisational basis? On Monday, I put to the vice-chancellor personally that Lord Flowers was picked, at least in part, to lend the eminence of his name to the report so that it would carry greater weight. That causes perplexity because we do not understand why the people involved in the report would want to be associated with something which is so hard to understand on the face of it. What was behind the report?<br/>
There might be a case for rationalising medical education, but not on the basis of the report. I oppose the closure of the medical school and the Westminster hospital.</p>

<p>I have answered a large number of Adjournment debates in the past year&#x2014;more, it feels, than any other Minister&#x2014;but never yet has any Adjournment debate that I have replied to had such a large and distinguished audience. I interpret the remarks that have been made in the debate, from both sides of the House, as a warning shot across the bows.<br/>
I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Putney (Mr. Mellor) for raising the question of the future of Westminster hospital, and I compliment him on the way in which he has presented his case, reinforced as he was by two of his hon. Friends and a former Secretary of State. The hospital also has a friend who is, perforce, silent in this House but who is active in the interests of the hospital outside the House, my hon. Friend the Member for City of London and Westminster, South (Mr. Brooke), who is in his place at the moment.<br/>
This is a subject which has caused much public concern, and I see that the subject is reported yet again in this evening's newspapers. Westminster has a long and distinguished tradition both as a hospital and a medical school. Many hon. Members have reason to be grateful to the staff of the hospital for the help and treatment that they have received, and some, as we have heard this evening, even owe their lives to the hospital.<br/>
Eighteen months ago, I had occasion to visit the hospital with a cracked rib.


I was given excellent personal service by the staff. Owing to my unusual height, three X-rays of my rib cage had to be taken, but it would be churlish of me to hold that against the hospital.<br/>
I am aware that many right hon. and hon. Members have signed an early-day motion on the subject. Nobody can deny that Westminster is a much-loved and valuable hospital. My hon. Friend, as a special trustee of the hospital, knows this better than I do, and he has eloquently drawn our attention to the contribution which the hospital has made in many areas. I endorse what he said about the fine record of the hospital.<br/>
I equally understand the anxieties which the staff and patients at the hospital and those at the medical school must feel. The efforts which they have put into the campaign to save the hospital is evidence of their commitment to it, and I must say that they have conducted that campaign with commendable restraint and intelligence. I know that for them this is a difficult time, and I sympathise with them.<br/>
However, it is important that a legitimate and serious debate should be allowed to run its course whether or not one agrees with the remedies that have been proposed. I can assure hon. Members, and indeed the staff, that the points which have been put in this debate will not be ignored. I accept that there is a strong case for resolving as soon as possible the planning blight which has descended on the hospital. I hope that we can resolve it without, in the words of my hon. Friend, " bloodshed and strife ".<br/>
In response to what my hon. Friend the Member for Sevenoaks (Mr. Wolfson) said, may I say that there is a complex relationship between medical education and the provision of health services? This relationship is described quite well in the report of the consortium. My right hon. Friend will have to make any decision that falls to him in full knowledge of that relationship. I make it clear that the Government have taken no decision to close the hospital.<br/>
May I explain briefly what the position is? We are concerned with two reports. The Flowers report was produced by a working party set up by the University of London under the chairmanship of Lord

Flowers. Its job was to look at the way in which resources were used within the University of London for medical education and to suggest what changes were needed. The report proposed that radical changes should be made in the organisation of the medical schools and the postgraduate institutes. From a total of 34 separate institutions, the report envisages the creation of six new combined medical and dental schools. In this process, it envisages the complete closure of Westminster medical school.<br/>
Although the report is of widespread interest, it is concerned with the internal organisation of the university and, as a self-governing body, the university must decide itself how far it wishes to pursue the proposals. It would be wrong for me to comment at this stage on the proposals to close the Westminster medical school. None the less, the vice-chancellor has said that he wishes the report to be carefully considered and has invited anyone who wishes to submit views to do so within the next month. The report, and the views expressed on it, will then be considered by the appropriate machinery within the university before it reaches its decisions. I understand that a decision will be reached by the university by the end of July.<br/>
The second report, which appeared in parallel, was produced by the London Health Planning Consortium. As my hon. Friend said, that was set up in 1978 and was made up of officers of the main bodies concerned with the Health Service and medical education in London. It has produced a number of reports, the latest being entitled " Towards a balance ". This document suggests that major changes are needed in the level of hospital services in London and gives the consortium's views on how those changes should be brought about. It identifies a framework of major hospital groupings for each part of London around which health services might be planned in future. The consortium proposes that one of these groupings should be formed by linking Westminster hospital with St. Thomas's hospital. It proposes that the majority of acute services within this grouping should be provided in the new St. Thomas's hospital. There is no suggestion in that report that Westminster hospital should be closed. But it would be envisaged that the role of the hospital


should be different, and the report suggests that it should provide a different range of services.<br/>
The hospital has good facilities which have been developed and improved in recent years. As has been said in the debate, the facilities will need to be used effectively, even if for some other purpose than at present. I shall not speculate at this stage on what that use might be, because consideration of that report is at an early stage and no decisions have been taken. The report has been issued as a basis for discussion, and my right hon. Friend has made it clear that he wishes to see the fullest public debate before he considers the proposals. I shall return to the way in which that report is to be dealt with.<br/>
The consortium has asked to be informed of the views of health authorities, the university and others, but it would not be for the consortium to decide what action to take. It has no executive role and can only make planning proposals, as it has done so far. I understand that it will be giving consideration during June and July to representations. Its revised views will be referred to the London advisory group in about August, and Ministers will be advised some time in September or October.<br/>
The Government's views on the structure of the NHS are well known. We intend to move towards a simplification of the structure over the next two or three years. We are determined that changes should take place in London on the same time scale as the rest of the country. Some of the most urgent and difficult structural problems are to be found in London&#x2014;I say that as a London Member. But, before decisions about the future structure of the Health Service in London can be taken, it will be necessary to know what the strategic pattern of hospital services should be. It is important, therefore, that the issues

raised by the consortium should be resolved. That does not mean that its proposals will necessarily be pursued, but we must be satisfied that we have the right basis on which to develop London's hospital services over the next 20 years.<br/>
Clearly, there are major issues to be resolved and important decisions to be taken. My right hon. Friend is anxious that the decisions that he takes are based on an appreciation of the full range of views and evidence which may be expressed. He is concerned that, in reaching these decisions, he should have available to him broadly-based advice reflecting the views of all interested parties. For this reason, he has decided to establish a London advisory group which will be called upon to consider not only the issues raised by the reports of the London Health Planning Consortium but the proposals which will be made by the regional health authorities for the restructuring of the Health Service. The group will not advise on the Flowers report which, as I have said, is a matter that, in the first instance, the university must resolve.<br/>
However, it will be the advisory group's task to look at the whole range of views which have been expressed on reports by the consortium. It will act as a " jury " weighing the evidence&#x2014;not just the conclusions of the consortium, but any other proposals put up by people in the field&#x2014;and considering everybody's views. I undertake to ensure that all the views expressed in this debate will be available to the advisory group. The group will then advise my right hon Friend on the best course of action. But, in the final analysis, he will be the judge. He will make the final decision on the Health Service issues. But I know that at the forefront of his mind he will have some of the points that have been made in this important debate.</p>
