<p>I merely ask your guidance, Mr. Speaker. I notice that questions Nos. 5 and 13 are to he taken at the end of Question Time, and not in the usual order. I ask you, Mr. Speaker, or the Government Front Bench, the reason for this? If these are run of the mill questions, the answers should be given in the proper place. If the answers are important, why are we not getting a proper statement at the end of Question Time? I ask this question because, on another occasion, the Secretary of State for Defence tried to avoid making a statement on the ordnance factories. We want to know what is going on.</p>

<p>I thank my hon. Friend for that reply. Does he agree that it would be wrong to build a barracks on Dartmoor? It is not essential to build a barracks there.

sex barracks. It will be two or three miles within the Dartmoor national park. In view of the fact that the Ministry of Defence is exempt from planning consent, it is quite wrong for the Minister to collude and allow the Ministry to destroy the boundaries of the national park by building a barracks in the way proposed.</p>

<p>I agree with my hon. and learned Friend that perhaps more should be done by NATO. The NATO press and information service, which works closely with Government information services, maintains an active programme of films, audio visual productions, seminars and visits. My hon. and learned Friend might be interested to know that in 1985 no fewer than 76 groups from the United Kingdom visited NATO, and 60 groups have visited NATO so far this year.

<p>My hon. Friend is entirely right, in that most of the remaining Argentine mines are concentrated round Port Stanley, which is the main centre of population on the Falkland Islands. During the past year of so, the Ministry of Defence has been carrying out an in-depth research programme, on which about &#x00A3;3 million has already been spent, to try to deal with the problem. So far we have been unable to identify, and even if we spent many millions of pounds more we would be unable to identify, a sufficiently safe way of clearing those mines that could be employed in peace-time. Three Engineers were seriously wounded in the immediate aftermath of the Falklands campaign while trying to clear those mines. My hon.

<p>The right hon. Gentleman uses a new word when he refers to "strict" sanctions; he does not define it.

<p>Will my hon.

<q>The likely effect in South Africa would he the imposition of a siege economy and more repression.</q>
We adopt my right hon. Friend's view. As he knows, we have been in touch with the Economic Community. The communique issued recently was a communique of the Twelve, who are taking positive measures to bring more aid to black South Africans for their greater education.

With regard to what the right hon. Gentleman said about the Commonwealth games, I greatly regret the

unjustified action that has been taken about withdrawing. In regard to Zola Budd and Annette Cowley, it is not a matter for the Government but for the Commonwealth Games Federation to decide upon the eligibility of individual athletes within its own rules. It is for it to justify its decision and it is for the federation to administer its rules impartially. Those games have nothing to do with decisions of Her Majesty's Government.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman will be aware that when it came to sanctions against Libya we argued that they do not work unless they are totally and utterly universal, and they never are. That is why they were not put on. Certainly we had good cause to turn out of London the Libyan People's Bureau, but that was not an economic sanction. Certainly we have good cause to refuse to supply defence equipment to Libya. Also, we have absolutely refused to supply defence equipment to South Africa.

<p>My right hon.

<p>I agree with my hon. Friend. I think that most people hope that there will be a summit between President Reagan and Secretary General Gorbachev, and that there will be a summit this year. It will be fruitful if it succeeds in reaching some decisions on arms control, possibly as a prelude to a third summit next year. As my hon. Friend says, I believe that chemical weapons offer an area in which the Soviet Union could follow the lead given by Britain and the United States, in that she could substantially reduce her stockpile and agree not to engage in any more manufacturing of these weapons. Also, I believe that there is some hope of making further progress on intermediate nuclear weapons. There are very interesting proposals on the table now between the United States and the Soviet Union. I believe that they will be prosecuted with the utmost urgency and I hope that they will lead to a successful summit.</p>

I am pleased to announce today that I will be placing orders for three type 23 frigates of the Duke class, two to be built at Yarrow Shipbuilders Limited on the Clyde and one at Swan Hunter Shipbuilders on Tyneside as soon as outstanding contract terms have been settled. The first two ships will start building in the coming months and the second ship at Yarrow next year.<br/>
The order with SHS followed negotiations with it, in the light of the statement made by my predecessor on 28 January 1985, which have resulted in a satisfactory agreement on price. The order with YSL followed a competition with three other yards and the winning tender offered the best value for money.<br/>

<p>As my hon. Friend knows better than most of us, it is not as simple as that.

<p>I am sorry to point out to the hon. Gentleman that he has got the wrong person. I believe that Sir Peter Main is in charge of the teachers' inquiry.

<p>I can confirm the hon. Gentleman's last point. I am glad to say that the three ships that we are ordering today will be fitted with new towed array sonar. There has been a gap in the ordering which is quite usual

when the first of a new line of frigates is ordered. The type 23 01 has taken longer than usual to produce because it is the first. This year, we have produced an order for three follow-on frigates. The hon. Gentleman must await future announcements for other frigates in due course.</p>

<p>My right hon. Friend's announcement will be welcomed by everyone who believes in the defence of Britain. The types 23 and 22 are both expensive and too sophisticated for a number of foreign purchasers. How will my right hon. Friend encourage foreign navies to buy British? What plans has he to ensure that yards develop a system for building frigates for naval use which have lower manning levels and cost less?</p>

<p>My hon. Friend makes a valid point. The type 23 is much more economical in terms of manpower than its predecessor. It needs a considerably smaller crew and will be fitted with a great deal more sophisticated equipment. It is true that such a sophisticated vessel is of interest only to certain navies which have similar needs, but nevertheless it is more cost-effective than its predecessor. Therefore, it ought to be a better bet for many more navies than the previous type of frigate. We should do all we can to encourage its purchase.</p>

<p>Although the whole of Tyneside will be pleased that the Government have confirmed this order, does the Minister appreciate that there is still a considerable shortfall of work in the area?

<p>I appreciate the hon. Gentleman's point. That there should be a shipbuilding presence on the Tyne is a matter of great concern to many of us. This order was an undertaking given to Swan Hunter and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will feel that it has been properly and completely carried out. It is worth reminding the House that we are in the middle of a large warship building programme. In real terms, it is probably the largest that we have had for many years. It is a demonstration of the importance that the Government attach to defence.</p>

<p>Does my right hon. Friend recognise that his statement will cause great disappointment in Vosper Thornycroft in my constituency?

<p>I appreciate what my hon. Friend says about Vosper Thornycroft and I am sorry on its account that it did not win the competition for the type 23 frigate.

<p>Is the Secretary of State aware that this will be good news for the workers in Yarrow before they go on their annual holidays, but will he be a bit more precise about the starting date for the building of the frigates? He did say that, in the case of the two placed at Yarrow, construction would begin in the coming months.<br/>
Is the Secretary of State further aware that it is entirely appropriate that he should answer the question put down by the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Hirst), who, when he worked for the Marathon yard, had his job saved by my right hon.

<p>The principal consideration that I have to have in mind when I place orders is whether they are the best value for the defence budget and the best equipment for the Royal Navy, and I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will understand that. It will be good news for those who are likely to have their jobs safeguarded.<br/>
Let me reaffirm the position on construction times. The precise starting dates for construction are for negotiation between the Department and the contractors concerned, but I understand that the one at Swan Hunter and the first of the two at Yarrow are likely to start in a few months time, and the second one at Yarrow is likely to start next year but it is not yet clear in precisely which month.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend hits an important note. Approximately 1,200 men per year per ship will be employed in direct labour at the yard with about twice as many again employed on sub-contracts and in the weapons and marine equipment industries.

<p>I congratulate the Secretary of State on at least keeping faith with Swan Hunter with regard to the frigate order. He refers to the jobs that are being saved, but is he aware that, had it not been for the robbery with violence of the auxiliary oiler replenishment vessel from Swan Hunter a lot of men who are now walking the stones would still be in full-time employment? When can we expect an encouraging statement from him on the second AOR for Swan Hunter?</p>

<p>I appreciate part of what the hon. Gentleman said, but his remarks about the AORs may be looked at a little askance elsewhere. If I had decided that the firm which clearly won the competition on design and price was not to get the first AOR, I would have been justifiably and severely criticised. In case the hon. Gentleman has forgotten, I remind him that in the course of that announcement I made it clear that I would make sure that Swan Hunter had a particular opportunity to bid

for the second AOR order on certain terms. I should have thought that that was a fairly good gesture towards Swan Hunter which I hope is appreciated in the north-east.</p>

<p>The Secretary of State's long-awaited announcement is welcome on these Benches, as I am sure it is very much welcomed by the work force at Yarrow and Swan Hunter. As he has rightly and properly taken into account the undertaking given by his predecessor to the Swan Hunter yard and no doubt awarded the order on a basis other than sheer competitive price, will what might be called the difference in price fall on an overstretched defence budget or can it be allocated to some other budget such as, for example, that of the Department of Employment?<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman has mentioned that this must be looked at on a long-term basis. Can he assure the House that, over that long term, bearing in mind the pattern of new ships coming into service and older vessels going out of service, there always will be a surface fleet of about 50 vessels, or will there be a shortfall at some stage during that period?</p>

<p>I see the point that the hon. Gentleman is getting at about the small amount of extra cost which we shall have paid by placing the order somewhat uncompetitively at Swan Hunter. That is something that we had already undertaken to do, and, therefore, it falls on the defence budget. I make no complaint about that because it was a decision taken openly by the Department some time ago.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman mentioned the ordering position generally. He is right in his suspicion that the way in which the orders are placed must be balanced out between how long the existing ships can be kept going economically and sensibly and how much new build is needed to keep the fleet in balance. I have maintained the policy, which has been the policy of the Department for a long time, that about 50 frigates will be kept in commission. I think that the House would like to know that.</p>

<p>The right hon. Gentleman will be aware that his statement will come as a great relief both to the Royal Navy and the warship building yards involved. He will also recognise that it does not solve the fundamental problems of arriving at a modern 50-warship Navy by the 1990s. The right hon. Gentleman said that there would be two orders this year and one next year. What will the cost be in terms of the Ministry of Defence budget in this financial year? In other words, how much money will come out of the Ministry of Defence budget in this financial year as a result of today's announcement?</p>

<p>The right hon. Gentleman was somewhat less than generous in his opening remarks. I should have thought that it was a major step towards having a modern force of about 50 frigates in the 1990s. I leave that aside. The position of the frigates in the programme must be balanced out with all the other factors. I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will take that as a clear indication. Costs are commercial and confidential. However, I have aready made it clear that the cost of the frigates is about &#x00A3;1 15 million each. While I cannot give the precise prices for the group of three frigates, I can say that we have made a saving of about 5 per cent. on what we expected to spend.</p>

<p>The present position is that over 2,800 athletes and officials from 54 Commonwealth countries have informed the organisers that they will be attending the games. I hope that that number may be increased to the original figure of over 3,100 athletes and officials if the five boycotting countries reconsider their position.<br/>

Will the Secretary of State dissociate himself from the call made today by a Conservative Member of Parliament to cancel the games? Does he agree that it is a tragedy that the friendly games have been fractured in this way and become a victim of our isolation in the Commonwealth because of the Prime Minister's intransigence? Will he make it clear to the Commonwealth that the games are being hosted by the Scottish people, not by Downing street? Will he reflect directly to the Commonwealth the strong feelings throughout Scotland on the issue, our abhorrence of apartheid and our deep differences with the Prime Minister on the sanctions issue? Is it not right to urge on Commonwealth countries, which are concerned and understandably bitter about Britain's attitude to sanctions, that the best way forward is to argue the case in the Commonwealth and not to boycott the games?<br/>
As the Secretary of State knows, great efforts are being made to put the games on a sound financial footing. Clearly, that has not been helped by the current turmoil. We are all aware that there has been no financial backing from the Government. That has been conspicuously absent. Will the Secretary of State be prepared to look sympathetically at any future approach for material support to meet liabilities which could not have been anticipated and result from factors beyond the organisers' control?</p>

<p>I welcome the hon. Gentleman's comment that the Opposition share the view of the Government and, I am sure, all British people that all Commonwealth countries should come to the games in Edinburgh, and that it would be wrong for differences of opinion on other matters to endanger or threaten the value of the Commonwealth Games.<br/>
Despite the regrettable signs from five countries that they are not at present intending to come to the games, the remaining countries which are participating will nevertheless send more athletes to these Commonwealth Games in


Edinburgh than have attended any previous Commonwealth Games in the history of the event. Therefore, the games, which will begin next week, still look like being the best and largest-ever games that the Commonwealth has experienced.<br/>
Whatever one's views may be about the issue of sanctions against South Africa, the whole value of the Commonwealth Games in the past has been its expression of the multiracial identity of the Commonwealth. There is no better way of showing South Africa our abhorrence of apartheid than by having a successful multiracial Commonwealth Games, symbolising the unity which the Commonwealth should represent.<br/>
On the financial aspects, the hon. Gentleman will be aware that the Commonwealth Games organisers have raised substantial sums, and that following changes announced two weeks ago new initiatives, including some exciting ones, have been launched to fill the remaining gap. I remain confident that that will be possible.<br/>
Finally, I remind the House and those who have criticised the Commonwealth Games that the games belong not to any one country or Government, but to the Commonwealth as a whole. It is both illogical and undesirable that the Commonwealth Games, which belong to the Commonwealth, should be boycotted by individual countries because of their disagreement with one Commonwealth Government.</p>

<p>One certainly regrets the politicisation of any games.

The Secretary of State said that he was confident that financial matters would be all right. Has he made no contingency arrangements in case there is a shortfall?</p>

<p>On the hon. Gentleman's latter point, I can state that those who have become involved in the financial aspects of the Commonwealth games have launched certain new initiatives. There is every prospect that the initiatives will raise the funds which are needed.<br/>
In relation to the hon. Gentleman's earlier point, certain African countries have expressed their concern about the South African issue by refusing to participate in the games. Other African countries have taken a different view. The Malawi team has already arrived in Scotland and the Gambia has said that it will take part. It is likely that other African countries will take part. There is clearly a difference of opinion within Africa, but it is true that those who wish to support the Commonwealth ideal, which is a multiracial ideal, can express that best by participating in the games.</p>

I must concede that the withdrawal of any Commonwealth country from the games will diminish them. It goes without saying that the attitude of a large proportion of the Commonwealth will be influenced by the fact that all parties in this House, including the Opposition, are appealing to all Commonwealth countries to come to the games and to make them a great success, irrespective of any difference of view about sanctions. The British Parliament and people support that view, and that will carry great weight with many Commonwealth countries.</p>

As I have attended many meetings of the main organising committee, which is extremely worried about finance, may I ask the Secretary of State where the shortfall is to come from?

<p>I said earlier, and I think that the hon.

Of course, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and the Heads of Government of other Commonwealth countries will discuss those matters. There is to be a meeting at the beginning of August to review the situation, and my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister will make a full contribution to that discussion.</p>

<p>I beg to ask leave to move the Adjournment of the House, under Standing Order No. 10, for the purpose of discussing a specific and important matter that should have urgent consideration, namely,
<q>evidence of serious malpractice by officers of the Kent county constabulary and the inquiry by officers of the Metropolitan police and the Police Complaints Authority thereinto.</q>
Several reports since Sunday in the press and by television and radio have given prominence to allegations by my constituent, Mr. Ron Walker, who is a serving officer in the Kent constabulary. Mr. Walker has alleged that fellow officers have been involved in widespread and systematic malpractice which has led to the clear-up rate of offences in Kent seeming to be better than it really is. Mr. Walker claims that convicted criminals have been persuaded to admit, without fear of further prosecution, offences that they did not commit and that false confessions have been written by police officers, thus allowing offences to be "written off" as cleared up. He further alleges that fictitious offences have been recorded, only to be falsely confessed and written off.<br/>
These are serious allegations and Mr. Walker, who has placed his career on the line, has provided sufficient evidence in two specimen incidents to prompt the deputy chief constable of Kent, whose responsibility disciplinary matters are, to commission an inquiry by another force &#x2014;the Metropolitan police&#x2014;and to inform, properly, the Police Complaints Authority. That inquiry has now taken place and I understand that a lengthy report is in the hands of the Director of Public Prosecutions.<br/>
I am concerned about the nature of the inquiry, especially its terms of reference. It is reported&#x2014;1 know not how reliably&#x2014;that the inquiry was restricted to an investigation of Mr. Walker's two specific specimen allegations and that no wider investigation took place. In view of Mr. Walker's more wide-ranging contentions, care should have been taken to determine whether they were two isolated incidents or whether, as Mr. Walker suggested, they were but examples of much wider abuse of the write-off system.<br/>
The last thing I want is for this unhappy matter to become a stick with which to beat the police by those who would gainsay the normally high standards of the police. I believe, however, that in the public interest we should know urgently from my right hon. Friend the Secretary whether the inquiry was restricted or whether it was drawn widely enough to determine whether there was widespread malpractice and abuse of the write-off system.<br/>
I believe that this urgent and important matter should be settled before we rise for the recess so that public confidence in the police, which must inevitably have been damaged by Mr. Walker's allegations, is restored as soon as possible. That is why I have sought leave to move the Adjournment of the House to discuss this matter.</p>

<speech hansard_id="429632" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1986-07-15a.870.1" hansard_membership_id="6885" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2938" speakername="Mr. Archy Kirkwood" colnum="870" time="16:22:00">
<p>I beg to move,
<q>That leave be given to bring in a Bill to impose a duty on the Secretary of State for Scotland to undertake a survey of the conditions of the public and private sector housing stock in Scotland every five years; to provide for the publication of the survey; and for connected purposes.</q>
The first house condition survey took place exclusively in England in 1967. There had been increasing disquiet about the rate of slum clearance in the early 1960s, and in 1964 the Government required local authorities to submit returns of all their remaining unlit houses. A subcommittee of the Central Housing Advisory Committee was set up to deal with the difficulties of obtaining better data on the standards of unfitness. It became known as the Denington committee. It took an active interest in the need to collect accurate information on the condition of the older housing stock and specifically recommended a national house condition survey.<br/>
Since then, England and Wales have had the benefit of surveys carried out on a national basis at five-yearly intervals. The first house condition survey played a large part in the switch from demoliton to rehabilitation in housing policy in the late 1960s. In Northern Ireland, house condition surveys began in 1974 and have been maintained on a five-yearly cycle, in 1979 and in 1984.<br/>
The English survey is paid for out of the housing research budget. The total annual budget for the 1986 survey is estimated to be about &#x00A3;1&#x00B7;4 million. The cost of the Welsh survey, which, too, is financed from a specific research account, is likely to be &#x00A3;1&#x00B7;5 million. The Northern Ireland budget is included in the block allocation for supervision and management and therefore is not available to be identified as a separate cost.<br/>
Of course, it can be argued that, if the research budget is expanded to meet the cost of a survey, less money is available for capital expenditure. I submit that, measured against the estimated cost of the perceived investment need, which the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities estimates to be about &#x00A3;819 million, the &#x00A3;1 million a year, or sums of that order, which would be required to finance such a survey are well worth paying in terms of the benefits that would directly accrue on a continuing basis for all such surveys.<br/>
Recent developments have further reinforced the case for house condition surveys to be extended to cover and embrace Scotland. They include the Duke of Edinburgh's recent inquiry into the state of British housing, which was published in July 1985, and the inquiry by the Department of the Environment into the condition of local authority housing stock in England, which was published in November 1985. The latter revealed that the condition of housing stock was much worse than had originally been suspected.<br/>
During the passage of the current Housing (Scotland) Bill, the Government were repeatedly pressed &#x2014; I give credit to the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton), who was in the van of that movement&#x2014;to make a commitment to set up a nationally based survey. In addition, the third report of the Select Committee on the Environment made specific reference in paragraph 22


to the importance of the English house condition survey and went as far as to say that the next survey should be brought forward.<br/>
The Government's response to all this has been, to put it mildly, minimal. Last week, in the housing debate on Estimates day in the Scottish Grand Committee, the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland &#x2014; the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram)&#x2014;said that he was keen to set up a project to make technical advice available to local authorities which could then undertake local surveys. Such proposals do not even begin to measure up to the need in Scotland to assess the extent of the investment required and to bring public and private housing stock to tolerable standards. I suspect that the extent of the need is as suggested by COSLA. It will he impossible to finalise arguments on that score until we undertake an objective survey. Until that is done, there will always be room for continuing political argument.<br/>
I fully accept that it would be impossible for any Government to respond immediately in meeting the total bill. It would be unrealistic to expect that to happen. However, it is evident to everyone in Scotland, except the Government, that existing sources of information on house conditions are inadequate. At present, there is no basis for knowing whether house conditions in Scotland are worse or better than in other parts of the United Kingdom. It is not known whether Scotland is receiving an appropriate share of national resources. A regular house condition survey would make it possible to review the success of legislation, expenditure, priorities and programmes and would identify problems and new policy directions.<br/>
Postponed maintenance is inevitably more costly than maintenance, if not eventual enforced demolition and rebuild. A survey's objectives would include the ability to identify and cost the need for improvement and repair. A survey could make comparisons between tenures and districts, help determine local priorities and provide guidance for legislation. It could embrace also a social survey of family groups and types. A sample of 56,000 houses, which is the suggested number, could be covered over a five-year period at an annual cost of &#x00A3;1 million, which represents only 0&#x2013;22 per cent. of the 1986 capital allocation. A house condition survey in Scotland is therefore a stitch in time that would save nine. It is urgently required. It should be funded and organised by central Government, and the Bill sets out to achieve just that.</p>

<p>Yes, Sir; I oppose the Bill. The issues that it raises have been discussed at great length in Committee, as the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) is aware. Indeed, we have discussed the issues more than once in Committee. We are in a period of scarce resources and cash is required for the improvement of houses rather than for surveys to tell us what we already know is wrong. Local authorities know exactly what they are required to do with their houses. What is required is the necessary resources to put right the wrongs.<br/>
The Select Committee on Scottish Affairs has prepared a report, having considered the problems of condensation and dampness. Information was made available and it was clear that local authorities were not too happy that we had discovered that some of them were falling down on their job. The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire suggests that we should spend &#x00A3;5 million over five years on a survey, but that &#x00A3;5 million could be spent on putting wrongs right. He has suggested a complete misuse of scarce resources.<br/>
The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire will be aware that the English survey, which he talked about and complimented, is nothing like what he was advising would be included in the proposed survey for Scotland. If he reads carefully the report of his speech, he will realise that he was proposing something different from the sample which was taken in England. He knows that it was based on a sample because that was made clear in Committee.<br/>
The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire is indulging in a Liberal party gimmick that is designed to get publicity for something that it wants when the real answer is to deal with the problem directly and solve it. That is why I oppose the Bill.</p>

<p>I beg to move,
<q>That this House, recognising the importance to employment, defence, education and the economy of a strong high technology sector, expresses its concern that a regettable consequence of the United States Government's attempts to impose its laws on United Kingdom companies is to damage relationships between the two countries; regrets Her Majesty's Government's failure to take effective action to stop the extra-territorial imposition of United States law on United Kingdom firms exporting high technology from the United Kingdom; notes that a number of British computer manufacturers have been forced out of business by use of the United States blacklist; urges the Government to refuse to allow United States Government officials to inspect United Kingdom companies for compliance with United States laws; and calls on the Government to defend and assist British high technology industries, to preserve United Kingdom sovereignty, to support the rule of international law and to use the opportunity of the Presidency of the European Community Commission to co-ordinate policies to promote European high technology co-operation.</q>
This debate is, in part, about the state of Britain's hightech industry. Goodness knows, the industry needs some attention. Last year we had a deficit in high-tech trade of &#x00A3;1&#x00B7;3 billion, and the deficit is predicted to rise by 1990 to about &#x00A3;5 billion annually. The industry is suffering severe problems in software, as the recent ACARD report revealed. The earlier NEDO report told us that there are problems in the industry generally. Meanwhile, at a time of high unemployment, the skill gap in trained high technologists is growing wider and wider, with the number of computer graduates leaving university falling further and further behind the industry's needs. I have no doubt that all these matters will be referred to by others during the debate.<br/>
I wish to raise a matter that is at once more specific and wider in its overall implication. The United States Government are being permitted by the British Government to impose and even administer their own laws on British high-tech firms operating within Britain. This is damaging appropriate relations between allies and placing burdens on British high-technology trade. It is yet another example of the way in which the Government seem prepared to allow the United States Government increasingly to dictate what happens within the United Kingdom.<br/>
Of the top 10 computer companies in Britain, nine are United States subsidiaries. Even ICL, our only homegrown United Kingdom company that is in the list, is 25 per cent. United States owned. Perhaps more important is the fact that 80 per cent. of all components used in United Kingdom high-tech manufacture come from the United States. There is nothing wrong in that because high-tech trade is truly international, and I would not wish to see it otherwise. What is wrong, however, is the way in which the British Government permit the United States to use their

powerful position in the United Kingdom market place to impose United States regulations in Britain and to diminish the viability and capacity of United Kingdom companies to trade abroad. This is exactly what is happening and what has happened continuously over the past four years.<br/>
This issue surfaced with the now famous IBM letter of 23 December 1983. The letter, which was sent to all IBM's United Kingdom customers, informed British firms that certain computers that they had purchased from IBM could not be moved within the United Kingdom without permission from the United States Government. Despite considerable public comment about the letter, IBM has recently confirmed to me that the letter still applies and will not be withdrawn.<br/>
Digital Equipment Corporation &#x2014; DEC UK Ltd tells its United Kingdom customers in a written document that they must obey United States export control laws, even when trading within the United Kingdom, and that DEC UK will
<q>control movement of hardware, software and knowhow</q>
within Britain. That will be done, apparently, according to United States laws. Texas Instruments and many other major United States firms operating in Britain insist on similar provisions.<br/>
The effects of these requirements are considerable. Many United Kingdom banks and large corporations that own certain United States produced computers will be required formally and technically to ask for a licence from the United States Government before moving the computers from one location to another, even within the United Kingdom. This requirement appears even to apply to certain computers owned by the Government themselves, as I shall shortly show. Secondly, United States subsidiaries within the United Kingdom do not generally export any of their products except to their own subsidiaries. That is a consequence of United States law. Thirdly, United Kingdom companies seeking to export their manufactured goods must now apply for United States export licences if the goods contain any United States produced component, no matter how small.<br/>
In essence, they must apply for two export licences, one from the Department of Trade and Industry to conform with COCOM regulations and one from the United States Department of Commerce. I am happy to say that they are usually able to get a licence quickly from the DTI. It is a fairly simple process and we are grateful for that. However, this is not the case when it comes to the licence that has to be obtained from the United States. The Department of Commerce frequently takes up to three months to issue a licence, and has in the past been known to refuse a licence to a United Kingdom company without offering any explanation. For example, major export orders were lost to Cable and Wireless because the Department of Commerce in Washington, without any explanation. rejected, ignored and finally returned licence applications relating to equipment for China. It is a matter of record that at the same time United States firms were selling precisely the same equipment to the Chinese Government. They were doing so without restraint.</p>

<p>In this instance my definition is directed chiefly to the information technology industry and the components that it uses. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will be able to make his own contribution to the debate.<br/>
I am not at liberty to say which British firms have approached me expressing their concern about the situation which I have described and the impact that it is having on their trading viability. The firms concerned are naturally frightened of retaliatory action from the United States Department of Commerce if they kick up a fuss. I can say, however, that numbered among the firms are Britain's foremost computer manufacturers.<br/>
On 23 April the United States Government enacted the final formalisation of their export regulations covering high-tech exports under the United States Export Administration Act. Apart from the conditions already described, the new regulations make the Department of Commerce responsible for the policing of United States distribution licences in foreign countries, including the United Kingdom. It also makes the checking of end users abroad the responsibility of other "United States agencies". I understand this to be the normal form of words used in many instances to describe the CIA. We know from a speech in Palo Alto made by the then director of the CIA, Mr. William Casey, on 3 April 1984, that the CIA operates a blacklist of 300 European firms which have contravened United States regulations. I was subsequently informed during a telephone conversation that I had with the CIA that among these are a number of British firms.<br/>
It is under this new regulation that United States Commerce Department officials sought to visit the United Kingdom earlier this year to inspect the books of United Kingdom companies operating within Britain in order to ensure that they complied with United States law. I am astounded to know that the Government did not dismiss this application out of hand. Indeed, I believe that they are still considering it. I ask the Minister to make it clear in his speech what the Government intend to do to protect United Kingdom firms from this intrusion, and why they have taken so long to do it.<br/>
The Government have always said that they reject these United States claims. When I first raised the matter with the then Secretary of State in 1984 I was informed that they would treat each United States demand on a "case-by-case basis"&#x2014;the very words, incidentally, used in the Government's amendment to our motion. But they have done nothing about the IBM letter, a copy of which they have; or about the DEC licence instructions, a copy of which they have, or about the Texas Instruments demands, a copy of which they have.<br/>
In a letter to me of 3 July 1985, the Attorney-General declared that United States claims in this matter were
<q>an unwarranted encroachment on UK jurisdiction and contrary to international law".</q>
Yet such claims continue, they are not dismissed &#x2014;indeed, the Government say that they are still considering them. The House is entitled to know why.<br/>
The problem has worsened. In the last few months a major United States subsidiary, Motorola, has refused a British citizen a car phone because he is said to be on a United States Government denial list. This has had the effect initially of denying a British citizen access to the British Telecom network. DEC UK has also recently insisted that any British student attending a DEC course

in Britain must sign a form agreeing to accept United States export administration law, even though he will not place one foot outside the United Kingdom.<br/>
I have also learnt that United Kingdom companies submitting licence applications to the United States will have full details of their firms and operations passed on to the Pentagon, which will check up on them and the equipment that they are purchasing. The effect of this, as I understand it, is that if a British-manufactured Apricot computer is bought by a firm today and subsequently sold, say, seventh hand in five years' time to a buyer in a prohibited country&#x2014;which incidentally, includes Iran, Iraq and Syria&#x2014;that British firm could technically be held responsible for that ultimate destination. Indeed, one United Kingdom company, Systime, has effectively been driven out of business because of United States sanctions &#x2014;or at least partly because of United States sanctions&#x2014;against it for exporting in this case to Switzerland. I also understand that Thorn EMI is having considerable difficulty extracting its own equipment and designs for its world-heating transputer from its United States factory.<br/>
What have the Government done about this? Perhaps most remarkable of all, in view of the Government's agreement that these United States claims are illegal and will be countered on a "case-by-case basis"&#x2014;I use the words used in the amendment&#x2014;is the fact that the Government themselves seem to have agreed to accept a United States claim that they must ask the United States Government's permission to move a computer that they themselves own from one location to another.<br/>
As I understand it, the United States Government have forbidden Her Majesty's Government to move their own Cray super-computer owned by the Department of Energy at Harwell to the university of London without formal United States approval. This happened in May, yet our Government are still considering the matter. Indeed, I have just heard today that the United States Government have imposed unilateral third party restraints on the Japanese companies Fujitsu, Hitachi and NEC, and their European distributors Amdahl, Basef and Siemens, to prevent them from supplying London university with an alternative super-computer. Meanwhile our own Department of Trade and Industry, I understand, is still petitioning the United States Government for permission to move its own Government computer 40 miles from Essex to London.<br/>
Is this not a disgraceful situation for a British Government to accept? I ask the Minister to indicate clearly to the House whether the United States claim on this matter will be repudiated or whether the Government intend to be party to an act which their own Attorney-General has described as
<q>an &#x2026; encroachment on UK jurisdiction and contrary to international law".</q>
Our Government's apparent acceptance of the fact that the United States has a right not only to impose but also to administer its own law in Britain is a direct infringement of our sovereignty. It also comprises a major and damaging barrier to United Kingdom trade.<br/>
I do not claim that the United States Government's intention is to give their own firms a trading advantage through these actions. I am convinced that United States claims are driven by a genuine, if in my view mistaken, attempt to protect high-tech secrets. But there is no doubt that these regulations are being used by United States industry, and particularly the larger United States firms,


to keep out United Kingdom and European exporters while they move in and clean up. The figures show this perfectly clearly. According to the only figure that I have managed to get out &#x2014; I stand to be corrected if I am wrong, but it is difficult to pull out figures because they are not differentiated very clearly &#x2014; while United Kingdom high-tech exports to the eastern bloc have fallen to approximately &#x00A3;40 million a year, in the same period, United States high-tech trade to the eastern bloc countries has risen from &#x0024;230 million in 1980 to &#x0024;1&#x00B7;5 billion last year, and is predicted to rise to &#x0024;5 billion this year.<br/>
I do not suggest that we do not need a mechanism to ensure the security of our high-tech secrets, but we already have such a mechanism in place. The international NATO-based multilateral organisation COCOM already provides just such a mechanism. Indeed, one of my major arguments against United States unilateral action in this area is that it undermines and makes a nonsense of international action by western countries through COCOM. I am glad to note that the Minister agrees.<br/>
Neither do I necessarily blame the United States Government for trying it on. They are, after all, only pursuing their national interest, which is what governments are supposed to do. If the Government insist on conveniently lying down in front of the United States Government, who can blame the United States for taking the opportunity to walk all over us?<br/>
What now needs to be done in this serious matter? First, the Government must use the opportunity of the European presidency to co-ordinate European action to make it clear to the United States Government that we simply will not accept their extraterritorial claims. In this matter I draw the Minister's attention to the fact that a resolution is now before the European Parliament calling on the Community to reject United States claims. I hope that he will make it clear in his speech that the Government welcome this motion.<br/>
Secondly, the Government must make it clear that they do not expect United Kingdom firms to deal with Washington themselves but that, where claims are made, the Government will treat these as matters to be taken up on a Government-to-Government basis.<br/>
Lastly, in my view, the Government should insist that all letters such as those put out by IBM, DEC UK Ltd., Texas Instruments and others that seek to impose within the United Kingdom the laws of the United States should be formally, and at the Government's request, withdrawn.<br/>
United States attempts to impose its law on firms in Britain undermine the effectiveness of the existing international organisation COCOM; they constitute actions that are inappropriate as between allies; they are damaging to United States-United Kingdom relations at a time when anti-Americanism is becoming all too prevalent in our society; they directly infringe United Kingdom sovereignty; they are illegal under international law; they increase the pace of United States high technology colonisation of Europe and they seriously damage the economic viability and trading capacity of the United Kingdom's already depleted high-tech industry.<br/>
The question that the House wants to have answered, after the Government have been doing nothing very effective, is: what are the Government going to do about it?</p>

<p>I beg to move, to leave out from "House" to the end of the Question and to add instead thereof:
<q>`recognising the importance to employment, defence, education and the economy of a strong high technology sector, applauds Her Majesty's Government's actions to support this sector through the provision of a favourable climate for business and through support for research and development; endorses Her Majesty's Government's continuing efforts to prevent, by discussion on a case-by-case basis, the extraterritorial imposition of United States law on United Kingdom firms exporting high technology from the United Kingdom; and supports the Government's initiatives to encourage British high technology industries and their intention during the Presidency of the Council of the European Communities to co-ordinate policies to promote European high technology co-operation.'.</q>
The hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown) has raised a very broad subject, which I imagine hon. Members will want to take further in the debate. I look forward, with the leave of the House, Mr. Deputy Speaker, to the possibility of catching your eye, perhaps briefly, to respond to those comments.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman has concentrated his remarks on one aspect of high technology, although the motion is quite widely drawn. It would, therefore, seem appropriate to address some of the wider aspects in addition to the points that he has made on extraterritoriality. I share his concern about the cases where extraterritorial difficulties arise, but I want to begin by putting the points that he has made into a broader context.<br/>
We have an expanding high technology sector which the Government have taken a number of measures to stimulate and foster. It is an industry that benefits from the multiplicity of commercial and scientific links that this country enjoys with the United States. It is against that wider background that the issues raised by the hon. Gentlman need to be seen.<br/>
I shall begin by saying something about United States export controls. We all agree that they represent an important topic. Certainly I welcome the opportunity to restate the Government's position. However, those controls need to be seen in the context of our close links with the United States. They also need to be seen against the background of United States concern, which this Government share, about high technology goods reaching the eastern bloc.<br/>
There is, of course, a well-tried mechanism to deal with those concerns in the COCOM framework, about which I shall say something in a moment. I wish to remind the House of the many steps that my Department is taking to make United Kingdom high technology firms less vulnerable in their dependence on United States technology and on sourcing from the United States, by providing support for research and development and strengthening our links with high technology industries in other member states of the European Community, which the United Kingdom currently chairs in its presidency role.<br/>
We have very close and harmonious relationships with the United States not only in trade but across the whole realm of defence policy. As the hon. Gentleman has said, high technology is very much an international trade. Of course, we have very close commercial links with many important United States companies that are established in this country; IBM, Ford, General Motors and many others have important British subsidiaries. British companies have a powerful presence in the United States


and, indeed, this country is the largest foreign investor in the United States. At present we enjoy a positive balance of trade with the United States.<br/>
In high technology this community of interest is reflected in the COCOM arrangements, which have been in existence for nearly 40 years. As the House knows, the arrangements cover exports to Warsaw pact countries and to China of strategically sensitive goods and technology, including those designed for civil purposes but also having military applications. The controls are co-ordinated through the Paris-based COCOM committee which provides the framework for maintaining agreement between NATO countries on the operation of a controlled list of products. True, COCOM is an informal body, but it provides an essential link in co-ordinating the interests of the United Kingdom, the United States and other countries in their approach to high technology exports. The controls we have are our own, of course, and are imposed through the Export of Goods Control Order 1985 which, as the House will remember, was debated in Standing Committee in July last year.<br/>
So the problem in a general sense of controlling sensitive technology is not new. In the United Kingdom's view the right way to go about it remains through multilateral co-operation agreement in COCOM. Against that background, unilateral action on extraterritorial claims to jurisdiction is harmful to such agreement. Because the United States is a dominant economic power in the world and a major source of high technology, the extraterritorial nature of its export controls inevitably leads to tension and dispute.<br/>
In our view the only law that applies in the United Kingdom is United Kingdom law on which our own controls are based. We reject out of hand claims by the United States Government to have jurisdiction over United States goods or goods based on United States technology while they are in the United Kingdom or when they are being exported from the United Kingdom. If we could compel the United States Government to withdraw this claim the problem could be eliminated easily, but we cannot. We have tried, and will continue to try, to persuade the United States Government to change their policy. Where we judge that it is the right response we shall not hesitate to use the Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980 to safeguard United Kingdom sovereignty.</p>

<p>If that is the case&#x2014;and it is the same case as has been deployed before &#x2014; surely the Government accept that they could ask United Kingdom firms such as IBM and DEC to withdraw those letters. Why have the Government not done that? Why do the Government even accept the possibility that the United States Government should be able to control the movement of the computer owned by the British Government from Harwell to London university?</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman made both those points in his speech. I shall come to them in my speech.<br/>
Other hon. Members may raise the same point as he did about why the British Government do not have more frequent recourse to our powers under the Protection of Trading Interests Act. We have those powers. They were used originally to direct companies in the United Kingdom not to comply with the extraterritorial provisions of the United States export administration regulations in the Siberian pipeline affair. They could indeed be used again,

if that seemed the best way to protect overall United Kingdom interests in a particular case. But hon. Members should be wary of the temptation of thinking that use of the Act to impose a general ban on compliance&#x2014; which could take no account of the commercial and other interests in broad cases&#x2014;would offer the right solution to the joint problem.<br/>
If I may explain, the usual method by which the United States enforces its extraterritorial controls is by blacklisting companies that do not comply, making it an offence to supply them with United States-controlled goods. Use of the Protection of Trading Interests Act could strike at the application of blacklisting to United Kingdom companies; but the main sanction&#x2014;denial of supplies direct from the United States&#x2014;would not be touched. The United States reaction to a direct and comprehensive challenge to its law cannot be predicted, but any indiscriminate use of the Act could jeopardise British companies dependent on continued access to United States goods and technology. The Government therefore believe that a case-by-case approach to problems best serves United Kingdom interests. And, unless a major dispute, like the Siberian pipeline affair, makes confrontation unavoidable, the Government consider that in general it is best for companies to be left free to make their own commercial decision as to whether to comply with United States rules.<br/>
United States export controls create uncertainty and the extra burden of compliance is a disincentive to sourcing from the United States. That is a factor which, inevitably, companies here have to consider, and it is a point which the United States Government should reflect upon too. It is in no one's interest that the flow of goods and technology between trusted allies should be distorted by unjustified and over-zealous attempts to impose unilaterally another layer of control, bureaucracy and legal claim.<br/>
The hon. Member for Yeovil has also urged the Government to refuse to allow United States Government officials to inspect United Kingdom companies for compliance with United States laws. In doing so, he is referring to the proposals by the United States Government to introduce a distribution licence system, under which United Kingdom companies importing United States goods would have the option of applying for the status of approved foreign consignees and so be released from the need to import high technology goods from the United States under individual United States export licences. I put it to the hon. Gentleman that this could be a benefit. But its cost would be that United Kingdom companies' books might be open to inspection by United States Government officials monitoring compliance with the United States rules.<br/>
The United States Government have made an approach to us to ask whether we would be ready to countenance such inspections. A proposal that foreign inspectors should visit companies here to monitor their compliance with foreign rules can never be easy. We thought it right, as a first step, to consult our own high technology industries; and I can tell the House that, while not enthusiastic&#x2014;perhaps not surprisingly&#x2014;they would not wish to be denied access to the proposed United States licensing facility. To answer the hon. Gentleman's point, that is why we have taken some time. It is very easy to make the instant, emotional response, which is to say that we deny the jurisdiction and therefore we deny the request.


But, as has been made clear, the Government are considering the United States Government's request. I can say now that it is not by any means a request that could be granted unconditionally. We should not get our difficulties in this area out of proportion. We see eye to eye with&#x2014;</p>

<p>The Minister is aware that his hon. Friend the Minister for Trade has written to me on this matter, and I understand that in some respects it is a difficult issue. However, he will appreciate that this is something that the Opposition could not countenance or agree with. Is the Minister saying, because I could not quite follow him, that in principle his Department is now prepared officially to agree to United States Department of Commerce officials coming here to inspect the books of British companies? Provided that the specific case is satisfactory, is the Minister now prepared in principle to concede that major issue of principle?</p>

<p>No, I am not saying that. I am saying that we thought that it was right first to ask the industry what it would like. We have had previous debates on this matter, particularly in the context of the Systime affair. On that occasion I sought to make it clear that it would be to nobody's advantage to take action with or against the United States Government that had the effect of putting a British company on to a particular blacklist, which effectively would mean that it was denied access to the material that it wished, thereby causing it to be put out of business.<br/>
I urge the hon. Member for Yeovil and the House to put the matter into a broader context. The Government's view has always been that on matters of this kind the nation's sovereignty should be respected. We believe that United States claims to jurisdiction over re-export are an infringement of our sovereignty and that they are contrary to international law. I assure the hon. Gentleman that this Government will continue to do their utmost to protect British interests, and we stand ready to support any United Kingdom company that in the course of its legitimate trading has fallen foul of United States extraterritoriality.<br/>
It was interesting to note that during the hon. Gentleman's speech, with its echoes of the Systime debate, he said that he had received letters. He felt unable to name companies, but he said that he had a list of companies and that he had been in correspondence with them. That is precisely the nub of the problem. We are not saying that companies should deal exclusively with the United States Government, but if the companies who have written to the hon. Gentleman would care to write to me and make arrangements to come and see me, I should be very happy to see them. The practical question is whether or not they are prepared to comply with the requirements of the American multinational companies. That is primarily a question for them. However, the question whether we shall admit United States Government inspectors to carry out inspections is a completely different matter, and we shall not gladly comply with such a request.<br/>
The Government asked whether we would consider using our presidency to draw together a European position. We certainly would. This matter is causing concern to our partner countries in the Community, and we could well take an initiative on it during our presidency.

We have been considering the matter, and I am glad to be able to respond positively to the hon. Gentleman on that point.<br/>
I shall be prepared, particularly if the companies concerned will make representations to me, to examine again the United States circulars, to raise the matter with the various American companies and find out whether they would be prepared to vary the terms of those circulars. The companies that are making these requirements need to be aware of the fact that, although they are established in the United Kingdom and are trading in the United Kingdom &#x2014; we are delighted to have those companies here; many of them have been here for many years and they make a valuable contribution to our economy &#x2014; they need to consider whether the continuation of such a policy is in their best interest, or in the interests of the industry in general.<br/>
It would help a great deal if there could be a lessening of the dependence of United Kingdom companies on supplies from the United States. One of the ways in which this can be promoted is by developing greater co-operation throughout Europe. As the hon. Member for Yeovil knows, we have developed in recent years a considerable number of programmes. The most recent is the series of EUREKA programmes. As we have the presidency of the European Community, we are taking a very active role at the moment in developing the research and development programme. We shall need to obtain agreement for the European Community research framework programme at the Research Council meeting on 9 December. If we obtain that agreement, it will be quite a major achievement.<br/>
As for domestic support, may I make it quite clear that the Government do not envisage activities in Europe&#x2014; be they in EUREKA or in the European Community research framework programme&#x2014;ESPRIT, RACE and BRITE &#x2014; as a substitute for activities in the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>May I just develop this point? It is very important for the House fully to understand that the Government are not looking, through greater participation in European programmes, for means of diminishing the national base of research and development. If that were to happen, before very long we should cease to have the ability to participate in these programmes.<br/>
When one looks at the support that my Department has given to research and development it is interesting to note that in 1979&#x2013;80 that support was &#x00A3;143 million and that in 1985&#x2013;86 it was &#x00A3;440 million&#x2014;a doubling, in real terms. People write learned articles, or what they claim to be learned articles, alleging that not enough is being spent by the Government on research and development and that this, and this alone, is one of the causes of our problems in the world of high technology and in other forms of technology. I dispute that. Significant sums of money are spent on research and development by the Government, but the problem is that British industry does not spend on research and development anything like the comparable figures that are spent upon research and development by either Japanese or German industry. This country must find ways to encourage industry to spend more on research and development and at the same time to encourage the City to take a more favourable view of investment in research and development.<br/>
I do not believe that the problem simply relates to the level of expenditure on research and development. When I carried out my consultations during the run-up to the first EUREKA conference and asked various people in industry what they would like the EUREKA movement and series of programmes to be, it as extremely interesting that they said to me, "Please, not another research and development programme." In their view, research and development programmes are coming out of companies' ears. What they were looking for, and what they have got, is a series of programmes that are close to the market place, that are therefore market-related and that have in view an actual product and a service.<br/>
The problem in this country over many years has been not so much the level of our research and development or the amount of innovation, which compares favourably with that of many other nations, certainly in terms of the number of Nobel prizewinners that we have produced, as our inability to exploit our research. We have failed to pull through the science into applied technology. When that is added to the fact that our domestic markets are too small to support many of our high technology firms, it is obvious that United Kingdom companies need to look much more towards European collaboration and markets as the springboard for world markets. Therefore our policies and our industrial research and development expenditure are directed towards stimulating greater European collaboration and a greater investment in research and development by industry from within its own resources.<br/>
In Europe, there are some areas of technology, especially over the harmonisation of standards, where there is considerable additional value in having a Community research and development programme.<br/>
Under the proposed changes to the treaty of Rome agreed last year, it is recognised that the Community must devote a greater share of its research and development to promoting the competitiveness of European industry in world markets. That has been recognised in the Commission's proposals for a new Community research and development framework. The Government are committed to a gradual growth in European Community research and development and will seek agreement on a new framework programme during the current presidency. The most significant European Community programme is ESPRIT &#x2014; the European strategic programme for research and development in information technology. The United Kingdom has done extremely well in ESPRIT, being involved in 135 of the 200 projects.<br/>
Similarly, my Department proposes to support RACE &#x2014; another acronym for the research on advanced communications in Europe programme&#x2014;in which again United Kingdom companies have done well, at a suitable level, reflecting the sharing of collaborative research and development, the opening up of markets and the forging of standards for future telecommunications networks.<br/>
The BRITE programme&#x2014;basic research in industrial technologies for Europe&#x2014; is also important and allows the more traditional industries to benefit from recent advances in technology.<br/>
I have mentioned EUREKA, which is a framework programme involving 19 countries, which seeks to encourage European collaboration on market-led high technology projects, thus helping to increase Europe's competitiveness with Japan and the United States. Seventy-two projects have been announced, 32 of which involve British companies. The EUREKA project

information net can help British industry to find partners for collaborative projects and to inform them of other projects in which they might wish to participate. Where firms involved in a EUREKA project discover a market barrier to commercial success, Governments can act as a lobby to resolve that problem. That is one of the most important future developments for EUREKA as a market-opening device to get the internal market that we all wish.</p>

<p>I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that intervention, although he has anticipated a point that I was about to make. It would be remiss of me if I did not mention the Alvey programme, the second annual conference of which was held just recently at the university of Sussex. It is the largest collaborative programme we have, and it brings together my Department, the Ministry of Defence, the Science and Engineering Research Council, various parts of industry and also higher educational institutes in collaborative projects in four main areas of information technology. Some 187 full industrial projects have been approved, and 116 academic-only projects. Public funds of &#x00A3;200 million are provided by the Government, with the remainder coming from industry.<br/>
One of the most successful research schemes of recent years is the joint opto-electronics research scheme &#x2014; JOERS&#x2014; which is a pre-competitive joint research scheme between industry and higher educational institutions. The take-up of funds &#x2014; &#x00A3;25 million &#x2014; has been rapid with many applications of high quality being submitted. Both the motion and the amendment concentrate on higher technology, and the aerospace industry is a very important user of various aspects of it. In March 1984, the Government provided &#x00A3;250 million in launch aid to British Aerospace in respect of its participation in the design and development of the Airbus A320. By the end of May this year, 134 A320s had been ordered by 12 different airlines. That is encouraging and discussions are taking place on the possibility of support for future members of the Airbus family. Launch aid funding of &#x00A3;60 million has also been provided for the new fuel-efficient IAE V2500 in which Rolls-Royce is participating, and for Westland for its participation in the EH101 multi-role helicopter.<br/>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel (Mr. Marshall) has said, Government support for space research and development is aimed at creating an industry capable of exploiting the rapidly growing commercial opportunities by producing space hardware, software and services. The British National Space Centre was formed in November 1985. Total Government expenditure on space in 1985&#x2013;86 was &#x00A3;100 million, of which the largest share, &#x00A3;70 million, was provided by the Department of Trade and Industry. But space development is expensive, and it is


therefore essential to work through the European Space Agency. The British contribution to the European Space Agency, administered through the British National Space Centre, was about &#x00A3;80 million, of which the Department of Trade and Industry contributed &#x00A3;60 million. That contribution represents about 80 per cent. of British Government civil space research and development and about 15 per cent. of the total ESA budget.</p>

<p>Am I right in thinking that the director of the British National Space Centre, Roy Gibson, presented his British space plan to the Department of Trade and Industry on 4 July?

If not, how will we be made party to that final decision?</p>

<p>No, it is not true that Roy Gibson presented the plan although that was his aim. I understand, however, that I am about to receive it. My colleagues and I in the Department will wish first to consider it carefully and will try to arrive at a decision, which may be taken before the House reconvenes. I should be happy to give an assurance to my hon. Friend that there will be a statement on the Floor of the House, but it would be unwise to do so. I am sure that the usual channels will ensure that a debate takes place if that is the wish of the House.<br/>
We are conscious of the needs of small firms, and my Department especially welcomes applications from small firms for the various support programmes that we have. In April this year we announced the small firms merit award scheme for research and technology. It draws openly and unashamedly on the experience of the United States and on what is known over there as the small business innovation research programme, which has worked well. The first two examples will cover the areas of biotechnology and instrumentation for a one-year trial.<br/>
It is also important for the House to be aware of the great emphasis that the Department of Trade and Industry places on close co-operation between it and the Ministry of Defence. The Department spends &#x00A3;35 million a year in and through the Royal Aircraft Establishment and the Royal Signals and Radar Establishment at Malvern to provide technical underpinning of aircraft, electronics, information technology and space industries.<br/>
We have carried through some important recent developments. Defence Technology Enterprises Ltd. has been set up to license technology in such establishments as the Royal Aircraft Establishment, the Royal Signals and Radar Establishment, and the Admiralty Research Establishment and that has now extended to the Royal Armament Research and Development Establishment. The national electronics research initiatives at the Royal Signals and Radar Establishment bring together researchers from collaborating firms to form strong teams.<br/>
I strongly believe in the need to bring the civil sector and the military sector together as often as possible, and that initiative at the Royal Signals and Radar Establishment represents an excellent forerunner of technology transfer programmes to come. The teaching company scheme is an important programme for helping to deal with the problems that the hon. Member for Yeovil referred to in his opening remarks about skill shortages

and about improving co-operation between the educational sector and industry. We strongly support the technique of research clubs such as those that I have already mentioned in Alvey and JOERS. That seems to us to be a very acceptable way in which to proceed.<br/>
The Government generally believe that high technology and other companies can be assisted by the right economic climate, in which taxation is reduced and devices such as the business expansion scheme are introduced.<br/>
On the subject of venture capital it is interesting to note that in 1979 there were only five funds investing &#x00A3;7 million. There are now more than 100 specialist funds investing &#x00A3;270 million a year. That is good news for the high technology sector. We have worked hard across Government to reduce many of the bureaucratic burdens in terms of price, dividend, exchange and many other controls. This is extremely important. Various high technology companies have done extremely well following the privatisation programme, such as British Telecom, Cable and Wireless, British Aerospace, and Amersham International. There is now an upsurge of various companies which are emerging from the academic sector. In that context, it is extremely interesting to note the success of science parks. They have done extremely well, not only in Cambridge but elsewhere, often in contrast to the lack of success of similar attempts in the United States.<br/>
I hope that the hon. Member for Yeovil will feel that I have given him good measure in my speech. I fully accept that extraterritoriality is a problem. We recognise that, and are also conscious of the practical difficulties faced by companies that are caught up in such practices. I have given the hon. Gentleman certain assurances, and I hope that he will find them acceptable. The Government are running several programmes to help British high-tech firms to be strong enough to cope with those pressures, particularly through developing co-operation and collaboration with other companies in Europe.<br/>
The subject of today's debate is important and I look forward to hearing the views of other hon. Members on matters of common concern. I assure the House that this subject is serious, and that the high technology sector is vigorous and developing. We are very pleased with the progress that it is making.</p>

<p>I am sure that the Minister did not expect many Opposition Members to be impressed by that complacent recitation of the recent activities of his Government and Department.<br/>
This comprehensive motion gives us an opportunity to discuss a matter that has in recent years aroused intense and growing resentment in the country, in British industry and, in particular, among British industrialists. I am sure that the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown) will be pleased to know that we shall support the motion standing in his name and in that of his right hon. and hon. Friends.<br/>
When we debated high technology on 15 May 1985, it was again against the background of the infamous IBM letter of December 1983, and of the earlier raging controversy over the John Brown Russian pipeline contract. Those, and a growing number of other similar events, have demonstrated the American Administration's now octopodal interference in the high technology trading relationships of Britain with other countries, in addition to the COCOM member states.<br/>
Since our last debate, matters have degenerated further. Far from backing off from its claim to extraterritorial and retroactive imposition of United States law, the Reagan Administration seek to extend it and to institutionalise it with a step-by-step policy of effective commercial coercion orchestrated by Mr. Richard Perle at the Pentagon, and encompassing not just the United States Department of Commerce, but the United States Customs and Excise and, apparently, even the CIA.<br/>
The latest step to be taken by the United States authorities&#x2014;the Minister will know about it, as I have been in touch with the Minister for Trade&#x2014;involves a set of new regulations for the distribution licence, a system of bulk licensing that allows American exporters to export specified goods to approved foreign consignees without the individual transaction approval that the United States authorities usually require.<br/>
In his letter of 30 June, I was informed by the Minister that the system is
<q>designed to free the companies concerned from the delays and expense of applying for individual licences.</q>
No-one&#x2014;not even this gullible Government or Minister &#x2014;would swallow that. The simplification procedure is nothing more than a sprat to catch a mackerel. The real purpose, long hankered after by Mr. Richard Perle and his associates, is that United Kingdom companies that accept those new regulations would be required to accept audit visits by United States Department of Commerce officials.<br/>
Furthermore, as the Minister has frankly admitted to the House, the United States Government have sought this Government's agreement to visits by Department of Commerce officials in order to audit the books of British companies. I asked the Minister whether he had conceded that principle, but I am not sure what his answer was. He seems to be confirming that no such concession will be made by the British Government&#x2014;<i>[Interruption.]</i> I am trying to put some words into his mouth for him, which he could then use when he replies to the debate.<br/>
On behalf of the official Opposition, I say that any acceptance of any such jurisdiction by the Government in order to audit the books of British companies would he utterly unacceptable. It would be tantamount to an official acceptance of the United States' long-standing attempt to have that imposition of American laws on United Kingdom companies accepted. To us, that is unacceptable.</p>

<p>Will the hon. Gentleman address himself to my point, that it is important to take into account the feelings and aspirations of the companies concerned? What would he do if they said that they preferred to continue with the regulations?</p>
</speech>
<speech hansard_id="429660" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1986-07-15a.887.1" hansard_membership_id="174" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/3217" speakername="Mr. Robinson" colnum="887" time="17:20:00">
<p>I am grateful to the Minister for that intervention. Given the total lack of support given to companies by this Government, I can well understand companies accepting almost anything that would give them some freedom of access to American technology. But the matter should not be approached in that way. The Government should make it clear to British companies that they are standing four square behind them in resisting that unacceptable pressure from America. What would those companies then say? If they felt that the Government were four square behind them and had embarked on a policy of resistance to pressure from the United States, none of them would want to go along with that set of regulations.<br/>
As a Minister, the hon. Gentleman bears responsibility for upholding the laws of this country, and he cannot hide behind any temporary commercial convenience. Incomprehensible and feeble as the Minister's position is, he will no doubt try to explain it at the end of the debate.<br/>
Following the Minister's intervention, it is even more clear that the Government will not give any categorical assurance. Consequently, we can do little but echo the remarks that have been made about this Government's attitude towards standing up for British industry. Several British business men sought the Government's support in resisting American pressures. They were interviewed in that remarkable "TV Eye" programme, "Uncle Sam's Law". The Minister should consider his intervention against this background. Mr. Colin Hill, a British business man who was under American pressure, sought help from the British Government and from the Department of Trade and Industry. He said:
<q>our Government is not strong enough. And certainly our Department of Trade and Industry always gives me the appearance of being like a toothless tiger. I mean, all it does is bare its gums at the opposition.</q>
We know that feeling from our debates in the House.<br/>
The same point was put later in the same programme, perhaps even more appositely, by another business man, who said that he did not blame the Americans for defending their interests but
<q>What I do blame is the British Government for being so wet, and frankly so pusillanimous, not to stand up for British interests.</q>
That is the reputation shared by the Minister and his Department. It is time that he did something about it.<br/>
But I am asking that of a Government who, in their supine appeasement of the American President, agreed to the F111 raid on Libya from British territory, and am asking it of a Government who have a total lack of faith in British technology or in British managers and workers. They forced through the sale of Westland to the Americans and tried to do the same when it came to disposing of Britain's vital motor vehicle industry to General Motors and Ford. Consequently, there is not much hope of support for British industry from this Government.<br/>
It is not to be wondered at that a Government who are opposed to the very idea of an industrial strategy for a high technology centre should be so wet, half-hearted, hesitant and lacking in self-confidence when it comes to opposng the United States' attempt to impose extra-territorial law on trade in critical high technology components which is being conducted by British industry.<br/>
But even if we resisted the Reagan Administration's most overt attempts to ride roughshod over our commercial interests &#x2014; we could perhaps do that occasionally on a case-by-case basis &#x2014; as long as that American law stands, the problems experienced so acutely in recent years by the microcomputer industry would persist. I accept that point. I agree with the Minister that we must deal with the real world as we find it. We must be tough about it, not supine.<br/>
I would put one question to the Minister. If there are cases where it could be considered to be illegal, especially in the conduct of some American companies or even American agencies such as the CIA &#x2014;perhaps there is no evidence for that&#x2014;and the Pentagon and so on, is there no case that we can take to the International Court? Are there no grounds on which we could seek a legal resolution of a problem which seems irresoluble other than


by legal action? Even if we do all the things which were valiantly called for by the hon. Member for Yeovil, it will not solve the problem. Even if we get the letters revoked or have Government-to-Government confrontation instead of confrontation of the Minister and a United States Department of Commerce official, I promise the hon. Gentleman that it will not solve the problem. I leave it with the Minister. He should not be as afraid to take on our strong and powerful allies as he appears.<br/>
The history of the international relations of the United States Department of Commerce has shown it to be sensitive to actions that call into doubt the exactitude of American commercial behaviour. Nothing showed that better than the action we took on American steel imports which quickly made the Americans rescind the legislation that we considered directly infringed the rules of the general agreement on tariffs and trade. I do not necessarily expect an answer from the Minister tonight. I am sure that our correspondence on these matters will continue. We are definitely looking for a much more vigorous and determined pursuit and defence of British national interest than he or his Department have shown to date.<br/>
That can only be half of the issue. The second part of the motion must not be dominated by the first part. What is needed, beyond the negative defence of our interests to the best of our abilities, is a positive and determined British effort to build up a British and European high technology base to lessen, as rapidly as possible, our dependence on United States technology. For once, there is no alternative. However, instead of pursuing that course with vigour and a real commitment to British science and technology, the Government have preached the value of low-wage service industries and boasted only of their commitment to the creation of a low-tech and even a no-tech economy. The fearsome prospect for the country is that in this one area the Government are likely to have achieved their policy objectives. The whole of the distinguished British scientific community has felt so threatened that it has launched a Save British Science campaign supported by over 100 fellows of the Royal Society, 11 Nobel laureates and a substantial number of vice-chancellors and presidents of learned societies.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman will be aware that some of the leaders in that campaign, especially one I debated with on radio, were unaware of the amount of money that the Ministry of Defence spends on research and development every year. He did not take that into account and that is nonsense because of the importance that it has for high technology.</p>

<speech hansard_id="429662" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1986-07-15a.889.1" hansard_membership_id="174" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/3217" speakername="Mr. Robinson" colnum="889" time="17:20:00">
<p>That is a valid point. This country spends far too much on defence-oriented research and development and has done so for far too long. The ignorance of that fact on the part of one fellow of the Royal Society or a supporter of the Save British Science campaign in no way detracts from that. Indeed, the continuing heavy commitment to defence research and development explains why vital areas of civil research and development, including those represented among the coordinating committee and supporters of the campaign, are being sadly neglected. Later in my speech I shall give the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) some examples from the campaign literature which I am sure he has seen but has not found time to read.<br/>
I should like to deal with one more of the Minister's arguments. It is becoming tiresomely familiar to all hon. Members. The argument goes along the lines that, although we have a long and distinguished record of basic scientific research, as a nation we have failed to capitalise on British inventiveness by translating the research into marketable products for world trade. That is a fair representation of how the argument goes. It is my view that we trumpet rather too much about our scientific research and its successes. In that area, as in many others in today's world of rapid and extensive development, there can be no room for such complacency.<br/>
Even if we accept, for the sake of argument, that Britain has done well at fundamental scientific research and less well at exploiting it, it is utterly perverse logic to argue that we should cut basic research, which is what we are doing. It is perverse to argue that by hacking to pieces what we are good at and by chucking overboard decades of priceless scientific fundamental research, we would be able to improve our record in exploiting it. The argument does not begin to stand up.<br/>
The attack on British science is part of the Government's attack on the whole educational framework of the country. Its consequences are felt in the critical shortage of mathematics and physics teachers in our secondary schools, in the shortage of electronic, computer and engineering graduates from universities and colleges of further education and now in the haemorrhage to posts abroad of many of our most brilliant research graduates.<br/>
As I promised, I shall give a few examples from the Save British Science campaign document. It gets better with rereading. One example deals with inorganic chemistry where, in the assessment of one of the fellows of the Royal Society,
<q>'the best of the British inorganic chemists in the age group 30&#x2013;45 are now employed by American universities of high repute.'</q>
A further example comes from the head of an important department of Glasgow university. The extent of the move abroad, the brain drain of British research, is quantified in this way:
<q>Of our 15 British Ph D graduates since 1981 only 3 are working in science within the UK 10 are in the USA and one is in France.</q>
One further example is about a lost "new blood" appointment where a "superb candidate" according to the head of department, was being interviewed and was offered a place in Lancaster physics department in the area of experimental low-temperature physics. The reasons given by the superb candidate for not taking up the offer, as set out in the document by the head of department, were as follows:
<q>I understand that the reason for his change of heart lay not so much in the inadequate salary per se&#x2014;although this doubtless played a part&#x2014;but in the belief that the British university system was being allowed to collapse &#x2026; (he will) continue his career in North America.</q></p>

<p>Some of the facts from the university of Southampton in the latest University Grants Committee allocations for departments that are really making their way in scientific and development work, show that the university got &#x00A3;750,000 and it raised &#x00A3;13 million by doing outside work in science and development. I do not think that the denigration of our universities is helpful.</p>

<p>I am sure that the hon. Gentleman's remarks concerning the university in his constituency are


well noted. I shall refrain from telling him about the outstanding record of Warwick university in my city. If the hon. Gentleman cares to check, I think that he will find that there are some quotations from Southampton making the same points. It is not me who is making the comments but those who are working in British universities and are concerned about maintaining and developing British science in the universities.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman should address to those concerned his queries and remonstrations as to whether documents of that kind are harming science. I am sure that he would be rapidly convinced to the contrary. If he reads the report again he will read the conclusion:
<q>Our conclusion is not only that damage has been done but that some of it may now already be irreversible. The lead even in technologically important areas of research has been allowed to slip to other countries.</q>
The Government are presiding over a brain drain of Britain's top scientific talents, the extensive damage of which will be felt over the next decade and beyond, when it will become clear that Britain has wasted a golden opportunity to capitalise on its strong research capabilities, and to play a leading role in the creation of the new technologies on a Europewide basis.<br/>
We accept that the scale of resources required for research and development, as well as the size of the homogeneous market required, will mean that the organisation and exploitation of the next generation of scientists and technologists must take place on a European scale. That is why, from the beginning, we have supported ESPRIT and RACE and BRITE. The Minister also referred to RACE and BRITE, which are lesser-known but still very useful European projects. We condemned the Government when they dragged their feet over the EUREKA project when it was initiated by the French. Equally, we welcomed the Government's change of heart and the backing they are giving to EUREKA during this important period of the British presidency of the Community.<br/>
What continues to puzzle us &#x2014; I hope the Minister will address himself to this when he replies&#x2014;is how we shall sustain a high profile active role in Europe if the overall funds from the Department of Trade and Industry and Government support for innovation and other schemes, are not increased. The Minister has refused to tell us whether the funds will be increased and if so by how much. He will be aware that a good deal of anxiety persists in industry as to whether the Government will continue to support ESPRIT and more importantly, EUREKA. Such support will require new additional money to be found from the existing DTI budget at the expense of other national programmes.<br/>
The Minister made it clear that he did not consider the European projects as substitutes for national projects but he has been extremely coy about how much money the projects will cost and whether there will be adequate money for both sets of programmes. I have raised this matter with him on a number of occasions, most recently at Question Time on 18 June 1986. With regard to the companies participating in the European projects, he gave me the assurance:
<q>we are not talking about alternative or substitutional activities. It is important to put that on the record." &#x2014;[<i>Official Report,</i> 18 June 1986; Vol. 99, c. 1019.]</q>
He put that on the record again today.<br/>
If that is the case&#x2014;industry will be relieved that it is so&#x2014;there must be new additional money for EUREKA.<br/>
Following the completion of the Bide committee's report later in the year there must be new and additional money for Alvey. I urge the Minister not to postpone the new funding which is urgently required on Alvey. He will be aware of the immense damage that was done by the five-month moratorium which was introduced&#x2014;I give him the benefit of the doubt &#x2014; prior to his taking over his position. Later in the year, industry and universities will be looking to the Government for urgent and positive decisions on Alvey.<br/>
If we consider the scale of Government resources needed, I draw to the Minister's attention two instances which give us some idea of the scale of competition which we will face. On 1 July, when the latest EUREKA project was announced&#x2014;to a general welcome, as the Minister said &#x2014; the <i>Financial Times</i> stated that the French Government expected to pay 40 per cent. of the near &#x00A3;400 million which French companies are expected to spend on EUREKA. That is the scale of the French involvement. It comes on top of the five times greater spend by the French on electronics. German expenditure on support for electronics is running at over three times the British level.</p>

<p>I will give way in a moment.<br/>
The Minister has said that he is committed to additional programmes and in his reply to me during a recent Question Time, he gave a commitment to meeting industry's requirements for EUREKA.

<p>I thank the hon. Member for giving way. A moment ago he said that the French Government spend five times what our Government spend on their electronics industry. Is he aware that a vast proportion of this is spent to make up the losses in the nationalised French electronics industry? It was nationalised in the 1980s and previously had been profitable, but it is now making massive losses and is costing the French taxpayer a huge sum of money.</p>

<p>The hon. Member is not aware that French research and development represents 3 per cent. of its gross national product. Since the war, the French have had a long successful tradition of Government-backed research and development in industry through to bringing products on to the market. In many ways France has set a pattern for us of what can be achieved by positive collaboration between Government and industry. That is anathema to this Tory Administration.<br/>
My attention has been drawn by that intervention to the French microelectronics industry. I am sure that the hon. Member for Amber Valley (Mr. Oppenheim), when he intervened to so little effect, overlooked the fact that when the three major semiconductor manufacturers&#x2014;Thomson of France, Philips of Holland and Siemens of Germany &#x2014; met in June this year to discuss joint research and development on advanced technology needed to design and make microchips in the late 1990s, no British company was invited. A couple of years ago when the French and German Governments were holding talks about industrial co-operation &#x2014; talks that led to the important plans for the key design and production technologies wich western European semiconductor makers will need in order to be competitive with the


Japanese and the United States in 1995 &#x2014; the Conservative Government of Britain were venting their bitter spite against any form of public or private cooperation by crippling INMOS as an independent British producer.<br/>
The result of the Government's attack on British research and development, their inadequate funding for national and joint European projects, their failure to harness the power of public purchasing for the purpose of developing British technologies is evident, in its cumulative effect, in the massive deficit that we now face on our balance of trade in information technology products. The deficit on the balance of trade has grown from &#x00A3;384 million in 1980 to no less than &#x00A3;2&#x00B7;3 billion in 1984.<br/>
The Minister may take some comfort from the apparent stabilisation of the deficit in the past couple of years, but he will know, as every expert will tell him, that the situation is getting worse.<br/>
The recent Advisory Council for Applied Research and Development publication which dealt primarily with software and of which the Minister is so fond, also addressed itself to the growing critical deficit in information technology. It projected that, by 1990, we shall be facing no less than a &#x00A3;9 billion deficit on our balance of trade in information technology products. What are the Government going to do about it? We do not expect an answer from the Minister, because the harsh truth is the Government do not know what to do. If the Government wanted a plan, they are forbidden one anyway and above all, whatever is done must not involve any further expenditure. <i>[Interruption.]</i><br/>
I am aware that many Members wish to speak, and I will certainly make haste, I wish to consider two documents which have recently been published by ACA RD &#x2014; "Software: a Vital Key to UK Competitiveness" and "Exploitable Areas of Science". These documents, which have brought together experts in different areas, make it clear that what is lacking in Britain is a coherent strategy for the development and exploitation of science and technology. These experts cannot bring themselves to say that, as they are contorted by the need to observe Thatcherite semantics. The criticism has been dressed up in the process of consultation, and despite the evidence of recommendations in the software report, the document states that there is no need for Government intervention or subvention. Yet it is clear that six of the principal recommendations of the report need direct Government intervention and indirect Government subvention.<br/>
Rather than set up a planned, independent procedure for the valuation of British science, the Government have sneaked through, in a Cabinet Office document, a science and technology assessment office. Nobody is clear as to the exact purpose of this office. It is significant that, on the same day that it was announced, Mr. Fairclough let slip in his evidence to the House of Lords Select Committee on Science and Technology that the Government had announced &#x00A3;5 million further cuts in their research funding. No doubt Mr. Fairclough has only just started.<br/>
The combination of the Prime Minister's craven subservience to President Reagan and her pathological

antipathy to constructive Government and industry cooperation make it impossible for the country, under this Government, to develop and carry through a coherent industrial strategy.<br/>
Such a strategy must be driven by three engines of recovery &#x2014; research and development, training and investment. In all of those the Government have a major role to play. The next Labour Government are pledged to those policies, which will halt the decline of British science and high technology. The implementation of those policies awaits only the sure and certain victory of the Labour party at the next general election.</p>

<p>I congratulate the alliance on choosing this important topic for debate. I must confess some surprise that the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown) took an important but narrow point in the motion. I was hoping that we might be given a little insight into the Liberal party's policies on information technology.<br/>
I want to know whether the Liberal party has moved on from the days of the Lib-Lab pact when, as the House knows, it supported the Labour party when it spawned the National Enterprise Board when the Government of the day went out to pick high-tech winners.<br/>
I take the strictures of the hon. Member for Coventry, North-West (Mr. Robinson) slightly awry when I think of the companies that were chosen. The names of those companies that went bankrupt should be inscribed on a brass plate so that politicians can constantly look at them and be reminded of their own fallibility. I do not know how many tens of millions of pounds it cost the taxpayer, but it was a great number.<br/>
Having said that, I recognise that we need a balanced and dynamic programme for high-tech research, if Britain is to maintain its position as an industrial power. For any country to have a high-tech policy it must have an efficient communications system to communicate data throughout the country and, if required, on through the rest of the world.<br/>
For that reason, Conservative Members should take considerable pride in the fact that we brought about the improvements in British Telecom by its privatisation. We did that just in the nick of time. The delays in installation, the poor quality and the few choices of equipment were becoming a scandal. There was no way that the vast sums of money needed to bring about the new systems could have been generated out of earnings and the Treasury was reluctant to find such vast sums of money from the taxpayer. As we know, there is no way that the value added network services, which are now doing such a valuable job throughout Britain, could have been allowed without the liberalisation of the system.<br/>
It is interesting to note that the parties responsible for the debate tonight had their usual voting pattern on that measure. Some voted for it, some against it, and some abstained. I think that that covers all the possible options. For the record, I should point out that BT is now providing the Treasury with &#x00A3;1&#x00B7;3 billion a year, near enough double what it was producing when it was a nationalised industry. That point should be repeated time and again.<br/>
I hope that, when the hon. Member for Stockton, South (Mr. Wrigglesworth) replies, he will mention what he sees


as the future of BT if and when the unlikely event occurs that the Social Democratic and Liberal parties have a say in its future.</p>

I have already pointed out what would happen if the Government started to try to second-guess the market place. But there is no doubt that, if we are to remain an industrial power, our industries must be willing and eager to embrace the sunbelt sector.<br/>
The predictions of the market for information technology and electronics vary, but everybody agrees that, whatever the figure, it will be huge. To secure a fair slice of that market, the Government have already played an important role in encouraging companies to introduce new technology into their methods of operation and the CADCAM and robotic programmes are examples of what they have already done.<br/>
In addition, as my hon. Friend the Minister has already mentioned, in 1983 the Government launched the biggest collaborative research programme that Britain has known since the second world war &#x2014; the Alvey programme, which has pulled together the universities and companies to combine theory with the demands of the market place.<br/>
As my hon. Friend knows, that programme comes to an end in 1988 and talks are already taking place on Alvey mark 2. I appreciate that there must be an evaluation of the effectiveness of that programme, but I want to echo what has already been said by Opposition Members. I hope that my hon. Friend will announce his decisions as soon as possible, for a variety of reasons. One is that research teams take a little time to put together. They cost money to bring together, and, as their programmes come to an end, they want to know whether they will have a continuation or whether that is the end of the line for their project.<br/>
Let me make one further suggestion to do with Alvey clubs. At the moment, there is a general feeling that there has been a little too much emphasis on the supplier input rather than on the user input. I hope that when my hon. Friend comes to make his decisions on that point he will bear that in mind. The field of opportunity is probably larger at the moment on the user side than on the supplier side.<br/>
The vital role that Government have to play is to ensure that the United Kingdom competes successfully with the other two major powers, the United States and Japan, who have not only been making most of the technological discoveries that have recently been brought before us but have been bringing them to the market place with great effect. That has led our Government to seek the support of our EEC partners and with it a market potential to

match that of the competition. That could be the answer to the extraterritorial question. If we have our own continental alternatives, we shall not have to go down the route of all the legal hassle and argument with the United States.<br/>
As has already been mentioned, one of the participating programmes is that of ESPRIT, which is similar to the Alvey programme, and must be the way in which the huge investments needed for this type of research can be found. The other, which puts a more commercial face on research, is EUREKA. Any collaboration must have an end in view &#x2014; a product that can be bought by the customer, particularly in the EEC, and, I hope, in the rest of the world. I am glad to hear that my hon. Friend emphasises the need to exploit those discoveries.<br/>
The hon. Member for Coventry, North-West made great play of the Save British Science campaign. It has its particular arguments, but he did not read out&#x2014;this is why the Alvey programme is successful&#x2014;that the theme of the Government's pronouncements on research is that support depends upon perceived economic benefits. If we are to compete with the rest of the world, we must make a product that will eventually be bought. Vast sums for pure research that have no financial benefit at the end of the day cannot be funded for ever. I believe that the EUREKA programme is attacking the matter in exactly the right way.<br/>
The theme running through the speeches of Opposition Members is the desire to become involved in the use of taxpayers' money, whether by way of nationalization&#x2014; another phrase that is used now is "social ownership" &#x2014;a national investment hank, which is rumoured, or the new technological enterprise corporation. That still adds to a severe case of the politicians' disease of them knowing better than the experts in the industry. I hope that the Government will follow the path of providing support but not of going into the realm of endeavouring to pick winners. I believe that Government can only lay the ground rules and create the framework. British people and British companies will provide the growth, wealth and employment for the people of this country.</p>

<p>A great deal of the debate has focused on the information technology industry. That industry is important to my constituency. For example, IBM, which employs 2,900 people, is the biggest employer in my constituency. That company, along with National Semiconductor, generates work for thousands of people.<br/>
I wish to widen the debate a little and talk about the United Kingdom's offshore oil and gas industry and the problems that it faces. With your favour, Mr. Deputy Speaker, the title of the motion &#x2014; "Defending British High Technology Industries"&#x2014;allows me to do so. The Government's amendment refers to the defence of British high technology industries. The offshore oil and gas industry must be one of the most advanced industries. On 24 June, the Minister of State, Department of Energy told the Scottish Grand Committee:
<q>The industry is taking the lead, particularly in offshore technology, not only in our own continental shelf but in other parts of the world." &#x2014; [<i>Official Report, Scottish Grand Committee,</i> 24 June 1986; c. 3.]</q>
I would not dispute that comment. It is an important industry to Scotland as well as to the United Kingdom.


The Scott-Lithgow company in my constituency is building one of the most technologically advanced semi-submersible rigs ever built for drilling purposes in deep water.<br/>
The low oil price since the end of 1985 has led to a marked reduction in exploration and appraisal drilling and the deferment and delay of the development of new fields in the North sea, although no significant reduction in production has taken place. A survey of oil company intentions by the Grampian regional council this year suggests that the downturn in development activity will last throughout the whole of this year, 1987 and 1988. That report, commissioned by the Grampian regional council, suggests that there will be an upturn in 1989 and that there will be a large increase in activity in 1990 and into the 1990s.<br/>
The problem with such a projection is that the three lean years of 1986, 1987 and 1988 almost certainly mean that a considerable capability that has been built up in the oil service and supply sectors in the United Kingdom, especially in Scotland, will not survive to 1989 to enjoy the benefits of an upturn in the market. Scotland is already seeing the redundancies coming through. Britoil recently declared redundant 400 of its employees in Glasgow. Forty of those employees were senior technologists and managers. The company gave them an hour to clear their desks.<br/>
Aberdeen, which is an employment bright spot in Scotland&#x2014;male unemployment is less than 10 per cent, which is a vastly different position from that which exists in my constituency and others on Clydeside &#x2014; is suffering redundancies in the oil and ancillary industrial organisations. An upturn in the market in 1989 will encounter severe shortages in local services and supplies, leading to rapid price inflation and a greater dependence than hitherto on overseas supplies.<br/>
My intervention is a plea for a temporary amendment to the tax regime in respect of the North sea, which might help to even out the cycle, to the long-run benefit of the oil companies, the services and supply industries and employment in Scotland and the United Kingdom.<br/>
At the moment, oil operators offset the development costs of a new field against the petroleum revenue tax payable on production from that field. However, the oil companies need money up front to develop the field first. Since the drastic fall in the oil price, those companies are saying that it is a simple shortage of cash that is causing them to defer or delay developments in new fields. For my constituents and the rest of Scotland, that spells disaster. If orders are not made, the fabrication yards, the engineering industry and the information technology industry will suffer.<br/>
One change to the present tax regime that might help to overcome the problem would be if the oil companies were allowed to offset the development of new fields against the petroleum revenue tax that they are currently paying on existing production from other fields in the North sea. Such a tax regime would provide the oil companies with the money to carry out new development. In order to ensure that the United Kingdom achieves some additional benefit from such a change to the tax regime, it could be limited to projects approved after the announcement of the change and the costs incurred on the projects before the end of 1988.<br/>
By that means, the gain to the companies would accrue only to new projects brought forward and implemented later this year, in 1987 and in 1988, not to existing projects already under way, and only to expenditure incurred in that period. That might be a substantial encouragement to some oil companies to bring forward into 1986&#x2013;88 projects that would not otherwise be developed until after 1989. The state would not necessarily lose tax revenue because it would accrue a tax revenue from the new field. The tax take could be rescheduled from 1986&#x2013;88 to 1989 and onwards.<br/>
There may be some loss of revenue to the extent that the new fields would yield less tax than existing fields. The net outcome for the Treasury would need to be calculated on the basis of likely effects of the tax change and the tax profiles of particular fields. The advantage of such a proposal is that it would directly address the need for cash up front to develop the new fields. Being for a limited period only, it would be a direct incentive to bring forward deferred projects. The limited time would also ensure that the tax concession would be operative only where there was a gain in activity. Also, the delay or loss in tax revenue implied by the proposal would be kept to a minimum by the limited time period.<br/>
Given the drastic fall in the price of oil, Scotland, in particular, faces massive employment problems. The industry, including its ancillary activities, is one of the most important and technologically advanced that we have. It has a huge market potential overseas wherever oil exploration takes place on continental shelves or even in much deeper waters.<br/>
A positive response is needed quickly from the Government to prevent those worsening circumstances leading to much higher unemployment in the bright spots of the Grampian region.</p>

<p>I shall not seek to follow the remarks made by the hon. Member for Greenock and Port Glasgow (Dr. Godman), although they are relevant to my speech. He described adequately and with force the impending decline of Britain's first-class sub-sea industry unless drastic measures are taken. I wish to contrast that possibility of decline, which we all hope will not happen, with the undoubted possibilities of expansion, profitability and scientific return from an enlarged space programme on the part of the United Kingdom.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Minister briefly alluded to the United Kingdom's space programme in his opening remarks and referred in particular to the inauguration of the British National Space Centre at Farnborough, which has borne fruit under his stewardship. I give full credit to my hon. Friend for that event because it brings us in line with our French and German counterparts, and will enable us to play a better co-ordinated part in the European Space Agency's programme for the next 10 years, which was decided at the ESA ministerial meeting in Rome in December 1985.<br/>
The space progammme for Europe, which my hon. Friend approved, was extremely important strategically for the United Kingdom and Europe. Our expenditure on space is to be increased by some 70 per cent. over a 10-year period. Many key decisions were made. One such decision was that we are to continue the development of Europe's launcher capacity through Ariane 5. If the full potential of


Ariane 5 is to be realised it should be a man rated vehicle, and this possibility was to be studied. I understand ESA's latest decision is for a preparatory programme to study how Hermes, a manned vehicle to be carried by Ariane 5, could be constructed. It is not merely a question of simple evaluation. It is a concrete programme to prepare for the launch of Hermes. The launch date for Hermes will be in the middle of the next decade.<br/>
Furthermore, the breakdown of funding for Hermes was approved in principle at the June meeting of ESA. If reports are correct, the French are to assume 50 per cent. of the responsibility and the Germans 25 per cent., leaving a further 25 per cent. to be divided among the remaining nine ESA members.<br/>
The House will recall that the United Kingdom was in the forefront of launcher development. We unilaterally developed Blue Streak, initially as a ballistic missile system. Following the cancellation of the Blue Streak missile, it was adopted by the European Launcher Development Organisation as Europe's satellite launcher. Some eight launches were achieved and then, regrettably, Europa, as it was known, was cancelled. Since then, the United Kingdom has been out of the launcher business.<br/>
However, British Aerospace and Rolls-Royce have put to the ESA our proposals for a revolutionary re-usable horizontal take-off and landing vehicle, designated HOTOL, with an exciting new power plant, the commercial potential of which is so great that it must be classified. The power plant is both air breathing in the lower layers and rocket-powered in exo-atmospheric flight.<br/>
I do not see HOTOL as a direct competitor to Hermes, but it is important that the British National Space Centre and the Government in their inputs to ESA secure the ultimate development of HOTOL by ESA. I do not think that there need be a conflict with Hermes, which is a more immediate programme. The technology of Hermes is less advanced and its systems less sophisticated than those of HOTOL. To support Europe's participation in the NASA space station&#x2014; this is a key element in ESA's 10-year programme &#x2014; the Columbus module, primarily to be constructed by the Germans arid Italians, will be the central European element. The European module and European activity in support of the NASA station will require a manned re-usable vehicle, and Hermes could have real merits.<br/>
There are two essential deficiencies in the European space programme. First, until now we have not had a manned space programme of our own. The United States and the Soviet Union recognised the key importance of man in space, which has enabled them to mobilise public opinion and political support for the ambitious programmes they have pursued. The Soviets recognised that to an extreme extent through the development of the Soyuz series of vehicles. They intend to place a permanent manned space station into orbit, probably in two or three years' time. Indeed, Commander Leonid Kizim, the present commander of Soyuz 15, is the first astronaut who has spent over a year in space. He reached that point on 5 July 1986. Another Soviet cosmonaut, a flight engineer, has completed 361 days in space. Clearly, the Soviets have long experience of sustained manned space flight operations, not merely for the greater good of Marxist-Leninism, but for sound strategic purposes. The Soviets' space programme is essentially military in nature.<br/>
I hope that the lack of a manned element in Europe's space programme will shortly be remedied through Hermes and HOTOL. It was a shame that Squadron Leader Nigel Wood, who was to have been the payload specialist for the launch of Skynet 4, has had to return to the United Kingdom following the decision to launch Skynet 4 on Ariane. We want an independent European manned space programme, not just that European astronauts should fly on the shuttle, as was done by the German payload specialist for Spacelab, or the French astronaut Chretian with the Soviets. We need an indigenous, autonomous, European manned space programme. Secondly, we must develop the full potential of space technology for our European defence.<br/>
The Federal German Minister for Defence, Manfred W&#x00F6;rner, has been at the forefront of efforts to push the European members of NATO towards the development of a European strategic defence initiative. Lieutenant General Jim Abrahamson was in this country yesterday on his way to Brussels in an attempt to goad the Europeans into a more active participation in the strategic defence initiative&#x2014;and rightly so in my judgment.<br/>
In no area is European participation more important than in the development of short-range systems to protect Europe from the growing threat of SS21, SS22 and SS23 ballistic missiles situated in the western military districts of the Soviet Union and in Czechoslovakia and East Germany, against which at present there is no defence. The current negotiations &#x2014; on intermediate range and strategic nuclear arms reductions&#x2014; do not cover these weapons.<br/>
As part of the European input to the strategic defence initiative, I hope that we will do all that we can to play as full a part as possible in the development of these short-range, defensive, anti-ballistic missile systems which, in this exposed and much threatened continent, we badly need.<br/>
In conclusion, I see the need for an expanding European space programme with an enlarged British participation. It could be a major engine for economic growth and above all for the development of new high technology industries. To their credit, the Government have made significant steps in the right direction but their commitment in financial terms has not matched their good sense in political judgment.<br/>
If Roy Gibson's national space programme is approved, we are likely to see a doubling of the British space commitment which runs to the tune of some &#x00A3;100 million at present. However, we spend &#x00A3;40,000 million on social security. A lot of the money goes straight down the drain. If we compare that prodigious expenditure with the paltry amount which we invest in space&#x2014;the technology of mankind's future&#x2014;we can see the lack of proportion in our expenditure priorities. I commend the amendment and I hope that the Government will do more in the area of space technology to create an enlarged and more effective European space programme.</p>

<p>I am glad that we have selected this topic for debate. It is natural that the topics raised reflect a wide range of interests, and these have ranged wider than the terms of the motion. Nevertheless, we have heard interesting comments from hon. Members on both sides of the House.<br/>
It is interesting that we are talking not simply with hindsight. The present position was predicted some time ago. I have always been impressed by the comments of the French Liberal, Servan-Schreiber, who, in his book, "The American Challenge", which was written almost 20 years ago, described what would happen if we were to follow the path that we have followed in the intervening 20 years. He remarked at the time:
<q>If Europe really wishes to escape American domination, there is only the way of federalism and social justice.</q>
He went on to state:
<q>If Europe is not to be defeated in this battle of computer manufacturing, it must unify its efforts under a single command.</q>
The high technology industries are a perfect example of the problems that we face in endeavouring to compete fairly on an international scale. Supplies within our industries are dominated by huge United States corporations backed by the extraterritorial application of United States export laws, mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown). In some cases, there have been questionable trading practices. It is extremely difficult for smaller United Kingdom companies to challenge this market domination. It is not impossible for them to do so on the basis of a lack of imagination or technical knowledge. In a sense, the Americans wish to restrict and constrict the market for our companies because of the excellence of some British innovations. If it had not been for the fact that some American-based companies were fearful of what would happen if there were fair competition with the United Kingdom, I doubt whether they would have wanted to exert the pressure that they have on British companies.<br/>
The Minister commented on the Systime problem, which we raised in an Adjournment debate in February. I received a response from the Minister of State yesterday, and my colleagues and I are carefully considering our response to it. Under the United States Freedom of Information Act&#x2014;their system is somewhat better than ours because it enables us to obtain material on these matters &#x2014; we have received copies of the documents involved in the recent case in which Systime was fined a substantial amount of money by the United States Department of Commerce.<br/>
When I received those documents, I was interested to see, contrary to what I had fondly imagined, that the case against Systime was not against the United States subsidiary of Systime UK but was directly against Systime Computers Limited of Millshaw park, Leeds 11. It is astonishing that the American Department of Commerce &#x2014;the documents are available and clearly state this&#x2014;should seek to impose its legal jurisdiction on a United Kingdom company in that way. As I understand the law, if Systime wanted, it could have refused to take part in any conduct of that case. It could have walked away and claimed that the department had no jurisdiction over that company.<br/>
As the Minister made clear in his opening remarks, the problem is that if companies do not believe that the Government will defend them against such extraterritorial intervention, there is no way that a company can hope to survive without submitting. Unless a company can continue to receive supplies, it cannot trade. Companies do not have the cash flow or resources to enable them to

carry out a long battle with American companies. Therefore, rather than fighting under such circumstances, they can do nothing but give in.<br/>
The Minister wondered whether companies wanted to go on to a blacklist. It is astonishing that the Government accept that there could be a blacklist for our companies. I accept that that is the reality, but throughout this debate we have asked what the Government will do to make such a blacklist ineffective. We know that such a blacklist will exist and we know of the existence of export denials of companies that export in this country. We know that that happens and that efforts are made to continue that process.<br/>
The American Government will continue to push against the door to open it as wide as possible to affect our industry. Will the British Government try to close that door? At present, we believe that the United States Department of Commerce is pushing against an open door. That increases interference week by week, month by month. The Minister also questioned whether it was better for a company to be consulted to discover whether it wanted to take part in a process of the Americans examining its accounts rather than taking part in the licensing process. The Minister appears to be prepared to allow commercial companies to decide whether sovereignty is waived. It is astonishing that a Conservative Government, who pride themselves on a belief in sovereignty, could allow such a discussion to take place.<br/>
There is far more freedom for smaller companies to contest against larger companies in the United States than there is for United Kingdom companies to defend themselves in this country against United States companies. Emulex, which trades in this country but which is American-based, has managed to win concessions out of DEC in the United States which it could not possibly have won had it fought under United Kingdom law from this country.<br/>
The Minister has asked for examples of such cases and I noted his stricture to my hon. Friend the Member for Yeovil about confidentiality and anonymity. It is no wonder that companies are not anxious to have their names broadcast when they are worried about future restrictions on supply. On that basis, I can quote an example, but, as we are in the real world, I dare not give the name of the company. A letter that I received on 22 April states:
<q>All our activities are approached with full support of the Board of Trade and with all necessary UK Export Licences, but now we find ourselves in the crazy situation where our activities are illegal with regard to the American Government. To give you an example, we took an order from a Singaporian customer for &#x00A3;500,000 worth of computer system which we had put together using American components: this was in November of last year. We got the UK Export Licence within seven days, and at the same time applied to the Department of Commerce in Washington on the infamous ITA699P Permission to Re-export Application'. Our customer had been approved by the Singaporian Government, and yet we are still waiting for the US Licence to be approved. As a business decision we shipped the order, and as a result we have won follow-on orders from this customer.</q>
That is a United Kingdom high technology business that has fought its way in an overseas market. It said that to make sure that it was able to fulfil that order and get repeat orders, it had to ship illegally according to the United States Government. That is unacceptable.<br/>
Are we being anti-American by raising such points? If any of us are concerned about our relationship with the


Americans and the development of our relationship not only on a governmental level but between our different peoples, it is important that we warn our American friends and allies when we feel that they are doing things that are harmful to that relationship. It is no friend or ally who sees the Americans heading towards greater bitterness and distress from what they are doing in this country without warning them that that is happening. That is why it is crucial that we debate the matter today before it goes further.<br/>
In view of what was written 20 years ago and what we have said on numerous occasions in the House and outside, I believe that unless there is a united European market, and unless there is united European co-operation on those matters, there is no way that we can stand up to the Americans' desire to involve themselves in our market for the sake of maintaining their own economy. I believe that the United States economy is in deep distress. It has cumulative problems, and it seeks to maintain the American dream by looking at other places where it can develop. Unless we in Europe are prepared to say that we have a strong, powerful and effective industry and that we have resources that the Americans might want to use, it will be impossible to prevent the blacklist and the extraterritorial export rules. This is all about being able to compete fairly. That is all that the customers, the clients and the companies with which we have been involved wish, but we do not see the British Government standing up for their rights.</p>

<p>One of the Opposition's consistent themes is that our information technology industry is doing badly. They say that it is doing badly simply because there is not enough Government money to support it. It is true that some of the raw statistics show that the deficit in our IT products trade has been growing, although it has been stabilising recently. However, of course that deficit has grown, in the same way as the whole sector has grown. The IT deficit is also growing at a far faster rate in Europe and, indeed, in the United States, which went into deficit on its IT products a couple of years ago. Looking at the raw statistics hides the fact that in many areas of our information technology and electronics industries we are doing exceedingly well. Where companies are making good quality products and taking the trouble to go out into the world, and go to Japan and sell them, they are prospering.<br/>
The Opposition claim that the Government have no strategy m information technology. Let us have a quick look at what the Opposition's strategy is. Their policies rely on two major pillars &#x2014; more money and more Government control and intervention. The Opposition spokesman, the hon. Member for Coventry, North-West (Mr. Robinson), looked to the French as an example of successful intervention in industry. He could not have chosen a more disastrous example if he had tried. In the 1950s, the 1960s, the 1970s and the 1980s the French Government poured billions of francs into the French electronics industry. In the mid-1960s under de Gaulle they encouraged the merger of CII and Bull, and later they brought in Honeywell as well. That was a disaster. When the Communist-Socialist coalition came into power in 1981 the Government nationalised the French electronics industry and encouraged the merger of Thomson Alcatel

and CGE. At the time they promised that employment in the French electronics industry would double. In fact, it has fallen by 25 per cent. and the French electronics industry is in a disastrous state. What is more, it is costing the French taxpayer billions of francs every year.<br/>
However, we do not have to look across the water. We can look at the policies of the Labour Government when they were in power in the 1970s. They tried the old interventionist, dirigiste themes. We had the National Enterprise Board. One of its favourite companies was one called Nexos, which has recently been the subject of an investigation by the Public Accounts Committee. Nexos was meant to he Britain's answer to IBM. With Government support, the politicians and the civil servants were going to create a British IBM. What happened? Nexos went bust a few years later, having cost the taxpayer &#x00A3;40 million. During its brief reign it succeeded in importing vast quantities of Japanese office equipment. It managed to import more Japanese facsimile machines in one year than could be sold in the whole of the market. When the company finally went bust it still had on its books 1,000 of those Japanese facsimile machines. The British Technology Group, which took over from the NEB, had to sell those machines, which had been bought for more than &#x00A3;1 million, for &#x00A3;1&#x2014;not &#x00A3;1 each, but &#x00A3;1.</p>

<p>I apologise. I cannot give way as time is short.<br/>
I attended the debate in the House a few years ago on technology, in which many Opposition Members praised INMOS, which is another of the NEB's creations. At that time INMOS was riding on the crest of one of the biggest booms that the electronics and microchip industry has ever seen. Obviously, it was doing well then. Since then, unfortunately, it has sunk into great losses. Although many people admire its transputer products and other products, the fact is that, unfortunately, it is not doing very well in selling those products on the world market.<br/>
What is Labour's new policy? Its new policy for the 1980s and 1990s, should a Labour Government be elected, involves renationalisation of British Telecom. What a pathetic, backward-looking policy. Our privatisation of British Telecom has been one of the most successful policies ever carried out by a Government in this country. It has meant not only that the workers in that company have a share in the company, but consumers have a better deal and the Government are getting more money from the company. The fact is that under Labour, when the General Post Office ran the telecommunications system, if one wanted to buy anything from the telecommunications side, and if one wanted an interview with a sales representative, it was almost like trying to get an interview with the Pope. It was almost impossible to get anything. Businesses had to bribe telecommunications engineers to get the essential equipment that they wanted into their companies.<br/>
If those policies are implemented in the late 1980s and the 1990s, we shall have the same results as those policies produced in the 1970s. We shall have a vast waste of public money and demoralisation of our industry because of the simple fact that Opposition Members, with their lack of business experience, have not learnt that politicians and civil servants simply cannot run private industry. It is as simple as that. They have not learnt that lesson.<br/>
Opposition Members say that the Government have no strategy for the information technology industry. They do


have a strategy. It relies on creating the conditions in which businesses can prosper. Our IT industry is no different from any other of our industries in that regard. It needs the same preconditions for its prosperity. It needs long-term pro-enterprise policies, stable prices, good industrial relations and quality in management, which is allowed to manage its company, and above all it needs profit. Of course, "profit" was a dirty word under the Labour Government. The countries that have done best in information technology&#x2014;the United States and Japan&#x2014;have followed those policies consistently for the past 30 or 40 years.<br/>
As we are all aware, Britain does not have an especially large market compared to the Japanese or the United States home markets. It is unfortunately true that we do not yet have a full internal market in Europe. Unfortunately, a number of non-tariff barriers in Europe prevent us from selling our equipment on the European market, especially the telecommunications market. In many ways, those tariffs are illogical. For example, tariffs on fully assembled computers or sub-assemblies are higher than tariffs on the imported components. Clearly, that is a disincentive for British manufacturers to get their goods assembled onshore. That is why companies such as Amstrad and Apricot have to get much of their equipment assembled offshore.<br/>
Time is running out. I believe that this Government have done more to encourage the IT industries than any previous Government. Their policies are forward-looking. If there is another Labour Government&#x2014;I hope that will never happen&#x2014;we shall be back with the stale old ideas and policies that have failed before in this country and abroad.</p>

<p>It is regrettable that the hon. Member for Amber Valley (Mr. Oppenheim) did not dwell more on the role of the subject of the debate, which he at last reached in his final sentences. I shall comment on one point made by the hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for Hertfordshire, South-West (Mr. Page) about British telecommunications. Clearly, that industry is central to the development of high technology and all industry. It is regrettable that the question of the renationalisation of British Telecom has been raised because of the Labour party's recent pronouncements and the decision of the court in Strasbourg as a result of the British Government's action.<br/>
The waiting list for telephone equipment and handsets was ended not by privatisation but by liberalisation and the introduction of competition. British Telecom might give better service to its customers, offer more competitive prices and be more efficient if there were even more competition than the Government allowed under the British Telecommunications Bill which was introduced to privatise telecommunications. Competition, not privatisation, has brought about better service for the consumer.<br/>
The debate has ranged widely between the constituency interests of the hon. Member for Greenock and Port Glasgow (Dr. Godman), who has apologised because he had to leave to go to his constituency, and the future of the space industry, which was raised by the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Wilkinson). I agreed with many of the remarks by the hon. Member for Ruislip-

Northwood about the development of the space industry. Unfortunately, he spoilt them by his references to spending on social security. He slightly over-egged the pudding. He ignored the small contribution&#x2014;2 per cent. &#x2014;that we are making to the European Space Agency. The development at Farnborough is excellent and I hope that it is built up and strengthened and will work in cooperation with the ESA. I hope, too, that British Aerospace's work with HOTOL is successful and can be integrated in or at least co-ordinated with the work in Europe.<br/>
The hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood did not mention the excellent work on satellites by British Aerospace. One of our major contributions on space has been through the work of British Aerospace and other companies on satellite technology. We have been involved in European as well as other rockets.<br/>
I wish to refer to the core of the motion and debate. Over a long period, my hon. Friends the Members for Leeds, West (Mr. Meadowcroft) and for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown) have vigorously pursued this issue. The House and the industry owe them a debt for the vigour with which they have pursued it. They have displayed their interest and knowledge of extraterritoriality&#x2014;United States law restricting British companies and high technology development in this country.<br/>
We are saying two things. First, the United Kingdom is doing badly in high technology. It cannot afford this impediment to progress of British companies in high technology. Secondly, it is unacceptable in principle that United States law should be used in the way described by the lawyers of the Crown as an unwarranted encroachment on our territory and contrary to international law. An analogy can be drawn with our battle with the United States over the imposition of unitary taxation. I was part of a delegation which recently went to make representations to the United States Government and Congress about that issue. Once again, United States law was used in a way that penalised British companies, outside all the conventions of international law, and operated basically on the basis of "might is right". We should be saying loudly and clearly that we are not prepared to accept that.<br/>
We are doing badly in high technology. I believe that all hon. Members will feel that the response by the Minister for Information Technology to my hon. Friend the Member for Yeovil was disappointing and displayed tremendous complacency in the light of the damage being done and the weaknesses of our high technology industries. The crude balance of trade for information technology has widened from a deficit of &#x00A3;468 million in 1979 to &#x00A3;2&#x00B7;4 billion in 1984 and &#x00A3;1&#x00B7;8 billion in 1985. For microelectronics, the trade deficit widened from &#x00A3;13 million in 1979 to &#x00A3;645 million in 1984 and &#x00A3;565 million in 1985.<br/>
We have dangerous levels of import penetration in a number of key respects. For example, it is 57 per cent. in electronic data processing, 67 per cent. in office machinery and 24 per cent. in radio/electronic capital goods. One could go on citing key aspects where the level of import penetration is disastrous for our industry.<br/>
An article in today's <i>Financial Times</i> estimates that 70 per cent. of the crucial European software market is dominated by the United States. The Government have not been able or prepared to take action to reverse that pattern.<br/>
The major subject of the motion is the unwarranted encroachment by United States law on our companies. It is intolerable &#x2014; I hope that the Minister will recognise this and reflect it in his language&#x2014;that businesses are being impeded by having to wait for up to three months for licences from the United States Department of Commerce. What is the Minister prepared to say&#x2014; he did not respond to my hon. Friend the Member for Yeovil &#x2014;about the United States preventing the Government from moving a computer from Harwell to London university? What will the Government do about that? Do they accept it? Are they prepared to tolerate it? What have the Government said about it to the United States?<br/>
Companies which are being impeded by this extraterritorial action would be given some hope if the Government were at least prepared to do more on their behalf. They are in an impossible position. I am afraid that one concluded on listening to the Minister that he was prepared, to allow companies to be put into a position in which they fundamentally have to give way to blackmail. They face the threat of being put on a blacklist, of losing business and of not being able to obtain and to export products if they do not accept the legislation of the United States Government. That is unacceptable.<br/>
Companies are not strong enough to take on the whole of the United States Administration. In many instances, they are not even strong enough to take on the bureaucracy and expense involved in going through that whole rigmarole. That is doing enormous damage. When the Minister replies, I hope that he will go much further than he did in his earlier remarks and give hope to companies that have been hit by this requirement of the United States that the British Government will fight in a way that we have not seen to date.<br/>
There is a well known, well recognised and possible way of resolving the problem with the United States. Everyone knows that the answer is to go through COCOM in Paris. There was no need to go down the road that the Government chose. That route was inappropriate and there is the possibility that relationships between the United Kingdom and the United States will be impeded and interrupted, but we must make it clear that we shall be a thorn in the side of the United States unless it is prepared to take action. That was the message that was taken to the White House and the United States treasury on unitary taxation. I hope that Ministers will make it clear to the Department of Commerce and Congress that good relations will be impeded unless the United States Administration is prepared to act.<br/>
The Minister has an opportunity this evening to give that message loud and clear to the United States Administration and to give hope to the companies that have been hit. He can make it clear that the Government will give them backing in fighting the requirement. We must demonstrate that might is not right and that we are not prepared to be blackmailed, whether the blackmail comes from individuals, from institutions or from a Government.</p>

<p>We have had the extensive and wide-ranging debate that was foreshadowed when it began. I am sure that alliance Members realised that it might range far. My hon. Friend the Member for Hertfordshire, South-West (Mr. Page) talked about the transformation of the performance of British Telecom and raised various matters concerning the Alvey programme. I can confirm that the user aspect will be emphasised when we come to examine the Bide report. My hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Wilkinson) talked about space, about which he knows a great deal. As I said to him in an earlier intervention, we await with interest the plan of the British National Space Centre, on which we shall take decisions in the near future.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Amber Valley (Mr. Oppenheim) correctly assessed by the less than entirely successful position in France caused by interventionist policies over the years. He reminded us of the considerable benefits and improvements in the performance of British Telecom. I have received a message from the hon. Member for Greenock and Port Glasgow (Dr. Godman) that he has had to leave the Chamber to return to his constituency. The matters that he raised about tax regimes for offshore oil companies, for example, are not for me. They will, however, be referred to the appropriate Department.<br/>
The hon. Member for Stockton, South (Mr. Wrigglesworth) was right when he said that it was not simply the creation of British Telecom that had produced improvements and a dramatic increase in performance. He omitted to say that liberalisation and competition are part and parcel of the same process. We cannot have liberalisation and competition unless we create something in the nature of British Telecom in the first place.<br/>
The hon. Member for Stockton, South referred to the excellent work on satellites that British Aerospace carries out. This reference was characteristic of the thoughtful speeches that the hon. Gentleman makes in the House.<br/>
The hon. Member for Coventry, North-West (Mr. Robinson) always gives me some problems. I make notes and address myself to his reasonable arguments, only to find that suddenly he changes gear and produces a stream of complete gibberish. That is one of his specialities. I prepared myself to respond to his question about whether we would delay taking a decision on the Bide committee's follow-on to the Alvey programme. The answer is that we shall not. We shall want to take a decision as quickly as possible once the Bide committee has reported in October. When I was making that note, the gibberish began. There was a series of rapidly uttered non sequiturs &#x2014; for example, the assertion that Westland is being sold to the United States. Such assertions make me wonder where the hon. Gentleman has been.<br/>
The hon. Member for Coventry, North-West spoke about France. It seems that he, like many others, thinks that everything that is done in France is marvellous. He said that France spends more as a percentage of its GDP on research and development than we do. In fact, France spends 2&#x00B7;1 per cent. of its GDP on research and development and not 3 per cent. as he claimed. We spend more as a percentage of GDP as our spending amounts to 2&#x00B7;3 per cent. The hon. Gentleman should concentrate a little more on getting his facts straight.<br/>
To be fair to the hon. Member for Coventry, North-West, he was the only Member to participate in the debate


who referred to the International Court of Justice and a juridical outcome. He was saying, in effect, "How about Her Majesty's Government taking the United States to the Court of Justice?" Further research would have told him that the United States has decided, on the basis of Nicaragua, I think, that it will not be party to any actions brought in the International Court of Justice unless it agrees that it will accept the jurisdiction. There is no point in anyone inside or outside the House wringing his hands about that. We accept that we are faced with a serious problem, and what I would call the juridical route is not open to us.<br/>
The hon. Member for Stockton, South listed various examples of import penetration and added that most of it involved the United States, without being prepared to say that that does not put us in a very strong position to take the crusading attitude that he would like us to adopt. He told us that, with others, he went to the White House and bearded the Congressmen in their den on Capital hill. That is great, and I applaud his efforts. If penetration of our market by the United States has reached the extent that he claims&#x2014; I do not refute any of his figures&#x2014;that does not put us in a very favourable position to take a strong line on behalf of British companies&#x2014;</p>

<p>The contract is with an American company. Even the hon. Gentleman, with his incredible stupidity, will realise that we must take account of a contract. What is the position if the United Kingdom Government or a university want to move a computer and the company which has supplied it says, "If you wish to move it, you will have to break down the computer and comply with the agreements that have been made."? We do not like that and we are having discussions with the United States Government. They are not taking place on the Floor of the House for the benefit of the hon. Gentleman or of anyone else. To suggest that nothing is being done is a travesty, and I want to take the hon. Gentleman to task. The Liberals and SDP have decided to base their case on what could have been a wide-ranging debate on a very important topic; they have decided instead to base it on a very narrow point, and have not proved their case.</p>

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. Last night I was rather disappointed that I sat here for the full three hours of the debate but was unable to catch your eye before the promoters of the Bill moved the closure. I make no complaint about that, but it leads me to think that it is possible that the promoters will seek to move the closure on this first group of amendments some time between now and 10 o'clock. I put it to you, and through you to the promoters, that it might be a little unusual if extra time were to be found for the Bill, in view of the very large amount of parliamentay time that has been consumed by it so far. If the closure were to be moved tonight, it would make it extremely difficult for the promoters to negotiate with those Opposition Members who are a little tired of the Felixstowe Dock and Railway Bill and wish to produce an agreed Bill that might come back to the House at a later stage.<br/>
It would be very difficult for the House if new clause 2 were to be defeated tonight as part of a deal with some Opposition Members. I put it to you that it might lead to better progress in the long term if the House did not rush to a speedy vote tonight and if an opportunity could be provided for further negotiations to take place.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend the Member for Ipswich (Mr. Weetch) has made a good point, because the fundamental purpose of the new clause is to subject to the authorisation of the Secretary of State for Transport reclamation works of a primary nature which might otherwise take place well in advance of the company's need to construct new berths under the powers in clause 6. Our point is that the company has been given powers to do some work, but that monitoring by the Secretary of State for Transport and his Department is not enough. As my hon. Friend the Member for Ipswich said, we need, in addition, the Secretary of State for the Environment. Clause 7 seeks to place a restraint on the deposit of any material of
<q>more than three years before the start of construction of the quay,</q>
or parts of the quay. We believe that three years is too long. Furthermore, valuable though it is to deal with peripheral dumping, clause 7 is full of weasel words. It requires the company to give notice to, but not obtain the authorisation of, the county and district councils which have legitimate local interests in the matter. We hope that clause 7 will receive support from both sides of the House tonight.<br/>
The powers sought by the company have a direct bearing on matters of more than local interest. They have an impact on several areas of national policy. Last night we heard much about the national importance of the development at Felixstowe docks. In Committee, we discussed national docks policy, national landscape conservation policy, in view of the adjacent area of outstanding natural beauty, and national nature conservation policy because of the damage that will be caused to a site of special scientific interest. The European


Commission will take an especial interest in that site because of the United Kingdom's legal responsibilities under the directive on the conservation of wild birds.</p>

<p>Those of us who served on the Committee on the Felixstowe Dock and Railway Bill, even for a relatively short time, were well acquainted with the arguments put forward by the environmentalists and had considerable sympathy with them.<br/>
Amendment No. 11 seeks to require the authority of the Secretary of State for the Environment for works which involve the enclosure and reclamation of the seabed, the river and its foreshore. I understand that it is a normal provision of port and harbour legislation for the authority of the accountable Secretary of State for Transport to be required for such works. Section 12 of the Felixstowe Dock and Railway Act 1968, entitled
<q>Tidal works not to he executed without approval of Board of Trade,</q>
does just that. That provision is expressly re-enacted in clause 10, and provides an additional safeguard for other persons whose navigational interests might be affected by such works.<br/>
But who is to provide safeguards for our wildlife? Hon. Members spend many hours legislating to protect property and user rights, but we too infrequently protect the rights of other creatures or the rights of citizens to enjoy them. We are considering an area that attracts birds, and which is a national asset. We are asked by the people who support the development to allow wide open powers to a private company which intends only, as we heard so often last night, to serve its own financial interests. In so doing it will destroy thousands of birds of all descriptions which come to Britain in winter from many parts of Europe, and from Iceland, Greenland and Canada.<br/>
In European Community terms the area is recognised as warranting special protection in law. If, against the arguments of Labour Members tonight, the Bill passes into law substantially unchanged, it will almost certainly run into difficulties with the Commission in Brussels. All too often the Government have got into difficulties with the European Court of Justice and have been brought before it on some issues more frequently than many other countries. If we run into those difficulties with the Commission, there will be no long-stop power in the hands of the Government to halt damaging reclamation activities

being carried out by the company while proceedings are taken against the United Kingdom in the European Court. As Department of the Environment Ministers must answer charges which undoubtedly, if the Bill proceeds, will be laid against the United Kingdom&#x2014;not simply in court but in the Council of Ministers&#x2014;it is appropriate that long-stop powers should be placed in their hands. Our amendments seek to do that.</p>

<p>I rise to support the new clause and amendments. If I thought that this Bill would lead to the construction of a new dock within the next 12 or 18 months which would in turn create many new jobs, I should be happy for it to be enacted. But there is no evidence that it will create new jobs. The best that the promoters can claim is that it will create new jobs in Britain at the expense of jobs in Europe. Others say that it will take jobs away from Britain. Whatever the case, I can see no evidence for the Bill creating new jobs.<br/>
Until I have some evidence that the Bill will create new jobs, I can see no justification for a proposal that will damage the natural environment. We all have a responsibility to try to balance protecting the environment with the need to develop jobs and industries. I have always thought that we have a duty to try to leave the environment in as good a state as we inherited it from previous generations.</p>

<p>I thought that the hon. Gentleman had listened, like me, to last night's debate. It was forcefully pointed out then that the different types of environment are important. It is worth protecting these mudflats, because they attract certain types of birds. Trees may be attractive in certain places, but they will not provide a suitable environment for those birds. On occasion, I have severe reservations about the number of trees that are planted. Some of the Forestry Commission's areas do not enhance our natural environment at all. If there is to he a new development, let us screen it and make it as attractive as possible, but that does not mean that we would be improving the environment. We would merely be trying to screen the damage from others.<br/>
As I have said, genuine new jobs would he one thing. However, I understand that the promoters claim only that they are trying to take jobs away from Rotterdam or from other European ports, so we are not creating new jobs but merely moving unemployment around&#x2014;</p>

<p>One can say that we are moving unemployment around, or the reverse of that, which is that we are moving employment around. The promoters argue that the development will take jobs away from Europe and give jobs to Felixstowe. But we rightly argue that it will take jobs away from Tilbury and elsewhere. No one has said that jobs will be created. There is a tendency for products to be smaller in size, so the number and size of items is falling.

<p>Does my hon. Friend realise that the port of Ipswich will be an early casualty of that dock extension? Before the Bill began its passage, I had detailed discussions


with the trade unions and management at the port of Ipswich, and they are very worried about the employment consequences for Ipswich. The Bill would bring excess dock capacity to East Anglia, which would mean that dog would eat dog, and the port of Ipswich could become a ghost port in 15 or 20 years.</p>

<p>I was trying to talk about the new clause and the amendments, but in passing I wanted to point out that I would have been sympathetic to the Bill if it had created new jobs. My hon. Friend the Member for Ipswich (Mr. Weetch) has just pointed out that it is likely to take jobs away from Ipswich. That brings me to the new clause, because we now come to the environmental argument. If new jobs were going to be created, it might be worth sacrificing some of the environment. But that is not so, so there can be no excuse for sacrificing wetland areas and mudflats.<br/>
Sadly, dock developments have been allowed along the east coast of England and Scotland, and habitats have been destroyed. Recently, proposals came before the House that would affect Seal sands in the Tees and Hartlepool dockland area. Opposition Members resisted those proposals, but there was a great disappointment. Indeed, a much stronger case could be made for creating jobs in Middlesbrough or Hartlepool than for creating them in Felixstowe, but with the support of Conservative Members and with the encouragement of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, we fought hard to protect those wetlands. Substantial parts of the same sort of wetlands have gone for docks at Hull and Immingham, and all the ports round the Wash have gradually gone for reclamation schemes.<br/>
Therefore, there have already been many demands to take away the natural habitat of birds that use those estuarial areas. The same sort of habitat has also been lost along the Thames. A lot of work has been done to enclose land round the Solent in preparation for developments that have not taken place. There were proposals to extend that work, thus affecting&#x2014;</p>

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I seek your advice on a matter of importance to the House and of relevance to the new clause. It has been raised with you previously, but having thought about the issue, I realise that we are placed in a special difficulty. It is on record in the minutes of the Committee that the Secretary of State for the Environment said that there were certain detailed conditions which were relevant to the site under discussion. He then added that only proven national interests and a lack of alternative sites could justify any exception from what he said in 1982, in support of a site of natural beauty.<br/>
From my experience in the House I know that, technically, I am not quite in order. But a voice has to be heard and courtesies have to be established so that the Chair can consider the point that the House is in a weak

position, because we cannot challenge a Minister from the Department of the Environment. That is an important point, and I hope that the Under-Secretary of State for Transport will consider it. But I thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, for hearing me, as I know that I am technically not quite in order.</p>

<p>That was a very interesting point of order. Those of us who served on Committees under the guidance of my hon. Friend the Member for Hartlepool (Mr. Leadbitter) would have been pleased to get away with one like that.<br/>
We have lost a lot of similar estuarial land along the coast to port authorities that have every intention of developing it for extra port facilities. On many occasions, having carried out the reclamation, they have found that the economic circumstances have changed or that their future plans were too grandiose and they have not gone on to develop the dock or put the containers on to the site. They have stopped halfway through the process. Therefore, we have lost the natural environment but have not gained any jobs or docks.</p>

<p>I have read clause 16.<br/>
The current proposal is that the company will carry out reclamation on the basis that, within three years, it will continue the development. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will accept that in three years all sorts of circumstances will change. I am not casting any aspersions on the integrity of the Tees and Hartlepool dock authority or the dock authorities at Immingham, Yarmouth, Tilbury, Southampton or Falmouth. All the people involved in those docks genuinely believed when they reclaimed land that they would be able to expand their port facilities and attract new jobs. All I am saying is that the evidence is that it is not as easy as that.<br/>
Unfortunately, at Southampton a considerable amount of the estuary was reclaimed with every good intention, but at present the land has not been used for dockland. It is logical, having enclosed the land at Southampton and taken it away from the birds, to let that harbour develop rather than run the risk of taking away more land at Felixstowe, with a question mark over whether the development will take place.<br/>
The new clause is to ensure that the company has to satisfy the Secretary of State that within a year it will go ahead with the development. That is a reasonable test of sincerity. I accept that even within a year circumstances may change. However, at least there is a reasonable possibility that the development will take place. Of course, there is always the risk that the reclamation will go ahead and that at the end of that period there is a financial crisis within the country or the company or a change of circumstances which leads the company to decide that it will not go ahead with the rest of the development.<br/>
The new clause says that to allow that risk over 12 months may be reasonable, but to allow it over three years is a little unreasonable. I would not be particularly happy about a development that took jobs away from other ports


but I am sure that I should be very unhappy about reclamation taking place and then, at the end of two or three years, the company announcing that it could not go ahead with. the development.</p>

<p>It would follow, in the purely hypothetical circumstances that the hon.

<p>I am not certain about that. Unfortunately, I am not a specialist in biology, so I cannot say whether the particular species of birds that use the mudflats at present will find the alternative proposals at Trimley marshes as attractive. I am certain that other birds will find it as attractive and I am also certain that some birds will find the trees attractive. However, the area was designated as a site of special scientific interest because of particular wading birds. The problem we face on the east coast is that it is that type of environment which is continually being taken for dock development or development associated with it. If the circumstances I described had occurred and the alternative land and trees had been provided, we may have had some environmental gains. However, if the land has been reclaimed and the jobs do not materialise and the dock does not develop, we have lost an environment which is at present attractive to the particular groups of migratory birds that use it.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend, with some modesty, says that he is not an expert, although he is well known for his expertise in these matters. It may help if I quote the advice of the Nature Conservancy Council, which is the Government's official adviser on things natural. In its comments on this proposal, referring in particular to grey and ringed plover and turnstone it says that it has
<q>advised the Department of the Environment that there are no sites on the Orwell estuary with features comparable to those at Fagbury Flats and that the passage of this Bill would prejudice Britain's international obligations towards nature conservation.</q>
Although my hon. Friend may not be able to reassure the House, I hope that the House will be reassured by the Nature Conservancy Council which, as the nation's guardian of the environment, feels that the flats are irreplaceable.</p>

<p>I thank my hon. Friend. It certainly makes the case and answers the points made. Even if we got all the things that the company is saying it would provide for the environment, welcome as they are, they would not solve the problem of the area that is being lost.<br/>
My concern is that, once the land has been reclaimed, it cannot be restored as mudflats. Therefore, one suspects that if at some point the company is not sure whether it should go ahead, as the Bill stands it will go ahead and reclaim the land. At the moment the company has only to take the view that it would be reasonable to develop the docks within three years. At the end of those three years there is no way in which the House or anyone else can compel the company to go ahead and develop the dock if it decides that circumstances have changed. It can come

back to the House to ask for a variation in the legislation and there is nothing that we can do in legislation to stop the company coming back.<br/>
The company can go ahead, reclaim the land, provide the environmental amenities it has promised and, if it decides not to go ahead with the development, it can stop. The company can then leave the reclaimed land, as much other reclaimed land along the east coast of Britain has been left, in an almost semi-derelict state. It may attract other birds and animals but not those that have been displaced. The company can then let the matter rest for several years before deciding to go ahead with the development.<br/>
The company can decide that, because of the change in trade, perhaps brought about by the Channel tunnel, that it will never want to go ahead with the development. What would the company do'? It would have a piece of reclaimed land on which it had spent a considerable sum of money, so it would have to look for ways to get the money back. The temptation is to use the land for some other purpose, such as a light industrial development or something else. It may be that the company would have to come to the House to get new legislation or it may be that it decides it has to go to the county council and apologise for taking the land, saying, "We know that it was of special scientific interest; however, at the time we had every intention of going ahead but, sadly, we were unable to. It would be a pity if we lost our money and it would be a pity for the local community to lose jobs. Let us use the land for some other purpose." That is the risk at the moment. If the company can say that it has every intention of going ahead within three years, it can do so, knowing that, if having reclaimed the land it becomes uneconomic to go ahead with the development, it can come to the House or go to the planning authority with a proposal to use the land for some other purpose.<br/>
The House would not have dreamt of allowing the company to reclaim this sort of marshland if it was to be used for light industrial purposes. The House would have insisted that there were lots of other sites within Felixstowe or East Anglia to use for that purpose. All we are seeking with the new clause is a safeguard so that there is a high probability that the land will be used for the purpose that the promoters are putting forward rather than a risk that, because of the passage of time, the very good intentions of the promoters will be thwarted by economic circumstances.</p>

<p>It is not a guarantee of like for like. One is taking away something which was prized in Europe&#x2014;the wetlands area&#x2014;and one is giving people something else in return. People are not objecting to this attractive alternative but it is an alternative; it is not a replacement, and that is the problem.<br/>
I am certainly not complaining because the promoters are offering something else, but they are not offering back the same environment. My hon. Friend the Member for South Shields (Dr. Clark) read out an article which made


the point that something else is being offered in exchange for the land. I can think of many cases when I would like to have traded an environmental improvement in one place for some damage elsewhere, but that does not justify the damage. We must have a certainty that the damage is absolutely necessary. So far I have not had that proof. No one has been able to convince me that the development will create new jobs. I have grave doubts that, over three years, circumstances will remain exactly the same to enable the promoters to carry through their undertaking, given in the Bill, to develop the area.<br/>
There are many uncertainties, especially concerning what will happen to ports policy in this country as a result of the possible building of a Channel tunnel. The future is difficult to forecast, and the Government are reluctant to predict the changes. Southampton is upset about the Channel tunnel, but what will be the reaction in Dover? If harbour activities are reduced at Dover because of the tunnel there will be tremendous pressure in Dover to try to grab some of the container work. Nothing would be more logical than for ships to put in at Dover, offload and bring containers into Britain. The containers could then go back through the tunnel to Europe. It is certain that Dover will fight for that work. Will shippers be encouraged to come to Britain or will they be encouraged to go to French ports and send goods through the tunnel? The future is extremely difficult to predict.</p>

<p>I am very interested in what my hon. Friend says about the capacity of our existing ports to handle existing cargo. He may be interested to know that the port of Dover, both in volume and value terms, shifts more cargo than the port of Felixstowe.

<p>The reason we want the consent of the Secretary of State is to have as near certainty as possible that if the reclamation is allowed to go ahead the docks will follow.<br/>
As the Bill stands, the reclamation will start on the basis that the company believes that, over three years, it is likely to go ahead with the dock development. I am trying to demonstrate to the House that, for all sorts of reasons. and whatever the company's good faith, that certainty cannot exist, because of the great doubt about the fixed link and the doubts over the attitude of other ports which may decide that is worth dropping their prices. Dover, which will see much of its work disappear, will try very hard to take on container work.<br/>
At the moment, approval will be given for the work to start, the reclamation will go ahead and land will be lost to the environment and the birds. In the end, the company may decide that it cannot go ahead with the proposal. We wish to ensure that the company will go ahead. When it wishes to start the reclamation it must make its case to the Secretary of State for the Environment. The Secretary of State must be satisfied that, within 12 months, the

company would be ready to continue with the remainder of the construction. That appears to be an eminently reasonable proposal. If the promoters are attempting to resist this new clause, there must be some doubt in their minds as to whether they really want to go ahead with this development. There may be some doubt that, having undertaken the reclamation, they will place the port facilities and container berths on that site.<br/>
That brings us back to the other possibility &#x2014; that once they have the land they will decide to use it for some other purpose. Along the whole of the east coast there is land which was reclaimed&#x2014;in most cases in good faith &#x2014;for dock development but which is sadly unused and is no longer a good natural environment for waders and other birds.<br/>
One of the other amendments in this group requires the approval of Ministers when changes are proposed to the channels along the estuary. At present, we have the odd situation of competing measures for the enclosure of the water in the estruary. A competing measure has been put forward by the promoters of the Bill to enlarge the docks at Harwich. I understand that the question of working out tidal flows in river estuaries is extremely complicated and complex. Although models can be made in water tanks it is difficult to predict what will happen to the natural environment. If a dock is constructed on the Harwich side of the river and the Felixstowe enclosure is taking place on the north side of the river, the interests of those two developments could be in some conflict.<br/>
Both the projects wish to spend the minimum on retaining the navigable channels which would allow ships to pass up as far as Ipswich. Each Bill implies that the changes it will carry out will not alter navigation but that the other Bill will. The Minister's approval should be sought to guarantee that the implications of any changes to navigational channels which may occur as a result of this Bill will not adversely affect the ships which go up the river to Ipswich.<br/>
Once one starts to change navigation channels, one affects much wider areas of the mudflats. If the entrance to the river is narrowed it may start a scouring effect and damage much larger areas of the mudflats than those attacked directly by the Bill. It would be reasonable to call in the good offices of Ministers to arbitrate on the claims of the dock companies as opposed to the requirments of other users of the river, both for recreational purposes and as an attractive area for birds and other animals.<br/>
We should support new clause 2, the other amendments which pave the way for that and the further amendment which deals with the estuarine matters. I can see no reason why the promoters should not accept the new clause. If they want to demonstrate their good faith and confidence that they can carry out the development, I can see no reason for them not to accept it. If they insist on trying to persuade us not to accept the new clause, I can only suggest that it is because they do not have the confidence, like so many of my hon. Friends, that there is a demand for extra port facilities along the east coast or anywhere in Britain, or, for that matter, anywhere within western Europe, and they are interested in the possibility of enclosing the land if the development goes only halfway and then returning with another Bill with a suggestion that the land should be used for other purposes. Therefore, I hope that the House will support new clause 2.</p>

<p>I would not want to question the Chair's selection, nor was I talking about new clause 2. I was talking about amendment No. 10.<br/>
However, on new clause 2 and amendment No. 11 I have to say that the effect of the Bill would be to give Parliament's permission, which is, after all, the highest authority in the land, to the plans for this development.<br/>
If Parliament gives its approval, the Government believe that a requirement for the further consent of the Secretary of State for the Environment is not only unnecessary but creates ad hoc control by the Secretary of State which we would not favour. A well-established procedure is involved here by which Parliament is giving detailed consent.<br/>
My point is fairly minor: that we believe that the Secretary of State should not further intervene in the process which Parliament has approved. That is the only comment that the Government have to make on these amendments and why we would not favour them.</p>

<p>Let me take up the point with which the Minister left us because in a sense it is at the core of the thinking behind this group of amendments and the new clause. As I understood it, the Minister was basically arguing that new clause 2 was not applicable because if the Bill had gone through the necessary stages of Parliament, Parliament would have so decided and therefore it was not necessary for the Minister to be consulted.<br/>
In the debate yesterday it became clear that if the Bill becomes law, it will override the wider Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 as that appertains to sites of special scientific interest. Therefore, this Bill affects the overall judgment of the major Wildlife and Countryside Act of Britain. In that sense, an additional safeguard, which is only a time safeguard &#x2014; essentially that is what new clause 2 and the subsequent amendments are about&#x2014;is well justified.<br/>
New clause 2 relates to clause 7 which places a constraint on the types of operation and works which can be undertaken by the company.<br/>
Before I develop that point, let me return to the problem which seems to be causing a great deal of difficulty for some hon. Members and which is one of the reasons why we feel that new clause 2 is necessary. That involves the issue of the site of special scientific interest which will be affected, and, indeed, destroyed by the Bill. I do not think that any hon. Member would deny that. The only point of difference is that those who support the Bill say that the site will be destroyed, but it will be improved because 500,000 trees will be planted. It is worth making the point, crucial to new clause 2, that the site was declared to be of special scientific interest because of the estuary, the wetlands, and the bird population which, at certain critical times of the year, occupies those mudflats.<br/>
We do not really understand all the meanderings and wandering of birds. We cannot understand the migratory


patterns of swallows or wintering birds. It is a finely tuned operation. It is quite clear that if we remove the wintering area of some of those birds, we threaten the species. It is as serious as that. I use the poignant example of Duich Moss. The reason why the EEC is threatening the British Government over Duich Moss is that, if that area, where about 8,000 to 10,000 white-fronted Greenland geese are present over the bad months, is excluded, it is quite likely that the whole species will disappear. I am not arguing that that will apply directly in this case, because it is not as critical as that. What we suggest in new clause 2 is a limitation of time which will allow the birds to continue wintering in certain respects.</p>

<p>I respect the hon. Gentleman's sincerity, as I hope he does mine. It is not fair to describe the alternative as the 500,000 trees. About 176 acres of arable land in the Trimley marshes will be converted to grazing marsh &#x2014; that is, part wetlands. The hon. Gentleman should be aware that the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds has said:
<q>with suitable management, such as that practised by ourselves in Elmley in Kent and elsewhere, it would be possible to create a worthwhile reserve on these Trimley marshes that would probably attract birds in nationally significant numbers.</q>
The hon. Gentleman and I have considered the RSPB's letter. The RSPB is specific that the development would create a reserve able to
<q>attract birds in nationally significant numbers.</q>
That is the important point.</p>

<p>I wish, in a sense, that the hon. Gentleman has not raised that point, for the simple reason that I had not intended to quote from the letter from the RSPB. Quite rightly and fairly, he quoted from the letter yesterday and today. What he said was absolutely correct. It is important to note that the RSPB&#x2014;I know that the hon. Gentleman will check it&#x2014;went on to say:
<q>We have considered this most carefully and have decided that we cannot restrict ourselves in this matter.</q>
The RSPB said that it would
<q>not withdraw its opposition and voluntarily enter into a `compromise' over the future of an internationally important SSSI".</q>
Additional land will be set aside. Hopefully, that will satisfy some, if not all, of the birds. However, we do not know that. I think that we all agree that it is a jump into the unknown. One can understand the RSPB, in a back-up or fallback position, writing in the way that is has about Trimley marshes. Let us not deceive ourselves. The RSPB still opposes the Bill. It has made that clear to me in a telephone message today, and by sending me a copy of the letter that the hon. Gentleman and I discussed earlier.<br/>
New clause 2 tries to restrict the time in which the operations of the company can be carried out. It has been drawn up carefully by my hon. Friends and me. We took as a model the now defunct Tees and Hartlepool Port Authority Bill which contained a similar clause. We believe that the clause is apposite to Parliament and is legally correct. The new clause would require the Secretary of State for Transport to give his consent for certain works involving reclamation. If the House permits the Bill to pass as reported from the Committee, we believe that it will allow the company to meddle in important matters of national and international policy. The key point is that the area is not only an SSSI. It is further designated as not only

grade 1 status but supergrade status by being declared under EEC directive 79/409. That gives the area further status.<br/>
We believe that if a private company interferes in issues which are nationally and internationally important, it is wise for Parliament and for the Government to have as much restraint upon the company as possible. Therefore, when we deal with a site, such as an SSSI, and if it is to be disposed of, the final decision must remain with the Minister. That is what the new clause provides. We have given the matter considerable thought. We thought that perhaps the Minister should be the Secretary of State for the Environment, but we felt it was right that it should be the main Minister&#x2014;the Secretary of State for Transport.<br/>
If hon. Members agree to the new clause &#x2014; I wish that the promoters felt able to agree to it; it does not restrict them too much &#x2014; it may prevent the death of literally thousands of birds if major reclamation works are started and not completed. One might justify that if the economic expansion and industrial operation had got under way, providing jobs and employment. There is no guarantee of that. The new clause would try to restrict the development work within a time constraint. That would be a sensible move.<br/>
The consequential amendments, Nos. 8 to 12, develop that further. We envisage the construction of a quay frontage along the lines intended by the company, but we would not allow the reclamation of the whole of Fagbury flats and the salt marshes immediately. In reality, we take a step-by-step approach. The amendments and the new clause require that. The company would have to justify every stage of development. We realise that the company has commercial interest to protect, and we acknowledge that, and we suggest that we concede powers to construct berthage, hard standing for cranes and the temporary storage of containers &#x2014; in other words, the works and the facilities necessary for the ongoing construction.<br/>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett) has suggested, the development could be constructed on an island site rotated at the outer limits of the bay. That would allow the gradual development of the site to take place with the minimum threat to the wildlife. It would exclude the company from reclaiming a substantial area of mudflats and salt marsh on the landward side of the quay.<br/>
We suggest the island site because that could be constructed in such a way as to maintain the tidal flow in a partly contained bay of Fagbury flats. The whole venture would be constructed to try to restrain as large a part of the mudflats system as possible, because that is the area that is regarded as the most valuable when it comes to the bird feeding area. We believe that that could be achieved quite easily.<br/>
We submit that neither the company nor the Committee, when it reported on the Bill&#x2014;we accept all its good endeavours &#x2014; made any serious attempt to consider a port development which tries to retain, as far as possible, the necessary wildlife interests in the area. By tabling new clause 2 and the amendments, we have attempted to combine, as much as possible, what may appear to be diverse activities and to build in a kind of linkage system so that each stage of the development would not take place until there was an absolute necessity for it. By so doing, we would have the maximum impact


on the protection of the environment and the wildlife that lives on it For those reasons, we have tabled new clause 2 and the amendments.</p>

<p>I hope that the House will follow the advice of my hon. Friend the Minister who spoke neutrally when he pointed out that new clause 2 would wreck the Bill. That is the intention of the Opposition and particularly of the hon. Member for Ipswich (Mr. Weetch), who has never made any bones about it. 1 was surprised to hear him in one of his many interjections earlier suggesting that if this Bill were passed, in 20 years' time Ipswich would be a ghost port. That is the sort of exaggerated language that should have no serious place in such discussions.<br/>

Ipswich is an important, well managed, municipal port and complements the ports of Felixstowe and Harwich. It is one of a complex of ports in those estuaries which service not only eastern England. but, increasingly, the whole of our trade. There is an efficient division of labour between the group of ports. The growth of Felixstowe assists the growth of Ipswich. One port benefits the other.</p>

<p>I do not regard the hon. Gentleman's remarks as being entirely a private row between him and my hon. Friend the Member for Ipswich (Mr. Weetch). The hon. Gentleman talked about a general division of labour between the ports. I do not understand what he means by that. Tilbury, for example, is an extremely important container dock and will be adversely affected by the development of a large new container berth at Felixstowe. Therefore, I cannot see what the hon. Gentleman is talking about when he speaks of a division of labour between the ports.</p>

<p>If the hon. Lady had listened a little more attentively, she would have realised that I was dealing with the prediction that Ipswich would become a ghost port. I was saying that that was a hopelessly exaggerated statement which had no place in a serious discussion such as this.<br/>
These amendments are primarily directed to the reclamation of land. It is important to keep the matter in some perspective. The shoreline of the River Orwell where the development is to take place is 22 miles long. The proposed extension of the port area is about half a mile of that shoreline, which is 2&#x00B7;5 per cent. of the entire area. Therefore, the development cannot be described as an environmental catastrophe, which was the language used by the hon. Member for Ipswich. Some 97&#x00B7;5 per cent. of the shoreline will remain completely untouched.<br/>
Obviously, I regret any intrusion into an area of outstanding natural beauty. Indeed, I had some part in establishing those areas. However, I must remind the House that of that 151 square miles of outstanding natural beauty in Suffolk, one third of one square mile will be covered by the port extension. I am advised that that is just under 0&#x00B7;25 of 1 per cent. That puts the matter into some perspective.</p>

<p>Has the hon. Gentleman considered the promotion of earlier Bills, in relation to the

docks at Felixstowe? Does he accept that the argument is always that only a little piece of land will be taken, and that in the end all the extra pieces build up to the destruction of the whole environment?</p>

<p>I understand the piecemeal argument, but if the hon. Gentleman will study the Bill he will see that it provides a guarantee against the further movement of the port upriver. The promoters inserted that specifically to deal with the anxiety that he has raised.<br/>
I came across the problem of bird life when I sat on the Front Bench, taking the Maplin measure through the House. It was extraordinary how much time we spent on Brent geese. I am worried about the bird life, but it is to the credit of the promoters of the Bill that when the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds intervened, they immediately financed 75 per cent. of the cost of an extensive bird survey &#x2014; the best that has been done in the area. The survey was carried out by the Suffolk Trust for Nature Conservation. I hope that the hon. Member for South Shields (Dr. Clark) will accept that the trust is an entirely objective and deeply concerned body.<br/>
The report showed that the dock extension was in an area that was certainly important for three of the 30 species of birds to be found there. Therefore, we are talking about a small fraction of the bird population. Moreover, the count showed a considerable migration of birds in the Orwell and Stour rivers area. That has strengthened the view that development would displace a relatively small number of birds and would not disrupt the ecological balance of the estuary as a whole.<br/>
I must accept that any development such as this requires a balance. It would be absurd to suggest that there is no environmental impact, because obviously there is. However, one must balance that against the replacement of that lost proportion of land by alternatives. One of the alternatives, which I have already suggested in an intervention, is that a substantial area will be changed from arable land into grazing marsh. That will assist the bird life in the area. A great deal more assistance will be provided by flooding areas that are not now regularly flooded. The combination of the trees, the grazing marsh and the prevention of further movement up the estuary adds up to an enhancement of the total environment. Judged as a whole, there are gains and losses, but there is no environmental catastrophe of the sort forecast by the hon. Member for Ipswich.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman has made a fair point that the ecology and environment of the area will he changed, and, rightly, talks about the flooded areas and marshes. However, it is not merely the ecology that could be changed, it is the ecology of those three bird species that is at risk. I think that they are the grey and ringed plover and the turnstone, which are rare birds. The marshes are of no particular use to them and are much more suited to


Brent geese and other species. The key point is that we must consider not only the ecology of the area, but the existence of the three rare species of bird.</p>

<p>I respect the hon. Gentleman's concern in the matter and he will understand that my concern is no less than his. I remain of the view expressed by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, that with suitable management&#x2014;all reserves need that these days &#x2014;it would be possible to create a worthwhile reserve on Trimley marshes which would probably attract birds in nationally significant numbers. It is a matter of balance, but I do not believe that that balance was remotely accurately described by the hon. Member for Ipswich, when he described the proposal as an environmental catastrophe. That is an absurd exaggeration and he knows it.<br/>
New clause 2 would wreck the Bill because clause 6 is the essence of this development. Clause 6 confers powers on the docks company to construct the proposed works. Clause 14(1) provides that those powers may be exercisable for a period of 10 years from the passage of the Bill or for such extended period as the Secretary of State may allow.<br/>
The effect of new clause 2 would be to restrict the docks company's powers to construct the works by requiring the company to obtain the consent in writing of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State before the company can exercise any of the powers where land reclamation was involved. Since the entire development requires land reclamation, that would mean that the Secretary of State and his civil servants would have to give their consent to every item of contruction or development that was required.<br/>
The docks company may have every confidence in my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State taking a sensible and objective view of these matters. I am delighted to see the Minister of State, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food &#x2014; my right hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer)&#x2014; sitting on the Front Bench. He represents the area where these developments are to take place. It was only because my right hon. Friend has many duties to perform in Brussels &#x2014; which he performs so well&#x2014;that he was unable to present during our prolonged debate last night. However, I am sure that my right hon. Friend will agree that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State would take a sensible view in that case.<br/>
Having listened to the language of Opposition Members and the interventions by the hon. Member for South Shields, I would not be surprised if a developer or customer of the port of Felixstowe, at home or abroad, believed that a Secretary of State of a Labour persuasion would take a biased and prejudiced view of the development of Felixstowe. The Opposition have demonstrated perfectly clearly &#x2014; yesterday and today&#x2014;that they would use the new clause to wreck the Bill if they were in office. That is a good reason why we should reject the new clause.<br/>
Amendments Nos. 6, 8, 9 and 10, with which new clause 2 is grouped, would produce an absurd position. If passed, they would reduce the area over which the new works could be constructed by removing any power to reclaim land. I am advised that that could be the effect of the

amendments. Since the works cannot be constructed without reclaiming and that is an essential feature of the work, the result of carrying the amendments would be to make it impossible to proceed. The amendments are simply nonsense.<br/>
Amendment No. 11 would also require the docks company to obtain the consent of the Secretary of State before any work could be carried out &#x2014; the same approach as that under new clause 2. In effect, that means that the company would be put into the leading strings of the Department of Transport. It would effectively make the company a branch of the Civil Service and tie it hand and foot to whatever view was prevailing on the items of contruction and reclamation involved in the work. The House would not sensibly wish to tie the hands of any private developer in that fashion. Worst of all, the amendment would effectively put the decision of the House into commission. Notwithstanding the view of the House &#x2014; I remind the House of the overwhelming majority on Second Reading&#x2014;</p>

He seeks to deny us the opportunity to compete more effectively for that trade of the future.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman seeks to prevent the jobs being created in Felixstowe and in his own constituency of Ipswich. In so doing he flies in the face of the stated wishes of the Transport and General Workers Union. Brendan Lambe, the regional secretary, has said time and again that that union wishes the Bill to proceed. The hon. Gentleman seeks to deny to that union the jobs that its members wish.</p>

The hon. Member for Ipswich further seeks to deny to that part of East Anglia the new investment that will enable us to improve our infrastructure. He is giving the lie to his party leader's frequent demand for more investment and more jobs. Here is more investment and here are more jobs. Here is a chance for us to be more competitive. I should have thought that a Labour party that brags about its desire to reduce employment and to create more jobs would have welcomed the Bill, instead of which the hon.

<p>The House might show considerable interest in the manner, approach and vigour of the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Sir E.

I have an interest in ports as a constituency Member, and I have had some experience of such legislation, so I believe that the House should be wondering at the excitement, the aggravation and the charges that the hon. Gentleman is making. I wonder whether it is connected with the relationship that may exist between the Felixstowe docks authority and the

Conservative party. I do not know. I have heard suggestions that that company contributes large sums to Conservative party funds. Of course, I do not know. 1 am merely wondering why the hon. Gentleman is behaving in the way that he is.</p>

I want to put things in such a manner as to test the House, by asking a simple question. Where does truth really lie'? Who is shifting whose feet'? On the Opposition Benches, it is impossible for us to be charged in that respect, because this is not our Bill.

<p>The hon. Gentleman says that he is representing the communities in question. I take it that he would suppose that the local authorities of the area in question would be representative.

<p>The hon. Member for Hartlepool who, for the hon. Gentleman's information, happens to be the person holding the Floor at the moment, never suggested that he represented the communities in Suffolk. I said that I had a port interest. It so happens to be the third largest port in the United Kingdom&#x2014;the Tees and Hartlepool port authority. I was saying that I had had some experience of such legislation as is now before us. I emphasise that in point of fact the hon. Gentleman's attitude raised self-evident questions in the minds of reasonable hon. Members on both sides of the House. But I said that I did not know. I am told that there is a relationship. I am told that there is a funding relationship. I am told that that has not been rebutted. The hon. Gentleman is not in a position to rebut it, either.<br/>
The only point that I am making in a debate as serious as this is that where there is genuine opposition to the proposals, the House must be concerned. In addition, we still do not have a Minister from the Department of the Environment. The hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds apparently has no port interest in the sense that his whole time in the House of Commons is concerned with two things. The first is his proper responsibility as the Member of Parliament for Bury St. Edmunds. The second is that he is a paid officer representing the police.</p>

<p>I apologise.<br/>
The hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds said in his intervention that Suffolk county council was not an objector. It so happens that Suffolk county council, not unlike some other county councils, changed its mind when pressure was put on it. Originally, it objected, as far as I


am aware. The proposals are in direct conflict with the county council's structure plan, which was approved by the Secretary of State for the Environment in August 1979. It is interesting that there has been that movement in the county council from a position that was agreed to by the Secretary of State.<br/>
I now come to a matter that fascinates me. The hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds described the position thus: the proposal involves only half a mile in a shoreline of 22 miles. Experience suggests to me that, once there is an incursion into land which has been designated for a particular purpose &#x2014; in this case, in the words of the Secretary of State for the Environment &#x2014; that is a precedent for further incursions. The nibbling process continues after that first weakness of changing one's mind about the designation.<br/>
The hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds referred to the half mile out of the 22-mile shoreline to show the minimum impact of these proposals on the area, but he was not even correct in that respect. The Bill's sponsors sent out a memorandum which stated:
<q>The extension area is about one third of a square mile"&#x2014;</q>
that is a bit of a difference&#x2014;
<q>and comprises a relatively small south-eastern corner of a strip of roughly 150 square miles.</q>
Notice the trick&#x2014;only a square mile, which is a linear measure, compared with a square measure. The innocent who reads the document may think that not much land is really affected because it refers to a minimum amount of land, as shown by the linear measurement, along the coastline.<br/>
9 pm<br/>
The sponsors are not content with that. After all, they think that hon. Members are rather innocent. The memorandum continued:
<q>The extension area therefore is about 0.25 per cent. of the area of natural beauty and comprises about 90 acres of poor &#x2014; that is, heavy clay &#x2014; low lying, level, agricultural land separated by a clay wall from an area of roughly 140 acres comprising a small area of salt marsh and creeks and a larger area of mud flats which are only exposed at low tide.</q>
That is all to tell us that we are making noises about an exceedingly small area and land of exceptionally poor quality.<br/>
On 29 July 1982 the Secretary of State for the Environment said:
<q>in general,"&#x2014; referring to this land&#x2014; "it would be inconsistent with the aims of designation to permit the siting of major industrial and commercial development in AONBs. Only proven natural interest and lack of alternative sites can justify any exception" &#x2014; [<i>Official Report,</i> 29 July 1982; Vol. 28, c. 708.]</q>
Why was there a change of heart within such a short period? I spent some days looking up evidence which might be helpful to the House, and to me, so that I might address myself fairly to the substance of clause 6. Part of my exercise involved considering the 23 sittings of the Committee. I noticed something strange but understandable. The Felixstowe port authority appeared to be bringing before the Committee witnesses who had a special relationship with it&#x2014;they were either on friendly terms, were directly related to trading within the port or had

shipping and other agency interests. One such person was Mr. George Patrick Gardiner who was sworn in on 5 December 1985. He agreed that he was
<q>a director of a number of companies concerned with transport matters and transport facilities".</q>
Further questioning brought out the fact that he had a much closer relationship with the company doing the main business in representing shipowners in the United Kingdom, sometimes but most specifically at Felixstowe. I was fascinated with that use of witnesses.<br/>
When Mr. Gardiner was cross-examined, Mr. Whybrow, representing the petitioners, said:
<q>You said last that it was essential for Felixstowe to continue to expand. Would you be prepared to accept the qualification to that expression of opinion, 'Unless suitable alternative facilities are available'?</q>
The witness replied:
<q>Yes. In the context of the national interest, of course".</q>
He was further asked:
<q>And you have already agreed with Mr. Fatchett that there are potentials in other sites, Bath Side I think?</q>
The answer was:
<q>Yes.</q>
That is a fascinating observation.<br/>
The Secretary of State for the Environment laid down two conditions. First, there was the national interest; secondly, there were alternative sites. Those were the two conditions that had to be met before there could be an alteration of the designation. The witness to whom I have referred is a man of considerable experience and authority. He appeared before the Committee purportedly to assist in upholding the proposals set out in the Bill, but under cross-examination from the petitioners he admitted that other sites were available for the development that the docks authority had in mind. Once that has been made abundantly clear, the House must draw back from the emotive expressions of concern that we have heard lately and ask itself where the truth really lies.<br/>
The Conservative Administration made certain things abundantly clear. They stated that there were only two exceptions that would prevent an intrusion. One was the national interest and the other was the lack of alternative sites.<br/>
What were the three main reasons for the Bill and the proposed works? It is rather surprising that only three proposals in principle and in purpose were outlined in Committee by Mr. Ryan, QC. He said that the first reason for needing the land and for having works on it was that of international trade. He claimed that the facility was required for major shipping lines in the container business. The second reason was the justified expectation of a substantial increase in trade. We did not have any figures&#x2014;</p>

<p>Order. I am finding it difficult to relate the hon. Gentleman's remarks to the new clause and the amendments that are before the House. We are dealing with whether the consent of the Secretary of State should be required for certain works. We cannot go over the arguments that were advanced in Committee; nor can we have another Second Reading debate. The hon. Gentleman's remarks must be related to the new clause and the amendments that are grouped with it.</p>

<speech hansard_id="429808" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1986-07-15a.938.1" hansard_membership_id="8101" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/17116" speakername="Mr. Leadbitter" colnum="938" time="20:45:00">
<p>I understand, Mr. Deputy Speaker, the difficulty in which the Chair finds itself. The first two lines of the new clause read:
<q>The Company shall not exercise the powers conferred by section 6"&#x2014;</q>


I must refer, therefore, to section 6&#x2014;
<q>of this Act without first obtaining the consent in writing of the Secretary of State in any case".</q>
The difference between section 6 and the wording of new clause 2 is that the section provides that the work outlined shall he allowed to proceed without the Secretary of State's permission. New clause 2 seeks to have the Secretary of State's permission attached to the same works. That being so, I must apologise to the House for finding it necessary from time to time to refer to the objectives and purposes that were outlined in Committee in the use of the designated area and the works that are outlined in section 6.<br/>
It was argued that the works should go ahead because of a justifiable expectation of a substantial increase in trade. I have seen no figures to support that expectation of trade. There are many imponderables, not the least of which is the Channel tunnel proposal. There are no projected statistics that make it clear that the designation of the land in question should be impinged upon in the interests of urgency or essential need.<br/>
The final reason that Mr. Ryan gave in his submission to the Committee was that the proposal was in the national interest. Therefore, this half mile of land, as it was described by the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds, or two thirds of a mile of land, as it was described by the Felixstowe harbour authority, apparently has become of national importance and interest. How can that be when it is agreed that there are sites available on the east coast and on the south coast? How can that be when there are areas already designated for industrial development at Port Harwich? Where does the truth lie?<br/>
There is clearly on the Conservative Benches a commitment to support the Bill, because the Bill is there and because it has come from a Committee set up to consider opposed private Bills. Conservative Members are not saying clearly why they turn their backs on their own assurances to that area and to the people in it. The land was designated for a particular purpose and accorded that designation by the Secretary of State, yet they say that it does not matter. If it does not matter now, am I to understand that, when the Secretary of State made the designation in 1979 and his statement in 1982, it did not matter then?<br/>
How can responsibility accrue to the House of Commons if hon. Members are conveniently going to forget their responsibilities and obligations to a community after firm commitments have been given? How can we test the House of Commons if Conservative Members are shy and coy about declaring the extent of their party interest? If the undertaking that was given does not matter now, and the Bill is essential for a small piece of land in the national interest, then we have to say that the Minister and the Secretary of State did not mean what they said in 1982 and in 1979.<br/>
Here is a situation of power and influence overriding the parliamentary protection of the people whom we represent. That is what it is&#x2014;overriding roughshod and horse trading. How many hon. Members when the Bill is passed will sit in the dining room congratulating each other on how Parliament was used in this way, with the Opposition virtually neutralised?</p>

Private Bills should be channelled through the House so that proper opposition can be expressed with the ability to challenge the exercise of responsibility of Ministers who are answerable to the nation.

My hon. Friend the Member for Ipswich (Mr. Weetch) is a modest man.

The council had every confidence that my hon. Friend the Member for Ipswich would put the case against the Bill as well as a whole army of lawyers. Of course, the ratepayers of Ipswich have benefited greatly because my hon.

we deal with these matters. It was open to the borough council of Ipswich to petition against the Bill. It elected not to do so. When the county council decided to withdraw all further opposition, the borough council of Ipswich could, if it had wished, have tried to introduce a petition. It decided not to do so.

<p>I am very glad to have that clear message from my hon. Friend the Member for South Shields (Dr. Clark). It confirms the view that I had formed.<br/>
I have not devoted a vast amount of time to the Bill, because the arguments that were advanced on Second Reading were sufficiently powerful to convince Her Majesty's Government about the proper and responsible role and attitude that they should have adopted. I regret that the Government have been pressurised&#x2014;no doubt by the regional interests&#x2014;to take a view. That is quite wrong, and it is an example of very serious misjudgment. I shall turn in a moment to that statement and to the reason for the importance of the amendment.<br/>
The evidence presented on Second Reading justifies the amendment. It demonstrated that the port is unnecessary. As my hon. Friend the Member for Hartlepool (Mr. Leadbitter) pointed out, Britain has adequate port facilities. The Government are pursuing a dreadful and inaccurate obsession. Britain is a mercantile country. At one time it had a great merchant fleet. The General Council of British Shipping used to be the biggest financial contributor to the Conservative party, but it is so busy developing ports that it seems to be paying no attention to the fact that the British merchant fleet is disappearing&#x2014;</p>

<p>I shall not pursue that point. All I am trying to suggest is that the amendment would provide Ministers with an opportunity to reflect upon realities of this kind.<br/>
My major reason for involvement in this debate is that I am chairman of the Council of Europe's environment committee and that I have been acting as chairman and rapporteur on matters relating to the natural environment for a very long time. For the last few years I have been able to do so on a non-partisan basis. Conservative Members who serve on my committee have always agreed with the line that I have taken. That was certainly true in April of this year when I took the Committee through a report on the implementation of the Berne convention.<br/>
Throughout this period of five or six years, Conservative and Labour Members have sought on the Council of Europe&#x2014;the leading international body on conservation matters &#x2014; to try to ensure that Britain's leadership on conservation is maintained. I hope that the Department of Transport and the Department of the Environment will take note of the fact that, if we do not confer upon the Secretary of State the power that is contained in this amendment, our international position will be gravely embarrassed. Many other countries have copied the United Kingdom's example. If the other signatories of the Ramsar convention on wetlands see Britain going headlong into retreat in the face of the Ramsar commitment, they will do the same.<br/>
On Second Reading, Conservative Members said that this was an area of unimportant, valueless and uninteresting mudflats. Conservative Members appear to have learnt a little during the proceedings on the Bill, because of the efforts of my hon. Friend the Member for Ipswich. They now recognise that this is an area of both national and international importance. It would be remarkably injurious, not merely to the ecology of the Suffolk coast but to international integrity and to the example that our country should continue to set, for this project to go ahead. If the amendment is accepted, it should be borne in mind by Ministers that this port development was demonstrated by the RSPB study to be utterly unnecessary.<br/>
That is a particular cause of offence no doubt to those in Suffolk and certainly in the rest of this country, who are concerned that we should fulfil our international commitments. If we do not fulfil our international commitments to conservation, it will be little use hon. Members saying what should happen in other parts of the world. That is the nub of the argument, and as I have said, I do not want to speak for too long.<br/>
I urge Ministers to recognise that the voice of constituency interest should not necessarily be paramount. Ministers from the Suffolk region may feel that they can dictate Government policy but no wise Administration would ever set such a precedent. The views and advice of Ministers from that locality should be discounted as a matter of principle; that is particularly true when national and international interests are before us. If the Minister allows the national interest to be subordinated to the commercial interest that Conservative Members so ably serve, he will be acting in a very damaging way. One of the most important wetlands in western Europe will be destroyed or imperilled. Moreover, if he allows that to happen, it will greatly embarrass the significance of Britain's international conservation lobby.</p>

<p>I had not intended to speak in this debate, but, having listened to the remarks of the hon. Member for Hartlepool (Mr. Leadbitter), I felt that I had to comment. He asked where the truth lies. Well, it certainly does not lie in the distortions that we have heard from Opposition Members.</p>

<p>I should like to finish my point. I listened to the hon. Gentleman's speech with some attention. But aspersions have been cast on me and other Conservative Members, if not by name by implication. If the truth lies anywhere, it lies in the 23 sittings that took place when only two of us, as the original members of that Committee, listened to every word of evidence put before us. I am prepared to be told that we are wrong, but I am not prepared to told that I was subjected to influences that in any way affected my judgment of the facts put before me. I bitterly resent some of the statements made tonight, last night and in Committee.<br/>
The hon. Member for Hartlepool talked about the neutralising of the opposition, but the opposition neutralised itself by refusing to serve on the Committee. The Committee had to have its quorum reduced to two in order for the Bill to proceed in the way that the House had determined. It is important to say these things. The onus on the promoters was to deal with the statement of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State in 1982. That was all that they had to do. I say that, but it was a major task, because they had to prove that an incursion was being made into an area of outstanding natural beauty and into a site of special scientific interest that was in the national interest, and that there were no suitable alternative sites. That is what they had to do, and we thought that that is what they achieved.<br/>
As I said, there were 23 sittings of the Committee. We heard witnesses on behalf of the promoters. If the hon. Member for Hartlepool is somehow suggesting that the promoters should not bring forward witnesses to testify to their case, I wonder what he feels they should bring witnesses forward to do. He, as an experienced Chairman, knows full well that the private Bill procedure is quasi-judicial and that the witnesses who come before us are on oath. Therefore, in the course of examination and cross-examination there are statements which conflict from time to time. However, extracting one statement here or there and having no regard to the vast weight of the evidence of the witness is the sort of distortion I was referring to.</p>

<p>I suggested to the House that there were two major conditions laid down by the Secretary of State. One was national interest and the other was the lack of alternative sites. My submission is that in the 23 sittings of the Committee the national interest was not made out and it was substantially proven that there were alternative sites. That was my point.</p>

<p>That may well have been the hon. Gentleman's point. However, in seeking to make that point he introduced other factors. I am sure that he will understand why I took such grave exception to them. I reiterate all that I have said. I merely wanted to put it on record.<br/>
I share the view of my hon. Friend the Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Sir E. Griffiths) that the new clause, which would destroy the Bill, does nothing to circumvent the Secretary of State's powers in this matter. It is for the House to decide having gone through the proper procedures.<br/>
I cannot see that the clause will do anything other than destroy a Bill which was given massive support on Second Reading, which has been the subject of lengthy deliberations in Committee and which is now properly on Report. In the interests of all that we have done so far, the new clause should be rejected.</p>

<p>I seek to intervene for two reasons. I thought that the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Sir E. Griffiths) cast a serious slur on my hon. Friend the Member for Ipswich (Mr. Weetch), on Opposition Members and many Labour councils up and down the country. I also feel it important to intervene because there seem to be fundamental planning implications in this legislation. I noticed, as no doubt you and the House did, Mr. Deputy Speaker, that we had a fleeting visit from the Under-Secretary of State for the Environment. Alas, it was too short because many Opposition Members are concerned about the environmental and planning implications of the Bill.<br/>
My first point relates to the remarks which the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds made about m) hon. Friend the Member for Ipswich and about the Labour party, represented in different parts of the country. He was, in effect, saying that the main reason why my hon. Friend the Member for Ipswich, myself and others were opposed to the Bill was that we were opposed to industrial and commercial development. At least, that was my understanding of what he was saying. He then went on to suggest that the Labour party, or a future Labour Government, would do everything possible to prevent such development and therefore allow the persistence of unemployment in areas such as Felixstowe and other parts of the country.<br/>
That is pretty ripe coming from a Member of the Conservative party supporting a Government who have caused the present massive unemployment. It is even riper when one considers the magnificent record of the Ipswich borough council, the Greater London Enterprise Board, the West Midlands Enterprise Board, and m) own


borough council, to name just a few Labour authorities, which have played a major part, in spite of the Government's economic and employment policies, in bringing jobs to their areas.</p>

<p>I am grateful to you, Mr. Deputy Speaker; that was precisely what I proposed to do.<br/>
You may be aware, Mr. Deputy Speaker, that in the previous Labour Government I occupied the position in the Department of the Environment which is currently occupied by the hon. Member for Mitcham and Morden (Mrs. Rumbold). A number of planning decisions came my way on appeal. I am taking part in this debate because I am seriously concerned by the general principle that the planning power as laid down in the Town and Country Planning Act 1971 should be derogated and that the situation should arise whereby the Secretary of State for the Environment appears to have no say about the forms of development which may take place, anything up to 10 years after the Bill becomes law.<br/>
The amendment which has interested my hon. Friends and myself is amendment No. 11 which proposes to insert
<q>and subject to the consent in writing of the Secretary of State for the Environment.".</q>
That is absolutely vital. In clause 14 there is considerable derogation under the provisions of the Town and Country Planning General Development Order 1977 which will allow a development to take place at any time over the next 10 years without any intervention from the Secretary of State for the Environment.<br/>
I began my preamble in the way that I did because decisions of this kind are inevitably extremely difficult. My hon. Friends and I are very concerned about the environmental development in and around Felixstowe and the effect that it would have on bird life. Those arguments have to be balanced against developmental arguments. The hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds clearly believes that these outweigh the environmental argument.</p>

<p>I am quite sure that it is, as the Committee reported, in the national interest that this development should go forward. I am certain that any economic development has an impact on the environment. On Second Reading, I said that I could not support the Bill unless it contained an environmental enhancement as well as an economic development. The balance between the two is the result of the Committee's work and the negotiations between the promoters and the petitioners. We have achieved a balance that enhances the environment and also achieves the substantial economic expansion of the port.</p>

<p>I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his intervention. I do not know how he knows such things. How does he know what will happen in the future? Let us take a parallel case which is of great concern in my area of London.<br/>
Under the Local Government Planning and Land Act 1980 the Government introduced legislation&#x2014;late in the

Committee stage&#x2014;to make possible the development of enterprise zones. This measure was passed into law and the assumption behind it was that it would enable small businesses to develop with the minimum of interference.<br/>
One enterprise zone was set up on the Isle of Dogs. An enormous international combine has come along and wants to build a vast office complex on the Isle of Dogs &#x2014;Canary wharf. I am told by the Secretary of State for the Environment that he has no power to intervene. That is why I am disturbed by attempts to derogate from powers contained in town and country planning legislation, thereby removing from the Secretary of State any power over future developments.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman has only to re-read clause 6 which gives the promoters enormous powers over the future development of the land in question. One of the consequences of one piece of development may be that it would have a serious impact upon the bird life there. My hon. Friend the Member for Wentworth (Mr. Hardy) is an expert on bird life and knows a great deal about the way in which they react to environmental changes. But how do we know how migrating birds will be affected and whether they will cease to come to Britain or perhaps die as a consequence of any development that may take place?<br/>
That kind of thing needs to be monitored, and that is why I am strongly in favour of amendment No. 11. That is vital in the Bill in order that the national interest should continue to be protected over a period of development or redevelopment, as is contained in clause 6, which may take place som years hence. The right way for such things to be considered is through the planning procedures that are now a vital part of the protection of Britain's environment. For that reason, I give my full support to this vital amendment.</p>

<p>I wish to say a few brief words in support of new clause 2, but I really want to address some remarks across the range of the first group of amendments. Let me cut through a great deal of what I wanted to say because it has already been said and at this late stage in the debate it is better for me to come to the brass tacks of what new clause 2 is about. Its centrepiece is contained in subsection (2)<i>(a),</i> <i>(b)</i> and <i>(c).</i><br/>
At the beginning, my hon. Friends and I took close professional advice on the new clause. In no sense was it put forward to wreck the Bill. We have taken a great deal of trouble over the amendments and they are as thoughtful as we could make them. My hon. Friends and I have not flooded the Order Paper with amendments, as we could have done. We have a small number of groups of amendments which we wanted to make as thoughtful as possible.<br/>
I shall not respond to all the flak that has come in my direction because I want to deal with the meat of the new clause which I thought, among other things, would help the environmental purposes of the Bill which, at the end of the day, is what we set out to do.<br/>
Sub-paragraph (2) says:
<q>The Secretary of State shall give his consent under this Section in any case where he is reasonably satisfied that&#x2014;
<ol>
<li><i>(a)</i> further development of the land which is to be reclaimed will be commenced not later than one year after the date on which the works of reclamation have been substantially completed".</li>
</ol></q>
That means that we want to keep within a reasonable time limit because there are many uncertainties in the growth


of traffic and there are many complexities in considerations of this kind. We want to be sure that if land is reclaimed and developed it is needed. Once this wildlife facility is destroyed, it is destroyed for ever and paragraph <i>(a)</i> was put in to try to help the environmental cause of the Bill.<br/>
I should have thought that paragraph <i>(b)</i> could have been accepted by the promoters without any arguement. One of the conditions is outlined in paragraph <i>(b)</i> which states:
<q>no reasonable alternative site for that further development is available on other land within the area of jurisdiction of the Company".</q>
In other words, the company should look carefully before damaging the wildlife irrevocably. It should see whether any other land is available. That is a simple proposition. I should have thought that it was a valuable part of the new clause. Paragraph <i>(c)</i> reads:
<q>the area of land to be reclaimed is no greater than that which is reasonably required to accommodate that further development</q>
That point sprung directly from the Committee's evidence that I read carefully. One of the principal things in dock economics that is becoming a marked feature of dock development all over the country is that with modern equipment, dock work requires a smaller space. If space is to he an integral part of dock economics, I should have thought that that part of the new clause would have appealed to the promoters.<br/>
Subsection (4) reads:
<q>A consent given under this Section shall come into force as soon as it is given and shall remain in force for a period of one year for for such longer period as may be specified by the Secretary of State when he gives his consent".</q>
In other words, we are talking about a reasonable time scale in the whole of the development. My hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett) made the point &#x2014; he made it much better than me&#x2014;that we are saying, quite emphatically&#x2014;we have taken a good deal of professional advice on the new clause; it is the principle of the group of amendments &#x2014; that while the Bill provides authority and power to make work and to do certain things, it is by no means the end of the matter. We believe that any development that takes place should be thought about carefully and should be supervised on environmental grounds so that we can engage in the process of environmental damage limitation. Even though the Felixstowe Dock and Railway Company has permission to do certain things, the amendments try to establish a framework of safeguards to say that it should do so in a certain way in order that the process can be monitored.<br/>
9.45 pm<br/>
For the life of me, I cannot see that that is a wrecking proposition. I have been accused of trying to wreck the Bill when, frankly, all I have tried to do is to avail myself of my constitutional rights to scrutinise what the company is doing. If at the end of the day I am accused of trying to wreck the whole measure, as far as I am aware, I have not spoken out of order. I have stuck to the point. I am trying to make the points that are directly relevant to to the amendments.<br/>
The new clause requires the consent of the Secretary of State before certain works can be undertaken. I hope that officers from the Department of the Environment are here in spirit if not in person. Perhaps the Department is rather like the Phantom of the Opera. I want to bring out a

number of points on which I genuinely need guidance on environmental grounds. The new clause relates to clause 6 of the Bill which gives the company authority and power to make work under subsection (2), to which our new clause relates. It gives the company power to
<q>reconstruct, renew, alter, replace or relay the work and may maintain the same as reconstructed. renewed, altered, replaced or relaid.</q>
Clause 7 relates to the deposition of spoil material in connection with land reclamation. I shall not develop the point because it has already been dealt with.<br/>
The Secretary of State for Transport is required to give consent to certain works containing reclamation, but not all. In addition, the provision does not apply to works which are not works of land reclamation, landscaping works, peripheral reclamation or deposit materials of any kind, although we argue that some of the amendments will damage wildlife in the areas to be reclaimed.<br/>
The purpose of the new clause is to provide certain safeguards for wildlife in the interests of international and national conservation. Unless the reclamation takes place in closely monitored conditions, we shall lose some of these facilities for ever more. The new clause seeks to ensure that that should not happen needlessly.<br/>
The evidence states that the development will mean "legalised concrete". I have not come across that phrase before, but I could not find a better description in the evidence if I tried. Together with all the hack-up and buildings which go with quay and related development, the Secretary of State must have powers of permission and control to see that any development is carried out in as thoughtful a way as possible. That is in accord with our other amendments, to which I shall speak shortly.<br/>
I refer the House to the evidence of Dr. Michael Edward Moser, the national estuarial officer for the British Trust for Ornithology, given on Wednesday 26 February. He was a most distinguished witness and one can quote from almost any part of the conservation evidence. Dr. Moser examined the significance of the Orwell estuary and, within the estuarial area, the significance of Fagbury flats as a feeding and roosting area for wader and wild fowl populations. All the information was scientifically gathered from a birds of estuaries inquiry based on monthly bird counts on fixed dates which has been continuing since 1969. I am advised that all such counts are made at high water and with great thoroughness and industry.<br/>
I would not emphasise the point but for the tone adopted by the Felixstowe Dock and Railway Company and underlined by the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Sir E. Griffiths)&#x2014;that, since only a small proportion of the estuary will be affected, it does not matter. The heart is only a small proportion of the body, so, purely on size and area, its critical function is completely underestimated. All the evidence given to the Committee showed that that small area was absolutely critical.<br/>
We are making our case in the light of the dismissive attitude to the new clause. It is necessary to have these procedural safeguards over the company's actions, although overall permission is given in clause 8 for the power of work to he exercised for reclamation.<br/>
Some points need to be cleared up and I shall ask some questions because I am genuinely seeking information on one or two matters. I am holding a letter from the Nature Conservancy Council which relates to the Orwell estuary


and notification under section 28 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. The letter sets out the responsibilities to the developer. In paragraph 4 it states:
<q>You are required to give written notice to the Nature Conservancy Council (directed to the Assistant Regional Officer), of your intention to carry out any listed operation and you may not proceed with the work unless:
<ol>
<li><i>(a)</i> the operation is carried out with the written consent of the Nature Conservancy Council;</li>
<li><i>(b)</i> it is carried out in accordance with a management agreement under section 16 of the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949 or section 15 of the Countryside Act 1968 or</li>
<li><i>(c)</i> three months have expired since the Nature Conservancy Council received notice of your proposal to carry out the work".</li>
</ol></q>
I understand that that point is in dispute by the promoters of the Bill. If the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds would listen to me, I would like him to clarify that point. I am genuinely seeking information on these points.<br/>
The letter from the Nature Conservancy Council contains an appendix headed
<q>Operations requiring prior consultation with the Nature Conservancy Council.</q>
There must be certain forms of notification before development can take place. In that appendix, 13<i>(b)</i> states that there must be notification of
<q>Modification of the structure of watercourses, [e.g. rivers and drains], including their banks and beds, as by realignment, regrading and dredging.</q>
Appendix 17 refers to reclamation of land from
<q>the sea, estuary or marsh.</q>
As I understand matters from the original letter, the developer is required to give written notice to the Nature Conservancy Council. I understand from the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds that that point is disputed by the company. If that is so, I would like to know whether the promoters can tell me whether that is right.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Wentworth (Mr. Hardy) has stressed the international importance of the area. He was absolutely correct to do that. The crux of the points which the Opposition are trying to make about the procedures for the framework of protection, occur in amendment No. 11. Amendment No. 11 is very important. It states:
<q>Page 6, line 2 [Clause 6], after 'above', insert 'and subject to the consent in writing of the Secretary of State for the Environment.'</q>
Whatever alterations take place and when the company exercises its power to put works into operation, the Secretary of State on behalf of the environmental interest of the country should seek close monitoring of the position.<br/>
Amendment No. 11 requires the authority of the Secretary of State for the Environment for works which involve the enclosure and reclamation of the bed of the sea, the river and its foreshore. It is a normal provision of ports and harbour legislation for the authority of the Secretary of State for Transport to be required for such work.</p>

<p>The regulations and the order form part of a comprehensive revision of rules governing the driving time and rest periods of goods and passenger vehicle drivers and the use of tachographs. Taken as a whole, the new European Community and domestic rules will benefit drivers by reducing the maximum number of driving hours in a fortnight from 92 to 90 and by increasing the requirement for normal weekly rest from 40 to 45 hours. There is provision for this to be reduced, but the reduction has to be compensated within a three-week period. The minimum break time for most drivers will be increased from half an hour to three quarters of an hour and it will be made easier for drivers to vary their driving hours so that they can reach their homes and relax properly rather than be forced to spend nights in their cabs.<br/>
The new rules pay attention to the needs of drivers and they are not too complex to enforce. The Government are firmly committed to effective enforcement of the existing and the new regulations. The new European Community regulations clarify and enhance enforcement officers' powers to inspect and seize charts. They place a new duty on operators to check that their drivers are observing the rules and to take action if they are not.<br/>
We shall continue our vigorous enforcement policy and will be consulting both sides of the industry about ways in which it can be made even more effective.<br/>
This subject has been under discussion in the European Community for four years. Most goods vehicles over 3&#x00B7;5 tonnes and most coaches are subject to the EC regulations on drivers' hours and tachographs unless they fall within a derogation.<br/>
New EC regulations 3820/85 and 3821/85 were agreed by the Council of Ministers on 14 November 1985 and will come into effect on 29 September 1986. Hon. Members will recall that in their draft form they were debated in the House on 3 December 1984. They apply directly to the United Kingdom and are not the subject of today's motion, apart from provisions for permissible derogations, but they underlie our debate.<br/>
The new EC regulations result from many months of negotiation and reflect the views of all the member states. We are not entirely satisfied with either the content or the drafting, but taken as a whole we believe that they are a significant improvement on the existing regulations and will bring benefits to both drivers and operators.</p>

<speech hansard_id="429858" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1986-07-15a.954.0" hansard_membership_id="8471" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/17851" speakername="Mr. Max Madden" colnum="954" time="22:13:00">
<p>Will the Minister confirm that the British Commissioner responsible for road traffic matters and transport matters has indicated that he does not support the regulations and sees no need for their introduction? Will he also confirm that there is no mandatory obligation on the British Government to introduce these regulations and, as a great many drivers see no need for them, will he respond to that feeling by not bringing forward the regulations?</p>
</speech>
<speech hansard_id="429859" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1986-07-15a.954.1" hansard_membership_id="1469" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2459" speakername="Mr. Bottomley" colnum="954" time="22:13:00">
<p>The Commissioner is well able to speak for himself and give his own views. As for the second part of the question, I intend to cover it in what I have to say.<br/>
Drivers in this country are subject not only to the EC rules on driving time and rest periods but also to the provisions of the Transport Act 1968 on duty periods, the total time a driver may work. Drivers not subject to the EC rules are subject to the provisions in the Transport Act 1968 on driving, rest and duty periods. With the introduction of the new EC regulations, it was necessary to re-examine the 1968 Act.<br/>
Under the present EC regulations, the existence of two overlapping sets of laws complicates operational planning. Under the new regulations, this duplication would be largely unnecessary since the new provisions on rest periods will on their own effectively limit the hours a driver can be on duty. To retain our existing weekly duty limit of 60 hours would prevent the use of a new EC provision which allows weekly rest to be reduced in one week provided it is compensated within the following three weeks. So we are proposing to abolish all 1968 Act limits on duty hours in so far as they apply to driving subject to the EC rules.<br/>
Turning to the four instruments before us, the Community Drivers' Hours and Recording Equipment (Exemptions and Supplementary Provisions) Regulations 1986 will provide for permissible derogations from the two Community regulations; where the drivers' hours regulation gives member states an option to modify the application of that Regulation, take advantage of that option, and require the installation and use of tachographs in certain parcels vehicles.<br/>
Regulation 1 revokes existing regulations providing for exemption from the existing EC drivers' hours and tachograph regulations. Regulation 2, with the schedule, provides for permissible exemptions from the drivers' hours regulation. In most cases the vehicles exempted correspond precisely to the categories of vehicles specified in article 13(1). The exemption limit for buses and coaches is increased from a maximum of 15 seats to 17 seats, both including the driver. This will be of particular benefit to private users of such vehicles. Hitherto we have taken the view that private driving was not subject to the EC regulations, but the new texts make it clear that they do apply to passenger transport. This is something we have asked the Commission to re-examine. In any case, our power of derogation will be used to ensure that, on journeys within the United Kingdom only vehicles with more than 17 seats will need to comply with the EC drivers' hours rules and to fit and use tachographs.<br/>
Part II of the schedule contains exemptions from the drivers' hours regulation under article 13(2) of that regulation. These exemptions require authorisation from the Commission. Application has been made for such authorisation and the regulation will not be made until it has been granted.<br/>
Regulation 3(1) extends to national non-regular passenger services the concession allowing the weekly rest period to be taken after 12 days of driving instead of six days. Regulations 3(2) and 3(3) provide that an alternative break provision can apply to regular national passenger services operating into or out of central London. For those services the three quarter hour break after four and a half hours of driving can be replaced by a half hour break after four hours of driving under certain circumstances. We are considering whether this might be extended to other cities.<br/>
Regulations 4(1) and 4(2) provide exemptions from the tachograph regulation for vehicles exempt from the drivers' hours regulation and also sea coal vehicles. The exemption provided by regulation 4(2) also requires authorisation from the Commission.<br/>
Regulation 5 applies the tachograph regulation to all vehicles carrying postal articles, other than letters, which would otherwise be exempt. "Letters" is defined by reference to the Post Office inland post scheme 1979.<br/>
In regard to the Community Drivers' Hours and Recording Equipment Regulations 1986, this draft instrument made under section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972 makes consequential textual changes to primary and secondary legislation to take account of the repeal and replacement of Council regulations 543/69 and 1463/70 by regulations 3820/85 and 3821/85.<br/>
I turn to the Drivers' Hours (Good Vehicles) (Modifications) Order 1986. This draft instrument is made under the powers in section 96(12) of the Transport Act 1968 to modify the domestic drivers' hours code for goods vehicles which are outside the scope of the EC regulations. Under regulation 2 all of the domestic drivers' hours code is disapplied except for the daily driving limit in section 96(1) and the daily duty limit in section 96(3)<i>(a).</i> The time structure provided by a limit on spreadover in 96(3)<i>(b)</i> is removed. In consequence of the disapplication of section 96(4) of the 1968 Act, which provided for a statutory period of rest between two successive days, the definition of "working day" is amended. Regulation 3 replaces the existing provisions which provide for further exemptions for light goods vehicles with new provisions which have been altered to take account of the fact that all the domestic drivers' hours code, except for the two provisions on daily driving and daily duty mentioned, are disapplied under regulation 2.<br/>
Finally, we have the Drivers' Hours (Harmonisation with Community Rules) Regulations 1986.<br/>
This draft instrument is made under sections 95(1) and (1A) of the 1968 Act. Regulation 2 provides that the domestic drivers' hours code shall not apply to Community regulated driving but that the periods of driving subject to Community rules count towards limits in the domestic drivers' hours code. Regulation 3 alters the definition of "working week" so that, consistent with the definition of the "week" in article 1 of the drivers' hours regulation, it runs from midnight Sunday/Monday. This change is needed to synchronise the operation of the domestic drivers' hours code with the new Community provisions. Traffic Commissioners will be able to vary the date of making this change to suit the needs of individual PSV operators.<br/>
Taken as a whole, besides the benefits that I spoke of at the beginning of my speech, the new EC and domestic rules will benefit coach operators by making possible some longer day trips using one instead of two drivers; by easing

the time pressures on some scheduled journeys; and by applying the same rules to tours within Britain as to international tours. They will provide benefits for lorry operators by allowing more flexibility in arranging work schedules, by removing the existing limits on duty time and by exempting operators on small islands, including the Isle of Wight, if the vehicles do not leave the island. They will benefit farmers by exempting from most limits their vehicles when used to carry goods within 50 km of base. They will benefit small businesses by exempting from most limits vehicles up to 7&#x00BD; tonnes carrying materials or equipment for use in the course of the driver's work within 50 km of base.<br/>
Finally&#x2014;</p>

<p>The Minister used the word "Finally". I hate to think that he intends to present such a one-sided account of the regulations and then sit down.

<p>The hon. Gentleman was probably here at the beginning of my speech, when he heard about the benefits that the regulations will bring to drivers. I intend to finish my speech and then to listen to the debate and respond.<br/>
The proposals contained in these instruments pay proper regard to road safety and they are consistent with our policy of reducing unnecessary burdens on industry. Trade unions and employers will be able to negotiate together new patterns of work which will allow both drivers and operators to benefit fully from the increased flexibility that is now available to them. I commend the draft statutory instruments to the House.</p>

<p>Occasionally remarks like "rubbish" are made from a sedentary position.<br/>
These are very technical regulations, and by their very nature they are somewhat desiccated, as was evident from the Minister's monosyllabic delivery when he read his brief. However, just because they are technical and detailed does not mean that they are unimportant. They are very important. Many of my hon. Friends wish to speak during this one and a half hour debate. Therefore, I shall endeavour to keep my remarks to a minimum, but I make no apology for spending some time upon a very important and technical matter.<br/>
Before these regulations were laid before the House, the 1968 regulations provided for up to 10 hours driving at the wheel, up to 11 hours on duty, including driving, up to 12&#x00BD; hours spread over&#x2014;that is, booking on and booking off &#x2014; and at least a half hour break for rest and refreshment after 5&#x00BD; hours on duty. There were at least 11 hours of consecutive duty.<br/>
Because the law for the majority was simple to understand and enforce, it led to an improvement in road safety standards. That is demonstrated by the fact that the


United Kingdom has a higher road safety standard than any other member state in the European Community. I am not proud of that, because there are still far too many accidents, but at least we can take some comfort from it.<br/>
In November 1984, statements were made by the Government in both this House and the other place about their intention to revise United Kingdom legislation which imposed limitations on regulation 543/69 for national journeys. The contention was that the proposed changes would eliminate the need to continue the limitations. The new regulations have now been published, and the Minister has told us about them.<br/>
Contrary to what the Government said, the new regulations will fundamentally change the hours of work and the rest periods, providing for an extension of driving hours and of the working day, and allowing, overall, for shorter rest periods. If the Government go ahead with these regulations, the permutations that will be available after 29 September will, in my view, and that of many people, especially those who drive heavy lorries, be impracticable and unenforceable.<br/>
In these regulations, the EC has apparently endeavoured to create greater flexibility for road transport operations and greater simplicity of enforcement, while increasing road safety and improving the working conditions of drivers. Against that, we must carefully examine what the Minister has said. Most United Kingdom drivers and operators are subject to national rules, which apply to journeys within Great Britain in vehicles over 3&#x00B7;5 tonnes maximum authorised weight.<br/>
In the past, national rules have comprised EC regulations and certain provisions of the Transport Act 1968. The new Government proposals, which are contained in these draft regulations, attempt to abolish the duty limitation on driving and work. I shall give four examples. We are now talking about statistics and figures. The current daily driving day, under existing legislation, is eight hours, but the Government's proposals will mean nine hours. The current number of hours for continuous driving is four, and the Minister now proposes four and a half hours. Weekly rest now totals 40 hours, and the Minister proposes that the figure should increase to 45 hours. Daily rest currently amounts to 11 hours, and in that regard, the Minister seeks no change.<br/>
Let us look at the figures for the current hours. They may be extended twice in any one week to 10 hours. Member states may fix minimum breaks of 30 minutes after driving periods not exceeding four hours for national passenger carriage on regular services. The daily rest periods may be reduced to 36 consecutive hours if taken at the base of the vehicle or driver, or 24 hours if taken elsewhere. Each reduction may be compensated for, en bloc, before the end of the third week in question. I apologise for giving such detailed information, but it is necessary to understand these regulations.<br/>
The emphasis on driving time limitations and the absence of any duty limits in EEC 3820/85 and the proposed national rules demonstrate a complete misinterpretation of the origins of driver fatigue. It reflects the commonly held view that driving fatigue is merely a factor of the length of time spent behind the wheel. It may be convenient to legislate for limits on driving times, but there is no empirical evidence to support driving time limits on road safety grounds.<br/>
Evidence showing that time spent behind the wheel is not a major factor in fatigue accidents was reported by the Transport and Road Research Laboratory in 1984. In a survey of 2,000 motorway accidents, involving heavy goods vehicles and passenger service vehicles it was found that fatigue was responsible for 11 per cent. of them. But the more important statistic is that 62 per cent. of those drivers had their accidents within 100 miles of beginning their journeys.<br/>
This is quite inconsistent with the view that limitation in driving time alone will reduce accidents caused by fatigue.<br/>
Research suggests that fatigue accumulates from mental and physical work in general and from irregular working hours which disrupt sleeping patterns and bodily rhythms. Many scientific examples demonstrate that. Dr. Ivan Brown, the assistant director at MRC Applied Psychology Unit, Cambridge, argues:
<q>There is a potential serious road safety problem among commercial truck and bus operators, where chronic fatigue is largely the result of bad law, which constrains hours of driving but fails to control hours of work, resulting in widespread flouting of the EEC Regulations and the general loss and disruption of sleep among drivers.</q>
There are other examples where scientists have found that it is not the time behind the wheel that counts, although that is important, but the working day and the accumulation of fatigue over that day. The chap clocks on and starts to load his vehicle, drives down the motorway for the maxiumum four and half hours under these proposals, then unloads his vehicle, loads it again and goes back to his depot.<br/>
The amount of time that the driver of the heavy goods vehicle is subjected to fatigue is not necessarily manifested in the time that he is behind the wheel. Fatigue is the combination of the time that he is behind the wheel and the time that he is at work. That is the significant point which the Minister has missed. What we must do is to put a duty limitation on the time of work, not on the time behind the wheel.<br/>
At some pain to my researchers and myself, I have worked out a couple of examples. As my basis, I used the regulations which the Minister has just annunciated from the Dispatch Box. Driver X takes nine hours rest period, which he is permitted to three times a week, from midnight until nine o'clock in the morning. He begins work at nine o'clock with loading and unloading work at the depot until 13.30 hours. He then drives to his destination, without a break, for four and a half hours. He will arrive there at 18.00 hours. At this point he has been on continuous consecutive duty for nine hours. He takes a break of 45 minutes and at 18.45 pm unloads and loads his vehicle for three hours until 21.45 pm. He then starts his four and a half hour drive back to the depot, arriving at 2.15 am.<br/>
The new regulations will allow him to work in this fashion until 15.00 hours on day two when he will have taken his daily rest periods. I have not made that example up. That is what will happen under the new regulations.<br/>
Let us take a further example: the abolition of the limit of 11 hours on daily duty. Driver Y takes his daily rest period between midnight and 9.00 hours and loads up at eleven o'clock He then drives to his destination without a break, arriving at 15.30 hours. After a 45 minute break he unloads and loads his vehicle commencing at 16.15 pm and continuing until 19.30 pm. He finishes his days work with a four and a half hour journey home and arrives at


midnight. Driver Y would be operating legally within EC 3820/85 and he could repeat this 14&#x00BD; hour work schedule for three consecutive days.<br/>
Over the past few weeks, I have painstakingly worked out what could result, in terms of a working schedule, if the regulations went through. The Minister may say that, in reality, that would not happen because the employer would not want his driver to do what I have described.do not know about that. Let us say, for the sake of argument, that the employer is an enlightened employer, and he may not want his driver to do that. However, there are many thousands of what are euphemistically called "cowboy operators" in the public transport field who would. Moreover, it would be legal for them to do so. They could do what I have described, and it would be completely legal.<br/>
There is no argument between the Minister and myself &#x2014; nor was there with his predecessor &#x2014; about the importance of road safety. I have stood at the Dispatch Box continually since 1979 and have addressed myself to the issues of road safety. I will not be found wanting by anybody in my concern for road safety. I do not doubt the Minister's concern either. I think that he is going about it the wrong way. I do not believe that it is a political issue. It is a common sense issue. I wish that the Minister would reconsider what he proposes, withdraw the regulations and have another think about them. If he does not do so, in my view and in the view of many people, he will be taking a retrograde step.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport will be acutely aware of my personal anxiety about all matters of road safety. I shall not speak about the case in my constituency that is sub judice, except to say that I do not believe that drivers' hours contributed to that great tragedy. There have been other tragedies in my constituency over the past two years where drivers have conceivably dozed off for a second or two. There have been subsequent accidents with the loss of human life where the driver has not paid a heavy penalty, for reasons best known to the courts.<br/>
Many lorries from the continent go to the town of Maidstone and its neighbourhood. Maidstone anticipates the Channel tunnel in the foreseeable future, and it welcomes fruit lorries because they are its life-blood. Drivers work long hours. The fruit markets up and down the country keep hours rather like the House of Commons. The people of Maidstone see those drivers thundering through their town at every hour of the day and night.<br/>
The picture painted by the hon. Member for Wigan (Mr. Stott) of the changed hours in the two examples he gave of driver X and driver Y filled me with horror and dismay. I was also perturbed that my hon. Friend brushed aside the question that the hon. Member for Bradford, West (Mr. Madden) raised of the traffic commissioner of the EEC Why did my hon. Friend say that the traffic commissioner could speak for himself? I do not see him in the civil servants' box. I do not see him at the Bar of the House. He cannot speak to the House for himself. As God's representative in the House, perhaps my hon. Friend will speak for God for a moment.</p>

<p><i>The Financial Times</i> of 5 July reported Mr. Stanley Clinton Davis as saying:

<q>I would have been happier if the council could have accepted other aspects of the proposal, notably the equivalent of a full weekend's rest for drivers and a better system for the control and enforcement of these regulations.</q>
That is clear enough, as are the EEC press releases. It is frivolous and lazy for the Minister to give such an answer.</p>

<p>I understand why the Minister did so, but perhaps in his reply he will come cleaner with the House. Many hon. Members wish to speak and I do not want to waste the time of the House, but I must emphasise the great anxiety in my area about lorry and coach safety. We should like a little better assurance than we have had.</p>

<p>I have a special constituency interest in these regulations. Barnsley is only one and half miles from the M1 and only a few miles from the M6, so we have major motorways running north, south, east and west nearby. Consequently, it is in a perfect position for the siting of road haulage firms. Therefore, in recent years a multiplicity of large and small companies have come to operate from our area.<br/>
The Transport and General Workers Union branch 9/17 in my constituency, speaking on behalf of lorry drivers&#x2014;the branch covers all the commercial firms and has up to 100 drivers in Barnsley and surrounding areas &#x2014;is seriously concerned about the proposed changes in drivers' hours and rest periods. The drivers are not against change, but the present rules governing drivers' duty periods have been in operation for about 18 years, mainly to the satisfaction of lorry drivers, coach drivers, the TGWU and all the related unions. I am informed that all the unions affected by the changes are strongly resisting them. They fear &#x2014; the Government appear to have admitted this&#x2014;that within the regulations a 14 hour day is feasible. They have not agreed any of these changes with the Government, and there has been no unanimity on the new regulations on any of the European Economic Community Committees.<br/>
The TGWU sent a letter to the Department of Transport on 13 March setting out its objections to the regulations. It met Ministers on 30 April, and again expressed its concern. In particular, it stated strongly that the greater flexibility incorporated in the new regulations and the proposals to amend the provisions of the Transport Act 1968 would make enforcement more difficult and lead to increased driver fatigue. It is so seriously upset at the proposed changes that it is now issuing warnings to its men that being fatigued kills. It is so concerned about the well-being and safety of its members that its message is, "Sleep in bed and not at the wheel. Longer hours will lead to greater tiredness, and accidents will be inevitable." The union knows that bad employers will exploit the flexibility of the regulations to the detriment of its members. It fears that the effect of the regulations will be more tired drivers, and tired drivers are a threat to themselves and to everyone on the roads, including pedestrians.<br/>
Lorry, truck and coach drivers throughout the whole EEC, backed by the International Transport Workers Federation, have also combined to warn about the increased risk of accidents on the roads through fatigue. The ITWF has warned the Common Market Commission and the Council of Ministers that it is possible that a permutation of the new regulations could allow managers to operate drivers on six consecutive days, driving 12&#x00B7;5


hours on three days and 14&#x00B7;5 hours on three days. Two drivers on a vehicle could be on duty for a continuous period of 22 hours with two breaks of 15 minutes, and drivers on international coach trips could be on duty for 12 consecutive days before taking a rest day.<br/>
Employers can, and the fear is that some will, exploit the weaknesses in the regulations. There are bad employers and, as my hon. Friend the Member for Wigan (Mr. Stott) said, cowboy operators in the commercial truck business. Therein lies the danger and the unions' fears.<br/>
The Government intend to rescind the current 60 hours on duty limitation, and regulation 3820/85 recinds the current weekly driving hours limitation. Therefore, the union argues, driving hours will increase from eight to nine hours daily for all drivers, and, by the introduction of the sixth day working, they could then be called upon to work four nine-hour spells and two 10-hour spells, resulting in 56 hours driving and working in one week. They may not be called upon to operate for 34 hours the next week but what dangers will that one over-tiring and exacting week cause?<br/>
That is why the union, in its message to its membership, clearly states that the medical research studies in recent years have shown that excessive hours of work and inadequate rest lead to greater driver fatigue and increase the accident rate. The studies show that fatigue is often the contibuting or main cause of accidents. However, the employers and the Government have not accepted that. Drivers' health, safety and welfare are paramount. As the union states,
<q>Unless we can effectively campaign and succeed in retaining United Kingdom provisions for national journeys these will become secondary as drivers fall by the wayside, younger drivers will replace them, this is the practice now happening within the Community who have no on-duty limitations and work up to 90 hours in a week.</q>
The Barnsley branch of the Transport and General Workers Union &#x2014;9/17 branch &#x2014;drew my attention to this final message which they endorse from practical experience.<br/>
The union has painted a very worrying picture. According to the union:
<q>There appears to be no comprehension in the Department of Transport about the physical and mental demands on a driver or the effects of fatigue. Various studies of illness and injury have been made. These showed increased rates of hypertension, coronary heart disease amongst drivers plus a high rate of insomnia, headaches, fatigue, ulcers and other digestive disorders as well as musculature problems including pain in the lower back and neck. Difficult working conditions associated with the lack of adequate toilet and meal facilities, noise, traffic, vibration, all contribute to stress-related factors affecting drivers.</q>
However, the Department of Transport and the regulations take no account of that.</p>

<p>I am making my conclusions.<br/>
My constituents say that they would like to know how rescinding the 11 hour on-duty time can be justified with no practicable means of enforcing the taking of the accrued rest hours. The Barnsley union continues:
<q>The change to a new fortnightly limit on consecutive driving will be impossible to monitor and enforce, while the abolition of the five-hour 30 minute continuous duty limit and its replacement with a four-hour 30 minute limit on driving will mean many drivers will never qualify for any break.

Drivers will work longer hours. The inability to enforce what remains of the law will allow cowboy operators a free rein. They will compel reputable operators to work at least to, if not beyond, what would be legal. Looser drivers' hours regulations, coupled with a reduced police inspection rate when the Health and Safety Executive take over responsibility for roadside checks on vehicles carrying hazardous loads, will result in a cowboy's charter.</q>
My branch of the union has a great deal of responsibility for its membership and it is seriously concerned about the regulations. The Minister addressed the House with contempt this evening. I have never known a Minister bring forward regulations of such importance, of serious concern to many lorry, coach and truck drivers &#x2014; I speak on behalf of my constituents &#x2014; and make opening remarks that were an absolute disgrace. I hope that he will rectify the position when he replies. It is incumbent upon the Minister to answer the many queries that have been raised in all seriousness and I hope that he will be able to allay many of the fears that I have expressed.</p>

<p>This is a matter of great importance and one that involves safety. I am sorry that the Opposition should seek to make strident party political points when we are dealing essentially with matters that go to the heart of our transport system. As one who does not depend upon a research assistant&#x2014;as the hon. Member for Wigan (Mr. Stott) did&#x2014;but who has been involved in industry and seen much of the distribution system, I know that there is a major fallacy in the hon. Gentleman's arithmetic&#x2014;<i>[Interruption.]</i> I appreciate that some hon. Members may not wish to hear the fallacy, but they should bear with me for a moment.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman miscalculated, because he did not take into account the fact that, in many cases, drivers do not load their vehicles. I have visited depots in and around York and met drivers who belong to the Transport and General Workers Union, about which the right hon. Member for Barnsley, Central (Mr. Mason) spoke, and I know that the vehicles are already loaded before the measured time commences. If the hon. Member for Wigan is serious about transport&#x2014;I think that he is, for he is an honourable Member, whom I have faced across the Chamber for some years now &#x2014; during the recess he should go into industry, where he will find support for the measures.<br/>
I shall not rely, as the hon. Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) did, on quoting the Socialist former mayor of Hackney as the source of all erudition in this matter. The Opposition Benches contain much more skill than that on which he could have called.<br/>
Let us go to the root of the matter and consider the safety aspects of transport. My hon. Friend the Minister must be due some praise, for an increase in the weekly rest period from 29 hours to a minimum of 45 hours must be of interest.<br/>
I would ask the House to consider the equivalent of pilots' licences for the heavy goods vehicle and passenger vehicle industries. In the airline business, the qualified pilot can work only for a given number of hours. He cannot come off a plane, of whatever dimension, and immediately fly a smaller plane or another type of plane. However, that does not apply in heavy goods or passenger transport. Drivers who should be entering periods of rest can pursue gainful employment as drivers of other coaches


or even taxis, for there is no correlation on the tachograph between the two forms of transport. I raised this matter in the House yesterday, in the hope that my hon. Friend the Minister would consider it today. We must consider the provision of personal logbooks for drivers. Then we could see the number of hours worked in a week or a month, which must be in the interests of traffic safety and of the drivers. Their periods of rest must be genuine, and not times when they are in gainful employment driving coaches and lorries.<br/>
Tourism has not yet been mentioned this evening. If, as is suggested here, there will be an increase in longer day trips for coach operators, and the application of similar rules to British and non-British companies, it must be in the interests of the development of United Kingdom tourism, which is the fastest growth industry in Britain. That is another reason for recommending the regulations to the House.</p>

<p>I found it no easier to understand the regulations than the Minister did to explain them. As someone who comes fresh to the problem, I am bound to say that the submissions of the Transport and General Workers Union were much easier to understand and a good deal more convincing than some of the Minister's comments. I know that he has valued his membership of the TGWU, and I should have thought that he would have given rather more weight to its submissions on the issue.<br/>
The Minister's case seems to rest on the argument of flexibility. and the fact that the new regulations permit daily driving and rest periods to be varied to suit operational requirements. I accept that that can be of great benefit to an operator, or a firm working on a tight schedule to get a job done or a delivery made. I also understand the Minister's point that on occasions that can be of great benefit to the driver, too. It can enable him to drive that bit longer to get home and have a decent rest rather than having a nap in the cab.<br/>
However, surely the message from various parts of the House is that flexibility involves risks, and the regulations provide for an almost infinite number of variations of daily, weekly, fortnightly and monthly driving limits and rest entitlements. Against that background, drivers will have great difficulty in keeping track of their own situation and entitlements. Whatever the Minister says about enforcement, it will be extremely difficult for enforcement authorities to keep track of what is going on.<br/>
The regulations provide the opportunity for unscrupulous employers, or indeed unscrupulous drivers, to take advantage of them, and to arrange for drivers to work over-long hours and to miss much-needed rest periods and meal breaks, with very little chance of getting caught. Such a situation must inevitably put pressure on the reputable haulier, the firm that is anxious to maintain standards and concerned about road safety. Such firms may be placed at a competitive disadvantage as a result of the operations of less scrupulous firms, which take full advantage of the flexibility that the regulations offer. That could lead to a general decline in the standards of the road haulage industry.<br/>
Other hon. Members have said that the 1968 limits that are being removed by the regulations were clear, precise and easy to understand. Since 1968, undoubtedly the situation on our roads has changed. In some ways, it has

changed for the better, and in some ways it has changed for the worse. We have more roads, and in some cases better roads. We have more motorways, but at the same time there has been a substantial increase in car ownership since 1968. Commercial vehicles are in many cases carrying much heavier loads than they were then, and they are operating at much faster speeds. All those factors have increased traffic congestion and have certainly increased pressure on commercial drivers. As a result, they have increased the risk of fatigue. It seems to many of us that this is hardly the time to risk aggravating that fatigue by enabling drivers to work longer hours.<br/>
I know that the Minister argued on 25 June that
<q>There is no clearly established connection between driving hours and fatigue." &#x2014; [<i>Official Report,</i> 25 June 1986; Vol. 100, c. 242.]</q>
That is an argument that many of us who drive either professionally or on an amateur basis will find hard to accept. Whether we argue about that or not, one point that we cannot argue about at all is one put to me by the Woolwich district officer of the Transport and General Workers Union. He told me that under circumstances of congestion and pressure, fatigue can kill. None of us can dispute that. The TGWU quotes a 1985 survey of drivers in international transport, which showed that over 7 per cent. of those drivers had been involved in an accident caused by falling asleep at the wheel. I do not think that any of us would argue with the finding of my local TGWU official that
<q>Any legislation to encourage this trend would be criminal.</q>
That is an indictment against the regulations.<br/>
I understand that after four years of negotiation in Brussels there is an inevitable temptation to take second best. The Minister has accepted that the regulations do not meet all the United Kingdom's objectives. When we are talking about vital issues of road safety, and thinking about the sheer size of the vehicles that are now on our roads I do not believe that we should accept the risks involved in accepting second best. I suggest that the Minister should take the regulations away and produce something that is a good deal more watertight and reassuring both to drivers and to the public.</p>

<p>I speak in the debate with a constituency interest in having one of the nation's motorways, the M4, running through part of my constituency. The motorway brought good communications to Swindon, and at the same time it brought with it the risks to users of that motorway. It is with that issue in mind that I speak tonight.<br/>
The issue of road safety has been brought home to hon. Members very clearly today with the anouncement of increased accident figures for motorways in the past year. Clearly, we must consider that question. I pay tribute to the generally high standards of professional drivers of buses, lorries and other forms of transport who use the major road arteries of this country. With few exceptions, they demonstrate a professionalism and expertise that is a credit to their profession and an essential feature of high road safety standards.<br/>
We are discussing the marginal or grey area where the regulations can be broken and bent. We must ask whether the regulations, whether they are old or new can be adequately enforced. I ask the Minister to tell the House,


in closing the debate, how he equates greater road safety and security for all users of roads with an increase in the number of hours that a driver may drive on one day, whether it is from eight to nine hours, or indeed, on two days a week, for up to 10 hours. How is that conducive to greater road safety?<br/>
Secondly, how far would increasing the maximum number of hours driven in one stage from four to four and a half hours be conducive to road safety, when the break that follows that period is reduced from half an hour to a quarter of an hour? I am not sure what one can do in a quarter of an hour. I suspect that a driver can rush around to do the things that have to be done. Is that very much of a rest? I question the regulations on that basis.<br/>
The complexity of the regulations must be evident to all hon. Members. We have heard an explanation from both Front Benches. Most hon. Members would say that an administrator would need to concentrate hard to work out rosters with all the permutations and find out what can be done legally, let alone what they can get away with. I question the regulations on the basis of their complexity.<br/>
The advantage that has been put forward is in the flexibility of these regulations. I do not agree with that view. Flexibility, if it is positively and properly handled, can be beneficial. Then again, flexibility can lead to a labyrinth of complications that can be abused.<br/>
Finally, how can we be sure that these regulations, if they are passed by the House tonight, will be enforced properly? I would welcome perhaps a departure from his brief, and hope that the Minister will tackle the issue of road safety. Will the Minister say that we can expect to have an adequate level of enforcement of the regulations to ensure that they are not abused and that, as a result, the safety of other travellers on our roads is not put at risk?<br/>
I hope very much that my hon. Friend the Minister will take up the point put to him by the hon. Member for York (Mr. Gregory) in relation to a personal logbook. That seems to offer a way forward in ensuring that individuals will go by the book, literally. I hope that my hon. Friend will reply positively and sympathetically. I know that it is in his heart to do so because he shares my concern for road safety. I hope that the Minister will tell the House how he sees these matters and these problems being dealt with in the future.</p>

<p>Like right hon. and hon. Members on this side of the House, and I dare say some from the Government Benches, I have been approached by many drivers from my constituency. I wish that I could convey to the Minister the sense of outrage they feel about the introduction of these proposals. I must say that their sense of outrage would be greatly increased if they had been able to attend and listen to this debate.<br/>
An overwhelming case has been put by my hon. Friend the Member for Wigan (Mr. Stott), speaking from the Front Bench, and by my right hon. Friend the Member for Barnsley, Central (Mr. Mason). Indeed, there has been only one speech from the Government Benches in favour of the regulations. A hon. Member thought that it was relevant to pour scorn on the traffic commissioner in Brussels, who holds the same view as we do about the measure. The performance of the Under-Secretary of State

has been pitiful and derisory. If the regulations are passed because of that type of persuasion, it will be an insult to the House and will do great damage.<br/>
All those who have discussed this matter listened with derision to the explanation of the Under-Secretary of State of what the regulations do:
<q>There is no clearly established connection between driving hours and fatigue.&#x2014;[<i>Official Report</i> 25 June 1986; Vol. 100, c. 242.]</q>
What drivel&#x0021; Apparently, that view is based on a proposition of the House of Lords Select Committee. I doubt that that Committee really believes that. It is especially comic that that statement was made at a time when the other place is complaining that it sits for too many hours and that it is suffering from fatigue. What ludicrous nonsense that is. I hope that the Under-Secretary of State will listen carefully to hon. Members' comments. I am sure that he is passionately eager to assist with road safety and to introduce fresh measures to meet that aim. These regulations drive in the opposite direction. The hon. Gentleman should be ashamed to proceed with them. If he does so, some of the blood will be on the Government's head. I therefore urge the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the regulations and look at them afresh. That is what the House asks him to do.</p>

<p>I am a Member sponsored by the Transport and General Workers Union and I am currently chairman of the 31-strong group in the House. Yesterday, following a question by me we drew the attention of the House to the remarks of the Under-Secretary of State for Transport&#x2014;the hon. Member for Eltham (Mr. Bottomley) &#x2014; in a written reply to a question by my hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Riverside (Mr. Parry). The hon. Gentleman made the idiotic comment that there is little relationship between fatigue and the hours that a driver spends at the wheel. The Minister's response was a carefully premeditated written reply to a written question. It was not made off the cuff.<br/>
The Under-Secretary of State comes to his present occupation with a reputation for caring about road safety. He is supposed to be an outstanding performer. We all care about road safety. If the House really cares, it will throw out these regulations. Conservative Members who are listening patiently must share our conservation and concern. They should not hesitate in the name of the House of Commons to reflect people's anxieties. They must say that they will throw out these measures and join us in the Division Lobby in opposition to them.</p>

<p>Not at the moment.<br/>
Reference has been made to no less a man than the transport commissioner. He happens to be a former Labour Member who represented Hackney, Central. His scepticism about the changes has been recorded. He thought that they were a backward step. The changes have been opposed also by other bodies within the EEC set-up. The measures have been introduced because they have been discussed for a long time.<br/>
The regulations are a backward step. Manipulation and confusion will result. Calculations will be changed&#x2014;for example, the hours of required rest will be changed from one week to another and there will be confusion about


whether the hours driven in one week are to be added to the number for the following week. There will be hopeless confusion about the operation of the regulations.<br/>
I am disappointed that the Secretary of State for Transport is not present. The right hon. Gentleman is a newcomer to transport matters and I have been involved with them for a long time. I think that I am the senior member of the Select Committee on Transport. Most of the Select Committee's members are currently in Canada studying that country's railway system as part of a study of railways generally.<br/>
Commercial road transport drivers keep open Britain's main economic artery and we must be concerned with what they think about the regulations and the views of the union which mainly concerns itself with these matters. Surely the views of the drivers and their union are of great consequence. The International Labour Office has addressed its mind to transport matters, working conditions and safety generally. It has always emphasised that great weight must be attached to the views of employers and trade union organisations, and that above all responsibility should rest with Governments. The Government are evading the fundamental responsibility of ensuring that our roads are made safe by freeing them of fatigued drivers.</p>

<p>Next week I shall be speaking at a public meeting called by my union to draw attention to the grave disquiet among union members and which should exist among the public once they become aware of what the Government are doing in imperilling their position on the highways.<br/>
The hon. Member for York (Mr. Gregory), who is no longer in his place, has said that he has evidence that some drivers support the regulations. It is significant that he did not produce any evidence to support that contention. There has been ample evidence presented to the House that all those involved in road transport are gravely disquieted by the regulations.<br/>
In formulating the regulations the views of the transport commissioner as well as those of the transport committee and the social and economic committee of the European Parliament have been ignored. The social and economic committee is the statutory body that the Council of Ministers is required to consult.<br/>
Flexibility for the benefit and use of employers is the proposition that is before us. That is all that has been achieved. Bad employers will be encouraged by the manipulation that is possible of the regulations. Long hours are a killer. They kill the driver at the wheel and those who load vehicles before they take to the highways. Excessive driving hours and working hours lead to fatigue and loss of concentration. The 1985 survey of international transport drivers showed that more than 7 per cent. of drivers had been involved in accidents due to falling asleep at the wheel.<br/>
These matters have been well ventilated, and so I shall conclude by alluding to the aims and considered judgment of the International Transport Workers Federation, to which my union, the Transport and General Workers Union, is affiliated. The aims are a proper limitation on

working hours as well as driving hours both daily and weekly, which is what the regulations do not achieve. There should be adequate rest breaks for meals and daily rest; the right of drivers to spend their weekly rest periods with their families; weekly rest periods long enough to allow drivers to enjoy a normal life to the maximum extent possible and simple understandable regulations&#x2014; which these certainly are not&#x2014;so that one knows what the position is and so that the regulations can be enforced to prevent the cowboy operators taking away work arid jobs. That is the aim of the decent drivers on our highways today who shoulder such a substantial burden of our economic welfare and our road safety combined.</p>

<p>Like my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Southall (Mr. Bidwell), I am proud to be a member of the Transport and General Workers Union, which I have been for 34 years, and I am a responsible member of that union.<br/>
To the hon. Member for Wirral, South (Mr. Porter), I say that I will be speaking not only for lorry drivers and coach drivers in my constituency but for 100 per cent. of my constituents who are road users.<br/>
The regulations are quite appalling. The Transport and General Workers Union has made its views very clear to the Government, and has had a national campaign about the regulations. I found it appalling that the Minister, in addressing the House on these highly controversial regulations, gave an explanation that was less understandable than the explanatory memorandum contained in the regulations. There was not a mention of the enormous opposition that exists to the regulations. There has been a marked deterioration of working standards and conditions for drivers in this country that is dangerous not only to the drivers but to the public.<br/>
I wonder how the Minister will answer the figures put forward by my hon. Friend the Member for Wigan (Mr. Stott). What my hon. Friend outlined could and will happen under these regulations that the Minister has brought in under the sacred name of flexibility. This is not flexibility, but a marked deterioration in the conditions of work.<br/>
If I may turn to the public, as all my hon. Friends have said, a tired driver is a dangerous driver; that is inevitable, because he is tired. My hon. Friend the Member for Wigan put his finger on the point when he talked about hours of work rather than hours behind the wheel. The hon. Member for York (Mr. Gregory), who has left the Chamber, said that not all drivers load their lorries, and of course that is true. If the Government were concerned about road safety, they would have framed the regulations to deal with the driver who loads his lorry as distinct from the driver who does not. Just a little bit of care could have dealt with that. The Government have shown no sign of consideration for road safety.<br/>
What we are discussing for an hour and a half late at night after private business, tucked away at the end of July, will kill and maim people in the country. I beg the Minister to think again about the regulations.<br/>
As I have said previously when we have discussed harmonisation with Europe, let us realise what we mean by this. It must be borne in mind that the climate in this country is different from that in Europe. It is all right to drive on a lovely July night, but it is a different matter to drive through fog and snow in the winter. There are


conditions in this country that drivers in Italy, the south of France, Spain and Greece do not experience. Their hours of work and hours of darkness are different from ours. In Scotland in the winter months most hours are hours of darkness. On the continent the conditions are considerably better and the climate is better. I hope that the Minister will reconsider this and will make amends for the disgraceful way that he introduced these highly controversial regulations by telling the House that he will go back to Europe and will think again.</p>

<p>I declare my interest at the outset as a sponsored member of the Transport and General Workers Union. I confess also&#x2014;other hon. Members may do likewise&#x2014; that I did not know that we were in EEC road safety year. It is clear from what has been said in these deliberations and from the remarks of the EEC Transport Commissioner that the regulations will do nothing to promote road safety.<br/>
The officer responsible for commercial transport matters in the TGWU, Jack Ashwell, wrote a blistering six-page critique of the regulations to the Minister on 3 June of this year in which he stated:
<q>There appears to be a mental block within your Department as to the consequences on drivers' health, safety and welfare".</q>
As I listened for 14 minutes to the Minister recite his departmental brief, I could appreciate why Mr. Ashwell took that view.<br/>
Reference has been made to some aspects of the Minister's written answer of 25 June to my hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Riverside (Mr. Parry). Other aspects of it were interesting. For example, the Minister said:
<q>The trade unions consider that our proposals will lead to longer working hours, increased driver fatigue and hence increased accidents. It is true that the flexible work patterns allowed by the new rules may make longer working hours possible for some drivers occasionally, but those whose main work is driving will still be subject to effective limits. There is no clearly established connection between driving hours and fatigue.</q>
My hon. Friend the Member for Wigan (Mr. Stott) completely demolished that argument. It is clear that these regulations will be a charter for the exploitation of many drivers, that they will assist the activities of the many unscrupulous cowboys who have a presence in the industry and that they will damage the promotion of road safety.<br/>
The Minister went even further in his reply of 25 June, for he said:
<q>We believe that our proposals are consistent with our policy of reducing unnecessary burdens on industry while having proper regard to road safety. It will be up to trade unions and employers to negotiate together new patterns of work that would allow both drivers and operators to benefit fully from the increased flexibility now available to them."&#x2014;[<i>Official Report,</i> 25 June 1968; Vol. 100, c. 242.]</q>
That shows that this is all about lifting burdens on industry. As we know, that is a euphemism for enabling exploitation to occur as some people make profits.<br/>
The letter from Mr. Ashwell added:
<q>The 1968 Act dramatically reduced the weekly on-duty hours from 72 to 60 hours. Yet with worse road conditions, greater traffic congestion, larger vehicles, higher speeds overall, all demanding physical and mental requirements on drivers, your Department sees fit to remove restrictions. There is no enhancement in either the driver's working

environment or working conditions. In fact, longer hours lead to greater stress on drivers through increased fatigue. Your Department does not even pay lip service to occupational safety and health in road transport. Extending a driver's hours of work is contrary to existing medical evidence.</q>
Hon. Members have voiced their fears about the regulations. The Minister's pitiful attempts to justify the new provisions showed that the regulations are completely unsatisfactory and should be withdrawn immediately.</p>

<p>I am not a member of the Transport and General Workers Union but I am the holder of a class 1 heavy goods vehicle driver's licence, so I have experience of driving goods vehicles, filling in logbooks and so on which some hon. Members have been talking about.<br/>
I also represent a constituency that includes 30 miles of the Al trunk road that is not dual carriageway. My constituents will be worried about the prospect of drivers making their way home, perhaps at the end of their legal driving hours under the new flexible regulations. In such circumstances it is inevitable that people will be suffering from severe fatigue and there will be more accidents similar to those of the past.<br/>
We are all in favour of flexibility, but it must be compatible with safety. I want to draw the Minister's attention to paragraph 3(1) of part I of the schedule to the Community Drivers' Hours and Recording Equipment (Exemptions and Supplementary Provisions) Regulations, which says:
<q>Any vehicle which is being used by an agricultural, horticultural, forestry or fishery undertaking to carry goods within a 50 kilometre radius of the place where the vehicle is normally based, including local administrative areas the centres of which are situated within that radius.</q>
The Minister should ponder for a moment on the flexibility that that will provide in the far north of Scotland which my right hon. Friend the Member for Halton (Mr. Oakes) was talking about. The Highland region of Scotland extends to 10,000 square miles. I understand from the derogation that I have just quoted that it will be possible for anyone transporting timber, fish or agricultural produce within the whole of that area to be completely exempt from the drivers' hours regulations and from the tachograph regulations. Can such flexibility be justified?</p>

<p>I shall confine my remarks to the element of risk. The risk factor is mathematically calculable. There is a distinct risk that this ceiling could collapse. That is calculable. If any hon. Members think that is humorous, they should remember that the ceiling collapsed in another place, thankfully not on any of the Members and not causing severe damage. There is a risk that the seat on which the Minister now sits could collapse. That is calculable. There is an even greater risk that the seat which he represents in his constituency might be removed. That is certainly calculable.<br/>
There is even a risk that the Minister may give us straight answers to the questions that have been put to him and that he may choose a different tactic from that which


he adopted on 19 May when, in answer to questions by my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea (Mr. Dubs), he frivolously engaged in phrases about

<p>I am pointing out the risk that we may get straightforward answers to straightforward questions rather than hearing the Minister engaging in party games in the treatment of the nation's serious affairs. These statutory instruments are being given scant attention. All but two hon. Members have spoken vehemently and articulately against them. I hope that the Minister will treat them with the seriousness they deserve.<br/>
We have heard about wagons of fruit in Kent and about the lower incidence of risk in certain methods of transport. I represent a constituency in Cleveland where frequently ethylene oxide, caustic chlorine, highly concentrated sulphuric acid and other volatile and hazardous commodities are conveyed around the area. By increasing the hours of driving and the element of risk, we add to the danger of transporting such commodities.<br/>
If the Minister is content to run the risk of having to stand before us and report a major road traffic accident, he will also run the risk of having a name attached to him.</p>

<p>I begin by dealing with the speech of the right hon. Member for Blaenau Gwent (Mr. Foot). Once I met an old friend of his and, although this is probably an apocryphal story, when I asked him what the right hon. Member was like in his youth, and why he was such a good writer and made his newspaper so popular, his answer was that the right hon. Member was good at vituperation when he had not concentrated on the detail. The right hon. Member's remarks about the speech that I made earlier this evening are ones which in the light of day when perhaps he is feeling less tired, he will wish to reconsider. I would not ask for an apology, but I think he treated the House and my speech with a degree less of respect than might have been expected.<br/>
I assumed at the beginning of the debate that hon. Members wanted to be taken through the regulations. As the hon. Member for Wigan (Mr. Stott) said, they are complicated and technical, and they should not be made the subject of party politics. It is worth noting that not a single Opposition Member referred in detail to the regulations, or said which of them they regard as acceptable or unacceptable.<br/>
A number of serious points have been made on both sides of the House. I have had the opportunity to listen twice to Jack Ashwell, the national organiser of the Transport and General Workers Union. The union has some serious points to make and it performs a useful function in an industry that is difficult to organise. With better operators, with or without union representation, there is concern for the safety and welfare of the drivers. I pay tribute to the union&#x2014;as I would, even if I were not, as the hon. Member for Woolwich (Mr. Cartwright) pointed out, a member of the union.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for York (Mr. Gregory) referred to the personal logbooks of airline pilots. We shall consider that point. We remember the very grave doubts of the Transport and General Workers Union over the tachograph. For many years it was referred to as "the spy in the cab." I wonder whether the union or its members would favour a proposal that appeared to increase what could be interpreted as interference by the law in their lives.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Swindon (Mr. Coombs) and other hon. Members referred to the professionalism of heavy goods vehicle drivers. I emphasise the tributes that have been paid to them. Their standard of driving has improved. The safety of heavy goods vehicles has also been improved. The roads have also been getting better.<br/>
At the beginning of my speech I said that I thought that the new rules would benefit the drivers. Opposition Members and some of my hon. Friends have said that if drivers' hours are unduly extended, they will lead to greater fatigue and therefore to greater risk. That is self-evident. In my written reply I said that the link between drivers' hours and fatigue had not been clearly demonstrated, but that referred only to the narrow changes that we are discussing. I did not say that if people drive for hour after hour, or become involved in the kind of concoction that the hon. Member for Wigan described, there will not be a greater degree of risk.<br/>
Fatigue also affects those who are not the drivers of heavy goods vehicles. If hon. Members work through until about four o'clock in the morning, return to work at nine the same morning, work through until about eleven in the evening and after that, if it is a Thursday, drive for four or five hours back to their constituencies, I suspect that they are substantially more at risk of falling asleep at the wheel than are most heavy goods vehicle drivers.<br/>
If the maximum number of driving hours in a fortnight are reduced from 92 to 90, that is welcomed. If the requirement for normal weekly rest is increased from 40 to 45 hours, that is also welcomed. If the minimum break time for most drivers is increased from half an hour to three-quarters of an hour, that helps to deal with the point about 15 minutes which was also made in the debate. If it is made easier for drivers to vary their driving hours so that they can reach home and relax properly instead of being forced to sleep in their cabs, that, too, is welcomed.<br/>
I do not want to make too much of it, but it is fairly normal for a driver, because of congestion on the roads, to find that he has exceeded his hours, so he has to stop, find a telephone box and telephone his depot. Somebody has to drive a car to the vehicle and change places with the heavy goods vehicle driver. The new driver then takes the heavy goods vehicle back to the depot while the old driver takes the car back. That practice meets the letter of the law, but the flexibility provided by these regulations will reflect reality more, as long as there is compensation.<br/>
I was not surprised to see my hon. Friend the Member for Maidstone (Sir J. Wells) in the Chamber, and I listened carefully to his speech. He referred to the possibility of international drivers, carrying fruit through his constituency, having accidents. He also made an appropriate but non-specific reference to a recent accident in Maidstone. By regulations affecting drivers' hours and by every means possible, I am determined to improve safety. That may mean enforcing the tests on heavy vehicles,


where more could be done, or ensuring that there are more weight testing stations. Vehicles could then be checked for overloading, and for the number of drivers' hours.<br/>
In my speech, I mentioned a commitment to consult the drivers' unions and operators on how to make enforcement even more effective. I suspect that Britain's enforcement is the best in Europe, and that we take our rules much more seriously than some other countries. I hope to be able to work within the EC with both sides of the haulage industry. The best practices may then be spread, and we may be able to learn from others just as they can learn from us.<br/>
I actually welcomed some of the remarks of the right hon. Member for Blaenau Gwent. He is always worth listening to, but other hon. Members made rather more specific points. I am glad that the right hon. Member for Barnsley, Central (Mr. Mason) is in the Chamber. The Health and Safety Executive must be the enforcement authority, because under the Health and Safety at Work, etc. Act, there can only be one enforcement authority. We came to the view that as most mistakes or criminal errors among those carrying dangerous goods occurred at the place of loading, or at the place that the vehicle was operating from, it was better to transfer sole enforcement to the Health and Safety Executive. I explained carefully to a symposium in Middlesbrough, which was run by the Cleveland police, that safety was not being diminished. We can concentrate all the reports, some of which may draw prohibition notices. The police have the power, in effect, to take a vehicle off the road and to ensure that the report goes through.<br/>
I seriously believe that the new arrangements will lead to better safety as long as people get the right message. I could send the right hon. Member for Barnsley, Central a copy of the relevant press release, and he might then be able to join me in spreading what I hope is the right message. The hon. Member for Ealing, Southall (Mr. Bidwell) referred to his position as chairman of the Transport and General Workers Union group in Parliament. Two Opposition Members wrote to me quite separately from any representations made by that union. Most of the representations have come&#x2014;</p>

<p>I wish to raise before the House an issue of considerable significance to conservation generally which touches on the long-established interests of my constituents on the Wedholme Flow just off the Solway coastline, 10 miles west of Carlisle.<br/>
Wedholme Flow is one of the three largest sphagnum peat bogs in production in the United Kingdom. Through the years, the use of peat has changed. At the turn of the century peat from Wedholme was used to bind up the wounds of those wounded in the first world war. Indeed, in Scotland one thinks of Flanders moss as one of the best known sphagnum peat bogs. Then the peat was used as moss litter for bedding horses and, finally, peat has now been developed by the horticultural industry as a suitable medium for enriching the soil throughout the gardens of England.<br/>
Wedholme peat is rated as being the finest sphagnum peat produced in the United Kingdom, and, indeed, the wrapper on a bale of peat produced there states,
<q>internationally acclaimed Golden Moss Peat the world's finest Sphagnum Moss Peat".</q>
The peat works are an integral part of the small community around Kirkbride and peat has been cut there for over two centuries. In the Enclosures Act 1816, an area of peat moss was allocated to named individuals actually residing at that time within the parish who became in effect the freehold owners. The principle of the award was a residential qualification. Every household was apportioned a strip approximately one chain wide and extending to an area of about three acres. A similar award was made to Newton Arlosh parish in 1814. These are, therefore, long-established rights worked over many years by the residents of Kirkbride and Newton Arlosh.<br/>
However, over the past few months a cloud has been hanging over the moss. The Nature Conservancy Council is endowed by Parliament with important functions which my constituents appreciate. In 1959, just over a third of Wedholme Flow was designated a site of special scientific interest. Some 270 hectares was so designated. Mr. D. A. Radcliffe, the chief scientist for the Nature Conservancy Council, in 1977 wrote in his book "A Nature Conservation Review" that Wedholme Flow,
<q>forms a single extensive raised mire unit, but is severely modified and &#x2026;only a very limited section of the mire system is now viable".</q>
By "viable" Mr. Radcliffe means viable for conservation purposes, and he goes on to note that
<q>the area of intact Sphagnum rich raised mire vegetation is now reduced by cutting and by recent fires to a section about 0&#x00B7;4 kilometres long by only 90&#x2013;180 metres wide.</q>
The maximum area, therefore, intact is only just short of 18 acres and yet some 667 acres have been included within the original site of special scientific interest. Now with its richer purse, the Nature Conservancy Council is having another bite at the cherry and it wants to include some 780 hectares or almost 2,000 acres, which is more than 100 times the size of the original unspoilt part.<br/>
The stint owners now face a greatly enlarged SSSI. In support of its notification, the council has published a great list of species alleged to be special on the moss, but


my constituents' researches have revealed that only one species on the entire list is not a "bog standard" species. Indeed, nearly all the species are listed and drawn on a poster produced for children describing sphagnum bogs and produced by the British museum. As part of its extension of operations, the council proposes to raise the level of the water table which will make the bog unviable to work for peat cutting and will undermine the areas of grassland on the fringe which for some reason the council has decided to include, which have been grant aided for drainage purposes in the past. Indeed, it is ironic that the only species of any rarity on the moss, Sphagnum Molle, like a dry site and the Council's very efforts to alter the hydrology of the district could kill the only species that can be said to be in any way rare.<br/>
My constituents have consulted one of Britain's top experts on peat and he has confirmed that, whilst the existing SSSI is indeed special, there is no justification for extending it by more than 100 times. The Nature Conservancy believes, apparently, that in order to protect the existing SSSI it needs a huge buffer zone where it can control the activities which would &#x2014; in its view &#x2014; endanger the existence of the current site. However, my constituents' specialist has confirmed that the two areas are quite hydrologically separate and therefore there is no need for such a large buffer zone. Nor is there anything special on the proposed extension of the SSSI which would justify the designation as "special". The whole of the stint owners' area has been worked on for over two centuries, and there is no way that the original mire can be intact, and we come back with the basic question, what is so special about the site? Is this really a site of special scientific interest? Why have there been no scientific papers written on Wedholme Flow in the past? Why have students of flora and fauna not been flocking there?<br/>
Unless it is thought that the existing peat workings are injurious to conservation, it must be explained that this is not the case. Even on areas which have been worked, these are now returning to a sphagnum lawn&#x2014;even near drained farmland.<br/>
At the core of this application is the council's assertion that it needs this massive amount of extra land to protect the existing site. What expert evidence has the council for this assertion? It wishes to raise the water table but has not produced a detailed hydrology report on what the proposals would mean for the water table, nor has the council provided a proper detailed scientific analysis of the bog. My constituents' expert has said that the two areas are hydrologically separate and one could not support the other. This is borne out by a Mr. D. A. Greg, who was commissioned by the NCC in 1975 to make a report on the various mosses in the area. In his report he states:
<q>On a large scale Wedholme Flow can be divided into three areas. The central band of peat workings spreads right across the bog from east to west leaving two sections of raised bog which are isolated from each other.</q>
The council seems to be relying on this report and that of a busy young lady, Miss Jane Smart, who in November 1980 recommended that the SSSI boundary be extended. She visited four bogs between 1 August and 5 August 1980 before reaching this conclusion on Wedholme Flow&#x2014;but even then she said:
<q>A full survey would need to be carried out to determine the precise limits of the area.</q>
Where is the NCC's

<q>full survey to determine the precise limits"?</q>
In lieu of that survey, is the council going for a catch-all 2,000-acre plot instead?<br/>
Having established that the flow is not special, how do my constituents challenge the NCC? The Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 and the subsequent financial guidelines for management agreement make no provision for compensation for members of the public who defend their own and who protect their family's long-cherished property. My constituents have been advised that they must now seek professional advice, which will obviously cost them considerable sums of money. How do they best protect their own, when taking on the might of the Nature Conservancy Council, with its far greater financial purse?<br/>
The council has listed an impressive array of 28 operations likely to damage the special interest which completely erodes the basic fundamentals of ownership of the land. The stint owners have been advised that the only way that they can achieve proper compensation is if planning would have been forthcoming for their part of the bog. This has been no problem in the past, and the stint owners would naturally expect to sell part of their bog to the commercial company operating the peat working there. Very little land in acreage terms is involved, but it is a right that the stint owners have exercised for 200 years and a right that they wish to pass on to their children, grandchildren and great grandchildren. They will now be deprived of that right, because the county council will automatically reject any planning permission for commercial peat workings if the NCC expresses an interest in the land. In any event, if the council raises the water table, the place will be too wet for milling and selling of peat and all workings will become worthless. That could have severe employment repercussions for the area in the longer term.<br/>
A further scandalous part of the council's powers is its position as judge and jury. If the stint owners apply for planning permission for their area for commercial peat extraction, who does the county planning authority have to consult? None other than the Nature Conservancy Council. And will the council give its approval to further peat extraction if it means it having to fork out four, five or six times the amount of compensation than if planning permission was not forthcoming? Clearly the council has a vested interest to say no to further planning consent to extend its ambitions to acquire the land. The stint owners are caught in a classic Catch 22 situation&#x2014;if they apply for planning consent, nothing can be more certain than that the council will be unable to find a reason for granting consent.<br/>
One other worrying feature of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 is that it introduces no independent body to assess whether those sites are of special scientific interest. Section 28(1) states:
<q>Where the Nature Conservancy Council are of the opinion that any area of land is of special interest by reason of any of its flora, fauna, or geological of physiographical features, it shall be the duty of the Council to notify that fact.</q>
Why should the stint owners have to resort to judicial review to assess whether the council has properly assessed the site as being special in its entirety? Why is there no provision for independent consultants to give their opinion?<br/>
In this instance, the council has not begun to attempt to satisfy the scientific interests of the stint owners as to


its proposals. More seriously, it has completely overlooked the terms of section 37 of the Countryside Act 1968, as amended. The section reads:
<q>In the exercise of their functions under this Act and the Act of 1949</q>
and the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, it shall be the duty of every Minister, and of the Countryside Commission, the Nature Conservancy Council and local authorities,
<q>to have clue regard to the needs of agriculture and forestry and to the economic and social interests of rural areas.</q>
Can it be in the economic and social interests of rural areas to bring about a cessation of all peat workings to attempt to expropriate their land with as little compensation as possible? Is not the enclosure award of 1816 of equal historic and hence scientific interest? For two centuries now, peat from the flow has gone to heat the houses of the residents, to dress the wounds of the afflicted in the first world war and to bed Army horses. Now the produce of Wedholme flow is being spread, even on this very day, among the gardens of England, including my own, introducing conservation and beauty into the back streets of the depressed areas of England &#x2014;I include my back garden in that description&#x0021; Has the council really had,
<q>due regard to the needs of agriculture and forestry and the economic and social interests of rural areas</q>
in its desire to control this land? Does it really need 100 times the special mire area, when it already has under its control a large number of mosses and bogs, including Glasson Moss, of more than 259 hectares, and Bowness common, of 802 hectares? Indeed, the Bowness common notification is very similar in terms to that of Wedholme flow.<br/>
I must say to my hon. Friend the Minister in conclusion that I consider this a form of back-door nationalisation. I see no need for the NCC to take over all that extra land when there is more variety of surface microtopography on the existing SSSI. This is too complicated an issue to go into in this short debate, and I hope that my hon. Friend will agree to a meeting between herself and representatives of the stint owners who are affected. I hope that when she replies she will agree that commercial workings of peat and conservation of bogs can go hand in hand, and I hope that she will conclude from the evidence I have given her tonight that an extended Wedholme Flow is not really all that special.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend the Member for Penrith and The Border (Mr. Maclean) has raised with considerable eloquence and forthrightness a number of important issues relating to the present system for selecting and notifying sites of special scientific interest and the impact of SSSI notification on the owners and occupiers of the land concerned. I shall try to deal with them as fully as possible in a way which I hope will demonstrate that the current arrangements are both necessary and appropriate.<br/>
As my hon. Friend has said, under section 28 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, the Nature Conservancy Council has a statutory duty to notify as an SSSI, land which is in its opinion of special interest by virtue of its flora, fauna or geological or physiographical features.<br/>
In the case of Wedholme Flow, in my hon. Friend's constituency, the site is an extensive lowland raised mire, which is the largest of a series of raised mires on the south Solway plain, as he describe. They now represent the largest and finest concentration of that particular type of habitat in Britain. Lowland raised mires have, since the 1800s, been subject to significant losses. I am advised by the Nature Conservancy Council that the total remaining area of the habitat in Britain, which now possesses relatively few major concentrations of such bogs, amounts to approximately 1,800 hectares, of which almost half is within the north Cumbria complex.<br/>
Wedholme Flow is thus one of the largest and best remaining examples of the lowland raised bog habitat in Britain. It also possesses great conservation interest, and that has been recognised through its notification as a site of special scientific interest.<br/>
My hon. Friend inquired at length about the basis of the decision. I am advised that the NCC in fact conducted a considerable amount of scientific research over a substantial period before deciding on the area of the site to be renotified. Since as long ago as 1959, the site has been under continuous study by the NCC and others and several scientific reports, including those to which my hon. Friend&#x2014;referred have been produced. I have not had the opportunity to study all of them in detail, but I understand that they confirm the importance of Wedholme Flow in conservation terms, and I should point out that, although the area of the original SSSI is of slightly higher quality, the northern area &#x2014; that is the part within the proposed extension of the SSSI &#x2014; is richer in species and has substantial conservation interest.<br/>
In 1984 and 1985 the NCC carried out detailed scientific surveys of the site, which involved the careful identification and recording of data on the species of the area and investigations of the topography of the basin in which the site is located, the surface contours and peat depth. The outcome of that work has confirmed that the whole of the renotified site is a single and discrete hydrological unit rather than several separate units, as has been suggested by some others. The NCC's decision was a careful and informed one and was based on detailed scientific investigations. The NCC concluded that the extension of the area of the SSSI was necessary for two reasons.<br/>
First, the additional area is considered by the NCC to have sufficient intrinsic scientific interest to merit notification in its own right. The totality of the site is important. The section comprising the Newton Artosh peat awards includes the best intact raised bog surface, with original surface pattening, in England. It supports a complete range of raised bog vegetation from high hummock vegetation to aquatic pool vegetation. It also supports several rare plant species such as bog rosemary, several rare sphagnums and all three of the sundews.<br/>
Secondly, knowledge of peatland hydrology has increased significantly since the original notification of the site. Since the early 1980s, the NCC's understanding of peat hydrology has been radically changed as a result of its own researches and there has been a series of publications by British and European specialists. I have a list of these publications, which I will send to my hon. Friend if he considers that they would be helpful.<br/>
This body of informed scientific opinion now suggests that, if the existing conservation interest of the site is to be maintained, it is necessary to ensure that the whole of the


basin in which Wedholme Flow is located, rather than just a proportion of it, needs to be conserved. Because the existing SSSI and the northern extension form one hydrological area, if the northern extension was not included, peat digging would continue and the quality of the whole mire would deteriorate. This would lead to the loss of peat deposits, peat wastage, the threat of oxidation, drying out of the surface, the loss of pattening and the loss of vegetation areas, and the part that forms an integral part of this basin and is thus important to the well-being of the site as a whole.<br/>
Having said all that, however, and in the light of my hon. Friend's constituents' specialist views, the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 procedure includes provision for interested persons to make representations or objections to the NCC concerning particular notifications. The NCC is statutorily required to consider such representations or objections in deciding whether a particular notification should be confirmed and could be challenged if it failed to do so.<br/>
I therefore suggest that if my hon. Friend believes that his evidence suggests that the NCC may have got it wrong in this case, he should pass this to the NCC as soon as possible so that its objection procedures can proceed, as set out in the Act.<br/>
The NCC is a responsible scientific body and I am satisfied that it will give careful and objective consideration to any objections or representations of this kind. I do not think that it would be appropriate for the Government to seek to intervene.<br/>
Now, as my hon. Friend knows, having notified the site, the NCC considers that the continued extraction of peat from Wedholme Flow would be incompatible with the maintenance of the conservation interest of the site and has therefore included peat extraction in the list of potentially damaging operations. That means that owners or occupiers who wish to extract peat from the site, on whatever scale, would need to go through the statutory notice procedures set out in section 28 of the Act. All this my hon. Friend has clearly understood and also clearly rather dislikes. However, this would enable the NCC to consider the impact of particular proposals and, if necessary, to explore the possibility of protecting the site through some form of voluntary agreement that could include provision for payment and compensation.<br/>
As to the effect of SSSI notification on those with ancient rights to cut peat, I understand that, in the case of those who currently exercise the right to take peat for domestic purposes it has been the NCC's normal practice to grant a time-limited consent for such operations for a period of two years.<br/>
It is during this two-year period that the NCC would try to reach agreement with the stint holders concerned about ways of conserving the special interest of the site. That could involve the payment of compensation in respect of the value of the peat not cut. Alternatively, the NCC might be prepared to offer to buy out the stint or even to direct the peat cutting to another area of the site where it could go ahead without serious damage to the conservation interest.<br/>
There are, however, a number of stint holders who do not currently exercise their rights and would thus be ineligible for compensation. It seems to me logical that compensation should not be payable in respect of rights

which are currently not being exercised, the suspension of which would not result in any actual loss to the stint holders concerned.<br/>
The arrangements whereby the NCC has to be consulted on all planning applications affecting SSSIs are designed to ensure that, in deciding such applications, conservation factors are given due weight along with other relevant facts and arguments. This procedure provides an important safeguard for some of the most important areas of our national heritage. It is true that the NCC would not compensate the owner or occupier of an SSSI for not carrying out an operation for which planning permission had been reflected, possibly on NCC advice. I can see nothing objectionable in that.<br/>
Owners of other types of land who are refused planning permission do not, as a general rule, have any entitlement to compensation. It would, in my view, be inequitable to treat owners of SSSIs more favourably, and would indeed give them a positive incentive to put forward damaging proposals.<br/>
As for the general arrangements for notifying SSSIs, my hon. Friend has suggested that the cards are stacked against owners and occupiers of such land and that they should therefore be given a right of appeal against SSSI notification. I do not think that the current system is weighted against the interests of owners or occupiers or that the existing safeguards for such interests are inadequate. I shall briefly explain why.<br/>
The machinery in section 28 is essentially a delaying mechanism. Its purpose is to provide a period of temporary protection for a site &#x2014; four months &#x2014; to enable the NCC to discuss, and if possible agree, with the landowner or occupier, suitable arrangements for the long-term management of the land. Landowners may thus be constrained only for a maximum of four months by notification of their land as an SSSI. Unless during this period the land were to become subject to some other form of statutory constraint, the owner would thereafter be free to proceed with whatever operations he wished, subject of course to the necessary consent under planning legislation. Parliament therefore concluded that SSSI notification does not involve any ultimate loss of rights over land and decided that an appeals machinery was unnecessary. This remains the Government's view.<br/>
If voluntary agreement cannot be reached during the four-month protection period, the NCC could ask the Secretary of State to make a nature conservation order to extend the period of protection for up to 12 months. Alternatively, it could seek to acquire the land compulsorily by asking the Secretary of State to approve a compulsory purchase order. In the case of a proposed nature conservation order or a CPO, the landowners would have a statutory right to object to the proposals and to have their objections tested against the NCC's case at a public inquiry. Indeed, several nature conservation orders have been challenged in this way and one has been revoked. It seems that the existing arrangements contain sufficient safeguards for the rights of landowners.<br/>
The NCC has a duty under section 37 of the Countryside Act 1968 to consider the economic and social interests of rural areas, which my hon. Friend has mentioned. The NCC is very aware of this duty in carrying out its other and equally important duty to notify SSSIs. Its procedures are designed to ensure that these considerations are given due weight in decisions affecting individual sites. The NCC accordingly consults my own


Department, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the Forestry Commission and local and water authorities about all extensions to SSSIs, and would take careful account of any comments or observations from any of these committees.<br/>
Another important safeguard is that all renotification proposals have to be approved in advance by the appropriate NCC advisory committee. These committees, which are in effect the NCC's board of directors, are broadly based and include representatives of farming and landowning interests as well as scientists and academics. The composition of these committees ensures that the NCC's renotification proposals are subject to the scrutiny of a wide range of interests other than purely conservationalists. However, the fact that section 37 considerations have to be taken into account does not mean that they will always win, and there will inevitably be occasions when the interests of conservation should be given precedence over economic or social considerations.<br/>
I hope that it will be clear from this explanation of the background that the procedure for the notification of sites

of special scientific interest and their protection are designed to facilitate and encourage discussion, negotiation and voluntary co-operation. They are intended to provide a period of protection for the land, a breathing space, during which the Nature Conservancy Council can explain to owners and occupiers the nature of the importance of a site in conservaion terms, and discuss with them suitable and mutually acceptable arrangements for the future management of the land.<br/>
I hope that I have managed to convince my hon. Friend that the arrangements set out in the 1981 Act strike a fair and reasonable balance between the legitimate interests of landowners and occupiers and the need to conserve the natural heritage. However, if he wishes to bring the stint holders to discuss this matter more fully with me, I would be more than happy to meet them at a mutually convenient time and place.<br/>
