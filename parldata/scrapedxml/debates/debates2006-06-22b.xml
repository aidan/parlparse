	<p pid="b.1447.2/1">I thank the Minister for his reply. When he next holds discussions with the Department for Communities and Local Government on water supplies, will he support its view that 200,000 extra homes will lead to only one in 1,000 increase in total water use or that of Professor McDonald, as expressed in the eighth report of the House of Lords Science and Technology Committee, that the prediction of a minor increase in water demand is at odds with every other forecast?</p>

That is why DEFRA, the Environment Agency and Natural England are working closely with the Department for Communities and Local Government on its new growth point scheme. As part of that, we are closely considering water supplies, sewerage infrastructure, flood risk and biodiversity. It is right that any proposals must balance social, economic and environmental sustainability. We will not accept proposals that we believe would damage the environment or that did not provide for adequate water supplies.</p>

	<p pid="b.1449.2/1">I am not responsible for the planning processes. Water companies' 25-year water resources plans often include schemes for building new reservoirs and for extending existing ones, and it is right that such schemes should go through a robust planning process because people have to be consulted on these matters. However, the whole House will agree that planning processes should be as efficient as possible. The Government have done quite a lot to speed up such processes, but they should not be speeded up at the expense of individual rights.</p>

	<p pid="b.1450.4/1">I hope that the Minister agrees that if any target is to be meaningful, it must include aviation, which, as he will know, presents a major threat. If that continues at the same rate, it will cancel out all the gains made in other sectors. Does the Minister accept that while emissions trading is a useful tool which represents a step forward, it is not enough in itself to halt the inexorable rise of aviation? Does he accept that when one of my constituents goes to Spain and back by air solely to buy fags and beer cheaply, the price of aviation must increase?</p>

	<p pid="b.1451.1/1">My hon. Friend makes an important point. Let me say two things to him. First, by 205030 per cent. of houses will have been built since the introduction of the new building regulations, which represents a 40 per cent. improvement in energy efficiency in new housing. Secondly, I believe that there should be cross-party support for the home information packs that will be introduced next year. They will include an energy rating of every household, which has never been available before. They will also tell householders how they can cut energy emissions, and how they can save themselves money. <i> [Interruption.] </i>If the Conservative party opposes a measure that is both green and economic, it needs to re-examine its policies.</p>

	<p pid="b.1451.5/1">That, too, is an important point. I think that I am right in saying that more or less every citizen is responsible for an average emission of about3 tonnes of carbon a year. If we are to meet our 2050 targets, we will have to reduce that to 1 tonne, which means thinking about our own footprint. I have the impression, from my constituency and elsewhere, that the younger generation&mdash;those at school&mdash;are ahead of the game when it comes to thinking about their carbon footprint, but we must do as much as we can nevertheless, and I will certainly explore my hon.

	<p pid="b.1458.3/1">The hon. Lady is right that there is huge potential for combined heat and power&mdash;and also for energy from waste, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1573" name="David Burrowes">the hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate (Mr. Burrowes)</phrase> suggested. However, she is wrong to suggest that countries on the continent are moving away from recycling. In percentage terms, there may be a slight downward trend in their domestic recycling, but they are still far ahead of us in terms of how much they recycle. I can give the hon. Lady the figures; in Sweden, for example, the recycling rate is 38 per cent. and 45 per cent. for waste-to-energy. Although our recycling levels have trebled under this Labour Government, they are still down at only about 25 per cent.</p>

	<p pid="b.1462.3/1">That is rather a lot of questions. I have nothing further to add to what I said about timing. The hon. Gentleman acknowledged in his question that there had been 47,000 responses to the consultation, which may be a record for any Government consultation. Of course, it is important that the Government take those representations seriously, and that we study the science. On the hon. Gentleman's point about compensation, he is aware that a number of independent reports have criticised the Government and the Welsh Assembly for seriously over-compensating farmers for TB reactors and that we have a new system based on table valuations, with 47 categories. That was consulted on twice. We are always looking at ways to improve the system but it is already proving extremely effective in addressing the serious issue of over-compensation that occurred previously.</p>

	<p pid="b.1464.2/1">The hon. Gentleman should appreciate, if he does not already, that the UK has an extremely good record on fish health&mdash;probably among the best of any member of the European Union. We want to keep these diseases out. I am afraid that I cannot give him an answer to his last point about where the disease came from. We simply do not know at the moment, but there is an intensive epidemiological investigation under way. If we get a better idea, we will keep the House informed. The cost depends on how many businesses are ultimately affected. My understanding is that the businesses that are worst affected at the moment&mdash;as raised by the hon. Member for Ryedale and one or two others&mdash;are those that move fish out to other fish farms for breeding or catching. The majority of the fish farms in the area that are producing trout and other fish for consumption should not be affected, because, once those fish have been killed and gutted, there is nothing to restrict them from being exported to shops and sold in the normal way.</p>

	<p pid="b.1468.4/1">What are the right hon. Gentleman's intentions regarding a welfare reform Bill? The consultation paper from the Department for Work and Pensions makes the process clear:</p>
	<p pid="b.1468.4/2" class="indent">&quot;The timescale is now pressing (given that we intend to have the new Employment and Support Allowance in place from 2008). We therefore hope to introduce a Welfare ReformBill in this Parliamentary session and to seek Royal Assent by Easter 2007.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1468.4/3">Is it the intention to introduce a Bill before the summer recess, and is it the right hon. Gentleman's intention that it should be carried over to the next parliamentary Session, which is the only conclusion that we can draw from the statement in the White Paper?</p>
	<p pid="b.1468.4/4">Once again, can I ask for a debate on post offices? I accept that this is a well-worn track, as the issue has been raised by many hon. Members on both sides of the House, but it remains a pressing need. I will receive two petitions this weekend from constituents who are concerned about the future of their local post offices. I did not organise those petitions&mdash;they were organised by my constituents, who are worried about the future of their local post office. There is a pressing need to hold a debate, because the termination of the Post Office card account has been announced, and sub-post offices have lost the right to issue the BBC television licence. I understand that, next year, the contract with the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency for the issuing of the road fund licence is to end. Before a decision is made to give that contract to someone else, can we have a debate in the House on the future of the Post Office?</p>
	<p pid="b.1468.4/5">Finally, as the nights are now drawing in, may I set the scene for our consideration late in the evening and ask for a debate on the conundrum of ministerial responsibility, which puzzles all of us? Yesterday, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1893" name="John Randall">the hon. Member for Uxbridge (Mr. Randall)</phrase> asked a question about the new post of liveability Minister. The Prime Minister did not deny that he was going to make such an appointment, but he did not confirm it, nor did he give any indication of who would be the liveability Minister. However, he said:</p>
	<p pid="b.1468.4/6" class="indent">&quot;Liveability is the ability of local communities to be freefrom crime and fear&quot;.&mdash;[<i> Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-21">21 June 2006</phrase>; Vol. 447, c. 1315.]</p>
	<p pid="b.1468.4/7">I take the old-fashioned view that making sure that communities are free from crime and fear is the job of the Home Secretary, so is that a responsibility of which he has now officially divested himself?</p>

	<p pid="b.1469.0/1">On a welfare reform Bill, we hope to introduce such a measure. It is a candidate for carry-over, on which there will be consultations with the usual channels. The hon. Gentleman asked for a debate on post offices, implying that there had not been any debates on the financing of rural post offices. However, there have been a great many, not least on the Adjournment and in Westminster Hall. He will know that because of changes to the way in which people communicate with one another and in banking practice, the Post Office operates in a more commercial environment. No, I cannot promise a debate before a decision is made by the Post Office&mdash;and not by Ministers&mdash;on whether it can win a contract with, for example, the DVLA, because that is a matter between the DVLA and the Post Office. Of course, issues of public service will be taken fully into account. Notwithstanding the closure of some post offices,99 per cent. of people in urban areas&mdash;I accept that the figure is lower in rural areas&mdash;live within a mile of their local post office, and the network of post offices is still substantial. In addition, the level of subsidy from the public purse to support the network in rural areas is still very high.</p>
	<p pid="b.1469.0/2">On the interesting issue of ministerial responsibilities and liveability, we are all responsible for making sure that our communities are liveable, but I wish that a different word had been chosen&mdash;</p>

My hon. Friend's experience of knowing about offenders and making representations, and the subsequent decision of my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary, all suggest that that policy is working. However, my right hon. Friend has announced that a Home Office Minister will go to America to consider the current application of what has been called Megan's law. As I have said publicly, six years after the murder of Sarah Payne and the measures that we originally introduced, it is appropriate to consider whether we can draw on experience from overseas.</p>

	<p pid="b.1478.1/1">With permissionMr. Speaker, I shall make a statement on the Rural Payments Agency. In my written statement on <phrase class="date" code="">9 May</phrase>, I promised to keep the House informed on progress made by the RPA on the single payments scheme. At oral questions today, no questions on the SPS were on the Order Paper. I therefore thought it right to give hon. Members the chance to raise the issue.</p>
	<p pid="b.1478.1/2">In summary, there has been some progress, but the situation is far from satisfactory. As of <phrase class="date" code="">Tuesday 20 June</phrase>, some &pound;1.38 billion, representing more than 90 per cent. of the total fund, has now been paid to more than 100,000 applicants; 82,571 claims have been settled in full, and 18,785 applicants have received a partial payment and are awaiting their &quot;top-up&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.1478.1/3">On <phrase class="date" code="">9 May</phrase>, I said that the priority for the RPA would be claims of more than &euro;1,000 Euro where no payment had been made. The number of claimants in that category is now approximately 2,300. I recognise the hardship involved for them and deeply regret the distress caused. The RPA is taking further steps to pay those complex claims, including discussing issues direct with claimants and, when feasible, bringing parties together in cases of continuing disagreement&mdash;for example, when two or more parties have made a claim for the same piece of land. The RPA has written twice to all the individuals concerned.</p>
	<p pid="b.1478.1/4">I also recognise the importance of the unresolved hill farm allowance payments. Of the approximately 10,500 eligible HFA claims, 5,000 have been paid in full and a further 900 authorised for partial payments. Full and partial payments are continuing to be made.</p>
	<p pid="b.1478.1/5">The EU defined payment window for making 2005 SPS payments runs from <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-01">1 December 2005</phrase> until<phrase class="date" code="">30 June</phrase> this year. Work is continuing to pay as many claims as possible by <phrase class="date" code="">30 June</phrase>. However, farming leaders have made representations to me on behalf of the farmers who do not receive the full sum due to them during the legal payment window. I have therefore authorised the RPA to make interest payments at the London Interbank offered rate plus 1 per cent. calculated from <phrase class="date" code="">1 July</phrase>, in respect of any payments where responsibility for the delay rests with the RPA. That will be subject to a minimum interest payment level of &pound;50. Further details will be given on the timing of those payments once the RPA has assessed how they can be integrated most effectively into the existing payment schedule.</p>
	<p pid="b.1478.1/6">Work on delivery of the 2006 scheme to be paid between <phrase class="date" code="">1 December</phrase> this year and <phrase class="date" code="">30 June</phrase> next year is under way. As I said on <phrase class="date" code="">9 May</phrase> and want to repeat today, the 2006 scheme year will be challenging. The RPA's interim chief executive, Tony Cooper, has made an initial assessment of the task ahead. He has confirmed that, in respect of customer service and management information, there is no quick fix. Possible options for the 2007 scheme&mdash;for example, the use of a minimum payment level&mdash;are not available for 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.1478.1/7">Against this background, farming leaders have understandably called for partial payments to be made in 2006, as they were in 2005. I have discussed the need for the necessary EU legislation to make partial payments with the Commissioner, Mrs. Fisher-Boel, and authorised the RPA to start work on the necessary systems. However, until the RPA chief executive has had an opportunity to make a realistic assessment of the prospects for full payments, I do not want to commit to a particular timetable or specify whether or when partial payments might be necessary. Initial validation of the 2006 claims is under way, and detailed validation should start next month. By the time the House returns after the summer recess, therefore, we should have a better understanding of the prospects for the 2006 scheme, and I will make a further statement then.</p>
	<p pid="b.1478.1/8">Given the position on the 2006 scheme, I have decided to simplify to the maximum extent possible the arrangements for the incorporation into the single payment scheme of additional support arising from last November's landmark EU sugar reform. In practice, that means that the &pound;52 million concerned will be added entirely to the entitlements held by sugar beet producers who meet the defined criteria, rather than some of the funds being used to increase the flat rate value of all entitlements. Further details, including on arrangements for 2007, will be announced in due course.</p>
	<p pid="b.1478.1/9">I can also report that an EU regulation has been adopted which provides for all 2006 claims to be accepted without penalty until <phrase class="date" code="">15 June</phrase>. Under the original timetable, the limit would have been <phrase class="date" code="">15 May</phrase>. This extra time above and beyond the extension to <phrase class="date" code="">31 May</phrase>&mdash;to which I referred in my statement on <phrase class="date" code="">9 May</phrase>&mdash;will mean that around 4,000 farmers will not now be penalised. I am sure that the whole House will join me in expressing my gratitude to the European Commission for its understanding on this issue.</p>
	<p pid="b.1478.1/10">The fundamental review of the RPA that the then Secretary of State, my right hon. Friend the present Foreign Secretary, set in train earlier this year will be important for the future of the RPA when it reports at the end of this year. In the meantime, I know that this year's problems have caused real distress and I repeat the apology to farmers that I have made before, both in the House and elsewhere. I can assure the House that the new RPA chief executive, with the support of the Department, will be looking to take interim steps to aid the recovery process and to improve the experience of farmers dealing with the agency to the maximum possible extent. I will keep the House informed as matters progress.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-06-22b.1479.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1857" speakername="Peter Ainsworth" colnum="1479"  time="012:16:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060622/debtext/60622-0628.htm#06062258000601">
	<p pid="b.1479.0/1">I am grateful to the Secretary of State for keeping the House informed of the modest progress that is being made to deal with this problem. It is unfortunate, Mr. Speaker, that the BBC's &quot;Farming Today&quot; programme probably heard about this statement before you did&mdash;but that is life these days, under new Labour. As I said, it is good to hear that modest progress is being made to address this appalling fiasco, which has brought added hardship to many in the farming community and related industries at a time of profound change, uncertainty and stress.</p>
	<p pid="b.1479.0/2">Many questions remain to be answered, however. How did the problems arise in the first place? What happens next? The Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee is conducting an inquiry into what went wrong. Will the Secretary of State give an assurance that the Committee will be given access to all the information that it needs to form a balanced, accurate and comprehensive view of the events that led to the failure to make payments on time? The Committee's inquiry has already produced some interesting evidence, and we look forward to its findings with great interest. Meanwhile, the BBC's &quot;File on 4&quot; programme has disclosed that the Office of Government Commerce gateway review was warning two years ago that there were severe problems with delivering the new system. Why were those warnings ignored?</p>
	<p pid="b.1479.0/3">I welcome the announcement that the Government will start paying interest on the money that they owe from <phrase class="date" code="">1 July</phrase>. But what about the people who are entitled to payment but have received nothing for the six months before <phrase class="date" code="">30 June</phrase>? Those people have been put at ahuge competitive disadvantage by the Government's incompetence, denial and mismanagement, and have been forced to take out commercial loans. The Secretary of State said that 90 per cent. of the total fund had now been paid, but he did not say&mdash;unless I missed something&mdash;how many claimants remained unpaid. I would be grateful if he could give us that information. Will he also tell us whether the hill livestock allowance claimants will benefit from the initiative on interest payments that he has announced today?</p>
	<p pid="b.1479.0/4">How many farmers will receive compensation equal to the salary of the sacked chief executive of the Rural Payments Agency, who, as I understand it, is still on the payroll but doing nothing? What estimate has the Secretary of State made of the total bank interest paid to date by the farming sector in England as a result of his Department's failure? What estimate has he made of the likely cost to British taxpayers of the Government's failure to meet the <phrase class="date" code="">30 June</phrase> deadline? Are we to assume that the Government's humiliating plea to the European Union for an extension beyond that deadline has been refused? What discussions has he had with the EU Commission about the fines that Britain will have to pay for this failure? What discussions has he had with the Chancellor about which budget the fines will be paid out of? If they will be paid out of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs budget, what will the Secretary of State cut in order to pay them? Or will they come from some other source?</p>
	<p pid="b.1479.0/5">Does the Secretary of State realise that the RPA is still getting its field data wrong and making wildly inaccurate partial payments? Will he tell us how many overpayments and underpayments have been recorded, and give us the value in each case? Can he give us the date on which he expects the 2005 payments to have been completed? Is he really unable to give us a date by which farmers can expect to receive their cheques for 2006? Can he guarantee that the UK will not face fines a second time?</p>
	<p pid="b.1479.0/6">Much has been made by Ministers of the hard work of the staff at the Rural Payments Agency, and I am sure that the majority of them have worked very hard to sort out the mess that their political masters have created. Will the Secretary of State take this opportunity to comment, however, on press reports about RPA staff who, even as calls to the rural stress network reached record levels, were cavorting naked in the office and hiding cups full of vomit in office cupboards?</p>
	<p pid="b.1479.0/7">We detected a bad smell about the handling of the single farm payment last year, but the Government denied that there was a problem. We called last year for the Government to introduce a partial payment scheme. Their refusal to open up that option at the time cost the farming community millions of pounds. We called on Ministers to return to farmers the interest that they had paid because of the Government's failure, but again the door was closed. It has taken months for them to accept any financial liability at all. Every time we prise open the door on this wretched affair a little further, the smell gets worse.</p>

	<p pid="b.1481.2/1">If the hon. Gentleman will just contain himself, I can assure him that he will get the full picture. As I was saying, 2,300 claimants of more than &euro;1,000 have not been paid, and about 12,000&mdash;it might be 12,200&mdash;claims of less than &euro;1,000 have not been paid.</p>
	<p pid="b.1481.2/2">As for <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1857" name="Peter Ainsworth">the taxpayers, the hon. Member for East Surrey (Mr. Ainsworth)</phrase> will know that the European Commission requirement is not to pay 100 per cent. of the payments by the deadline. Obviously, some people die, and there are other reasons involved. The target is a 96.1 per cent. payment for the UK as a whole&mdash;this will be of interest to Members from outside England&mdash;and our commitment is to make as many payments as possible by <phrase class="date" code="">30 June</phrase>. It would be wrong for me to make predictions, especially given the history of some previous predictions, but we have now reached over90 per cent. for England, and we are trying to make as many payments as we can as soon as possible.</p>
	<p pid="b.1481.2/3">As for the completion of the 2005 scheme, which relates to the <phrase class="date" code="">30 June</phrase> question, I have said that I want to meet as many claims as possible as fast as possible. The RPA is dealing with that, but I see no value in my making predictions about when the process will be completed.</p>
	<p pid="b.1481.2/4">Finally, in respect of 2006, I think it right for me to say that our first commitment should be to seek every opportunity to make full payments, but if full payments are not possible, we have the backstop of partial payments. We shall ensure that the decision on partial payments is made at an early rather than a late stage.</p>

	<p pid="b.1482.2/1">I cannot comment on &quot;Farming Today&quot;, but I note that the right hon. Gentleman's statement was available on the Department's website long before it was made available to the House. As a former journalist, I am delighted that at least one part of the Department is operating beyond its productivity quotas, namely the press and communications office. I hope that that does not reflect the Secretary of State's priorities, because this continues to be a grave issue for a number of farmers. I was informed today that, in the last three days alone, five farmers who have received no payment have approached <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1404" name="Alan Beith">my right hon. Friend the Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith)</phrase>. We now know from the Secretary of State's own figures that a substantial number of claimants&mdash;nearly 15,000&mdash;have received no payment. That is obviously devastating for some of the farmers involved.</p>
	<p pid="b.1482.2/2">We are pleased that further progress is being made on payments. We are also pleased that the Secretary of State has seen fit to authorise interest payments, which we have requested for some time, and partial payments for the 2006 single payment scheme, which we have also requested. However, it is worth noting that it is reported that the parliamentary ombudsman has received several complaints about the maladministration of single farm payments. If that is indeed the case, is it not clear that the interest payments have been granted at a time when the Government have a gun to their head?</p>
	<p pid="b.1482.2/3">Moreover, the Department's proposed interest rate of 1 percentage point above the London interbank offered rate strikes me as surprisingly niggardly. There may be a farmer or two in the country who can borrow at 1 per cent. above LIBOR, possibly including the Duke of Westminster, but a more typical rate for small farmers would be between 3 and 4 per cent. above LIBOR. Although DEFRA has made that commitment, I should be grateful if it took account of what farmers have had to pay to relieve the liquidity crisis caused by its incompetence and reflected that more adequately in the proposed interest payments.</p>
	<p pid="b.1482.2/4">Does the Secretary of State agree that, by giving firm assurances that 96 per cent. of payments would be made by March 2006&mdash;assurances given as late as 2005&mdash;his Department raised farmers' expectations about the timing of their payments above the legal minimum, and that that has seriously disadvantaged many farmers? How will he compensate them? Will he also undertake to assess the impact of mapping disputes causing farmers to miss the deadline for entry to agri-environment scheme?</p>
	<p pid="b.1482.2/5">In response to a question from a Liberal Democrat, the Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1446" name="Barry Gardiner">the hon. Member for Brent, North (Barry Gardiner)</phrase>, said:</p>
	<p pid="b.1482.2/6" class="indent">&quot;Feed merchants are, to varying effects, likely to be affected by the cash-flow issues faced by farming business waiting for receipt of payments under the 2005 Single Payment Scheme&quot;.&mdash;[<i> Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-14">14 June 2006</phrase>; Vol. 447, c. 1209W.]</p>
	<p pid="b.1482.2/7">What plans has the Department to assess that impact accurately and how will the Secretary of State ensure that feed merchants and other businesses that depend on farm revenues do not suffer?</p>
	<p pid="b.1482.2/8">As the Secretary of State knows&mdash;because he was asked about it by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1857" name="Peter Ainsworth">the hon. Member for East Surrey (Mr. Ainsworth)</phrase>&mdash;the late payments will have an impact not just on the finances of rural communities, but on Government finances. However, I did not hear him specify a figure that he has told the Treasury to expect for the overrun that will be caused by the fact that the European Union will not meet any payments made by DEFRA after <phrase class="date" code="">30 June</phrase>. What is that figure, and will it be met from the departmental budget? If so, what other budget lines will be cut to defray the extra cost? If not, will the Secretary of State assure us that the amount will be met from the contingency reserve? That would obviously be preferable for all concerned.</p>
	<p pid="b.1482.2/9">The Secretary of State said that a minimum payment level was not available for 2006. Given that the RPA has made a payment of just 1p, and that the costs of the &pound;54 million IT system, if divided equally among claimants, would be about &pound;450 per head, will he give urgent consideration to imposing a minimum threshold on payments for 2007 to prevent a repetition of this costly bureaucratic nonsense? I should be grateful if he would also give us an update on the trading of entitlements.</p>

	<p pid="b.1486.0/1">The hon. Gentleman asks for certainty about next year's payments and it is right that we prepare for all eventualities. We must make sure that the legal and other infrastructure is ready to make partial payments, if necessary, but I hope that he will agree that it would be premature to commit to partial payments now. Equally, it is right that I come back to the House in October with a written or oral statement to report on what the RPA chief executive has said about the prospects for full payments. If full payments for the 2006 scheme cannot be made at an appropriate time in 2007, it is clear that partial payments will have to be the answer.</p>

	<p pid="b.1487.2/1">Dozens of farmers on Dartmoor in my constituency are yet to be paid their hill farm allowance. When will the payment of the HFA be complete?</p>
	<p pid="b.1487.2/2">Secondly, I was told recently by the chairman of the Devon county National Farmers Union that hundreds of forms for 2006 are being returned on the grounds that they are inaccurate or otherwise deficient. I am becoming increasingly concerned at the triviality of the grounds for returning these forms and particularly concerned about the fact that the condition placed on the grant of interest for payments made after <phrase class="date" code="">30 June</phrase> is the weasel expression,</p>

	<p pid="b.1487.2/4">Many hon. Members will know from their surgeries that delays in payment are often the result of inquiries that turn out, on examination, to be very trivial, easily resolvable and providing no proper basis for returning the form in the first place.

	<p pid="b.1487.3/1">The hon. Gentleman is right to say that some forms are returned for what may seem like a small matter&mdash;if a form is not signed, for example. At one level, that is incredibly annoying, but at another level, it is obvious that a form has to be signed. If a signature is missed out at the end of a form, it can cause problems, and a surprising amount of the traffic is about unsigned forms, though there may be other reasons.</p>
	<p pid="b.1487.3/2">In respect of interest, we have responsibilities to the Exchequer, but I hope that the hon. Gentleman will take it from me that the spirit as well as the letter of my commitment today is acknowledgment that the payments should have been made in the <phrase class="date" code="">1 December</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="">30 June</phrase> window. It would be wrong for me to give a blanket commitment and it is important to include the point that it must have been the RPA's fault. We start from the position that the non-payments were the fault of the RPA for the system as a whole, and I will ensure that we adopt a judicious approach to the problem.</p>

On our international treaty obligations, I have set out what we have done since coming to power in 1997, and made it clear that all times we take the lead in trying to push forward multilateral discussions on the NPT and elsewhere. I wish that my hon.

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-06-22b.1506.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1976" speakername="Adam Ingram" colnum="1506"  time="013:01:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060622/debtext/60622-0630.htm#06062269000596">
	<p pid="b.1506.3/1">I will not even go there. It was great to see the project and the enthusiasm of everyone associated with it. The private contractors and our own people&mdash;both civilian and military&mdash;are keen for it to succeed.</p>
	<p pid="b.1506.3/2">I want now to touch on future policy and to address our long-term strategic defence posture. Our investment decisions are measured in decades ahead, rather than individual years, and we need to get them right. The debate is an opportunity for the House to consider the challenges of the longer term, and to understand how the Ministry of Defence is looking at them. The primary responsibility of any Government must be to provide security for its citizens, but we also have a global responsibility to defend international stability. It is in the UK's interest to act internationally to bring about a peaceful and prosperous world.</p>
	<p pid="b.1506.3/3">Our prosperity rests upon globalisation and we need, as a nation, to remain engaged in its development to ensure both our security and success. Our armed forces are a key asset for achieving that. Their quality and reputation are second to none. Their capabilities allow us and, often, international organisations, such as the UN, the EU and NATO, to respond to threats and to support an international system based on human rights, good governance, democracy, civil and political liberties and free trade.</p>
	<p pid="b.1506.3/4">As the House will agree, no nation can be the world's policeman, and that applies equally to the UK. However, we will continue to act where it is right to do so. The British people expect nothing less. That is why we have to adapt in good time to the trends that we identify both at home and around the world. We do not expect that purely national and military solutions will be adequate. Armed forces cannot act alone to maintain international stability. As I have indicated, we recognise that the major security challenges of this century will require joint, integrated and multinational solutions. UK policy needs to be based upon putting to good use the resources and expertise of different Departments in the UK, and different nations across the world. We will continue to build on our alliances, working together with the international community in Iraq, Afghanistan, the Balkans and Africa. It seems to me that public debate tends to focus on the British and American roles only, but we must not ignore the vital contributions of our allies and partners.</p>
	<p pid="b.1506.3/5">The success of our British military contributions has derived from expeditionary forces whose structure and capabilities provide speed, agility, deployability and the ability to conduct a range of tasks. Those capabilities, which make the UK armed forces almost unique, are possible only because of commitment to professional excellence and sustained investment to deliver whatis required in today's&mdash;and tomorrow's&mdash;security environment.</p>
	<p pid="b.1506.3/6">All that brings me to the longer-term policy question of the future strategic context. Globalisation is driving unprecedented growth and prosperity across the world. Increasing cross-border flows of resources, goods, services and people will spread values and ideas. We can expect greater wealth, lowered cultural and ideological barriers and widening freedoms. All that could be suggestive of a 21st century world where conflict between nation states would be a rarity, unlike the terrible wars and traumas of the 20th century. However, as we move into the 21st century, we see the beginning of profound changes to the strategic environment. There is the speed with which powerful forces are developing, the range of unpredictable ways in which they could interact, and the vulnerability of an increasingly interdependent international system to physical, economic or political shocks&mdash;all those things breed uncertainty.</p>
	<p pid="b.1506.3/7">Key security challenges for the future will include the familiar&mdash;weak and failing states, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and global terrorism&mdash;but we also need to consider the potential security consequences of climate change, rapidly growing pressures on natural resources, accelerating technological change, and the social, cultural and geopolitical challenges that will accompany the rise of Asia and other emerging powers. It is not possible to predict how those and many other factors will interact, but it is right to acknowledge that not all of the potential futures are benign and that conflict within and between states will not disappear. Weak states will continue to face severe pressures. Extremist ideologies will still find breeding grounds among those who believe that they are not gaining from rapid change. Even a return to confrontation between major states or blocs cannot be ruled out.</p>
	<p pid="b.1506.3/8">British Governments, like the entire international community, will continue to have to work hard to promote security and success in that challenging future environment. We need to consider systematically how our armed forces can strengthen the UK's ability to act, to influence the international management of crises and to respond to unforeseen events. Later this year, the Ministry of Defence will publish a paper on the future strategic context for defence. It will offer an analysis of the future strategic environment and its implications and, I hope, improve understanding of the issues and the key questions to be decided.</p>
	<p pid="b.1506.3/9">Painstaking analysis of security challenges helps to maintain the vital continuous understanding among service people of how they fit into overall policy, which I mentioned at the beginning of my contribution. It also helps us to continue to give our people the right tools, by investing in the highest priority programmes. Beyond the services, in a democracy such as ours, major decisions require an informed public discussion. I hope that today's debate will contribute substantially to that process and I look forward to hearing the contributions from both sides of the House.</p>

	<p pid="b.1508.0/1">Let me start with a quote from 1997:</p>
	<p pid="b.1508.0/2" class="indent">&quot;A strong defence capability is an essential part of Britain's foreign policy...By 1999 defence spending will have fallen to2.6 per cent. of GDP...The people who have had to bear the burden of these cuts are our servicemen and women, overstretched and under strength as never before. The strain on our Armed Forces is huge. We have a continuing commitment in Northern Ireland. Our forces operate in the Gulf, the Balkans, Africa, the Falklands, Cyprus, Hong Kong, Gibraltar, Germany and other parts of the world all at once.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1508.0/3">That was our Prime Minister in full pre-election flow. What have we seen from the Government he brought to office? The answer is further commitments in Sierra Leone, Iraq and Afghanistan, and cuts in our armed forces of almost 40,000. The Army is down 9,000, the Navy is down 10,000 and the RAF is down 16,000 since the Government came into office. This year we will spend only 2.2 per cent. of our GDP on defence&mdash;the smallest proportion of our national wealth that we have spent on defending our country in any year since 1930. So much for the overstretch that the Prime Minister described when he was in opposition.</p>
	<p pid="b.1508.0/4">That level of defence expenditure is supposed to provide for, at most, no more than one small-scale operation and two medium-scale operations at any time. However, since 1999, British armed forces have been operating over and above the Government's own planning assumptions in every year but one. The Chancellor and the Secretary of State for Defence, the former Chief Secretary to the Treasury, have trimmed the available resources time and time again&mdash;at the same time as the Government have been asking our soldiers to do more and more. For example, the gap between deployments for infantry units had dropped to 15 months, when it is supposed to be a minimum of24 months, increasing the stress placed not only on our servicemen and women, but on their families&mdash;something that is not sufficiently taken into account. As a consequence, there is a rising divorce rate among service personnel.</p>
	<p pid="b.1508.0/5">There are serious capability gaps now, and more looming in the immediate future. Only 40 per cent. of the Lynx and Gazelle helicopter fleet is fit for purpose&mdash;as is only 40 per cent. of the C-130K Hercules fleet. At times, we have had so few aircraft that soldiers have been left sitting on the tarmac in Basra because there have been no planes to fly them back home. This March saw the withdrawal of the F/A2 Sea Harriers, leaving the maritime fleet without air defence. As Ministers openly acknowledge, we shall be reliant on the United States for air defence of the fleet until the Type 45s, with their air defence role, enter service around 2009. These will be followed by the new carriers, with their joint strike fighters, which are due to enter service&mdash;well, we do not know exactly when they will be entering service. Perhaps the Minister could enlighten us.</p>

	<p pid="b.1509.0/1">As ever, the Government, having been in office for nine years, can find nothing better to do than blame their predecessors for the problems that they themselves have brought in. Many in the military believe that the Sea Harriers could have been kept flying without a change in engine for some time yet, but the Government have chosen instead to leave that gap in our services and to leave us dependent on the United States. I am keen on our partnership with the United States, but we are talking about a Government whose members kept telling us when they were in opposition that there was overstretch and underfunding and that gaps were being left. Since they came into office, we have had greater commitments, insufficient funding and greater gaps.</p>

	<p pid="b.1511.1/1">I was making the point&mdash;although not sufficiently clearly for the hon. Gentleman&mdash;that a stable and sustainable state is made up not simply by democracy, but by other elements. I can only explain the argument to the hon. Gentleman; I cannot understand it for him.</p>
	<p pid="b.1511.1/2">Post-war mistakes have clearly had several consequences, so we should accept what they were. Both the British and American Governments failed to plan successfully for the aftermath of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1537" name="Michael Ancram">the war. My right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Devizes (Mr. Ancram)</phrase> said time and time again in the Chamber that although winning the war would be the easy part, given the overwhelming firepower, the difficult part would be the reconstruction. The Iraqi police and army were disbanded far too soon, and I am afraid that the insufficient deployment of troops at the outset has led to a situation in Iraq that means we are likely to be there longer, and in more difficult circumstances, than might otherwise have been the case.</p>
	<p pid="b.1511.1/3">In recent days, both Japanese and Italian troops have withdrawn from the theatre of operations. The handover of al-Muthanna province to the Iraqi authorities is a development to be welcomed, but that does not mean that there is not still much to be done. Only this week the chief of joint operations made it clear that it would be some time before an area such as Basra could be handed over, although many of us already took that for granted. The Minister himself admitted that things had become worse, in that soldiers were in body armour rather than soft hats when he last visited. Intra-factional fighting in Basra is on the increase, and the Iraqi Prime Minister's declaration of a state of emergency is a testament to that.</p>
	<p pid="b.1511.1/4">I hope that we will hear the answers to several unanswered questions at the end of the debate. How prevalent are the militias on the streets of Basra? Given the extent of the overstretch, how do the Government intend to deal with any upsurge of violence in Basra, alongside the increased involvement of Afghan forces that has been announced today? How are the Government dealing with the shortfall in the availability of Lynx helicopters? What are we doing to ensure that the basic rights of Iraqis are protected in the areas that we control and for which we are responsible? In particular, what guarantees can we give that Sunnis will not be systematically intimidated and that women will not be oppressed by fundamentalist groups, reports of which are increasingly appearing in our press on an almost daily basis?</p>

	<p pid="b.1512.1/1">If the hon. Gentleman had been listening, or if he took an interest in what is recorded in <i> Hansard</i>, he would know that my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Devizes laid out our reservations on several occasions during that time. Unlike my right hon. and learned Friend, I was chairman of the party at the time, not the shadow Foreign Secretary&mdash;these things matter when one is in the official Opposition. It is clearly on record that we laid out our reservations and what we thought that the consequences of several mistakes that we outlined would be. I wish that my right hon. and learned Friend had been wrong, but he was right about many of the things of which he warned. When we took the decision to back the Government, we set out plenty of caveats, which are <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1507" name="Bob Russell">there for the hon. Member for Colchester (Bob Russell)</phrase> to read whenever he wants.</p>
	<p pid="b.1512.1/2">One aspect of our deployment to Iraq is not mentioned very often. What we are doing there is not simply a matter of grand geopolitical and military strategy. There is a human cost, not merely to Iraqi citizens, but among our serving British soldiers. According to parliamentary written answers obtained by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1696" name="Philip Dunne">my hon. Friend the Member for Ludlow (Mr. Dunne)</phrase>, 732 service personnel have been aero-evacuated from Iraq. Almost one in 10 of those were diagnosed with some sort of mental health problem. That is a fairly shocking figure, but after returning from deployment a further 727 soldiers have sought treatment from the MOD's community mental health departments, which raises the question of how many soldiers there are out there who do not know where to turn for help.</p>
	<p pid="b.1512.1/3">It is a matter of the utmost importance that those who risk life and limb in our name are given the health facilities that they require. I hope the Minister willgive a commitment to find out whether sufficient information is available, so that those returning know where to go for help, the help they get is appropriate to their service background, and they are not simply treated in a civilian mental health institution, which may not understand the effects of trauma in a military setting.</p>
	<p pid="b.1512.1/4">I turn to the other great deployment&mdash;that in Afghanistan, which also remains essential in the wider regional strategic context. As I have said before, while we could not have failed to act, we must not act and fail. The consequences of failure would be calamitous. A failed state would re-emerge, our enemies would be emboldened, and the hills and valleys of Afghanistan would once more become incubators of global terror.</p>
	<p pid="b.1512.1/5">As a knock-on effect, Pakistan, already a nuclear state, could become destabilised. NATO's reputation would be sullied by one of its first out-of-area operations, with the consequent dangers that the wider NATO membership could restrict operations to the Euro-Atlantic zone in the future. A loss of nerve within NATO, the emboldening of our enemies and the denial to the people of Afghanistan of a better way of life is not a legacy that Britain could or should contemplate.</p>
	<p pid="b.1512.1/6">It is a source of great worry to many within and outside the military that our deployment may be under strength for the many and varied tasks assigned to it. Despite there being some 10,000 NATO troops in Afghanistan under ISAF command, we still do not have enough support or troops to cover the entirety of the areas of responsibility in the three regions that NATO is supposed to be covering. There is excessive duplication of logistics provision in particular, especially with regard to troop movement. NATO needs to co-ordinate this aspect far more than it is currently doing. With 71 separate caveats among more than 30 contributing nations, the effectiveness of ISAF is bound to be compromised.</p>
	<p pid="b.1512.1/7">We are asking our troops to patrol one of the most dangerous provinces in one of the most dangerous countries in the world, yet we often lack the manpower and lift capacity to guarantee success. In particular, ISAF still lacks a reserve quick response force to deal with sudden incidents, such as when the Norwegians came under attack last February.</p>
	<p pid="b.1512.1/8">We must acknowledge success when it occurs. Although there has been good progress in the training of the Afghan army, training for the Afghan police, the prime responsibility of the Germans, is at least two years behind schedule, yet the police are crucial stakeholders in the efforts of the peace and reconstruction teams and those helping to rebuild Afghan civil society.</p>
	<p pid="b.1512.1/9">It is worth pointing out that there are still major incompatibility issues regarding the equipment of the major participating countries, particularly radios and frequencies. Most disturbing is the failure to agree to universal use of Blue Force Tracker, a system to allow HQs to follow all NATO forces via SatNav, down to an individual vehicle. The system is being used in Helmand, but the French and other countries refuse to use it, preferring to wait for a rival system built by Thales, which has yet to come off the shelf. That is not an acceptable position for the NATO operation to be in.</p>
	<p pid="b.1512.1/10">The role of the police has also become enmeshed in the wider strategic mismatch and confusion of roles, of which many have spoken. The Afghan police are not so much a national force, in the way that we would understand it, as a large number of independent semi-militias. The border goes unpatrolled, drug trafficking continues, and it is an open question to what extent the police militias overlap with the forces of the warlords and/or Taliban. The UN and other NGOs have withdrawn from Helmand, claiming it is too dangerous. I raise these points, and they all matter, because we are in danger of losing the hearts and minds war among the local population, which is so crucial to the success of the overall mission.</p>
	<p pid="b.1512.1/11">At the same time as we face these logistical problems, the poppy eradication projects have brought warlords and Taliban into coalescence on many occasions. To varying degrees we are seeing what NATO calls Talibanisation, where the Taliban pay local people for one-off strikes against NATO forces. Given the amount of money involved, funded by the drug trade, these incidents are, sadly, on the increase, as President Karzai noted today.</p>
	<p pid="b.1512.1/12">I raise all these matters because there is still time to do something about them. Our troops are committed, they are brave and intuitive, and they will do almost whatever we ask of them, with whatever we give them. But we need to ensure that they are given all that they need to carry out the task demanded of them&mdash;no shortcuts, no shortages. The Government have a twin duty&mdash;to maximise the success of the mission, and at the same time to minimise the risk to our troops. We strongly support British participation in the war on terror in Afghanistan, as it is strategically in our national interest and our membership of NATO commits us to it. However, it is questionable whether our security footprint is large enough to achieve the goals identified, in anything like the time scale envisaged. Having acted, we absolutely cannot afford to fail.</p>
	<p pid="b.1512.1/13">Let me deal with the issue that has dominated the newspapers and media coverage today&mdash;our nuclear deterrent. While North Korea threatens missile tests and there is the continuing stand-off with Iran, and when we cannot predict what new threats we may face by 2025, we cannot afford to leave ourselves exposed and vulnerable. Given such uncertainty, it is a strategic imperative that we replace our nuclear deterrent when the time comes. I remain to be convinced that any alternative to a submarine-based system is a credible option, but it is still an issue that we will consider in our policy review.</p>
	<p pid="b.1512.1/14">All history tells us that the outbreak of conflicts is seldom accurately anticipated. The onus must therefore be on the nuclear abolitionist, not on the believer in deterrence, to explain why one can be confident that no nuclear or major chemical or biological threat will be posed to the United Kingdom during the long period so far ahead. I doubt if any such explanation will carry much conviction.</p>
	<p pid="b.1512.1/15">The identification of a potential enemy once shaped the nature of our armed forces&mdash;the two power standard for the Navy, for example. With our nuclear deterrent, we enjoy a much greater degree of versatility. Intercontinental ballistic missiles such as Tridentare sufficiently flexible, given their range and invulnerability, to deter any state that may seek to use, or threaten the United Kingdom with, weapons of mass destruction at any time in the future. In short, it would not matter which potential enemy posed a real threat. Each would face unacceptable retaliation from a modern strategic missile system such as Trident.</p>

	<p pid="b.1515.0/1">If my hon. Friend will have a little patience, I will shortly come to the process by which that should occur. Let me say one final thing about the policy of deterrence. The versatility of a policy of minimum strategic nuclear deterrence makes up for our inability to anticipate future enemies or predict future threats. Conversely, any decision to deprive ourselves of the deterrent would leave the country open to future aggressors whom we would be able to identify only when it was too late to try and rebuild our nuclear forces that had been so recklessly discarded.</p>
	<p pid="b.1515.0/2">Needless to say, any attempt to reacquire a nuclear deterrent once a threat began to emerge would immediately generate a storm of political protest, on the basis that it would constitute a new arms race and make a tense situation even more febrile. We must act now on principle, because those are powerful and substantive arguments, but the way in which they have been handled in the past few days by the Government s nothing short of disgraceful. Instead of an announcement to Parliament about the Government's intention, there was a one-line mention in an after-dinner speech, not by the Prime Minister or the Defence Secretary but by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. The commitment itself is not clear&mdash;is it a commitment in principle or in practice? Will it retain or replace the existing deterrent?</p>
	<p pid="b.1515.0/3">The Minister said that a decision to replace Trident has not been made &quot;in principle&quot;, yet the newspapers are full of stories saying that the Chancellor's people have briefed that a decision has been made and that the Treasury will spend the money. The Chancellor, as the Prime Minister in waiting, will oversee a new generation of nuclear deterrence for the United Kingdom. If those newspaper reports are wrong, if all those Treasury briefings did not take place, and if a decision has not been made about the principle of replacing Trident, when will the Chancellor publicly disown everything that has been said in his name in the past 24 hours? This is a vital issue, so it is utterly unacceptable that power politics should be at play in the Cabinet, as the national interest must be put first.</p>
	<p pid="b.1515.0/4">The place to debate major issues is the House of Commons, and we must debate the principle and practicalities of action on our nuclear deterrent. However, we must do more than debate, as the House deserves a vote on those important issues. If the Government do not allow the House the opportunity to vote, the Conservative party will certainly ensure that all hon. Members are given a vote on an issue of enormous importance to the country.</p>
	<p pid="b.1515.0/5">We will back the Government when they act in the national interest, but the professionalism of our servicemen and women stands in sharp contrast to the Government's increasingly shambolic amateurism. What sort of Government, for example, arrange a defence debate, in their own time, knowing that the Secretary of State cannot attend? Those who serve our country deserve so much better; before long, they will get it.</p>

	<p pid="b.1516.1/1">I want to speak about Afghanistan and Somalia, but principally about Iraq.</p>
	<p pid="b.1516.1/2">In Afghanistan, not enough aid was provided to lift and stabilise that war-torn country after the initial takeover from the Taliban. We took our eye off the ball when we invaded Iraq, so vital time and good will were lost. Other forces are at work. Drugs are a driving force for lawlessness and the resurgence of the Taliban, which is backed by shadowy forces, probably from Pakistan or Iran and perhaps the countries of the former Soviet Union that have an interest in destabilising the foreign occupation of Afghanistan. That demonstrates the limit of defence operations. We cannot occupy north-west Pakistan, or go to war with Iran in support of our activity in Afghanistan, so we must find other routes to achieve our goals, for example, by working constructively with the United Nations and neighbouring countries. Our aim should be to stabilise democratic governance, with an ensuing reduction in drug production, which cannot be achieved peaceably without tackling the security situation. Killing every member of the Taliban is not possible, and trying to do so causes civilian casualties and acts as a recruiting sergeant. I do not want the Taliban to return, but we must be more politically proactive to incorporate moderate Taliban sympathisers into the political process. If we are to do our job in Afghanistan, the American troops should go, as their roaming, killing role is not helpful and creates a climate of danger for our troops. The exit of the American troops would be a sign that the fighting should be brought to an end. There should be another push to boost aid and the institutions of civil society, as Hamid Karzai suggested today.</p>
	<p pid="b.1516.1/3">In Somalia, the Americans backed the wrong group when it chose to support unpopular warlords. The popular Islamic Court Union is in the process of coming to power and can unify the Somali people for the time being, while the warlords cannot. America has encouraged the UN and the UK to back the wrong horse and the position has been made worse by President Bush's crude strategy of &quot;for or against us&quot;, which means that Muslim groups that attain power are automatically assumed to be supporters of al-Qaeda. We have worked constructively with Muslim Governments all over the world&mdash;for example, in Saudi Arabia and Turkey&mdash;so we can do so in Somalia, too.</p>
	<p pid="b.1516.1/4">We must acknowledge that we backed the wrong horse and start to engage properly and effectively with Somalia to achieve stability. We should not back Ethiopia's efforts to spread the conflict throughout the region, as that would be detrimental for the people of both countries, leading to more poverty and death, and an increase in the number of asylum seekers. We should not become embroiled in such a conflict, because <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1938" name="Liam Fox">the hon. Member for Woodspring (Dr. Fox)</phrase> was right that failed states and ongoing conflict offer the best opportunities for al-Qaeda to operate and recruit. We should therefore encourage stability in countries such as Somalia.</p>
	<p pid="b.1516.1/5">Turning to Iraq, on which I wish to concentrate, the weekly magazine, <i> Tribune</i>, published a &quot;world cup&quot; of the worst human rights abusers. It was a very good article and the final was a high-scoring draw between Iran and the United States, which keeps thousands of individuals in custody without charge in Iraq, Afghanistan and Guantanamo Bay. It conducts rendition to undisclosed locations and is guilty of torture at Abu Ghraib, as well as atrocities and abuses, including the mass killing of civilians. The US is our coalition partner and our Government offer apologia and gentle rebukes for such activity&mdash;for example, they refer to atrocities as &quot;unfortunate incidents&quot; or say that such matters are &quot;their responsibility, not ours.&quot; I strongly believe that joint and several liability applies, because we are part of a multinational force. The Government claimed credit for Saddam Hussein's fall, even though it was mainly achieved by US troops, so we should share the blame for US wrongdoing. A UK general is second-in-command of the coalition forces in Baghdad, and we share overall responsibility, whether or not we make representations, which are often ignored. In my opinion, the UK should have been in the semi-final of <i> Tribune</i>'s world cup human rights abusers, given its role in Iraq.</p>

	<p pid="b.1517.1/1">I did so in that debate and I am happy to echo what I said. I am amazed that the hon. Gentleman should choose to intervene on me, as he should intervene on Members who supported the war and put the lives of our troops at jeopardy, not to mention risk of mental illness and so on. I am happy, however, to give that assurance and acknowledge that our troops do a splendid job given the terms under which they operate. It is the political decision making that sent them to Iraq of which I am fiercely critical.</p>
	<p pid="b.1517.1/2">We have also been hostile to Iran and Syria, which are neighbours of Afghanistan. In a private sitting of the Defence Committee, the Minister of State discussed Iran's alleged role in Iraq and the death of British soldiers, although I suspect that he had very little evidence. Extending the war to Iran should not be an option, so we need to obtain better relations for mutual security. Threats, hostility and covert tit-for-tat killings are not the way forward.</p>
	<p pid="b.1517.1/3">I want to use this debate to raise some difficult human rights issues. Mr. Abdul Razzaq Ali al-Jedda is a joint British and Iraqi citizen on whose behalf Amnesty International has been making representations. Amnesty is concerned that, even after months of internment, the multinational force is continuing to hold internees without providing them or their legal counsel with substantive evidence to justify their detention. Mr. al-Jedda has been detained since his arrest on <phrase class="date" code="2004-10-10">10 October 2004</phrase> in Baghdad. He filed a case against the UK Secretary of State for Defence challenging his internment in Iraq which was dismissed by the High Court of England and Wales on <phrase class="date" code="2005-08-12">12 August 2005</phrase>. However, the court noted:</p>
	<p pid="b.1517.1/4" class="indent">&quot;Although detained for imperative reasons of security, the claimant has not been charged with any offence; and the Secretary of State acknowledges that, as matters stand, there is insufficient material available which could be used in court to support criminal charges against him. The claimant is therefore detained simply on a preventive basis.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1517.1/5">Mr. al-Jedda continues to be held without charge or trial by UK forces. When I tabled a written question on the matter, the reply stated:</p>
	<p pid="b.1517.1/6" class="indent">&quot;Mr. al-Jedda is being detained by the British contingent of the Multi-National Force in Iraq for imperative reasons of security under the authority conferred by United Nations Security Council&quot;.&mdash;[<i> Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-25">25 May 2006</phrase>; Vol. 446,c. 1963W.]</p>
	<p pid="b.1517.1/7">He might be a dangerous man&mdash;I do not know&mdash;but there should be a proper process of law, including charges and evidence. That man is a British citizen who is being held by British forces under a secretive process, which is not satisfactory. The Government should deal with the case properly.</p>
	<p pid="b.1517.1/8">Then there is the shooting of innocent Iraqi civilian motorists by employees of the UK company Aegis Defence Services. Evidence of that happening was posted on a website and broadcast on TV for all to see. The company has immunity from Iraqi law under the decree of the then chief US occupier, Paul Bremer, which was enacted with the support of the UK, and it is seemingly above UK law. It has had the nerve to use British law to shut up the whistleblower, an ex-Army man, Mr. Rod Stoner. The situation is unsatisfactory and the Government should address it.</p>
	<p pid="b.1517.1/9">I want to discuss inquiries set up by UK forces and the MOD when innocent Iraqis are killed. For example, a helicopter went down in Basra recently and the subsequent disorder led to the deaths of several Iraqis, including two children. During the Secretary of State's statement in this House, I asked whether the mothers of the children who were killed would be able attend or put any evidence to the inquiry, but no answer was provided. That raises a query in my mind about how such inquiries are carried out. The excluded Iraqis who have lost loved ones will see them as cover ups, which I suspect they are. We should hear a statement about how such inquiries are carried out and whether Iraqis who have lost loved ones can be involved.</p>
	<p pid="b.1517.1/10">We have been in control of Basra for three years, so why has it ended up in a state of emergency? The Stop the War organisation has e-mailed me to say that public order in Basra has virtually collapsed and that one person is being assassinated every hour. I have received an e-mail entitled, &quot;Ethnic cleansing under the watchful eyes of the British Army&quot;, from Mr. F. Sabri of the Iraqi Islamic party, which is based in London. It states:</p>
	<p pid="b.1517.1/11" class="indent">&quot;Three years of kidnapping, torture and assassinations by Shiite militias in Basrah caused tens of thousands of Sunnis to flee the city. A healthy Sunni population of 35 per cent. reduced to less than 15 per cent. under British rule. The British government is responsible for the protection of all Iraqis under its control in the south of Iraq yet it failed its obligation under international law to curb the influence and power of the Iranian backed gangs and militias. Last week leaflets were distributed in the city asking the Sunni population to leave by the 3rd of July otherwise they will be exterminated. We have asked the British Government repeatedly to act and protect the civilians in Basrah, but we never receive an answer. We hold the British government responsible for the safety of our people in Iraq. History will tell if a tragedy in Basrah will be added to the catalogue of catastrophes committed by Britain against the people of the middle east.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1517.1/12">We deserve an answer about what is going on in Basra.</p>

	<p pid="b.1520.1/1">It is welcome to have this chance in Government time to debate these important matters and to range across the whole realm of defence policy. I regret that it has not been possible to have the Secretary of State with us today, but it is still good that we are able to have these discussions.</p>
	<p pid="b.1520.1/2">These are important matters, because in recent months there have been many developments in our overseas operational activities. In the past five months, there have been announcements on major troop deployments to Afghanistan and decisions on the reconfiguration of British troops in Iraq. At the same time, the House has had to consider the Armed Forces Bill, the Blake review, and a series of critical manning, readiness and procurement reports. There are many other pressing issues that have not, until today, been subject to the same level of parliamentary scrutiny or debate, and I shall refer to some of those in a few minutes.</p>
	<p pid="b.1520.1/3">The defence White Paper proposed key changes to cope with new planning assumptions, reflecting the enhanced use of network-enabled capability, effects-based warfare and force restructuring. Those measures were said to create the circumstances for a reduction in future manpower requirements, but I wonder whether that can possibly be considered realistic now, when the demands on our forces in many different places have increased so much.</p>
	<p pid="b.1520.1/4">It must be of profound concern that, although the National Audit Office and the Armed Forces Pay Review Body have found that the services have been operating beyond planning assumptions for at least seven years, the Government have successively reduced armed forces strength requirements, leaving what the Defence Committee describes as &quot;little if any fat&quot; in the armed forces. I am sure that the Committee is right. When outflow from the armed forces is at a high, recruitment is at a low and our overseas commitments appear likely to increase, there cannot be any justification in those reductions in numbers. What impact will that have on our reliance on harmony guidelines and the extent of our reliance on reservists?</p>
	<p pid="b.1520.1/5">The latest Defence Analytical Services Agency figures show an increase in the total annual outflow from the armed forces. The figure is now 24,290 compared with 23,430 in April 2005. Similarly, recruitment from civilian life into the UK regular forces has dropped substantially to below 20,000 in the past two years. It was reported earlier this year that the Army expects a 12 per cent. recruitment shortfall compared with its target. Will the Under-Secretary confirm recent reports that the bounty offered to soldiers who persuade friends to join up is to be doubled, from &pound;650 to &pound;1,300? Does he acknowledge the serious recruitment problems?</p>
	<p pid="b.1520.1/6">The Armed Forces Pay Review Body's annual report in February attributes the increase in voluntary outflow to &quot;operational pressures&quot; and</p>
	<p pid="b.1520.1/7" class="indent">&quot;the nature of service life&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="b.1520.1/8">which it labels as &quot;retention-negative&quot;. The National Audit Office readiness report identified</p>
	<p pid="b.1520.1/9" class="indent">&quot;the continued use of personnel on operations&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1520.1/10">as a potential cause of retention problems. It went further, saying that the problem</p>
	<p pid="b.1520.1/11" class="indent">&quot;could exacerbate the shortage of specialist skills within the services, or more extensive drawing down of reservists&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.1520.1/12">The Armed Forces Pay Review Body identified serious shortages in key trades and skills. The Government have declined to make public, on what they describe as &quot;operational grounds&quot;, the extent of the shortages in specific areas, but the existence of several operational pinch points is seriously worrying.</p>
	<p pid="b.1520.1/13">The report identifies specific shortages in trades in the Royal Engineers, the Royal Signals, the Intelligence Corps and the Army medical services and asks questions about the prevalence and extent of the problems. What progress has been made in filling those gaps?</p>
	<p pid="b.1520.1/14">Questions are being asked about the effect of operational strains on our armed forces, consequently calling into question the feasibility of the revised defence planning assumptions in the defence White Paper. The NAO readiness report warned that a third of British forces had serious weaknesses in their state of readiness, and of the cumulative effect of a series of minor risks. It has also been said that 8 per cent. of our armed forces are medically unfit for duty, which could get worse with strains on mental health from over-deployment. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1938" name="Liam Fox">The hon. Member for Woodspring(Dr. Fox)</phrase> made that point effectively. That is profoundly significant not only for the individuals&mdash;the hon. Gentleman was right to stress the importance of making facilities available to them&mdash;but it must have an impact on the calculations of the extent of deployment that we can sensibly undertake in future.</p>
	<p pid="b.1520.1/15">I want to consider some current operations. Understandably, there has been much discussion of Afghanistan. In a memorandum to the Select Committee in February, the Ministry of Defence stated that, despite manning shortages, deployment to Afghanistan is &quot;manageable&quot;. However, in its report today, the Defence Committee observes:</p>
	<p pid="b.1520.1/16" class="indent">&quot;Overall we judge that the impact on personnel of our deployment to Afghanistan is manageable, but will inevitably constrain our capacity to respond elsewhere.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1520.1/17">The Committee is quite right to make that very level judgment. I wonder what assessment the Ministry has made of the fighting capabilities of the Taliban and other illegally armed groups in the south of Afghanistan, and what assumptions underlie its calculation of the kind of help that we are going to get from the Afghans themselves.</p>
	<p pid="b.1520.1/18">We support the deployment of troops to Afghanistan. It is intrinsically the right thing to do, but we are less certain of the extent to which it is do-able. I was in Paris earlier this week for the meeting of the Western European Union, which had received a report from a group that had been to Afghanistan. The report concluded that there would be a need for overseas troops to be present there for 15 years. I do not think that political or public opinion in the many parts of the country that are supplying those troops is in any way ready for that.</p>
	<p pid="b.1520.1/19">It is in everyone's interest to achieve the stabilisation and reconstruction of Afghanistan, not least because it supplies 90 per cent. of the world's opium. This concerted international effort has come rather late in the day, however. For three years, not enough progress was made. I fear that energy was being devoted to Iraq at the expense of Afghanistan, and the task is now more difficult because of that neglect. The Government have yet to explain how they can reconcile the concurrent objectives of achieving security and making progress on counter-narcotics. It has already been pointed out that the prevalence of the connections of the drugs industry throughout Afghan society and within its political institutions means that the drugs trade is the foundation of the Afghan economy. Effective measures against the trade are going to make the security situation even more challenging.</p>
	<p pid="b.1520.1/20">I hope that our forces will find ways of overcoming that tension, but I am unclear as to what role they will play in the counter-narcotics strategy. Does NATO have sufficient numbers of combat troops in southern Afghanistan, where the level of violence has reached a new high? What provision is there to cope with any further escalation in hostilities? This is undoubtedly a highly challenging mission, and we must be clear that an enduring solution will not be achieved without comprehensive political reform and serious reconstruction. Success will also depend on the active and constructive engagement of Afghanistan's neighbours, especially Pakistan.</p>
	<p pid="b.1520.1/21">There needs to be clarity on the co-ordination between the different national contingents serving in the international security assistance force&mdash;ISAF&mdash;as the hon. Member for Woodspring said. There have been examples of overlap, and the co-ordination does not seem to have been as strong as it might have been. With the forthcoming unification of ISAF and Operation Enduring Freedom, there needs to be clarity on the counter-insurgency role undertaken by NATO forces, and a recognition of the dangers of mission creep. There is a real danger that Afghan society will see all foreign troops in the same light, and come to view all of them as unwelcome.</p>
	<p pid="b.1520.1/22">Italy has begun the withdrawal of its troops from Iraq, with a view to complete withdrawal before the end of the year. As that involves the second largest contingent in multi-national sector south-east, I wonder what effect the withdrawal will have on our forces and commitments there. The Secretary of State told me when he made a statement just a day or two into his new post that the objective in Iraq was to reach a situation where we could hand over security responsibility to the new Government&mdash;I think that everyone would agree with that&mdash;and that the strategy was to achieve the objective. A full debate in the House on Iraq is overdue, and any such debate should be led or shared by the Foreign Office rather than being viewed simply as a defence matter.</p>
	<p pid="b.1520.1/23">A new strategy is needed in Iraq, central to which should be a peace process led by the United Nations to achieve national reconciliation and the internationalisation of support for Iraq. That process would need to build on the policies that have been set out by the Iraqi Prime Minister, and would work towards the agreement of an international compact setting out the commitments of all sides and a comprehensive security and reconstruction strategy. It would need to build on the good work&mdash;to which I pay tribute&mdash;of coalition forces that are busily engaged in the training, equipping, professionalising and regularising of the Iraqi security services. But it would need to go a long way beyond that.</p>
	<p pid="b.1520.1/24">We need a regional contact group to strengthen the engagement of Iraq's neighbours. We need a comprehensive disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration strategy comparable with those that coalition forces have overseen elsew<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1684" name="Harry Cohen">here. As the hon. Member for Leyton and Wanstead (Harry Cohen)</phrase> rightly said, we need an end to systematic and indefinite detentions by United States and, indeed, Iraqi forces, with safeguards against abuses. We need an enhanced national programme in Iraq to promote human rights and the rule of law. We need to expedite the reconstruction process, do what is possible to eliminate corruption, and increase the involvement of the United Nations and the World Bank.</p>
	<p pid="b.1520.1/25">As all those components begin to progress, it will become feasible to start talking about a programme for phased security transfer and the withdrawal of coalition troops. To get anywhere near such an approach, however, will require the United Kingdom to use its influence in Washington to press for US support, and it will have to be developed and implemented with the approval of, and in partnership with, the sovereign Government of Iraq.</p>
	<p pid="b.1520.1/26">Le me say something about procurement. The defence industrial strategy has rightly received a generally warm welcome, despite some concerns about its potential impact upon smaller companies. How will the Ministry of Defence monitor its impact over a period, and ensure that it is having a benign effect?</p>
	<p pid="b.1520.1/27">I will not attempt a tour d'horizon of procurement issues in one short speech, but a few brief points are worth making. What progress is being made on technology transfer in relation to the joint strike fighter? Last week, discussions between Bill Jeffrey and Gordon England failed yet again to achieve a statement of principles to facilitate the United States' sharing of technologies with Britain in the context of the JSF programme. Does the Minister believe that a memorandum of understanding between our two nations will be produced by December, as previously planned? Does the recent publication of a report in the US saying that the costs of the JSF could be better controlled if there were competition to provide engines revive any hopes for Rolls-Royce?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-06-22b.1523.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1539" speakername="Nick Harvey" colnum="1523"  time="014:38:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060622/debtext/60622-0632.htm#06062269000627">
	<p pid="b.1523.1/1">That is a very good point. The Farnborough air show will soon be upon us. I hope that it will focus minds and produce some agreements. That would be a realistic and sensible time scale in which to try to conclude discussions that are vitally important. No one wants to see the JSF programme fail, but British Ministers and officials have&mdash;rightly, in my view&mdash;taken a robust line with the Americans, and it is essential for this thorny issue to be resolved as soon as possible.</p>
	<p pid="b.1523.1/2">Another procurement issue that urgently needs attention is heavy lift capability. My noble Friend Lord Garden has persistently raised the issue in another place. What resources has the MOD with which to address that urgent problem, and when does it plan to do so?</p>
	<p pid="b.1523.1/3">We must ensure that the drive to meet planning assumptions does not lead us towards reduced stock holdings and spares. There are obvious risks associated with purchasing to meet urgent operational requirements, as we saw in the case of Operation Telic. The readiness report from the National Audit Office states:</p>
	<p pid="b.1523.1/4" class="indent">&quot;The department relies extensively on cannibalising equipment&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="b.1523.1/5">and that applies particularly in the fleet. What progress is being made to reduce that dependency, which is often inefficient and manpower-intensive and which restricts operational flexibility?</p>
	<p pid="b.1523.1/6">One issue that has not had parliamentary scrutiny but deserves it has to do with pre-emption and the Geneva conventions. In a speech in March, the then Defence Secretary called for a reappraisal of the Geneva conventions and an expansion of the doctrine of pre-emptive strike. Will the Minister say whether that is Government policy? If so, what revisions are proposed to those conventions, which form the bedrock of international humanitarian law? In light of the catastrophic consequences of the Iraq invasion, on what grounds should the pre-emptive strike doctrine be expanded? The UN High-Level Panel concluded last year that existing international rules on the use of force are sufficient, but that they need to be respected.</p>
	<p pid="b.1523.1/7">Finally, I turn to the matter that has been referred to already and which has dominated this morning's newspapers&mdash;the replacement of our nuclear deterrent. In February, the Prime Minister told the Liaison Committee:</p>
	<p pid="b.1523.1/8" class="indent">&quot;I do not know that we need, specifically, to have a vote...but I am sure there will be the fullest possible Parliamentary debate and there will obviously be that...it will probably be done in a far more open way than these decisions have been taken before.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1523.1/9">That was a welcome sentiment, but I wonder about it. The number of scientists working on hydrodynamic testing at Aldermaston is being increased for the first time in 20 years, and additional investment of more than &pound;1 billion is being made in that facility, with more than &pound;10 million allocated to preliminary work on Trident renewal.</p>
	<p pid="b.1523.1/10">I have been rather surprised by some of the answers to parliamentary questions that I have received in the past few weeks. Will the Minister confirm that no work is currently under way at Aldermaston on designs for a new nuclear warhead? It seems inconceivable that that can be right. We need transparency from the Government about the process, and they should actively provide information to Parliament and the public so as to inform a full debate on the matter.</p>
	<p pid="b.1523.1/11">Last night, we learned that the Prime Minister in waiting believes that the decision must be taken next year&mdash;although he seems to have made a decision, despite the fact that key facts have not been made public. Successive Defence Ministers have said only that a decision may be required in this Parliament. Why the sudden urgency? Has the Ministry of Defence changed its position and, if so, on what basis? The former Defence Secretary said in a written answer in March that Ministers had not yet begun to consider the position &quot;in any detail&quot;, so what new analysis has taken place since then? Exactly when will the &quot;fullest possible parliamentary debate&quot; that the Prime Minister promised begin? The truth is that the timetable for replacement seems to have more to do with political considerations than technical ones.</p>
	<p pid="b.1523.1/12">The Americans are proposing to extend the lifecycle of their Trident systems into the 2040s. I do not pretend that we could do that with ease, but it would certainly be possible. In that case, why does the Chancellor suddenly believe that a decision about replacement has to be made in the next few months?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-06-22b.1526.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1843" speakername="Robert Flello" colnum="1526"  time="015:01:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060622/debtext/60622-0632.htm#06062269000632">
	<p pid="b.1526.2/1">I would be delighted to do so. The scheme has been going for about 18 years and it has allowed something in the order of 170 or 180 Members to participate. In my relatively short period in the scheme, I have undertaken a few visits. I kick off with the Army presentation team. Again, I would recommend any interested Member to take the opportunity to get a flavour and overview from the team of what it does.</p>
	<p pid="b.1526.2/2">I also visited Headquarters Land Command and met the commander-in-chief of our land forces. The meeting was attended by three chiefs of staff, four assistant chiefs of staff, the Command secretary and his deputy and the director of Army infrastructure. Indeed, there were so many stars in the room that I thought I was in an episode of &quot;The Sky at Night&quot;. It was extremely informative. We talked about the organisation of the forces, the current operations, as have been mentioned in the debate, the major issues that the Army is addressing and the major challenges that it faces and, indeed, some of the issues that have been so eloquently spoken about already, such as the commitment of forces and the new equipment that is planned.</p>
	<p pid="b.1526.2/3">I also attended Pirbright, spoke to some of the new recruits on their phase 1 training and had an insightful briefing from the commander in charge of that facility. I saw at first hand the high-tech shooting range, where new recruits are taught how to use weapons in an extremely safe environment. They can get used to the equipment in a way that allows the trainers to correct any new recruit who needs some further guidance, in a way what would not be possible traditionally because of the accuracy of the training equipment that they have been given to use. Throughout my experience so far, the quality of the training comes through time and again. Perhaps other Departments could learn some lessons about the quality of the training that the Army is able to undertake. I stand in the House as a perhaps less-than-perfect example of someone at his peak physical fitness, but the effort that goes into, and the quality of, the physical training was also particularly notable.</p>
	<p pid="b.1526.2/4">I was fortunate to spend some time with 1 Royal Anglian on its training exercise. Give that yesterday was the longest day, the name of the exercise&mdash;Druids Dance&mdash;seemed somewhat appropriate on Salisbury plain. I also spent some time with a squadron of the King's Royal Hussars. Again, that was insightful, and I hope in the next few minutes to develop some of the information that was provided to me during those three very informative days. Most recently, I visited the armoured centre at Bovington with the Royal Armoured Corps. Again, I gained first-hand experience of training and speaking to recruits and soldiers at various stages of their Army careers, as well as the leadership of those facilities.</p>
	<p pid="b.1526.2/5">Later in the year, I hope to visit Iraq to see it for <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1684" name="Harry Cohen">myself. Unfortunately, my hon. Friend the Member for Leyton and Wanstead (Harry Cohen)</phrase> is not in his place, but if he got himself on to that visit, we could both see for ourselves what the reality of life is like for the troops in Iraq, by talking to serving soldiers about their experiences and perhaps not relying on&mdash;dare I say?&mdash;propaganda from possibly unreliable sources that cannot be corroborated.</p>
	<p pid="b.1526.2/6">I have had an opportunity to talk to soldiers at all levels, from a recruit who was only a few weeks into phase 1 training to the commander-in-chief of land forces. I spoke to soldiers all the way through: captains, majors, lieutenant-colonels, colonels and all the ranks. I had a particularly interesting conversation over a cup of tea in a deckchair on Salisbury plain with a brigadier, who very kindly hosted me at the headquarters of 12 Mechanised Brigade.</p>
	<p pid="b.1526.2/7">I want to get to the meat of the major issues that were expressed to me, but this is just a snapshot of some of them. The Bowman radio system has not been mentioned specifically in the debate, but it has been alluded to. I got very mixed views from professional soldiers&mdash;the signalmen&mdash;to whom I spoke, but the vast majority of them were impressed with the system. They said that it was fantastic and that the secure communications, the robustness and the whole set up was very good. Where the problems still lie&mdash;they are being resolved&mdash;is in rolling out the additional functionality of the Bowman system.</p>
	<p pid="b.1526.2/8">A number of outsiders have expressed concerns to me about the loss of some knowledge and the encryption ability in relation to the use of unsecured communications. Yet when I was with the Royal Armoured Corps at Bovington recently, I saw with my own eyes recruits being trained to use encryption if the secure communications system falls down. There is a lot of hype and myth about the loss of trained skills and abilities, but on seeing the situation for myself, it was clear that the reality is completely different.</p>
	<p pid="b.1526.2/9">Many people outside the military have expressed to me their views about equipment levels and availability. Being a member of the armed forces parliamentary scheme has allowed me to see the situation for myself and to talk to serving soldiers. On doing so, it became clear&mdash;I hope that my Front-Bench colleagues will take note of this message, and the spirit in which it is intended; this was a learning experience&mdash;that the equipment provided on operational duty was excellent and of the highest quality. Soldiers had what they needed where and when they needed it, but time and again they expressed concerns about training. For example, although the sights provided on operation in Iraq were superb, they were not available in the UK training environment, so there was a delay in deployment and in getting up to speed in the use of that equipment. The thermal imaging sight for the Javelin 2 missile system is an extremely capable piece of kit, but it is not cheap. One sight was available for training use by a number of units, which was sufficient to meeting training needs; however, we could do better.</p>
	<p pid="b.1526.2/10">Some of the equipment used at the land warfare centre to train soldiers is incredible, and a lot of thought has gone into developing the training systems. One room there has desktop computers with training aids that soldiers can use as part of a lesson or in their own time, in order to get back up to speed. They can also take those aids back to their base units, so that they can continue to upgrade their knowledge. There are also gunners' &quot;cabinets&quot;, which are used to train gunners, and a wide range of other training equipment. Yet again, the quality of training is absolutely superb.</p>
	<p pid="b.1526.2/11">Turning to the after-action review and my time spent with 12 Mechanised Brigade on Salisbury plain, the training facilities, tools and equipment provided there are absolutely superb. It is possible to identify whether individual soldiers are standing or lying down, and moving in the right or wrong direction. Such information can be gone through item by item in a replay after the training session, which is incredibly valuable.</p>
	<p pid="b.1526.2/12">On asset management of equipment, particularly the heavier equipment&mdash;the tanks&mdash;it would be remiss of me not to mention the robust session that I had with the King's Royal Hussars in the major's tent at the end of one Wednesday. They expressed their views in a forthright manner, pointing out that although central asset management of tanks such as Scimitars is in principle a good idea in practice, when on exercise troops have to spend a lot of time at the start bringing such equipment back up to standard. Because the unit that has used it previously does not own it and therefore has no personal pride in it, the various niggles are not sorted out before it is put back into storage. As a result, work often needs to be done to bring it back up to standard when it is taken out of storage. I hope that my colleagues on the Front Bench will take note of that information.</p>
	<p pid="b.1526.2/13">The KRH pointed out to me that most of their vehicles have been switched over from petrol to diesel, but my understanding&mdash;I hope that the Minister can correct me if I am wrong&mdash;is that the fuel used is virtually of the type to be found in the public garage down the road. It was duty-paid fuel, and it seemed odd to me to use that for those vehicles and that some arrangement has not been made. Perhaps more important, though, would be taking a lead in looking at biofuels and alternative fuels, to see whether there are ways for the services, and the Army in particular, to set an example on the environmental impact of having a Saxon armoured carrier sitting with its engine running so that tea can be boiled up in the brewing vessel. There is a need for alternative fuels.</p>
	<p pid="b.1526.2/14">A lot of comments have been made about soldiers having to buy their own kit, especially if they want anything decent. My experience is that that may have been the case a few years back, but the quality of kit is mighty fine now. It is good stuff. It is good kit. I was issued a pair of boots before going out to Salisbury plain, and only remembered them the day before. So, I had three days out in these brand new boots, but without a blister to speak of, and believe me that was not because I was sitting down, because I certainly had to do a lot of walking.</p>
	<p pid="b.1526.2/15">What came across to me was that soldiers do still buy some personal kit, but that is for personalisation reasons and not because there is anything wrong with the kit. One comment made to me was about a lightweight fleece jacket. Someone had bought one, but two months on they are being issued as standard, and he is looking for the receipt to try to take it back. The quality of food has also come a long way. Napoleon said that an army marches on its stomach, and the only comment made to me was that an awful lot of soldiers carry their own bottles of Tabasco sauce to spice things up a little.</p>
	<p pid="b.1526.2/16">Safety was absolutely paramount on the exercise. Someone twisted an ankle and the whole exercise on the plain was closed down while that was attended to. The quality of the safety, like the training, was phenomenal. Loader training at the Royal Armoured centre involved teaching loaders to get away from the recoil of the Challenger 2 breech. Almost everything seemed to be done, too, in terms of risk assessment. I started slightly cynically, as a Member of Parliament, thinking that things might be being talked about and done for my benefit. But when I sat back in the middle of the exercise and could see things happening for real, I started to realise that risk assessment is well and truly embedded.</p>
	<p pid="b.1526.2/17">Pay is never too far from most people's minds, and soldiers are no exception. One thing mentioned was that overseas troops tend to have tax-free pay. What was not mentioned was levels of pay and how well troops are paid now in comparison with some time ago.</p>
	<p pid="b.1526.2/18">I pay tribute to the soldiers I met. Finally, I ask that veterans day should be not just about ex-service personnel and that we should celebrate our current, serving personnel, who do a tremendous job.</p>

	<p pid="b.1530.0/1">I declare an interest in regard to what I wish to say later about Afghanistan.</p>
	<p pid="b.1530.0/2">I have some sympathy with the problems of the Minister of State and the Ministry of Defence. I know as well as anyone that although the Ministry has what appear to be vast resources&mdash;&pound;32 billion a year or whatever it is&mdash;that does not enable it to do more than a proportion of what it would like to achieve. The Ministry of Defence is always treated with a lot of jealousy by other home Departments. I recall Margaret Thatcher once saying to me that the problem with the Ministry of Defence is that it has no friends. I suggested that the Foreign Office was perhaps a friend, and she said, &quot;The Foreign Office? They're not wet; they're drenched!&quot; And so was the conversation brought to a premature end.</p>
	<p pid="b.1530.0/3">I hope that the Minister of State will forgive me for saying that our discussion so far illustrates why the Leader of the House was quite wrong to suggest that a debate such as this one meets the Government's responsibilities with regard to the House having an opportunity to debate Iraq or other fundamental issues of defence policy. We have just heard from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1843" name="Robert Flello">the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South (Mr. Flello)</phrase> and from others about many important topics, and we cannot go through dozens relevant issues, which just happen to include Iraq and Afghanistan, and then say that the House of Commons has fulfilled its responsibilities and that Parliament has been able to agree or disagree with the Government's policy. That is not acceptable. The United States Congress has had many opportunities to debate Iraq and Afghanistan, and I suggest to the Minister that his Department, and, I hope, the Foreign Office, will impress upon the Leader of the House, who ought to know better than most, why such a debate would be timely and necessary in the wider public interest if the Government wish to try to win back some support for their policy.</p>
	<p pid="b.1530.0/4">I shall not detain the House long, but I want to make two kinds of comment. First, I shall deal with the argument that the Government try to make, either intentionally or subliminally, that the situations in Iraq and Afghanistan&mdash;the problems, opportunities and tasks&mdash;are broadly the same, and that they are pursuing a single strategy and should have the support of the House and the country. Secondly, I want to make specific comments about Afghanistan.</p>
	<p pid="b.1530.0/5">I support what the Government are doing in Afghanistan; it is absolutely right. The starting point was quite different. Al-Qaeda may be present in both Iraq and Afghanistan, but it is in Iraq as a result of the British and American invasion of that country. Before then, there was a secular despot who had no more time for al-Qaeda than do the British Government. Al-Qaeda has identified a big vacuum in Iraq and is there in a big way, but the situation in Afghanistan is fundamentally different. The British, American and other Governments were right to intervene in that country.</p>
	<p pid="b.1530.0/6">The second consideration is that the United States had genuine global support. A few years on, it is easy to forget how unanimous that support and sympathy was around the world; there was also recognition of the need to take swift action against the Taliban, because they were giving al-Qaeda practical support. Another consideration is that there is not the insurgency in Afghanistan that there is in Iraq. People express great pessimism about Afghanistan going the wrong way, and talk about mission creep and our being sucked into something insoluble. There are indeed major problems, but they are of a quite different order. For practical purposes, the whole of Iraq&mdash;certainly in the areas where the population is concentrated, in Baghdad, Basra and elsewhere&mdash;is convulsed by the insurgency. In Afghanistan the Government's remit is relatively limited. However, that is not because there is general insurgency, but because warlords and others control individual provinces and deny respect for the central Government. The situation is not comparable.</p>
	<p pid="b.1530.0/7">Furthermore, 40,000 Iraqis and others have died since the insurgency began. There have been fatalities in Afghanistan, but they are of a different order.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-06-22b.1531.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1660" speakername="Malcolm Rifkind" colnum="1531"  time="015:17:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060622/debtext/60622-0633.htm#06062269000635">
	<p pid="b.1531.1/1">My hon. Friend is correct; the situation could deteriorate significantly, but at present there is no evidence of such an unholy alliance materialising. There have been no major military incidents of a comparable kind in Afghanistan.</p>
	<p pid="b.1531.1/2">In Afghanistan, there is not the sectarian split that has so dominated the Iraqi issue. Afghanistan is overwhelmingly a Sunni country and no one suggests that that situation is likely to change in any meaningful way. There is no equivalent of the Kurdish dimension; no part of Afghanistan has aspirations to the total independence that would fragment the country. Nor does Afghanistan have what is in one respect the curse of oil, to create further division in that state. However, there are big problems and we must look frankly at why the coalition forces of NATO and others, including the Afghan Government, are finding it so difficult to cope.</p>
	<p pid="b.1531.1/3">Part of the problem is that the Taliban were never defeated in the conventional sense; they simply faded away. They realised the overwhelming strength of the United States, in particular, and its allies, and withdrew to their villages, to the hill areas and the frontier where they could regroup and continue, which creates a very different situation. In addition, there is the inability of the western forces to act in a coherent and united fashion.</p>
	<p pid="b.1531.1/4">Earlier, I raised the question of the integration of the international forces operating in Afghanistan. I appreciate and understand the difficulties. Even within NATO, there are countries with different views on whether they would wish to take part in the kind of work being carried out by Operation Enduring Freedom. However, it is manifestly absurd to have a situation in which many thousands of British, American and other NATO forces are all operating within the country, but with two separate command structures for all practical purposes, two different rules of engagement and with an attempt now being made to draw them closer together. That is a wasteful use of resources and a wasteful way of approaching these matters.</p>
	<p pid="b.1531.1/5">The Minister knows that perfectly well&mdash;although he is not in a position to say it in quite the blunt terms that I am using&mdash;and the United States knows it perfectly well. Most countries know it well&mdash;even if the only way in which we can get a single unified command in Afghanistan, in order to maximise operations against the Taliban and other elements in that country, is to say to the one or two countries in NATO that do not want to go in that direction that they should no longer take part in the operation. Most of NATO is willing to work in a unified way. The United States, which is NATO's leading member state, can hardly be expected not to be part of a single, unified process.</p>
	<p pid="b.1531.1/6">There is a word of warning for the United States. It has seen the British and NATO involvement in Helmand province as the beginning of a process that will enable it to reduce its own troop complement in Afghanistan. Indeed, Donald Rumsfeld, in his usual sensitive fashion, has said as much, and has anticipated that the Americans will now be able to reduce their commitment. That would be an incredibly foolish mistake&mdash;comparable to the mistake that the United States, and indeed the rest of us, have been making since the beginning of the Afghan operation.</p>
	<p pid="b.1531.1/7">When the Taliban were overthrown&mdash;when Karzai's Government came into effect&mdash;the best estimate at that time was that Afghanistan would need an international force of about 30,000 to provide real stabilisation. In fact, we ended up with about a third of that number. Against that background, it is not surprising that warlords in individual provinces have been able to continue in control, and it is not a matter for any particular astonishment that the central Government in Kabul have not been able to extend their authority, even in many of the areas where the Taliban are not remotely present, or not present in any significant numbers. The problem is not just the south and the east. It is the failure in Afghanistan&mdash;in this sense it is comparable to Iraq&mdash;to realise that once the war is over, we still need a major international military presence. I am afraid that Mr. Rumsfeld is the guilty party, as he is in Iraq, for having decreed that somehow the numbers needed were far more modest than has turned out to be the case.</p>
	<p pid="b.1531.1/8">The Government are entitled to the support of this House. The United States continues to have a considerable degree of international support for what it is seeking to do in Afghanistan. All the warnings that have been given by the Minister and others about what would happen if the west simply withdrew from Afghanistan are entirely correct and justified, but that should not be used as an excuse to maintain an inefficient military command structure that cannot deliver the best results and, most of all, it cannot be used to justify a reducing American military commitment over the next few years.</p>
	<p pid="b.1531.1/9">One of the lessons that we should all have learned from history, over 100 years, is that if one wants to make a profound change in countries of lower economic and social development, which have major internal problems of stability and cultural differences, one needs to be there for a long time. If one is not prepared to do that, one should not go there in the first place. That is particularly true in Afghanistan at the moment. If the Government are able to pursue such an approach&mdash;not only in their own policy, but in the recommendations that they make to other Governments, including the United States&mdash;they will deserve the support ofthe House.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-06-22b.1533.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1766" speakername="Sarah McCarthy-Fry" colnum="1533"  time="015:29:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060622/debtext/60622-0633.htm#06062269000636">
	<p pid="b.1533.0/1">I begin by paying tribute to the brave men and women of our armed forces, who risk their lives every day to keep us safe and secure. My constituency is the home of the Royal Navy and Portsmouth ships have defended our country in many famous sea battles. Portsmouth itself suffered badly from bombing during the second world war and we who live there are aware that our city still remains a military target. My constituents and I owe a great debt to the men and women who have defended and continue to defend the city and our country.</p>
	<p pid="b.1533.0/2">Up until fairly recently, our defence policy was centred on keeping our borders and those of our allies safe from attack by potential enemy states by preparing our stand-by forces for traditional combat operations. However, things have shifted dramatically since 9/11, and our country now faces threats from not so much states, or even organisations with which we can negotiate, but shadowy individuals who are not allied to any one state. Such individuals can cross international borders and operate within our borders. They have unprecedented access to technology and weaponry that can cause destruction on a massive scale. They also operate without a thought for preserving their own lives. The accepted conventions under which defence policy was formulated for many years have thus changed.</p>
	<p pid="b.1533.0/3">We can no longer adopt a mentality of sitting on top of a hill and fending away the attackers and sheer force of numbers does not help much against a chemical or biological attack. We must have a smarter and more agile position in which we use the best equipment that technological advances can give us. Such equipment must be able to move in quickly and perform a multi-functional role, and the men and women who operate that equipment need to be professionals who can exercise judgment. They must be treated with the respect that they deserve, given the danger in which we ask them to put themselves.</p>
	<p pid="b.1533.0/4">The Ministry of Defence must prepare for all eventualities when it makes policy. We owe it to the men and women of our armed forces to ensure that they are trained for all types of conflict. We do not want them to have to be put in a situation that has not been foreseen and for which they have not been properly prepared. Of course, we cannot foresee every eventuality, but we need to think outside the box and prepare for as many scenarios as we can possibly envisage, no matter how unlikely they might seem at the time.</p>
	<p pid="b.1533.0/5">We need to consider not just conflict. Often the work of the armed forces is not armed combat, but peacekeeping, peace enforcing and disaster relief. The role of peacekeeping and peace enforcing becomes intertwined with the international objective of sustainable economic development in unstable countries. The role of the troop deployment in Afghanistan is as much to curb the narcotics trade as it is to bring security and stability to the area. That is a delicate role for our troops to undertake. The more successful we are at curbing the traffic in narcotics, the more danger our troops are likely to be in. How do we win the hearts and minds of local people if we are viewed as removing their livelihood? That must be balanced against the fact that Afghanistan will not have security and stability in the long term while the narcotics trade flourishes. We need to ensure that our troops are fully trained for such a role and that we have troops who can exercise their judgment and act professionally in such delicate situations.</p>
	<p pid="b.1533.0/6">I spoke earlier about treating our troops with the respect they deserve. They need to be treated with respect by not just the MOD and their commanding officers, but politicians, the public and the media. A few months ago, I had the opportunity to visit Iraq. I spoke to the men and women who are doing a superb job helping the Iraqis to rebuild their lives and helping to train the Iraqi security forces so that they can take control of their own safety and security. They face danger every day, but they keep their cool and behave professionally against extreme provocation. However, one would not know that from the media coverage. The only stories that are widely reported in the British press are the negative ones, which are then relayed across the rest of the world. That gives the armed insurgents the ammunition with which to arm their followers, which thus puts our troops in even more danger.</p>
	<p pid="b.1533.0/7">I spoke to many serving soldiers who told me about circumstances in which they have faced insurgents who have known only too well the rules of engagement under which our troops operate and goaded them to a point at which they hoped that our troops would break. However, such is the professionalism of our troops that they invariably do not do that. Nevertheless, accusations are still made, and they are duly investigated by our service police, contrary to what <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1684" name="Harry Cohen">my hon. Friend the Member for Leyton and Wanstead (Harry Cohen)</phrase> said.</p>
	<p pid="b.1533.0/8">I heard of instances of the security services being hampered in their investigations by the unwillingness of alleged victims to give evidence because they had been approached by agents of predatory lawyers who told them not to co-operate with an inquiry, but to sue through the courts for compensation. The Army investigators then stand accused of failing to investigate properly, or covering up, when they are in fact doing their best to investigate properly, but being prevented from doing so. None of that gets properly reported by the British media. It obviously has not reached the ears of my hon. Friend the Member for Leyton and Wanstead. Is it any wonder that some people ask why we are still in Iraq, when all they hear are the negative and unsubstantiated rumours?</p>
	<p pid="b.1533.0/9">The men and women on the ground whom I met felt that they were still part of the solution in Iraq, not part of the problem, but we all recognise that there is a fine line that needs to be kept continually under review. We have a job to do at the request of the elected Iraqi Government and we need to stay until the job is done or the Iraqi Government wish us to leave. There is an important task to do in training and helping the Iraqis to take responsibility for their own security. From my own observations, I believe that they have the training, experience and expertise to perform that task well.</p>
	<p pid="b.1533.0/10">It is not just the Army, the Marines or the RAF. The Navy, too, is doing its bit. Representing, as I do, the constituency that is the home of the Royal Navy, no one will be surprised that I am speaking up for it, as it was a bone of contention among sailors whom I met on HMS Bulwark in the Arabian Gulf that there was never any recognition in the media back home of the important work that the Navy was doing in Iraq, working with the Iraqi navy to protect the oil terminals that are the lifeblood of Iraq and the economic key to its reconstruction.</p>
	<p pid="b.1533.0/11">I saw the professionalism and diplomacy of our modus operandi when boarding unknown craft that had strayed into the exclusion zone. I was shown the basket of gifts that the captain of the patrol vessel carries with him, which are handed out to the crew while the marines search the craft. That is how we win hearts and minds and how we gain the valuable intelligence that we need in the fight against international terrorism, not by going in with all guns blazing, although of course there may be times when that is the appropriate response.</p>
	<p pid="b.1533.0/12">When we look at defence policy, we must make sure that we consider how our troops are viewed here at home and in other countries, because that has an impact not only on our ability to defend ourselves, but on our ability to recruit and retain high-quality professionals. We want to make the armed services attractive to young people, to ensure that we recruit people of the highest calibre. We also need to ensure that our armed services are representative of our population. That means encouraging recruitment of men and women from all ethnic backgrounds and reaching out to the gay and lesbian community and encouraging gays and lesbians to join up, rather than the shameful way in which they were treated by the MOD for many years.</p>
	<p pid="b.1533.0/13">I was encouraged by my right hon. Friend the Minister of State when he told the House last year that we had recruited our first Muslim, Hindu and Sikh chaplains, and I hope we can continue to work with the Equal Opportunities Commission and the Commission for Racial Equality to ensure greater diversity.</p>
	<p pid="b.1533.0/14">For too long, our armed services have been a closed world, hidden behind a cloak of secrecy, because of the fear that operational effectiveness could be compromised. But all too often we have seen that secrecy encouraging a culture of bullying. It goes without saying that junior ranks must obey orders from senior officers without question, because their own lives and those of their colleagues depend on it. However, one thing above all else that came out of my visits to Iraq, Cyprus and Oman is the tremendous team spirit among regiments, air crew and ships companies. They all had a joint commitment to a common goal and they were all fiercely protective of their fellow soldiers, sailors and airmen. Time and again, these young men and women told me that what they appreciated from their armed service was the training that enabled them to operate as a team.</p>
	<p pid="b.1533.0/15">Team work is much more likely to be generated by trust, transparency and openness than by operation as a secret closed group. We do not need to bully people into obeying orders and we do not need to break people's spirit. We no longer operate trench warfare and we do not ask our troops to blindly go over the top in the knowledge that not all of them will survive, but in the hope that some of them will.</p>

	<p pid="b.1536.2/1">My hon. Friend is making a thoughtful and wide-ranging speech. I have responded to the Blake report and I clearly stated that the complaints commissioner&mdash;that is the title of the post&mdash;will be independent. In addition, there will be civilian representation on complaints panels. As she said, the Armed Forces Bill which has progressed to the House of Lords, would allow us to achieve that, and the mechanisms can be defined and debated in the other place. We have taken on board the main issues that she raised, and we have made progress. I believe that Nicholas Blake, QC, the author of the report, is happy with the action we have taken.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-06-22b.1538.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1612" speakername="James Arbuthnot" colnum="1538"  time="015:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060622/debtext/60622-0634.htm#06062269000643">
	<p pid="b.1538.2/1">My hon. Friend has not read what the Chancellor said, because <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1724" name="Julian Lewis">the Minister and my hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, East (Dr. Lewis)</phrase> have rightly pointed out that the Chancellor repeated the Labour manifesto. However, it is mildly irritating that the Chancellor's people say one thing in private, while he says something else in public, and the problem is that we have grown used to such behaviour from the Labour Government.</p>
	<p pid="b.1538.2/2">I welcome the fact that in last night's remarks the Chancellor appeared to be a genuine convert to the interests of defence. He discussed</p>
	<p pid="b.1538.2/3" class="indent">&quot;the same strength of national purpose we will demonstrate in protecting our security in this Parliament and the long-term&mdash;strong in defence, in fighting terrorism, upholding NATO, supporting our armed forces at home and abroad, and retaining our independent nuclear deterrent.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1538.2/4">I was delighted to hear that he is intent on supporting our armed forces at home and abroad. If that implies that the money for any replacement of the nuclear deterrent will come out of new money, not current Ministry of Defence programmes, we will be making some progress with the Chancellor of the Exchequer.</p>
	<p pid="b.1538.2/5">My Committee has produced a report on the deployment to Afghanistan, and we will undertake a second inquiry fairly soon. That deployment has two elements that are separate, but co-ordinated: the movement of the allied rapid reaction corps from Rheindahlen to take over the international security assistance force operation in Kabul; and the 16th Brigade doing a slightly different job in Helmand. In our report, we concluded that we fully supported the deployment to Afghanistan and considered it essential in the interests not only of the economic and social stability of Afghanistan but of the region and the world as a whole. The attack on the twin towers demonstrated the consequences of allowing states to fail, and we felt that it was right to take the action that we did. In that, I fully echo <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1660" name="Malcolm Rifkind">the remarks made by my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Kensington and Chelsea (Sir Malcolm Rifkind)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.1538.2/6">Various issues arise out of the deployment. It is essential to the credibility of NATO that the mission should succeed. We are worried about the national caveats that many members of NATO placed on the use of their troops. When we visit Afghanistan as a Committee, as we will shortly, we will need to satisfy ourselves that the rules of engagement, which the Minister tells us are more robust than any that have operated before, are a cohesive feature of NATO's operations. I am afraid that I do not agree with my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Kensington and Chelsea that one can say to countries, &quot;If you don't want to play by our rules of engagement, then don't come.&quot; The method of collecting troops together to go to Afghanistan was difficult and time-consuming enough, and too many countries might simply say, &quot;All right then, we won't come.&quot; We need a broad international coalition in a country such as Afghanistan, given the difficult things that we are doing there.</p>
	<p pid="b.1538.2/7">Will the Minister tell us whether the operational command and control between ISAF and Operation Enduring Freedom has been fully worked out yet? That is not entirely clear from the Government's response to our report. I am grateful to the Government for providing that response within two months, to the very day, of the report's publication.</p>
	<p pid="b.1538.2/8">Our report refers to our worries about air assets and vehicles. We stated that we were concerned that the Harriers would leave Kandahar in June, and we were delighted to hear that the Government have decided now, perhaps because of what we said, perhaps through pressure from NATO, to extend the deployment of Harriers in Kandahar until at least March next year. I hope that, by that time, the runway in Kandahar will be upgraded and can take some of the F16 planes, which can then be brought in from other countries.</p>
	<p pid="b.1538.2/9">We were also pleased when the Ministry of Defence announced in April that, as a result of requests from commanders in the field, more than 60 Pinzgauer armoured wheeled vehicles were being ordered for deployment in Afghanistan. I was therefore a little surprised when the Minister, in responding to a question from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1509" name="Ann Winterton">my hon. Friend the Member for Congleton (Ann Winterton)</phrase> about what vehicles would be available, did not confirm that good news. I hope that he will confirm that the acquisition and deployment will happen.</p>
	<p pid="b.1538.2/10">We were unsurprisingly worried about overstretch. The number of troops in Afghanistan is low and the tasks that we ask them to perform are difficult. We need to be clear about their remit. We made the point that there is a fundamental tension between the aim of destroying the narcotics trade, on which a huge proportion of the Helmand province relies in order to live, and introducing security and stability to the area. The Government response to our report states there is no such tension. I simply cannot understand the logic of the Government's position. The tension exists. That is not to say that the twin roles are wrong. They are right because one cannot introduce long-term security in a drugs state. We have to get rid of narcotics from Afghanistan and introduce stability and security. However, there is tension between the two roles, which British troops, having worked in Northern Ireland and Iraq, will be well trained and equipped to tackle.</p>
	<p pid="b.1538.2/11">I said that I was in Iraq a couple of weeks ago with the Defence Committee. We found greater ground for hope than the media in this country would have us believe. We were encouraged by the formation of the final building blocks, which were put in place while we were in Baghdad, of the Government of Iraq. We were pleased that the Minister for the Interior and the Minister for Defence were appointed. That will produce some hope for Iraq. We were encouraged by the fact that the Muthanna province was close to being ready to be handed over. We were encouraged by the extent of the training of the tenth division of the Iraqi security forces. We were told that, in spite of the attacks on people who tried to join the Iraqi security forces, the Iraqi army is fundamentally full. It is being trained effectively by British troops, among others.</p>
	<p pid="b.1538.2/12">No one would suggest that the whole picture is encouraging, however. There are serious worries in Basra and elsewhere. We were not convinced that the local government in Basra was working in the interests of local people or the security of Iraq, or that there was any proper control over the killings between the various power-seeking Shi'a groups. However, I do not believe that there is an insurgency in Basra. The insurgency is happening in the north and west of Iraq. In Basra, there is a power struggle between Shi'a groups who see it as a rich area that they can exploit for their own interests, and they are using the most violent and awful means to do so. So there are real worries about Iraq.</p>
	<p pid="b.1538.2/13">We felt, when we talked to our troops in Iraq, that their morale was high. They are doing the most incredible work in the harshest possible conditions. I remember travelling through the city of Basra in an un-airconditioned Warrior armoured personnel carrier, and, when we reached a place of comparative safety, the mortar cover being taken off. When 50&ordm; C air came flooding in, we thought, &quot;Thank God, that's cool!&quot; The working conditions in those vehicles are extremely difficult, and the troops working in Basra are carrying 40 or 50 lb of body armour, kit and ammunition, which is very difficult for them.</p>
	<p pid="b.1538.2/14">It is not just that there is no fat in the operation. Our troops are not exactly penny pinching, but they have to juggle all the time with the available personnel, and with equipment that might be unavailable or going out of service. The number of helicopters there is tiny, and the number of vehicles is too small. To return to what the Chancellor has said, and to the support that he has given to the defence of this country, I hope, now that he has said those things, that he means them. I also hope that he will put our money where his mouth is.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-06-22b.1541.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1926" speakername="James Gray" colnum="1541"  time="016:01:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060622/debtext/60622-0634.htm#06062269000644">
	<p pid="b.1541.0/1">It is a bold Back Bencher who follows two right hon. colleagues of such great distinction in <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1660" name="Malcolm Rifkind">these areas as my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Kensington and Chelsea (Sir Malcolm Rifkind)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1612" name="James Arbuthnot">my right hon. Friend the Member for North-East Hampshire(Mr. Arbuthnot)</phrase>. They know what they are talking about. I shall therefore seek not to try to equal their distinction, but to talk about rather different matters.</p>
	<p pid="b.1541.0/2">I wholly agreed with my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Kensington and Chelsea when he said that this debate should not be about Afghanistan, Iraq or the renewal of Trident. Those subjects are sufficiently large to warrant an entire day's debate or more&mdash;perhaps several days debate over the years to come. To presume that those topics can be covered in this relatively short debate this afternoon would be a mistake.</p>
	<p pid="b.1541.0/3">I therefore intend to keep off the subjects of Iraq and Afghanistan, apart from mentioning in passing that my own strongly held opposition to what we did in Iraq in 2003 is one of the perfectly sensible reasons why I have ceased to be a Front-Bench spokesman on defence. I could not have continued to perform that role, given that I did not entirely approve of what my party was doing at the time. I also have some reservations about whether we shall be able to look back, in 10 or 20 years time, and say that what we have done in Afghanistan has been a success. I very much hope that it will be&mdash;it is a job that very much needs to be done&mdash;but whether we can be confident that that is the case is a matter of some debate. However, Iraq and Afghanistan are matters that we can debate at length on other occasions. Similarly, the whole question of the renewal of Trident is a huge matter for debate in the years to come. It is a matter for the nation, not just for party politics.</p>
	<p pid="b.1541.0/4">I felt slightly queasy about the Chancellor of the Exchequer's intervention into the debate yesterday, not least because, if anyone takes the opportunity to Google the words &quot;Gordon Brown&quot; to check up on what the right hon. Gentleman has said on defence, they will find that, over the past 10 years or thereabouts, he has said nothing at all on the matter. So far as I am aware, he has never visited a defence establishment. He took no interest in defence until last night, when he reiterated what had been said in the Labour party manifesto, but made it appear that he was making a spectacular announcement on the &pound;25 billion of defence spending on renewing Trident. I suspect that that has far more to do with his tactical position in the Labour party than with a strategic approach to the defence of the world.</p>
	<p pid="b.1541.0/5">I want to spend my time today commenting on something that I was greatly encouraged to learn that the Government are doing. The strategic defence review was, in its time, radical and far-thinking. Given the 17-year time span, most people thought that it represented a worthwhile approach, although we regretted the failure to release the foreign affairs baseline on which the SDR was said to have been based. A strategic defence review cannot be very good if the foreign policy baseline is not known. In any event, that relatively radical and forward-looking document was severely outdated following one event on <phrase class="date" code="2001-09-11">11 September 2001</phrase>, which made all previous thinking about defence irrelevant. Defence thinking as a whole had to start again from scratch.</p>
	<p pid="b.1541.0/6">I do not think that the subsequent so-called new chapter of the SDR&mdash;or indeed the defence White Paper, which one of our defence chiefs described as being more about slogans than about policies&mdash;added much to the debate. I was pleased to hear from the Minister today that a new strategic context White Paper would be produced later this year. I hope that it will represent a fundamental piece of thinking, founded solidly on a foreign policy baseline. It is no good talking about defence in the abstract; we must talk about it purely in the context of foreign policy and, nowadays, the context of security at home. We must involve the Home Office&mdash;and the Department for International Development, in passing&mdash;in that consideration. We need to know what our defence forces are required to do before deciding how to enable them to do it.</p>
	<p pid="b.1541.0/7">There is a degree of confusion about that. Are our servicemen required to defend the homeland against an aggressive outside attacker? I suppose that that is theoretically the case, but it is probably very unlikely. It is hard to imagine any third party attacking the nation, although of course it is right for us to have the capability to put up a defence should that become necessary.</p>
	<p pid="b.1541.0/8">Is it our job to deter a potential aggressor? I suppose that the question arises of what we do if and when it becomes obvious that Iran is going to make use of its enriched uranium for military rather than any other purposes. If that becomes obvious, to what degree does international law allow us, alongside the Americans, to take an aggressive stance of one sort or another against Iran? At what stage do we believe that pre-emption becomes a reasonable cause for the use of force?</p>
	<p pid="b.1541.0/9">During the run-up to the Iraq war in 2003, it was said that we must stop the Iraqis using their weapons against our soldiers in Cyprus. That was one of the excuses in the dodgy dossier. What was ignored for the moment was that Foreign Office travel advice for tourists was that it was perfectly acceptable to travel to Cyprus throughout the Iraq crisis, at the same time as the MOD was telling us that we had to invade Iraq to prevent that from happening.</p>
	<p pid="b.1541.0/10">Surely our armed services have a role to play in home defence. Perhaps the Territorial Army or the reserve forces could be involved. Surely we should be playing a significantly greater role in defending our nation on shore from asymmetric terrorist attack. Is there a bigger role for the TA than the role conferred on it in the new chapter of the SDR? Might that bigger role be sorting out huge emergencies? At present, it appears that we could do a pretty good job if a serious emergency occurred in London&mdash;probably&mdash;but what if there were simultaneous attacks on three of our cities? Would our forces be up to dealing with that? Might there not be a role for the TA?</p>
	<p pid="b.1541.0/11">Alternatively, is our role to take part&mdash;along with NATO and the United Nations, and possibly even the European Union, although I doubt it&mdash;in some form of coalition, going around the world and suppressing tyrants? That is often cited as the reason for what we did against Saddam Hussein in Iraq&mdash;and I am very glad that we did it; he is a bad man and I am glad that he has gone. But will our role in future be to enter willingly into coalitions, perhaps alongside the neocon element in the United States, galloping around the world sorting out bad men?</p>
	<p pid="b.1541.0/12">I remember Richard Perle saying in a notable speech that he believed that the US was a sort of sheriff, galloping around the world at the head of a posse sorting out the bad guys. One of the closest advisers to the US President, he made it clear that anyone not in the posse was one of the bad guys, and that he believed that we had to perform a type of neo-imperialist policing duty around the world. Although there may be some such role to play, we did not play it in Cambodia or Darfur, and international law provides scant justification for that approach.</p>
	<p pid="b.1541.0/13">The Pentagon has justified what is happening in Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere by saying that a war is being fought against terrorism, but our defence policy is different. We say that we do not want to engage in warfare against terrorists, and that we want to prevent asymmetric attacks being levelled against us. That difference between the UK and US approaches is very important. In that context, there is one significant gap in what this country otherwise does rather well, and that is that we are not entirely clear about why we do some things. In particular, there are discontinuities in the responsibilities undertaken by the Foreign Office, the Ministry of Defence and the Home Office. For example, is the Home Office or the MOD responsible for homeland defence, or does DFID have a role in that? I believe that we should consider introducing a sensible military stratagem planning mechanism, as has happened elsewhere around the world. Another option might be to establish a Government Department that deals with military planning, which would consider such matters in very fundamental terms.</p>
	<p pid="b.1541.0/14">Moreover, we need a fundamental discussion of the intelligence services. Should we retain the present structure of three separate services, or is it time for them to be amalgamated? My noble Friend Lord Hamilton asked that very question in the other place only this week. Again, is it right to retain our three services? Lieutenant-Colonel Tim Collins has said that he believes that we should abolish the RAF. I hasten to say that I do not agree with that at all, given that there is a substantial RAF base in my constituency, but I believe that we should look at the fundamentals of our defence policy. What are our people being asked to do, and why? What sort of mechanisms is needed to ensure that they are able to carry out what is asked of them? We need the sort of grand strategic policy for the UK that we have not had since 1956.</p>
	<p pid="b.1541.0/15">As many speakers have said, our armed forces are very professional, but they suffer from their own can-do approach. Almost regardless of what politicians ask them to do, they will salute, turn to the right and march off and do it. It is possible that they grumble about it, in the dark corners of their messes, but they never do so in public. They do what they are asked to do, and they are incredibly professional. However, how long can we rely on that can-do approach? I do not much like the word &quot;overstretch&quot;, but there are real signs that our armed forces are being asked to do more and more with less and less. Despite the Chancellor of the Exchequer's comforting words last night about the comprehensive spending review that is coming up shortly, there has been briefing going around to the effect that the Army could be cut to 80,000 men. That is smaller than the international definition of what constitutes an Army, and a British Army of that size would be the smallest since Waterloo.</p>
	<p pid="b.1541.0/16">I accept that all that may be the result of counter-briefing. The Chancellor may well make it clear during the comprehensive spending review that the 80,000 figure is nothing to worry about, that the reality is not nearly so bad and that the true figure will be a fantastic 85,000. That would be a classic example of the sort of thing that the right hon. Gentleman does.</p>
	<p pid="b.1541.0/17">We do not need an Army with 100,000 personnel&mdash;we need one that is significantly larger than that. Our Navy and Air Force also need to be larger, so that they and the Army can perform all the tasks that this Government, and all Governments in the foreseeable future, will require of them. In addition, personnel need to be better paid. What incentive is there to be an Army corporal, in charge of 10 people in situations of extreme danger, when the pay is only &pound;14,000 or &pound;15,000 a year? Police constables get much more. We must look at pay and conditions in the armed forces, as well as at the equipment&mdash;both personal and on the larger scale&mdash;that is provided. We must also consider every aspect of how our armed forces personnel are sent into war. We need a fundamental review of why we are doing things, how we can encourage our people to do them and how to be certain that whatever we do in the future is done well. One thing is for sure: the European Union is not worth the paper it is written on with regard to defence. The notion that we can have some sort of European Union defence force in the future is laughable. The only countries worth talking about in the defence world today, and the only people who can truly project power for good around the world, are the United States and the United Kingdom acting together in NATO. Without those two nations and NATO, I shudder to think about the future of our great globe.</p>
	<p pid="b.1541.0/18">It is right to have a fundamental look at what we are asking our armed services to do and Opposition Members will co-operate with the Government in doing so. Having done precisely that and published the results, they should look fundamentally at how best to achieve them. They should look into manpower and equipment, how our armed forces are structured and the rules of engagement. They should look at human rights and health and safety&mdash;I was astonished to hear someone say that they were glad that an exercise had been stopped because someone had twisted their ankle&mdash;the International Criminal Court and how people are asked to act on the battlefield. All those things are fundamental to doing a first-class job, which our people have always done, and to continue in a fully professional way for years to come. If we do not do so, we will not be able to play the role that we have traditionally played&mdash;the role of doing significant good in securing the safe future of our globe.</p>

	<p pid="b.1545.0/1">It is a pleasure to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1926" name="James Gray">my hon. Friend the Member for North Wiltshire (Mr. Gray)</phrase>, not least because, having been in the Territorial Army, he speaks with authority. I think I am right in saying that he is the only person to have done three stints in the armed forces parliamentary scheme and to have reached the dizzy heights of a brigadier, at least.</p>
	<p pid="b.1545.0/2">I would like to place our debate in context by asking what the Government think of their armed forces. I can see what new Labour thinks simply by looking in front of me. Apart from the Minister who is winding up the debate, the silent Whip and the silent Parliamentary Private Secretary, there are acres of empty green Benches. Not a single Back Bencher is in his place for a debate on defence policy in Government time. It is embarrassing&mdash;<i> [Interruption.]&mdash;</i>so embarrassing that the Minister is about to intervene.</p>

	<p pid="b.1545.2/1">As the Minister has kindly pointed out, our smaller party has six Back Benchers in their places, which is six more than the Minister has on his side&mdash;and there is, of course, the token Liberal.</p>
	<p pid="b.1545.2/2">So what do the Government think of our armed forces? I shall give three examples. First, in 2003, the Deputy Prime Minister&mdash;still hanging in there with his Office&mdash;in front of a number of witnesses, including some of our Doorkeepers, said, &quot;All soldiers are boneheads.&quot; That is what he thinks of our armed forces. Secondly, there is the disgraceful way in which the Government refused to take any action to assist soldiers and others on operations to register to vote before the last general election. I raised the matter time and again, as did <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1498" name="Andrew Tyrie">my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester (Mr. Tyrie)</phrase>, but the Government took no real action. One can only surmise why not.</p>
	<p pid="b.1545.2/3">The third indicator of the new Labour Government's view of the armed forces is seen in a business news leader article, entitled &quot;Huge cuts threat to defence industry&quot; in the <i> Evening Standard </i>on <phrase class="date" code="">12 June</phrase> this year. Written by Robert Fox, who is generally pretty well informed, it says:</p>
	<p pid="b.1545.2/4" class="indent">&quot;Chancellor Gordon Brown...wants &pound;1 billion taken from defence and given to...homeland security...A recently retired chief of staff commented: 'They'll have to tear up Labour's whole defence strategy and start all over again.'...defence chiefs have already been told that 'at least one major procurement programme has to go'&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="b.1545.2/5">probably the aircraft carriers. I have no idea whether that is true, but I do know, as hon. Members have already pointed out, that in this Chancellor's time here, he has shown precious little interest in and very little support for defence. I speak today against that background.</p>
	<p pid="b.1545.2/6">The major point that I should like to make is about the politicisation and the responsibilities of senior officers in the armed forces, and then I shall touch on the situation in Afghanistan. First, on senior officers, last November I was quoted in <i> The Daily Telegraph</i> as saying that the Chief of the General Staff, General Sir Mike Jackson, lacked the courage to stand up for his soldiers. I first discovered that that had been quoted&mdash;I had had a conversation with the journalist&mdash;when I got a telephone call and was asked to ring General Jackson, who had rung the then leader of the Conservative party. I asked him why he had phoned the then leader of the Conservative party instead of me, and he did not really answer. He hectored me down the telephone for 30 minutes in a somewhat bullying way.</p>
	<p pid="b.1545.2/7">It is not my business to have an argument with the Chief of the General Staff, so I am glad to say that a mutual friend organised a meeting. We had a meeting for an hour and three quarters. It was a convivial meeting and we discussed things in a reasonable way. There was not much meeting of minds, but I accept&mdash;I promised him at the time that I would&mdash;that I have no knowledge that he lacks courage. It was quite wrong of me to have said that he lacks courage, and I withdraw that unreservedly and apologise to him. I said that I would do that at the first opportunity, and this is the first opportunity that I have had. However, I did tell him that I would not withdraw the bit about standing up for his soldiers, and that is part of what I intend to discuss today.</p>
	<p pid="b.1545.2/8">Incidentally, I have no personal problem with General Jackson, so I do not wish this to counted as a personal attack on him in any way. He is a public servant who has given good service to this country over a number of years. However, I want to look at what has happened to the armed forces over the past three years&mdash;I shall stick to the past three years.</p>
	<p pid="b.1545.2/9">We had an immensely successful Iraq war in March 2003, or whenever it was. We can all be proud of our soldiers, sailors and airmen for the work that they did then. Since then we have got immersed, as other hon. Members have said, in a very difficult situation in Iraq. We have now deployed to Afghanistan. We have had four battalions of infantry cut from the line of battle. Notwithstanding what was said by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1766" name="Sarah McCarthy-Fry">the hon. Member for Portsmouth, North (Sarah McCarthy-Fry)</phrase>, the TA is haemorrhaging soldiers. Once they have been to Iraq, where they have an interesting experience, most of them do not much want to go again. The reorganisation of the infantry battalions is taking place, too. Although the arms plot was imperfect, I do not believe that that reorganisation will lead to a better system for the infantry.</p>
	<p pid="b.1545.2/10">Demands are now growing for a federation for armed forces personnel. We have to ask why are those demands growing. Why are grass-roots members of the armed forces demanding a federation? Soldiers are public servants. Politicians make the orders and soldiers must obey politicians&mdash;that goes for field marshals, generals and the like&mdash;but senior officers who demand loyalty from those below them are expected in return to give loyalty to those whom they command. That was certainly what I was taught, and hon. Members who have done any form of military service will know that.</p>
	<p pid="b.1545.2/11">Loyalty goes two ways, and the chiefs of staff who represent the armed forces in discussions with the Government should not be seen as the Prime Minister's representatives; rather, they should be seen as representing the armed forces to the Government. I understand that the chiefs of staff have access to the Prime Minister whenever they want it, but I have not heard of that access being used during the draconian defence cuts going on in all three services. What senior officer has resigned recently? None that I have seen, and there is a growing feeling&mdash;it may not be fair&mdash;that some senior officers are apparently more interested in their careers, in knighthoods and in future cosy appointments than in the good of the armed forces and the personnel whom they command. I should like to turn to an example of that: the courts martial that have been taking place in respect of Iraq.</p>
	<p pid="b.1545.2/12">Tight discipline is essential in the armed forces, especially in war, as anyone who has been in battle knows, but discipline is being undermined by a growing human rights culture&mdash;fostered, I am afraid, by the Government&mdash;that is encouraging barrack-room lawyers. Anyone who is guilty of a crime in the armed forces must be prosecuted, but we have a very difficult and continuing war in Iraq. We expect our soldiers to make split-second life-and-death decisions, while someone is trying to kill them. That is not the same as being on parade outside Buckingham palace or, indeed, policing a riot in Trafalgar square.</p>
	<p pid="b.1545.2/13">I will use one case of court martial as an example, because it is completely out of the courts now&mdash;that of Trooper Williams. As hon. Members may remember, in July 2003 Trooper Williams was part of a patrol that stopped a handcart that was being pushed along, filled with mortar bombs. Understandably, the Iraqis pushing the hand-cart scattered. Trooper Williams and a corporal chased one Iraqi into a courtyard and then into a house, where he fought with the corporal accompanying Trooper Williams. Trooper Williams believed&mdash;and who are we to gainsay him, as we were not there?&mdash;that the Iraqi was trying to grab the pistol from the corporal, so he shot him, and he died.</p>
	<p pid="b.1545.2/14">Rightly, the case was taken up by the commanding officer of the regiment to which Trooper Williams was attached. He was arrested and investigated and brought before that commanding officer, who, having taken legal advice, dismissed the case, as was his right. He made a judgment that Trooper Williams was not guilty.</p>
	<p pid="b.1545.2/15">What happened next? Brigadier Vowles and Major-General Howell&mdash;both of whom, as I understand it, are primarily lawyers, rather than soldiers by first profession&mdash;queried the decision. A memo dated March 2004, from the then Adjutant-General&mdash;I believe it was Sir Alistair Irwin&mdash;was sent to the Chief of the General Staff. It states:</p>
	<p pid="b.1545.2/16" class="indent">&quot;With the current legal, political and ginger group interest in the deaths of Iraqi civilians...there is a significant possibility that this case, our investigation and subsequent failure to offer for prosecution could become a <i> cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre </i>for pressure groups and a significant threat to the maintenance of the military justice system. If the Attorney General became aware of it in the meantime, it is possible that would himself order a review of the case.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1545.2/17">So this prosecution was all about ginger groups and the possibility that the case could become a cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre for pressure groups. I ask the senior officers involved: does that constitute standing up for Trooper Williams?</p>
	<p pid="b.1545.2/18">Following that, Trooper Williams was charged with murder under the civilian system and was to be taken to the Old Bailey. He was 18 years old when the incident took place, and for a year and a half he was under threat of trial at the Old Bailey. I suggest that that is a pretty serious matter for anybody.</p>
	<p pid="b.1545.2/19">On <phrase class="date" code="">7 April</phrase> last year, at the Old Bailey, the Crown offered no evidence. I have been told by a senior officer that Williams should be grateful to the Army because, now that he has been tried at the Old Bailey, he cannot be tried again. I wonder what he thinks about that.</p>
	<p pid="b.1545.2/20">What was the role of the Attorney-General,Lord Goldsmith, in all this? The trial judge, Mrs. Justice Hallett, believed that this was possibly a novel intervention by Her Majesty's Attorney-General. One of her judgments says:</p>
	<p pid="b.1545.2/21" class="indent">&quot;No-one in the Army has apparently thought to advise Trooper Williams that although his commanding officer had found in his favour he might still face a civilian prosecution. That is apparently because this is the first time&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="b.1545.2/22">the first time&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="b.1545.2/23" class="indent">&quot;to the knowledge of those appearing before me and called before me, that her Majesty's Attorney General has sought to exercise the powers accorded to him.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1545.2/24">In a written answer to my noble Friend Lord Astor of <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-10">10 November 2005</phrase>, the Attorney-General, speaking about the five members of the 2nd Royal Tank Regiment whose case was dismissed last year, said:</p>
	<p pid="b.1545.2/25" class="indent">&quot;I considered the matter and...I decided that the case should be referred to the CPS because...while there is no suggestion that the court martial would not deal with it impartially, justice would be seen to be done by ventilating the issues in the civilian courts&quot;.&mdash;[<i> Official Report, House of Lords,</i> <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-10">10 November 2005</phrase>; Vol. 675, c. 111W.]</p>
	<p pid="b.1545.2/26">Are this Government and their senior officers standing up for soldiers, or ventilating issues in civilian courts?</p>
	<p pid="b.1545.2/27">I do not expect anything better from a commercial lawyer who happens to be a Minister of the Crown because of his friendship with the Prime Minister, but these people have no idea of the pressures on soldiers, who have to take life-and-death decisions in such situations. Their senior officers should stand up for them, and they should expect better from them. This Government have politicised senior officers in a way that has not happened before. Let me give two examples. I have in my hand an edition of <i> The House Magazine</i>&mdash;one cannot get much more political than the in-house magazine of this place&mdash;that contains a big interview with the Chief of the General Staff. He also did the Andrew Marr programme, which is the BBC's major political programme on a Sunday morning.</p>
	<p pid="b.1545.2/28">Too often, senior officers are seen as apologists for Government policy, rather than as those who are obliged to carry out Government policy. If they disagree with me they are very welcome to say so, but I hope that they will consider my words, and whether there is some truth in what I am saying.</p>

	<p pid="b.1550.0/1">It is a great, if daunting, pleasure to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1422" name="Andrew Robathan">my hon. Friend the Member for Blaby (Mr. Robathan)</phrase> who has a great deal more knowledge on this issue than I have. I have rarely heard such an impassioned speech in the House of Commons. If only more people in the Labour Government had had such direct experience of the armed forces, we might not have so many foreign military interventions.</p>
	<p pid="b.1550.0/2">I shall hone in on Muthana, the Iraqi desert region on the borders of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait from which it has been announced that British troops will pull out. That is very good news and I applaud the Government for having managed to secure that withdrawal.</p>
	<p pid="b.1550.0/3">There are many service personnel in Iraq from my constituency. I have been in the Chamber all afternoon in order to have the opportunity to pay a personal tribute to and to applaud service personnel from Shrewsbury and Shropshire who are serving their country in Iraq.</p>
	<p pid="b.1550.0/4">Recently, James Holt, a journalist on our local newspaper, the <i> Shrewsbury Chronicle</i>, was sent to Iraq and has been sending back photographs and stories about our servicemen and their experiences. Those reports in our local paper have really brought home to me and my constituents the fact that real people from our community are out there fighting for their country&mdash;our neighbours, brothers and sisters. I am always in awe at the sacrifices that they make.</p>
	<p pid="b.1550.0/5">I cannot call for a withdrawal from Iraq at this stage; it is not my party's policy and I am a loyal Back Bencher. However, I want to say two things about which I feel passionately&mdash;I hope they do not get me into too much trouble with the Whips. Last week,Mr. Ken Tyrell led a large delegation of people from Shrewsbury to see me to discuss the war in Iraq. They passionately wanted to know when our troops would be withdrawn. They feel desperately sad when they tune into Prime Minister's questions week after week to hear the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition expressing condolences to the families of British servicemen who have been killed. That is a very emotive issue for my constituents. They applaud the Government for withdrawing our troops from Muthana and hope that soon we will be able to leave further provinces in the capable hands of the Iraqis.</p>
	<p pid="b.1550.0/6">My second point will stay with me for as long as I am a Member of Parliament. It is the most emotional thing I have ever come across, certainly from a political perspective. In January and February 2003, in the run-up to the war in Iraq, I received more than 200 letters from Shrewsbury women&mdash;but not one man&mdash;to tell me that they were worried that our country was going against the wishes of the United Nations, the Secretary-General of the UN, Hans Blix and every other opinion. They said:</p>
	<p pid="b.1550.0/7" class="indent">&quot;We are worried and concerned that our country is going to war in these circumstances.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1550.0/8">Those 200 Shrewsbury women, and my wife, convinced me that I should be against the war in Iraq. Week after week, I wrote in my local newspaper that the war was wrong. At the time, I was merely a parliamentary candidate, so it was much easier to express those views, but now that I am an MP it will be interesting to see what happens in the future when I have to follow the party Whip. However, our experience in Iraq makes me cautious about our engaging in future wars in Iran and other countries.</p>

	<p pid="b.1551.3/1">I am sorry; the Chancellor of the Exchequer. I am bemused, however, to discover that the Chancellor sees it as his role to lead the debate onthe issue.</p>
	<p pid="b.1551.3/2">As I mentioned in an earlier intervention, it is important to have parliamentary scrutiny of the replacement of our nuclear capability. My vote will certainly be influenced by the options. If one option is simply to buy something from the Americans, to me that is nowhere near as attractive as having a nuclear capability primarily designed and primarily manufactured in our own country. When we have the debate, I hope that the Minister and the Government will give us the opportunity to decide between two or three options, rather than merely to vote yes or no to a new modern version of Trident.</p>
	<p pid="b.1551.3/3">Very little has been said about veterans, but, for me, veterans are of great importance. I draw the Minister's attention to Polish veterans, in particular. One in six airmen in the battle of Britain was Polish. I am extremely proud of the role that my ancestors played in that. I know that people from many countries&mdash;countries that were occupied by the Germans&mdash;came and sought sanctuary in Britain in 1940 and we have to respect all of them. However, I argue&mdash;I put this point to the Minister as forcefully as I can&mdash;that the Poles have a unique and special role when it comes to foreign veterans in this country. I hope that, on future Remembrance days, those people will be acknowledged as unique, and quite apart from the French, Czechs, Dutch and others, because of the huge number who came and the courage and valour that they showed in the battle of Britain.</p>

	<p pid="b.1556.1/1">My hon. Friend has made a valuable point, and he is correct. I watched this Chamber before I was a Member of Parliament, and I have watched it since I became a Member of Parliament. I have seen politicians of all parties score political points at the expense of our wonderful troops, who protect us and defend our lives. No one wants to see civilians, whether they are in Afghanistan or Iraq, being killed, but what is done is done, and we are duty bound to make sure that Iraq and, indeed, Afghanistan are better places when we leave than when we went in. I think that we will achieve that goal, and I pray that we will. Have wrongs been committed? It is alleged that they have, and if they have, they must be looked into and rectified, but that does not make everything wrong.</p>
	<p pid="b.1556.1/2">In a previous life, I worked for an international charity with which I visited Ramallah. When I went into houses there, the people wanted a roof over their heads, food on the table and a peaceful existence&mdash;it is never the majority who cause the problem; it is always the minority. We can all make a difference, whether or not we agreed with the war in Iraq, and whether or not we think that we should be in Afghanistan. The people expect us to make a difference, and if we let them down, perhaps we are betraying what we are here for.</p>
	<p pid="b.1556.1/3">In my year in Parliament, I have not made that many speeches in this House, because I believe that unless one has something relevant to say, one should not say anything&mdash;perhaps I am unique in thinking that. However, this matter is important, which is why I am proud to speak in this debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.1556.1/4">In conclusion, our troops are doing a marvellousjob. I hope that they are home soon for them andtheir families, and I hope that there are no more announcements expressing condolences to the families of troops who have lost their lives doing our work. I am proud of our troops&mdash;I am sure that everyone else is, too&mdash;and I send them my good wishes and wish them a speedy return home.</p>

	<p pid="b.1558.1/1">I am grateful for that intervention, which provides some clarity. I hope that the debate will not be confined to the Army, but extend to the military as a whole.</p>
	<p pid="b.1558.1/2">A comment was made about disbanding the RAF. I hope that that does not happen but we must bear in mind that aircraft have been divided into two huge sections. A small or medium-sized helicopter is under the umbrella of the Army, whereas a large-scale helicopter or a fixed-wing plane is under that of the RAF. However, a commander wants to have the full array of assets under his command. He does not want to go through another operational level or a separate cell to call on those assets. We need to consider such command structures.</p>
	<p pid="b.1558.1/3">I want to consider the Typhoon&mdash;the Eurofighter. The first tranche is due now&mdash;I believe that there are55 aircraft, but I stand to be corrected if that is not the case. However, they were procured during the cold war and they are air-to-air combat aircraft. I do not know with how many nations we shall have dogfights. Again, the technology has moved on, as has the enemy. We need to be ready for any scenario&mdash;for any development or future threat&mdash;but to devise an aircraft that has only air-to-air capability limits our ability to defend our nation.</p>
	<p pid="b.1558.1/4">The Typhoon has great missile capability: ASRAAM and AMRAAM are medium-range and short-range missiles but, again, they are air-to-air. We need them, especially to deal with threats such as 9/11, but we also need the capability to support our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, where there is a ground threat. We therefore need to be able to take out ground targets.</p>
	<p pid="b.1558.1/5">The armoury of the missiles in our portfolio is not compatible with all our aircraft. Storm Shadow, Maverick, Brimstone and Paveway are our ground attack missiles, but none of them can be used on the Eurofighter. I wrote to the Secretary of State to ask what air-to-ground missile system the Eurofighter would employ. The reply was:</p>
	<p pid="b.1558.1/6" class="indent">&quot;Integration of air to ground missile systems onto RAF Typhoon, including the Storm Shadow cruise missile and the Brimstone air-launched anti-armour weapon, is being considered as part of the Typhoon Future Capability Programme.&quot;&mdash;[<i> Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-17">17 May 2006</phrase>; Vol. 446, c. 954W.]</p>
	<p pid="b.1558.1/7">That is not good enough. We simply cannot spend millions of pounds on 230 aircraft that are unable to share the array of missiles that we need because the technology and the way in which we conduct warfare have changed. Our Jaguars are disappearing, our Harriers are being sold off and our Tornadoes are coming to the end of their shelf life, but there is no sign of the joint strike fighter coming on line. Our ground attack capability is therefore questionable, yet that is the very capability that we need in Afghanistan and Iraq.</p>
	<p pid="b.1558.1/8">Afghanistan has been the focus of many hon. Members' contributions today. I had the honour to visit Afghanistan last week, and it was quite an eye-opening experience. The openness of the country was the first thing that struck me. Of course, there is a handful of major cities, but beyond them much of the mountain and desert terrain is inhospitable. Every so often, there is a river basin&mdash;such as that of the Helmand river&mdash;that is heavily concentrated with villages and towns. Such places are widely spread apart. A tiny village in Helmand province, for example, is extremely remote from what is happening in Kandahar or Kabul. That means that the people there do not hear the advice, the directions or the words of support that are coming from the Afghan Government. They are very much looking after themselves. These villages consist of tribal communities, and their loyalties are to the families and to the tribes of which they are part, rather than to the country of Afghanistan as a whole. Indeed, the word &quot;country&quot; should perhaps be used advisedly in that location. It is clear that, in that atmosphere, the Taliban and al-Qaeda are able to dominate and to work almost without feeling a threat from the NATO or ISAF forces.</p>
	<p pid="b.1558.1/9">While I was in Afghanistan, I had the opportunity to visit the ISAF headquarters and see the co-ordination between the Department for International Development and other international organisations. I am pleased to say that our operations are working very closely together. There is no doubt about that. However, we are now spending about &pound;45 million a year from the DFID budget and about &pound;50 million from the military budget. Where is the accountability? Where is the co-ordination? I called for more than just one Minister to come to the debate today to explain what is happening in that regard.</p>
	<p pid="b.1558.1/10">I also had the opportunity to meet General Jones, the NATO commander, and Sir David Richards, the general in charge of ISAF. Both expressed concern that mission creep was taking place in Afghanistan. On page 25 of its report, the Defence Committee states:</p>
	<p pid="b.1558.1/11" class="indent">&quot;We remain uncertain of the exact role which UK forces will be asked to play in support of the counter-narcotics strategy and call on MoD to provide clarification.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1558.1/12">That call has been echoed by other hon. Members today, and I hope that the Minister will be able to clarify where the line is to be drawn and what our involvement with that strategy will be. Will he explain how the division of labour is to be determined and who will take responsibility for these matters? If we do not solve these problems now, the move from stage 3, which involves taking over three quarters of NATO's responsibilities, will be threatened when we move into the final stage to take over all responsibility for co-ordination in Afghanistan.</p>
	<p pid="b.1558.1/13">Caveats have been mentioned, in which the Governments of countries providing NATO troops say that their troops cannot go into combat, for example. Too many countries are doing that and, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1926" name="James Gray">my hon. Friend the Member for North Wiltshire (Mr. Gray)</phrase> said, many countries are limiting themselves simply to providing troops in non-combat roles. That is not good enough if we want Afghanistan to work as a nation.</p>
	<p pid="b.1558.1/14">I was impressed by what ISAF is doing. Unfortunately, the footprint that it is creating is extremely limited. It cannot cover the entire country. We have spent a lot of time focusing on Helmand, but it is only one of 30 provinces. The neighbouring province of Nimroz does not contain one international soldier. Where does a member of the Taliban go if things start to get hot in one province? Obviously, he moves next door to the other. Unless there is a larger commitment on the part of other NATO countries, we shall not be able to fulfil our mission.</p>
	<p pid="b.1558.1/15">The mission is likely to come under more question&mdash;not because of what we are doing with NATO but because of what is being done under the umbrella of security that we are creating in the reconstruction and development programmes. As I told the Minister during our debate in Westminster Hall yesterday or the day before, there is clearly no co-ordination between the myriad international organisations&mdash;the United Nations, the European Union, the non-governmental organisations, and all the counter-narcotics agencies that have gone into Afghanistan. Their hearts are in the right place, but unfortunately the money is being spent as those agencies compete with their overlapping projects, and the lack of co-ordination means that a great deal of money is wasted. Although more than $400 million has been spent on challenging the narcotics trade, last year saw the biggest bumper crop ever: 400,000 tonnes of poppies were produced. That shows that our international effort is failing, and unless we do something about it our mission in Afghanistan will be brought into question.</p>
	<p pid="b.1558.1/16">Our debate has been far reaching and useful, but there are many questions that I should like the Minister to answer. We have not really talked about the Sea Harriers, and the gap that will be created in air cover. We have not talked about the F-35 and the limitations imposed by the United States Government&mdash;or, to be fair, a corner of Capitol Hill&mdash;on the repair and upgrade of that project, which threatens our purchase of the joint strike fighter in the long term. We have not really touched on what will happen to the aircraft carriers, although there seems to be delay after delay with the announcements. We have not discussed the future rapid effect system. We have not even discussed the A400M, which was once called the future large aircraft, but now that it is so far in the future that we are not going to see it, that name has been dropped. We have certainly not discussed the NATO deterrent to the extent that the nation would wish.</p>
	<p pid="b.1558.1/17">The Minister mentioned policy and I was pleased to hear about some of it, but we could do with an entire debate on the overlap of the EU mission, from a military perspective, with what is happening with NATO. A clash will come, if it has not come already. We need a debate on the procurement of equipment in general. There are also concerns about the future, on a wider and more serious note&mdash;</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-06-22b.1562.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1724" speakername="Julian Lewis" colnum="1562"  time="017:22:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060622/debtext/60622-0636.htm#06062269000676">
	<p pid="b.1562.1/1">I see that the hon. Gentleman is nodding enthusiastically, because the Opposition have ensured&mdash;even if we have to use one of our days&mdash;that hon. Members of all parties will have an opportunity to vote on the matter, whether the Government want that or not.</p>
	<p pid="b.1562.1/2">The Lobby briefing document states that, on Trident, the spokesman</p>
	<p pid="b.1562.1/3" class="indent">&quot;was asked whether any vote in the House of Commons would be a 'straight yes/no vote' or would there be a series of options. The spokesman said, 'What the Prime Minister said yesterday, echoing what he has said before, is that there will be a proper discussion. 'But would there be a vote?' he was asked again. 'There will be a proper discussion,' he replied.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1562.1/4">Defence Ministers have said today that no decision has been taken, either in detail or in principle, but I believe that they are trying to plug the hole in the dam that the Chancellor has opened up. There is no real excuse for a delay in making a decision in principle. My hon. Friend the shadow Secretary of State outlined with his customary elegance and eloquence exactlywhy there is a need for a nuclear deterrent in the21st century. It hinges on one simple concept: the unpredictability of any outbreak of war in the future&mdash;and I think that I detect the Minister nodding in some form of agreement with that proposition.</p>
	<p pid="b.1562.1/5">However, we are talking about having a nuclear deterrent between 2020 and 2050. Given that the real justification for that is that we cannot anticipate what threats might materialise from countries armed with weapons of mass destruction, why delay deciding the question of principle? The principle will be unaffected in a year, six months or three months from now. If we are going to decide then that we need to keep a nuclear deterrent because of the unpredictability of future threats, we might as well as do so now. It is interesting that the Chancellor has decided on it now, even though the Secretary of State for Defence and his colleagues who are at least here today are still trying to pretend that he has not.</p>
	<p pid="b.1562.1/6">If I had to summarise the themes that have primarily emerged in the debate, I would say that they are three: Trident and the principles behind it; Afghanistan and the tactics involved in dealing with that issue; and Iraq and what is best described as the political will to win. I have already addressed the first of those issues, and I want to say a word or two about Afghanistan.</p>
	<p pid="b.1562.1/7"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1817" name="Daniel Kawczynski">My hon. Friend the Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham (Daniel Kawczynski)</phrase> mentioned in passing the practice of reading out at Prime Minister's Question Time condolences for individual members of the armed forces who have lost their lives. That is honourably motivated, but it is worth remembering that it would have been quite impracticable in most of the wars that we have fought in the past, because there were many more casualties in those wars than are being incurred among British service personnel in the campaigns today.</p>
	<p pid="b.1562.1/8">In a strange way, therefore, the country has perhaps lost sight of the fact that when we engage in armed conflict, there are very heavy prices indeed to be paid. One of the reasons why the country has lost sight of that is that the longest war that we successfully fought and concluded in recent times was the 50 years of the cold war, and it ended without a shot being fired. All those countries that had been held under dictatorship and suppression were able to come out into the sunlight and pick up the reins of democratic practice. That was an exception to the rule of history, and we delude ourselves if we think that we can engage in conflicts, such as those in Afghanistan and Iraq, and expect that they will be as simple as that involved in substituting a democracy for a dictatorship.</p>
	<p pid="b.1562.1/9">We must look back to the successful counter-insurgency campaign&mdash;I have made this point from the Dispatch Box before&mdash;that was waged over 12 years in Malaya. That is how long it took. Whether that campaign, which has been widely taken as the model of winning hearts and minds, could be fought to a successful outcome today, with legalistic supervision and 24-hour media coverage, is open to question. As well as winning hearts and minds, the tactics involved were to send armed patrols out to find the enemy and eliminate them ruthlessly, while isolating them from the population at large.</p>
	<p pid="b.1562.1/10">I am relieved that the new Secretary of State for Defence seems to have consigned to the wastepaper bin the absolutely nonsensical description and distinction that his predecessor, whom I much admire&mdash;I make no secret of that, but I did not admire him for doing this&mdash;tried to draw between counter-terrorism and counter-insurgency. In any such campaign, if we wait for terrorists or insurgents to come to our armed forces before we react, we will lose. The only way in which such a campaign can succeed is to follow the aggressive strategy against the insurgents that is now being followed, and in which British forces are clearly engaged, whereby they are seeking out the enemy. As a commanding officer, Brigadier Nick Pope, has just said:</p>
	<p pid="b.1562.1/11" class="indent">&quot;We have put the terrorists on the back foot and seized the initiative.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1562.1/12">That is what must be done, and I welcome the fact that the politicians are catching up with the military&mdash;in so far as they are doing so.</p>
	<p pid="b.1562.1/13">I will come to Iraq in my final remarks, but I now wish to turn briefly to the contributions that hon. Members have made from the Back Benches. There were 10 of them&mdash;three from Government Back Benchers and seven from Opposition Back Benchers. All of the latter contributions were, for some reason, from Conservative Members, rather than from Members of the self-styled &quot;real&quot; Opposition: the Liberal Democrats.</p>
	<p pid="b.1562.1/14">The hon. Member for Leyton and Wanstead, to whom I have already referred a couple of times, made a consistent speech in which he talked thoughtfully about the dangers of failed states. He also made a remark that should give all of us pause for thought when, in speaking about the situation in Somalia, he said that one must not react intrinsically against any new Muslim administration without being absolutely certain that they intend to ally themselves with militant Islamism that is hostile to freedom. Such a group might be a potential enemy of that sort, but we must be very careful before we decide that; otherwise, we are playing the game of the terrorists and creating allies for them.</p>
	<p pid="b.1562.1/15"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1843" name="Robert Flello">The hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South(Mr. Flello)</phrase> is a living example of the value of the armed forces parliamentary scheme. I am delighted to say that I am on my fourth incarnation in that scheme. I pay tribute to the patience and hospitality of the commandant at the Royal College of Defence Studies, Sir Ian Garnett, and his colleagues, in welcoming me and several other Members on to this year's course. It is greatly to the credit of the hon. Gentleman that so soon in his parliamentary career, he decided to undertake the major commitment of doing the AFPS course. His contribution made clear the great benefit that he has derived from it.</p>
	<p pid="b.1562.1/16"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1660" name="Malcolm Rifkind">My right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Kensington and Chelsea (Sir Malcolm Rifkind)</phrase> touched once again on his concerns about the decision to invade Iraq, but he was absolutely resolute on the vital importance of not reducing our military commitment in Afghanistan. He said that once we decide to go somewhere we must stay, and that sending signals about withdrawals and timetables would be the worst possible thing that could be done for the welfare and safety of our forces.</p>
	<p pid="b.1562.1/17"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1766" name="Sarah McCarthy-Fry">The hon. Member for Portsmouth, North (Sarah McCarthy-Fry)</phrase> made a very strong speech. She made a robust defence of the armed forces in Iraq and touched on the role of the media&mdash;an issue to which, if I have time, I shall return at <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1612" name="James Arbuthnot">the end. My right hon. Friend the Member for North-East Hampshire (Mr. Arbuthnot)</phrase>, who is Chairman of the Defence Committee, said that the Chancellor had repeated the Labour manifesto commitment on defence. He also raised the important issue of whether the Chancellor proposes to put his money where his mouth is, if he does indeed intend that the nuclear deterrent should be replaced, by funding it separately.</p>
	<p pid="b.1562.1/18"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1926" name="James Gray">My hon. Friend the Member for North Wiltshire (Mr. Gray)</phrase> asked a series of penetrating questions; I am glad that I do not have time to attempt to answer <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1422" name="Andrew Robathan">them all. My hon. Friend the Member for Blaby(Mr. Robathan)</phrase>&mdash;I was sorry not to be present when he made his speech&mdash;stressed, typically robustly, the need for senior officers to stand up for their troops.</p>
	<p pid="b.1562.1/19"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1817" name="Daniel Kawczynski">My hon. Friends the Members for Shrewsbury and Atcham (Daniel Kawczynski)</phrase> and for Ilford, North (Mr. Scott) illustrated something that is very true about life in this Chamber: when Members put aside their prepared speeches and speak from the heart about a topic that really excites and inspires them, they can hold the House in <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1437" name="Tobias Ellwood">the palm of their hand. My hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, East (Mr. Ellwood)</phrase> is a persistent campaigner on defence issues and&mdash;be it votes on Trident, roles for Typhoon or narcotics in Afghanistan&mdash;today was no exception.</p>
	<p pid="b.1562.1/20">My final point relates to the situation in Iraq, where a process of competing political will is being undertaken. I return, as I said I would, to the reference that the hon. Member for Portsmouth, North made to the media. Over the 50 years of the cold war, we saw that political will was as important as actual military capability. The attempts that are being made in Iraq to break the political will of coalition forces are indeed being fuelled by selective media reports. There is an answer. The Government need a media strategy to ensure that propaganda from those who sympathise with the insurgents and the terrorists is matched by hard facts from the coalition forces, ably disseminated. I am not yet convinced that the Government have fully got their act together. I shall be interested to hear whether the Minister can reassure me.</p>

	<p pid="b.1565.0/1">We have had a wide-ranging debate on defence policy. I point out to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1724" name="Julian Lewis">the hon. Member for New Forest, East (Dr. Lewis)</phrase> that we have indeed had a proper discussion, although I note that we shall not conclude it with a vote.</p>
	<p pid="b.1565.0/2">My right hon. Friend the Minister for the Armed Forces introduced the debate by talking about aspects of our broader defence and security policy, including the defence industrial strategy, arms control and the role of international institutions. He set out future challenges and how we see our policy evolving to deal with them.</p>
	<p pid="b.1565.0/3">Many Members made great contributions to the debate and first out of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1507" name="Bob Russell">the trap was the hon. Member for Colchester (Bob Russell)</phrase>, who asked us to confirm which nations are currently posted in Helmand province. Denmark and Estonia are currently there.</p>
	<p pid="b.1565.0/4">The hon. Gentleman also asked about service accommodation in Colchester, but since he is not here, I will not give the House a detailed response. I am sure that he will catch me at some appropriate point so that I can fill him in on the detail.</p>
	<p pid="b.1565.0/5"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1684" name="Harry Cohen">My good and hon. Friend the Member for Leyton and Wanstead (Harry Cohen)</phrase> distinguished himself, as ever, by standing out against the crowd. Nothing has really changed in that he and I probably disagree on absolutely everything he said, except when he quoted President Karzai saying that we need to support the institutions of civic society in Afghanistan. President Karzai has also said we need to deal with narcotics and terrorism, which are the biggest threats to those civic institutions, a theme echoed in the considered contribution of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1612" name="James Arbuthnot">the right hon. Member for North-East Hampshire (Mr. Arbuthnot)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.1565.0/6"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1843" name="Robert Flello">My hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South (Mr. Flello)</phrase> has distinguished himself by making a big impact in the House in just 12 months. He talked about the armed forces parliamentary scheme. Like others, his experience on the scheme has clearly given him an idea of the front-line issues that our forces face. Tribute was paid to Sir Neil Thorne and we would all agree he does an excellent job in administering boththe armed forces and the police schemes. When I completed the police scheme, I gained some understanding of the pressures gone through by people on the front line in the forces and the police. So much of what they do involves split-second decisions, and we can understand that mistakes are made. The schemes assist all Members, particularly those with civilian backgrounds, on the common problems faced by our three services.</p>
	<p pid="b.1565.0/7">My hon. Friend also talked about improvements in our service people's kit. I was pleasantly surprised to visit Chilwell last week, where we prepare our reservists for mobilisation. The difference over even the last five years in the kit with which they are issued is remarkable. It would be a great fashion item in West Bromwich high street&mdash;the services need to keep an eye on where the stuff goes&mdash;because it is so well designed now, not just to be practical but to be quite fashionable.</p>
	<p pid="b.1565.0/8"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1660" name="Malcolm Rifkind">The right hon. and learned Member for Kensington and Chelsea (Sir Malcolm Rifkind)</phrase> made his usual wise contribution. Much of what he said about what we have to do in Afghanistan was endorsed by many Members. He made a point about the Ministry of Defence having no friends, but I am not quite sure that was the case in <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1422" name="Andrew Robathan">the debate, although the hon. Member for Blaby (Mr. Robathan)</phrase> probably has no friends left at the MOD&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="b.1567.3/1">I think that I heard the word &quot;knackered&quot;. We need to deal with the situation as best we can.</p>
	<p pid="b.1567.3/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1766" name="Sarah McCarthy-Fry">My hon. Friend the Member for Portsmouth, North (Sarah McCarthy-Fry)</phrase> talked movingly about her recent visit to Iraq and stood up for the Navy in Portsmouth. I am sure that all serving personnel in Portsmouth will have been gratified by her words. Members of the Navy can turn their hand to anything. They are not only deployed on current operations but deal with hurricane relief and do important counter-narcotics work in the Caribbean, which I am told is a particularly attractive posting.</p>
	<p pid="b.1567.3/3">My hon. Friend also stood up for her mechanics. A key challenge of my defence brief is to make sure that our serving personnel, who have great skills and are trained to do remarkable things, almost day in, day out, can transfer those skills to civilian life. Sometimes, however, we cannot commoditise those skills into the certificates needed for particular jobs. She raised a good point about the mechanics and I invite her to talk to me about it to see if we can apply some clarity to the situation.</p>
	<p pid="b.1567.3/4">Our service personnel are extremely employable. I was amazed to read that 95 per cent. of them find jobs within six months of leaving the services. Our challenge is to make sure that the remaining 5 per cent. have as much support as possible.</p>
	<p pid="b.1567.3/5"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1539" name="Nick Harvey">The hon. Member for North Devon (Nick Harvey)</phrase> put a large number of questions, so I hope he will allow me to canter through just some of them. He talked about harmony and pinch points. Over the last year, the number of regular armed forces deployed on operations has fallen to about 18 per cent., but there are pinch points and we are trying to deal with them. We are trying to target recruitment in particular areas, and we are looking at financial retention and re-engagement incentives, flexibility in the rank employed for some posts and how we mobilise reservists, as well as some contractualisation.</p>
	<p pid="b.1567.3/6">The right hon. Member for North-East Hampshire made a characteristically wise and assured contribution. He raised many wise points. I look forward to his report on strategic nuclear defence next Friday. If it has already gone to the printers, I wonder whether there will be any addendums. I was delighted that he is delighted with the Chancellor's commitment reported in the press today. I shall be joining the Chancellor at a veterans event this evening and I will make forcefully the right hon. Gentleman's point about the need for adequate resources to cover the demands. I am sure that, given the Chancellor's recent pronouncements, he will want to listen to the Chairman of the Defence Committee with great interest. The right hon. Gentleman asked about the Vector vehicle. It is not planned to be available until next March, but it is planned to be deployed with 12 Mechanised Brigade.</p>
	<p pid="b.1567.3/7"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1926" name="James Gray">The hon. Member for North Wiltshire (Mr. Gray)</phrase> fired off 30 or 40 points that the MOD should be considering over the next few years. It was a powerful contribution. He raised some serious questions that the UK will have to address in future years. In particular, there were his ideas for a department of military planning, the question of whether we are best servedby three intelligence services and, perhaps most controversially in the Department, the question of whether we need three services. He commented that someone had suggested that we should abolish the RAF. There are no plans to do that&mdash;</p>

Member for Ilford, North (Mr. Scott)</phrase> reminded me of England's first game in the World cup, albeit in reverse, in that the second half was inspirational. He made powerful points and held the attention of the House, especially when he spoke about Saddam Hussein and the way in which he treated his people and the people of Israel. The hon. Gentleman made the point that if Iraq is a better place when we leave than it was when we went in, our job will have been done. I think that we can all agree on that.</p>
	<p pid="b.1569.2/4"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1437" name="Tobias Ellwood">The hon. Member for Bournemouth, East(Mr. Ellwood)</phrase> made a wide-ranging contribution and I shall try to capture all his comments if I can. I take his point about the need for the Typhoon aircraft to have an air-to-ground capability. The redesign is taking place, although we have to work with our partners to get that done as quickly as possible.</p>
	<p pid="b.1569.2/5">Like several hon. Members, the hon. Gentleman talked about the need to win the propaganda war in Afghanistan. I absolutely agree with him. We need to ensure that our outreach programmes in Helmand province are right and that they have an Afghan front-facing approach.</p>
