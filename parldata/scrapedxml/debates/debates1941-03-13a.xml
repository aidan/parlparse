<p>In these pages the Chief Inspector expresses the view that the increase in non-fatal accidents in 1939 as compared with 1938 was not greater than the increase in man-hours worked, and points out that an increase in accidents in war time must be expected owing to various causes, At the same time I wish to emphasise that, apart from personal loss and suffering, avoidable accidents are a bonus to the enemy by way of lost time and disorganisation of work, and I have, with the assistance of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents, instituted a special Accident Prevention Campaign covering a large number of factories engaged on war production.</p>

<p>The problems arising out of transport facilities for workpeople are receiving constant attention. My right hon. Friend the Minister of Transport, in November last, asked the Regional Transport Commissioners to take immediate steps to set up local consultative committees at places where there are difficulties in regard to the transport of workpeople, and he suggested that the Area Boards, the Supply Departments, the Factory Inspectorate, the welfare department of the Ministry of Labour, the railway and road transport undertakings, the employers and the trade unions should all be represented on these committees. A number have been established and by staggering hours of work and by provision of hostels and in other ways these committees have been able to resolve many problems. If the hon. Member will specify any particular cases he has in mind, my right hon. Friend will gladly look into them.</p>

<p>Factory employers are encouraged, as a part of their arrangements for proper supervision in the interests of health and efficiency, to keep records of sickness and absenteeism which may afford indications of excessive fatigue or of something else amiss in the factory or in a particular department of it. It would not usually be possible without close inquiry at the particular factory, which would primarily be a matter for the management, to ascertain how far any evident fatigue or ill-health or accidents are attributable to speed of working as distinct from long hours and other factors, but the importance of optimum rates of work from the point of view both of efficiency and of accident prevention is stressed in the Industrial Health Research Board Report on Industrial Health in War, which received wide publicity, as well as in other publications.</p>

<p>It is because of my knowledge of the commitments of these widows that I put forward the proposition that these allowances should be continued for 13 weeks, in order to give them an opportunity of readjusting their circumstances. I am always prepared to consider any proposition which is put forward, but I cannot hold out any hope of dealing with the matter in the way the hon. Member suggests.</p>

<p>No, Sir; the ex-Service men in question are in receipt of pensions based on a cost-of-living figure which is actually higher than that of today. In any case it would not be practicable to single out one cross section of disability pensioners for special consideration.</p>

<p>Cases of serving men on leave and killed by enemy action are already dealt with either under the Service Warrants or the Personal Injuries (Civilians) Scheme as may be appropriate to their case. As regards accidents, there are borderline cases which present difficulty, and I am considering the whole question of injuries sustained when not on duty. I must point out, however, that the position of a soldier when he is absent from his unit on leave

and his movements are under his own control does not differ from that of a civilian, and an accident sustained in circumstances quite unconnected with military service cannot be regarded as attributable to such service; consequently, I have no power to award compensation for the results thereof under the Royal Warrant.</p>

<p>Is the right hon. Gentleman not aware that this attitude is causing the greatest distress in the country? Is he not aware&#x2014;as I am sure he is&#x2014;that in the last war the dependants of all soldiers who went to France and were killed there were given pensions, regardless of how the soldiers met their death; and now that the battlefield is transferred to this country, does not that suggest to him that the same conditions should apply here? Further, will the right hon. Gentleman consult the heads of the Service Departments, who, I can assure him, take a very different view from his?</p>

<p>My hon. Friend is not quite correct in saying that the dependants of a soldier who happened to be serving abroad in the last war and met with a fatal accident in any circumstances whatever received compensation. Certain matters, such as negligence, were taken into account.</p>

<p>It is all very well to say "Well, well," but we want to make the position clear. I have already informed my hon. Friend that I am giving the most careful consideration to these borderline cases, which have caused difficulty, there is no question about it.

<p>asked the Minister of Pensions whether he is aware of the hardship caused to parents whose sons are killed by enemy action on account of the failure of the Personal Injuries (Civilians) Scheme to provide a payment to cover funeral expenses; and whether he will reconsider this question with a view to providing for such payment?</p>

<p>Under the improvements in the Personal Injuries (Civilians) Scheme announced by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer on 18th December last, a payment of &#x00A3;7 10s. towards funeral expenses may now be made to any relative or friend responsible for funeral arrangements in the case of a Civil Defence volunteer who is killed on duty. In the case of any gainfully-occupied person killed by enemy action, the same grant towards funeral expenses may now be made to a widow or to any wholly dependent relative, including a parent, who has been regularly maintained by the deceased in his or her home. These provisions apply to privately arranged funerals. Arrangements have also been made by the Ministry of Health whereby in cases of deaths resulting from "war injuries" or "war service injuries" State funerals can be arranged by the local authority without any charge on the relatives.</p>

<p>Does not the right hon. Gentleman realise that in cases&#x2014;of which I have sent him instances&#x2014;in which parents have not been granted a pension and have been refused any allowance towards the expense of the funeral they naturally contrast this treatment with the fact that if the man had been killed at work, there would have been at least a grant towards the funeral expenses; and since this matter is causing some dissatisfaction, will he reconsider his decision?</p>

<p>Usually it is stated on the notice that they can apply again if their circumstances change, in accordance with the Regulation laid down.
