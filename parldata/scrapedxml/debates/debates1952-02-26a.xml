<p>Is the right hon.

<p>As I said before, this is a domestic matter and the reason behind it is that every unit has got to do everything it can to increase the authority of N.C.O.s. Nowadays N.C.O.s are very young, and it makes it a great deal easier for them to maintain authority if they are given a certain status.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend is no doubt referring to the decision to wind up the Army Agricultural Scheme.

<p>Is the Minister aware that the gunner I referred to in my Question collapsed at five minutes past 12 and there was no medical attention available to him until 12.45?

<p>This man collapsed while doing physical training and was immediately taken off to the hospital, which was some distance away; but a medical orderly is not an expert in medical attention. However, we have taken note of certain recommendations regarding supervision of physical training exercises, and these will be borne in mind.</p>

<p>Will the Minister remember that it has taken him two months to reply to my hon. Friend, who apparently has still not received the letter? Can the Minister tell the House why this man was left lying dead in the gymnasium whilst the class went on with the training and why medical attention was not made available for so long?</p>

<p>The time involved was three-quarters of an hour. By and large, one is fortunate in a unit if it takes only 10 minutes in sending a man to find the doctor and getting him to the necessary place; it may take longer. In this case, I do not think there was any actual fault, in view of the location of the hospital and the gymnasium. It took three-quarters of an hour: a quarter of an hour would have been better, but, short of having a medical superintendent at every P.T. class, one cannot obviate that possibility.</p>

<p>Is it not desirable that there should be someone in charge of P.T. who understands first aid and can take appropriate steps, and is it not the case that in this instance medical attention was not sent for, but the commanding officer happened to be going on his rounds and saw this man lying at the side of the gymnasium?</p>

<p>I very much regret that the arrangements for the reception of these men went astray. Three days after this ship reached Southampton a further troopship was due there, from which it was decided to send all the men who disembarked immediately on leave in order that they might spend Christmas at home. Unfortunately, owing to an error in a

teleprinter message, the unit at Newton Abbot was led to believe that the men from the "Empire Fowey" would similarly be sent straight to their homes. Arrangements were improvised to meet the unexpected arrival of these men and they were paid and sent off to their homes without delay.</p>

Does he also realise that Lord Waverley, of whose distinguished career we are all aware, has shown by his political speeches and by his bearing in the 1945&#x2013;50 House of Commons, that he holds strong political opinions&#x2014;[An HON.

<p>I beg to move,
<q>That this House takes note of the Foreign Secretary's statement, welcomes his adherence to the policy followed by the previous Administration of His late Majesty with regard to the Korean conflict and the relations between Great Britain and China, but regrets the Prime Minister's failure to give adequate expression to this policy in the course of his recent visit to the United States of America.</q>
This is a critical Motion, and it is particularly critical of the Prime Minister, but we have no wish to make of foreign affairs a wild party affair. We wish not to imitate the semi-hysteria of the former Opposition about Persia. Moreover, the state of the world is too serious for that. There is a good deal of aggression, some of it military and some of it political. It varies from place to place, and it is a dangerous world in which we live.<br/>
For ourselves, we stand by the fundamental principles of foreign policy for which our late colleague, that great trade union leader, Ernest Bevin, stood. We believe in the United Nations, its Charter and its principles. We believe in the organisation of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation. We believe in resistance to aggression, and we say that freedom needs all the friends that it can get.<br/>
But we are genuinely disturbed about what happened in Washington, particularly as to the Far East. It was commented by my right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition that the Prime Minister has spoken with two voices, one in London and one in the United States Congress. Neither voice, I am bound to say with my right hon. Friend, was wholly satisfactory. The Prime Minister's voice in both places was markedly different from that of the Foreign Secretary in the House of Commons on 5th February.<br/>
It is not us alone who have noticed this dual voice, this different method of expression, and some difference of approach. It was, as my right hon. Friend indicated, noted by the "New York Times" in a leader of 31st January, which he quoted in the first day's debate, which in part said:
<q>Prime Minister Churchill&#x2026;like a good salesman with different customers he displayed his wares to their best advantage, first in Washington and then in London.</q>

I now put to the House another quotation, which raises some serious points upon which we should like the comments of the Prime Minister. It is from an article by Mr. Joseph Newman, the well-known London correspondent of the "New York Herald-Tribune," of 5th February. Mr. Newman writes:
<q>Members of Parliament and the British public in general, listening to Prime Minister Winston Churchill's denial that he had made any 'definite or formal commitments' to President Truman for action against Communist China if it breaks a truce in Korea, felt something like Alice when she picked up her looking glass book and read the poem Jabberwocky.'&#x2026;</q>
[An HON. MEMBER: "Read it out."] No, I am not going to. I am conscious of my limitations. [An HON. MEMBER: "The right hon. Gentleman ought to know it."] I tried it in private, but it would not work. There is some comment upon that famous poem, and Mr. Newman resumes:
<q>Humpty-Dumpty eventually translated 'Jabberwocky' for Alice without any serious consequences, but about the worst thing that could happen to Mr. Churchill at the present moment would be for some official Humpty-Dumpty to appear on the scene to translate his denial of any 'definite or formal commitments' on China. This official could seriously damage Mr. Churchill's political position at home and destroy Britain's bi-partisan foreign policy. There are several officials in Washington apart from President Truman and Secretary of State Dean Acheson who can translate Mr. Churchill's words and one of Mr. Churchill's dearest hopes today must be that they refrain from playing the r&#x00F4;le of Humpty-Dumpty.</q>
We should like to know what the comment of the Prime Minister is upon that. It was the case that after the Congress speech there was a fairly universal assumption in the United States Press that the speech of the Prime Minister to Congress represented a major shift in British policy. We should also like to know whether that almost universal assumption of the Press of the United States of America was justified or not, or whether the Congress speech represented no change of policy at all.<br/>
It is not only that apprehensions have been raised in our own country; apprehensions have been raised in the United States as well. The "New York Times" of 21st February reports of the proceedings of the House of Representatives of the United States Congress:
<q>The House repudiated its Democratic leadership, its Foreign Affairs Committee and


the Administration itself. It adopted by a vote of 189 to 143 a resolution 'directing' Secretary of State Dean Acheson to come forward with full information as to whether President Truman had made any secret military commitments to Prime Minister Churchill of Britain in their consultations here in January.</q>
That is what the House of Representatives of the United States Congress is asking, and we in the House of Commons ask the same question with suitable British adaptations, and we expect to receive an answer.<br/>
The truth is that conflicting cleverness on both sides of the Atlantic is, in our submission, dangerous. It is dangerous to peace and it is dangerous to good Anglo-American relations. It is far better to be clear and frank both with the Congress and with the British House of Commons, and the statement in the House of Commons on 30th January, made by the Prime Minister, was, in our view, woolly and evasive. Indeed, the Prime Minister had little desire to make the statement at all. He wished to hold it over until the debate began.</p>

<p>We had a right to know in advance what his report on the United States visit was. He has just confirmed that he would have preferred to make his statement at the beginning of the debate; but surely, when a great mission of this importance, headed by the Prime Minister, goes to America, and especially as the Prime Minister came back by sea, which gave him an opportunity to prepare a report, it was right that the House of Commons should have a report at the earliest practicable moment and that there should be reasonable time between that report and the debate in the House. It was a poor report, we believe, and it was not willingly made.<br/>
The truth is that, from the point of view of the decision to undertake the visit at all, this was a somewhat rushed visit. The decision was made very soon after the right hon. Gentleman became Prime Minister, and I wonder whether there was adequate preparation for such a wide field of discussion. Moreover, it has to be remembered that this is Election year in the United States. It adds to the difficulties, with which the

right hon. Gentleman is familiar, because I well remember that in the War Cabinet there were difficulties on the occasion of the Election year, even during the Presidency of the late President Roosevelt. It is a difficult year in which to go at all, and it is liable to lead to complications in any case, because the parties are in some controversy and are adapting their decisions in readiness for the Presidential fight. Our war-time experience bears out the fact that there are difficulties.<br/>
I am inclined to think that it was a doubtful mission, undertaken by the wrong man at the wrong time. He came back with very small results for our country&#x2014;[HON. MEMBERS: "No."]&#x2014;but with vaguely expressed and possibly grave commitments. He created a legacy of confusion and doubt on both sides of the Atlantic.<br/>
I should like to know from the Prime Minister what was said about Japan and China, particularly regarding the intentions of Japan, now declared to have signed the Peace Treaty with Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek and not with Communist China. We have heard the Foreign Secretary on this aspect of the matter, but we should like to have the Prime Minister's version as well, because we are not quite sure who is directing foreign affairs in the Foreign Office&#x2014;the Foreign Secretary or the Prime Minister. Moreover, the "New York Times," on 26th January, contained the following report from Tokio, which conflicts with reports in other quarters, and I should like to know the truth of the matter. It declared that the Japanese Prime Minister
<q>told the Japanese Parliament today"&#x2014;</q>
that was, I think, 25th January&#x2014;
<q>that he had agreed to limited recognition of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek's r&#x00E9;gime on Formosa as the legitimate Government of China at the request of the United States. The British Government, which has diplomatic relations with the Chinese Communist Government on the mainland, raised no objection, he added.</q>
That is to say the Prime Minister of Japan added that the British Government had no objection.<br/>
There are reports to the contrary and, indeed, the Foreign Secretary did make the observation that he and the Government had taken the line we had taken and had made it clear to the United States


that we did not agree with the Japanese decision. Therefore, we should like to hear the Prime Minister's version of the matter.<br/>
The Labour Government discussed the Japanese Peace Treaty and the subsequent procedure with Mr. John Foster Dulles when he was here last year. The House will recall the dilemma of the two Chinese Governments. It was agreed between Mr. Dulles and myself, for, as it then was, His Majesty's Government&#x2014;and my right hon. Friend the former Minister of State was present at the time&#x2014;that Japan's future attitude towards China must necessarily be for determination by Japan itself in the exercise of the sovereignty and independent status contemplated by the Treaty. Indeed, I informed the House of Commons on 12th July:
<q>A further difficulty has been the question of the Government entitled to commit the Chinese people to a peace treaty with Japan. This is a difficulty which has not been resolved. If a treaty is not to be indefinitely delayed, the only alternative has seemed to us to be that China should not be invited to sign the present treaty. The interests of the Chinese people are, however, safeguarded by the provisions in the draft which is being published today. Once the treaty has been signed and Japan becomes responsible for her own foreign relations, it will be for Japan herself to decide her future relations with China."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 12th July, 1952; Vol. 490, c. 631.]</q>
It was and is our wish that Japan should become a really democratic country associated with the peaceful, freedom-loving nations, and Mr. Dulles himself confirmed the agreement that Japan should decide for herself. Speaking at the San Francisco Peace Conference in September, he said that a possible course with regard to China might have been to have two peace treaties, each of which would be signed by one of the two Chinese Governments. He did not think that the Japanese Government would have agreed to this, however, adding that
<q>to exert a compulsion in this matter would create resentment in Japan and it would activate and aggravate Allied division in the face of a grave world-wide menace which requires the maximum unity.</q>
He then said that, by deciding to exclude China from the Peace Conference, the Allies had
<q>left China and Japan to make their own peace, on terms, however, which would guarantee the full protection of the rights and interests of China.</q>

All this clearly meant that Japan should be free to decide the matter when she attained a sovereign and independent status; and that required that sufficient ratifications should be secured, which it is understood they have not, and certainly they had not at the material time.<br/>
I have certainly no wish to use overcritical words about an important official representative of a great and friendly Power with whom I had pleasant relations, but I must tell the House what has since happened in Japan. I quote from the United States Congressional Record of 16th January, 1952, certain proceedings in the Senate relating to a letter of 24th December from the Prime Minister of Japan on the subject, addressed to Mr. Dulles.<br/>
This is from the official record of the United States Senate which indicates what happened in Japan, and I think indicates how it was that the Japanese Prime Minister precipitately as I think&#x2014;and on the substance of the matter necessarily one must, from our point of view, tend to think wrongly&#x2014;but at any rate precipitately announced the intention of the Japanese Government as to which Chinese Government they would recognise. This is part of the proceedings. Mr. Sparkman, senator from Alabama, said:
<q>I shall not take time to read the letter in full, Mr. President"&#x2014;</q>
that is to say, the letter from the Japanese Prime Minister&#x2014;
<q>inasmuch as I shall ask that it be incorporated in the record as a part of my remarks, but I wish to call attention to the fact that in this letter the Prime Minister of Japan gives a positive assurance that his Government, as soon as it is legally possible, will enter into a treaty of peace with Nationalist China. That was a matter of considerable discussion during the time the Senator of New Jersey [Mr. Smith], Mr. Dulles and I were in Japan in December. As a matter of fact, I suppose it is the one item which arose more often than any other. Mr. President, this act on the part of the Prime Minister of Japan is an act of courage on his part, because there are many people in Japan, many in his own Government, who probably feel that this step should not be taken, certainly not unless the United States and Great Britain are able to present a united front in favour of such action. We know that this did not accord with the wishes of Great Britain. It does accord with the wish of the United States Government


which the Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Smith), Mr. Dulles and I did our best to make known to the Japanese Government and the Japanese people while we were in Japan.</q>
Then Mr. Senator Smith of New Jersey said:
<q>The Senator from Alabama and I are members of the Far Eastern Sub-committee of the Committee on Foreign Relations and at the suggestion and invitation of Mr. Dulles we accompanied him to Japan, because we felt it was most important that our colleagues in the Senate should understand, when the Peace Treaty comes before the Senate for ratification, whether the new Japanese Government is going to recognise one Chinese Government or the other. The letter of the Japanese Prime Minister is an assurance that the new Japanese Government intends to enter into a Peace Treaty with Nationalist China and to reject any possible negotiations for recognition of Communist China.</q>
It seems to me from this to be clear that, contrary to our agreement that Japan should be free as to which Chinese Government she recognised when she became an independent and sovereign State, United States pressure was brought to bear on the Japanese Government to commit themselves in advance to the recognition of the Chiang Kai-shek administration. Because not only were there two Senators sent from the subcommittee, but Mr. Dulles was there, and Mr. Dulles is in charge of these matters in the State Department. Therefore, I think we ought to have a full statement as to what happened about this between the Prime Minister and, or the Foreign Secretary and the United States Government.<br/>
I have only to add on this matter that since this the "New York Herald Tribune" of 30th January has published an article by the well-known columnists Joseph and Stewart Alsop giving, in my judgment, a most curious version of what happened in the London negotiations. It is a string of inaccuracies. For example, in the course of the article this statement is made:
<q>The fact is that before Dulles left for Britain last June, to try to negotiate a Japanese treaty with the British, the Japanese Government had already made up its mind. Premier Yoshida had already signified that Japan would extend at least limited recognition to Chiang Kai-shek in Formosa. This act was perfectly well known to the British Foreign Office, of course including then British Foreign Minister Herbert Morrison.</q>
I wish to state categorically and clearly that this statement is not true. It is not

true of the British Foreign Office, and it is not true of myself. I do not wish to blame the two distinguished columnists from whom I have quoted. To my mind it is clear that the writers were mis-in-formed, or perhaps I should say mis-inspired. But this sort of experience and this sort of thing is not good for Anglo-American relations.<br/>
Nobody is more anxious than we are, and I think it is generally true of the country as a whole, that our relations with the United States shall be cordial and good. But if Anglo-American relations are to be happy and healthy, and because we would wish that, we submit that we must speak to each other, we and the Americans, in friendship, on a basis of fraternal equality and with frankness.<br/>
It is a great mistake to assume that the United States people or Government mind frankness, as long as it is combined with friendship and courtesy. When I was in Washington last September, addressing the National Press Club, I deliberately and publicly discussed our own recognition of Communist China, as distinct from the United States refusal to do so and its recognition of the Chiang Kai-shek regime. I discussed it with all its controversial implications. Also, on the matter of East-West trade in Europe, I put the British point of view on that, and it really is a service to both countries that each should put, politely and firmly but clearly, these differences of view.<br/>
But the heavens did not fall, and there was no bitter quarrel about it. Indeed, it was taken in good part, as these things usually are, and I thought, therefore, that it is a mistake not to speak with each other&#x2014;and it is a two-way traffic, because the same thing happens the other way round&#x2014;in friendship and as between friends, but clearly, as to our respected views.<br/>
But there is another view about this, and I think that the Prime Minister has another view as to the way in which we should talk, as between ourselves and the United States, at any rate, in public. In this House in a debate on exports to China on 10th May, 1951, he made a statement which contains a remarkable passage which is not good for Anglo-American relations. He said this:
<q>Our advice to the Government"&#x2014;</q>
that is, to the Labour Government&#x2014;
<q>is to stop rubber entirely now and to reach an agreement with the United States on the


general question of trade with China in a spirit which will make the United States feel that their cause is our cause, and that we mean at all costs to be good friends and Allies."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 10th May, 1951; Vol. 487. c. 2168.]</q>
I submit that, since the words "at all costs" are included, it means that there can be no independent British foreign policy. It means that we have drifted into a very serious state of affairs, and I quote that passage because I think that it did indicate the genuine belief of the right hon. Gentleman.<br/>
Well, it did not matter when he was Leader of the Opposition, but it does matter much more now when he is Prime Minister. If we are to regard ourselves as satellites of the United States, or if we come to be regarded as satellites of the United States, or if we deceive the Americans as to our true convictions, our good relations with the United States will be spoilt, and we shall thereby stir up anti-Americanism here and anti-British feeling there, and we shall be playing the Communist game. Our relationships with the United States must be dignified relationships on both sides.<br/>
I do not want to see us drift into an attitude of subservience which is bound to do harm to our good relationships in due course. Moreover, there was another sign of the mentality of the Prime Minister on these matters when, in his statement in this House on 30th January, he got confused as to who was conducting the negotiations with the Communist forces for the truce&#x2014;the United States or the United Nations&#x2014;and it is indicative of his frame of mind.<br/>
We are all in this business of Korea. The Labour Government, I agree, with the support of the Opposition and the country as a whole, went into Korea, and we stay their loyally with our associates in this struggle, but we hope that a truce will soon come. It is perfectly true that the United States has made by far the biggest contribution in Korea, but that does not mean that we are to set ourselves aside or be involved in grave risks of widespread war without proper consultation and consideration.<br/>
I believe that the United States Government is, in general, seeking to limit the war, and our business is to be helpful to the United States Administration in seeking to limit the war, but, as I shall show, there are some United States views in

favour of open, large-scale war against the Chinese Government which is recognised by the Government of the United Kingdom.<br/>
The Foreign Secretary was wrong in denying this in the House of Commons on 5th February. He really was wrong in disputing that there were real elements of American opinion which were in favour of these policies. [HON. MEMBERS: "Oh."]I will give way, if necessary. Is it denied that the Foreign Secretary said that? In that case, we had better have the quotation.<br/>
The Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs denies it; he says it is not true, but this is what the Foreign Secretary said at col. 831 of HANSARD of 5th February:
<q>If I am to judge by the criticism, there seems to be an impression in some quarters in this country&#x2014;and this, I think, is at the heart of the matter&#x2014;that the United States is not really sincere in its pursuit of the armistice negotiations&#x2014;</q>
<q>Mr. S. O. DAVIES (Merthyr Tydfil): A very strong impression.</q>
and I do not myself hold that view&#x2014;
<q>MR. EDEN: I am glad to deal with it&#x2014;and even that she"&#x2014;</q>
that is, the United States&#x2014;
<q>seeks an extension of the conflict in the Far East. I want to state my experience, that I heard no single word in any responsible quarter, while I was in America, to lend colour to this belief. I sincerely believe that the American Government and people&#x2014;both of them&#x2014;are as deeply anxious for peace in the Far East as we are ourselves."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 5th February, 1952; Vol. 495, c. 831&#x2013;2.]</q>
In the first place, if hon. Members opposite say&#x2014;I am going to quote more people in a minute&#x2014;in advance that the distinguished Americans whom I wish to quote are irresponsible people who do not matter, let them say so, if they think that that sort of thing will improve Anglo-American relations. I do not treat these gentlemen with that contempt at all, and, moreover, when he says, as the Foreign Secretary did, I am sure in all good faith, that the American Government and people were all agreed as to the desirability of promoting peace in the Far East, there is more than one view in the United States about that, as I shall show.<br/>
But, first of all, I wish to quote from the Prime Minister's statement here and his speech to the United States Congress passages which I think were likely to


encourage the very tendency among some prominent Americans which the British people would wish to discourage, since this kind of thing was not calculated to be helpful to the Government of the United States. Let us consider the evidence of the Administration which was given to the Congressional Committee of Inquiry into the dismissal of General MacArthur.<br/>
The line taken by the American Government at that time was that it was most undesirable to extend the war in the Far East. It was in fact the line which was taken generally by the two Governments&#x2014;our own Labour Government here and the American Government there. But the Prime Minister, speaking in an election year to Congress, conflicted in spirit with that evidence given to the Congressional Committee. I think that that was an unfortunate intervention.<br/>
The Prime Minister's statement in the House of Commons on 30th January dealt with the question of the truce, and this was the statement he made. He said:
<q>The whole hypothetical question of what should be done, should a truce be made only to be broken, had been discussed before we left for America between the United Kingdom and the United States and the other Governments who have fighting forces in the field. It was agreed that clearly a very serious situation would arise in such an event as a breach of the truce; and various contingencies had been examined without any definite or formal commitments being entered into."&#x2014; [OFFICIAL REPORT, 30th January, 1952; Vol. 495, c. 198.]</q>
There was also the statement before the Congress&#x2014;on page 5 of the White Paper which has been circulated&#x2014;that:
<q>We welcome your patience in the armistice negotiations and our two countries are agreed that, if the truce we seek is reached only to be broken our response will be prompt, resolute and effective. What I have learned over here convinces me that British and United States policy in the Far East will be marked by increasing harmony.</q></p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1952-02-26a.955.1" hansard_membership_id="9545" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/29782" speakername="Mr. Morrison" colnum="955" time="">
<p>Let me ask some questions. I think the House is entitled to ask what is that policy to which the Prime Minister referred on which there is harmony between us and the Government of the United States. Moreover, it seems to me to be mischievous, irresponsible and foolish, when a truce is being negotiated under some difficulties, lasting

much longer than we like, goodness knows&#x2014;I am not criticising the United Nations team in that respect&#x2014;but negotiations are proceeding.<br/>
The truce is not yet reached. Is it sensible, while the negotiations are proceeding, before the truce is reached, to try to throw a spanner into the works and say, "Even if a truce is reached we have also to prepare for that truce being dishonoured and broken by the other side?"<br/>
That kind of talk is calculated to make it harder for the truce to be reached, and if the Prime Minister says to the Chinese, which, in effect, he did, "We have grave doubts as to whether you will honour the truce; you may make a truce and then break it," it is a provocative statement in itself and is quite likely to make the Chinese think we have some intention of breaking a truce and that we are preparing our defence in advance. [HON. MEMBERS: "No."] Yes, certainly.<br/>
Hon. Gentlemen really must get it into their heads that other people have their way of thinking as well as the British people have their way, and when we make statements concerning these delicate and important matters we have to try to think how other people's minds may work as a consequence of what is said. I think that that was a foolish, unwise and provocative statement, and was irresponsible and calculated to encourage people who take a point of view about these things which is different from ours.<br/>
Therefore, we had better know what the policy is; we had better know what these contingencies were about which the Prime Minister was talking, if we can, because these are things which may commit our country. It is all very well to say that they were non-committal, and so on. So was Sir Edward Grey before the First World War; he was non-committal, too. If these things involve extending warlike operations we really ought to know more about them than we do at present. We should like to know what the policy was to which reference was made, what were the commitments before the United States visit and during that visit and what is the general position. And we had better know now what the answers are to these questions.<br/>
The first business of the United Nations representatives on the one hand and of the North Koreans and their Chinese associates on the other is to reach a truce which is as sound and successful as we can and then to negotiate, on the political level, a peace settlement that will bring this particular trouble to an end, and it is not the business of the British Prime Minister, in the middle of these truce negotiations to make statements which are calculated to make it difficult for them to go forward to a successful conclusion.<br/>
We have to take into account some United States views as to open, large-scale war against China, and we have also to take into account in this House and on this side of the Atlantic the Prime Minister's background and his instincts in these matters, which ran through that Congress speech. There was no great and high appeal to the peoples of the world, including those of the Communist police States, and I think there ought to have been. These occasions ought not to be used merely for threats, innuendoes and attacks, they ought to be used also to try to lead the peoples of the world to better courses, including some of the peoples in police States, which can be done but which is difficult, over the heads of their own Governments.<br/>
Let us look at some significant statements made by leading Americans in responsible positions, and notice has to be taken from what they say. My first quotation deals with the past but it has its significance and illustrates the dangers of election year. This is by Mr. Taft, who is a very distinguished member of the Republican Party, one of its leaders if not its most important leader, and a possible Presidential candidate, reported in the "New York Times" on 27th January:
<q>Amid repeated applause, Senator Taft contended that the recall of General of the Army Douglas MacArthur as United Nations Commander 'apparently came from the fact that he wanted to win the war in Korea and the Administration did not want to win that war in Korea or to protect Formosa.' The Senator said he believed that MacArthur's policies of bombing and blockading and the use of (Chinese) Nationalist troops would have resulted in the consolidation of Korea and the setting up of a free Korea which might have been defended.' 'It is doubtful, however,' he said, 'whether today General MacArthur's

policies could be successful, because we no longer have control of the air over the Yalu River.'</q>
There is a second quotation from Mr. Taft which appeared in the "New York Herald-Tribune," on 14th February. It reads:
<q>Senator Robert A. Taft, Ohio, aspirant for the Republican Presidential nomination, said last night that the 'only chance to stop' an eventual military assault on the United States is a Chinese Nationalist invasion of Communist China.</q>
<q>He said in a speech: 'The invasion, well organised, might snowball rapidly. Is there any other way to prevent Stalin from seizing all Asia and building up such massive strength that he will attempt finally an assault on the United States?'</q>
It is fair to add that, later, Mr. Taft said that his observations were conditional upon a Chinese invasion of Indo-China. Whether or not that be so, we on this side cannot but regard such expressions as provocative and dangerous, and moreover, we ourselves have no faith in Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, either for his governmental administration or for his general record.<br/>
But there is not only Mr. Taft. There is, again, Mr. Dulles, and he was reported in our British Conservative "Daily Telegraph" of 22nd January as follows:
<q>Mr. Dulles, architect of the Japanese Peace Treaty, told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee today, in asking for its ratification, that the United States must take positive steps to assure the downfall of the present Moscow-dominated Government of China. We cannot expect a change in China to take place automatically. To realise such a change will require something besides a negative and purely defensive policy in Asia on the part of the leaders of the free world, notably the United States. It will require determination to promote freedom and independence in Asia, and action consistent with that determination, as opportunities arise.</q>
The "Daily Telegraph" adds:
<q>Mr. Dulles was not speaking for the State Department, but Mr. Acheson, Secretary of State, left the case for ratification largely to him, after supporting it briefly in general terms.</q>
There is a second quotation from Reuter of 12th February which reported:
<q>The United States should not allow the mainland of China to remain under Chinese Communist control,' Mr. John Foster Dulles said in Washington on Sunday. Interviewed on a radio programme, the chief architect of the Japanese Peace Treaty and adviser to the Secretary of State demanded a foreign policy that would make it 'as tough as possible' for People's China. Mr. Dulles added that the


pressure of the Seventh United States Fleet between Formosa and the mainland of China is 'not normal.' 'It is not normal for us to dedicate U.S. forces to restrain our friendly allies,' he said, 'I do not think we need to use the Fleet to accomplish that result, or at least I think that is something we should look into,' Mr. Dulles stated. On future relations between China and Japan, Mr. Dulles said: 'I think in the long run you cannot keep an absolute barrier between Japan and the mainland&#x2014;so we should change the character of the r&#x00E9;gime on the mainland'</q>
I should like to know something in respect of this reference to Formosa and the situation there. It will be recalled that my right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition, when he was Prime Minister, said that the Royal Navy would not participate in that operation, and it was, I understand, an American naval operation. I should like to know from the Prime Minister whether that declaration or undertaking still stands. Was that still clear as between the present Prime Minister and the President?&#x2014;because he said something about Formosa in Congress, and I want to know whether there is any change or whether, on the other hand, he has run a risk of misleading Congress.<br/>
It is fair to add that Mr. Dulles was careful to say that he was not speaking for the United States Government in that last extract, but it is no good calling him an irresponsible person. He is Ambassador at Large appointed by the President. He is the special adviser on Far Eastern affairs to the State Department, and, moreover, he is a possible Republican Secretary of State if there should be a change in the Administration. It is small wonder that the "Manchester Guardian," commenting on this statement by Mr. Dulles, said:
<q>If Mr. Dulles is to be taken at his word, he is asking for an American Crusade against China, Russia, and all the satellite countries. He rules out every idea of limited agreement. Doubtless he would prefer a cold war. But could his type of crusade remain at the cold war level? In Britain those who wish to sow division between us and America have been saying that American policy was exactly what Mr. Dulles describes. Fortunately, the American Administration has different ideas from Mr. Dulles, but his words, unless he can explain that he has been misreported, will rightly cause much anxiety.</q>
That is an extract from the "Manchester Guardian" of 14th February. It is a serious state of affairs, and what I am wondering is whether the spirit of the

Prime Minister's observations in the United States rather released some of these declarations by men feeling that it would be acceptable to the British Government.<br/>
The question about China is: ought we to assume that China is a permanent servile satellite of the Soviet Union and of the Cominform, even though China has a Communist Government? That was not the view of Mr. Ernest Bevin. It was not his view, and partly because he took that view the Labour Government recognised the People's Central Government and urged admittance of that Government to the United Nations. I personally agree with him and so do my hon. Friends on these benches.<br/>
Indeed, the Prime Minister himself introduced the question whether China would permanently be of the political character that she is at the moment, because he, in a bright moment in his speech, introduced this degree of wisdom into his Congress speech, even though the rest of it was out of harmony with the passage which I will now quote. He said&#x2014;and these are wise observations; it is a pity he did not live up to them&#x2014;
<q>The Chinese said of themselves several thousand years ago, 'China is a sea that salts all the waters that flow into it.' There is another Chinese saying about their country which is much more modern. It dates only from the Fourth Century. This is the saying: 'The tail of China is large, and will not be wagged.'</q>
The Prime Minister added&#x2014;and we can almost hear him saying it:
<q>I like that one.</q>
There is wisdom in that. I want to be quite fair and give the Prime Minister the credit to which he is undoubtedly due for that quotation. But if that be true, that China is not necessarily a permanent associate of the Communist system, then why assume otherwise in the rest of the utterances? Why carry on in a spirit as if she was beyond the pale, which seems to me to be foolish indeed? It seems to us that he was acting and talking the other way. We ought not to try to push China the other way. China, it must be remembered, has a vast population&#x2014;much bigger than the Soviet Union, bigger than the United States&#x2014;</p>

<p>My hon. Friend says, "Bigger than both together," and it may


well be so. She has a long history and she has her own traditions. She has her own psychology and characteristics, and I have met quite a number of businessmen with long knowledge and experience of China who have told me that they do not believe that China will permanently be an associate of the Cominform.<br/>
We must resist aggression, but our business is not to build up a Chinese wall against us. It is not to do in China what the Prime Minister helped to do in the Soviet Union 30 years ago at the early part of the Soviet Revolution. It is not a sensible thing to do and, moreover, there is a Commonwealth aspect. India, with other countries of the Commonwealth, has a great part to play in the great world of Asia.<br/>
We cannot always agree with each other about policy, India and ourselves. But the Labour Government achieved much, and the Indian Government achieved much, by way of Anglo-Indian co-operation and by way of understanding between ourselves, India, Pakistan and Ceylon. We wish that co-operation to continue, and we should never forget India's part in these matters and the help which she and those other countries can give in the relationships between ourselves and Asia and between themselves and Asia.<br/>
Yet the only references to India and Pakistan by the Prime Minister were indiscreet and inappropriate. He said this old thing which is persistently nagging in his head:
<q>After the war, unwisely as I contended, and certainly contrary to American advice, we accepted as normal debts nearly four thousand million pounds sterling of claims by countries we had protected from invasion, or had otherwise aided, instead of making counter-claims which would at least have reduced the bill to reasonable proportions.</q>
Why does he want to go out of his way to stir this up? He could not even carry the war Government with him on this doctrine. There was no agreement about it, and I say it was needless of him to go into that field and it was quite foolish to say what he did.<br/>
There is another one. [HON. MEMBERS: "Oh."] We have put a Motion down and it is my duty to prove the case from the documentary records. Here is the old imperialism coming out again, as it did then. He said, as recorded on page 6:
<q>Britain's power to influence the fortunes of the Middle East and guard it from aggression is far less today now that we have laid

aside our imperial responsibility for India and its armies.</q>
In the same old-style vein, he said, earlier:
<q>In the Middle East enormous changes have also taken place since I was last in power in my own country.</q>
That is what he said. [HON. MEMBERS: "Abadan."] He continued:
<q>When the war ended, the Western Nations were respected and predominant throughout these ancient lands, and there were quite a lot of people who had a good word to say about Great Britain.</q>
When will hon. Gentlemen opposite realise that they are living in a different world today? When will they realise that this persistent wish of the Prime Minister to get back to when the Western Powers were predominant over backward nations is a wrong conception? It is the imperialist conception. What we want is not to be predominant over these countries but to be friends and partners and co-operators with them. That is a much better conception.<br/>
In both these matters we are apprehensive about the whole approach and background of the Prime Minister and his party. They do not face constructively the great changes in Asia and the Middle East. They do not understand the dangers of the poverty and ignorance in which a large proportion of humanity lives. That is why we said, last October, that peace was safer with us than it would be with the Conservatives. That is what we say&#x2014;that peace was safer with the last Prime Minister than it is with the present Prime Minister.</p>

<p>The hon. and gallant Gentleman will be relieved to know what I said. I will tell the House what I said &#x2014;and this follows directly from what I have just been saying and from the imperialist attitude represented by the cheers of hon. Gentlemen opposite. This is what I said at the Labour Party Conference&#x2014;and it will be quite clear that it is untrue to say that this was an accusation of warmongering. What I said was this&#x2014;and it is on record and it is true:
<q>I do not accuse the average Conservative of being a warmonger, of thirsting for the shedding of blood, of wishing to be involved needlessly in a world war.</q>


This was on the eve of the Election, at the beginning of the Election campaign. I said:
<q>I do not say that, and I advise you not to say that, because it would not be fair and it would not be true. But it is their temperament, it is the background of their mental outlook, the old imperialist outlook. It is the semihysteria"&#x2014;</q>
[HON. MEMBERS: "Hear, hear."] And here it is again&#x2014;
<q>of the bulk of those Tory back benchers that really alarms one as to what a Tory Government would do if a Tory Government were put in. Therefore, if the country wants peace it had better vote for the people who can most surely be relied upon to preserve peace, and, if I may say so, are most competent to frame principles and proposals for the peace and well-being of the world.</q>
Those people sit upon these benches. I have shown by the evidence which I have put to the House that the Prime Minister has tendencies which are contrary to modern understanding and the cause of peace, and that he is out-of-date. I say that what I said to the Labour Party Conference was then true, that what we said in a similar vein throughout the Election was true&#x2014;and we say today that what we said at the beginning of the Election and during the Election has been proved to be true by the actions to which I have drawn attention today.</p>

<p>When I learned the text of the Motion which has been put upon the Order Paper and saw that it took the unusual form of a personal Vote of Censure upon me I am bound to say that I did expect that some more serious attempt to frame and sustain charges would have been made than we have heard from the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Lewisham, South (Mr. H. Morrison). I have hardly ever listened&#x2014;from a skilled Parliamentarian&#x2014;to such a weak, vague, wandering harangue which at no point touched the realities or which was so largely composed of quotations of all kinds, some of his own, and none selected with a view to proving or sustaining any effective case.<br/>
I shall in due course&#x2014;I hope I shall not too long detain the House&#x2014;deal with the attack which is made upon me today, but if I had to confine myself

to those aspects of it which have been dealt on by the right hon. Gentleman I am bound to say I should find myself very short of material with which to reply.<br/>
I wish, first of all, to draw the attention of the House to the agreement we reached in Washington about the atomic bomb. We reached an agreement about its not being used from the East Anglian base without British consent. This agreement states in a formal and public manner what had already been reached as a verbal understanding between the late Prime Minister and President Truman.<br/>
We felt, however, that it would be an improvement if the position were made public and formal, and I expect that will be the general opinion. A much more important atomic development is now before us. I was not aware until I took office that not only had the Socialist Government made the atomic bomb as a matter of research, but that they had created at the expense of many scores of millions of pounds the important plant necessary for its regular production. This weapon will be tested in the course of the present year by agreement with the Australian Government at some suitable place in that continent.<br/>
This achievement is certainly a real advantage to us and when I informed the Americans in Washington of the position which had been reached quite a new atmosphere was created on this subject. I was interested to read in the newspapers on Monday week the following statement by Senator MacMahon, the author of the MacMahon Act of 1946 which, under extreme penalties, forbade all sharing of secrets with Great Britain or other countries:
<q>The achievement of an atomic explosion by Great Britain, when an accomplished fact, will contribute to the keeping of the peace because it will add to the free world's total deterring power.</q>
<q>This event is likely to raise in still sharper focus the problem of atomic co-operation between ourselves and Great Britain. The British contributed heavily to our own war-time atomic project. But due to a series of unfortunate circumstances the nature of the agreements which made this contribution possible was not disclosed to me and my colleagues on the Senate special atomic energy committee at the time we framed the law in 1946. Now we may consider rethinking the entire situation with all the facts in front of us.</q>


This is a very important declaration. We must now await the result of the experiment in Australia. While paying all credit to the late Government and their scientists for the action which they have taken I must, as an old Parliamentarian, express my surprise that a full and clear statement was not made of this policy to Parliament, especially in view of the immense sums of money which were voted by this House without their having any clear appreciation of what was being done. There was no reason why Parliament in time of peace should not have been made fully aware, not, of course, of the technical details, but of the large scale new departure in policy adopted on so grave a matter.<br/>
The Conservative opposition would certainly have supported the Government, as we did on so many other of their measures of defence, and their majority would no doubt have been overwhelming. Nevertheless, they preferred to conceal this vast operation and its finances from the scrutiny of the House; not even obtaining a vote on the principle involved, while, at the same time, with Machiavellian art, keeping open the advantage of accusing their opponents of being warmongers.</p>

<p>I really cannot let those statements pass. We have carried on precisely the same policy on the advice of our experts and advisers with regard to the publicity of these atomic matters. I was ready at all times to see the right hon. Gentleman, and I always understood that his closest confidant, Lord Cherwell, was fully informed of all these matters. I do not know why he had not told me about it, and as for the Americans not knowing what we were doing, we were telling them every possible thing in order to get their co-operation.</p>

<p>The right hon. Gentleman will no doubt have various opportunities of making full statements upon all this topic, but it does seem to me that some of the late Government's followers hardly relished their success in this sphere. I notice, indeed, a certain sense of disappointment with the statement that the achievement which has been made could not be wholly attributed to us. Indeed, the right hon. Gentleman the Leader of the Opposition is in the position of one who "did good

by stealth and blushed to find it fame." Before the whole story passes from life into history he will have to do a good deal of blushing in the explanations which he will have to make to some of his followers.<br/>
This remarkable episode is a good prelude to the argument I shall now deploy in reply to the new move in the Socialist warmongering accusation, of which the right hon. Gentleman's Motion is the latest expression. I am complimented by the fact that the official Opposition's Vote of Censure should concentrate its gravamen on me. It is not the first time I have incurred the wrath of the Socialist Party. [HON. MEMBERS: "Nor of the Tories."] I remember that in March, 1946, a Motion condemning a speech I made at Fulton was put on the Order Paper by just over 100 Socialist Members of Parliament, including seven who subsequently became Ministers. Here is the relevant part of the Motion:
<q>That this House considers that proposals for a military alliance between the British Commonwealth and the United States of America for the purpose of combating the spread of Communism, such as were put forward in a speech at Fulton, Missouri, by the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Woodford, are calculated to do injury to the good relations between Great Britain, the United States and the U.S.S.R., and are inimical to the cause of world peace.&#x2026;</q>
That Motion was never debated. On the contrary, the policy which I outlined at Fulton five years ago has since been effectively adopted both by the United States and by the Socialist Party. Two years later, by the Brussels Pact, and in the following year by the North Atlantic Treaty, the whole substance and purpose of what I said was adopted and enforced by the Socialist Government, and today we all respect the foresight and wise courage of the late Mr. Ernest Bevin in helping to bring those great changes about.<br/>
Now, today, the Opposition have adopted a position of protestation that there should be no war with China. We agree with them about the importance of avoiding such a war, but I seem to have a recollection that there was some trouble about the Chinese going into Korea, which began 15 months ago, and that the Chinese Communists and their North Korean allies killed and wounded more than 100,000 Americans and nearly 3,000 of our own men, and that they lost themselves what has been estimated at over


1,250,000 killed and wounded. Even half that number would be quite a lot. One reads, too, in the papers every day about fighting that is going on even now with the Chinese.<br/>
Apparently, however, according to the mentality of the Socialist Party, which only five months ago supported all this devastating struggle in Korea, nothing matters unless we call it "war." Apparently the important point is: What is it to be called? As long as it is not called "war" the high condition of moral idealism of the Socialist movement is in no way impaired.<br/>
Hundreds of thousands of men may fall mangled and torn by bomb, bayonet, bullet or grenade; whole areas of Korea may be devastated in the advances and retreats of the opposing armies; 35,000 dead may be picked up in front of a single American division; our own men may have killed many times their number in deadly fighting; but, whatever happens, it must not be called "war." [HON. MEMBERS: "Rubbish."] It is not the fact, but it is the name that counts.<br/>
What a strange political philosophy. "No war. Peace in our time"&#x2014;that is what the Socialists said when they themselves were responsible, in conjunction with other nations, for using deadly modern weapons to share in the slaughter of a million or more Chinese and North Koreans. It is difficult to imagine such a process of self-delusion and mental obliquity.<br/>
But whatever has been going on in Korea in the last 18 months is war, even though they choose to call it a "collective police operation"; and it is a war entered upon by the Socialist Government, and waged by them, side by side with other members of the United Nations. Since we have been in office the truce negotiations, begun eight months ago, have continued, and the slaughter of the Chinese has abated. A comparative calm rests on the blood-soaked front, and the Socialist Party can turn their energies, I have no doubt with a measure of relief, from being war wagers to calling other people warmongers.<br/>
I made it plain a month ago, in my first speech on my return from America, that I was opposed to action that would involve us or our Allies of

the United Nations in a war in China. I drew the attention of the House to General Omar Bradley's statement which I will now quote exactly&#x2014;[HON. MEMBERS: "Another quotation."]&#x2014;for I was not quite accurate before. Verify your quotations is a good maxim. This is the quotation:
<q>We would be fighting the wrong nation in the wrong war and in the wrong place.</q></p>

<p>We did not interrupt the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Lewisham, South (Mr. H. Morrison), who has just sat down, and I really must ask for an opportunity of unfolding my case. I must remind the House that I have never changed my opinion about the danger of our getting involved in China. When the Chinese first came into Korea, after the Russian-instigated attack by the North Koreans, I said in the House&#x2014;[An HON. MEMBER: "Another quotation."] What did the hon. Gentleman say? Oh, I beg pardon. I thought it might have been an intelligent point. I said on 30th November, 1950:
<q>The plan would evidently be to get the United States and the United Nations&#x2026;involved as deeply as possible in China, and thus prevent the reinforcement of Europe and the building up of our defensive strength there to a point where it would be an effectual deterrent. It is one of the most well-known&#x2014;almost hackneyed&#x2014;strategical and tactical methods, to draw your opponent's resources to one part of the field and then, at the right moment, to strike in another. Military history shows countless examples of this and of variants of it. Surely, however, the United Nations should avoid by every means in their power becoming entangled inextricably in a war with China."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 30th November, 1950; Vol. 481, c. 1335.]</q>
I have never departed from those views in any way, either publicly or privately. I also endeavoured when I spoke here a month ago to show the danger which was arising in Europe by the dispersion of so many British, American and French divisions in Asia as a result of acts of aggression which the Soviet Government had promoted without losing a single soldier in Russian uniform.<br/>
This made it clear that I disagree profoundly with the kind of statements, some of which have been read to us this afternoon, which have recently been made in the United States by various


prominent Americans engaged in the impending Presidential Elections. I am not going to mention names. It is not for us to be drawn into American politics. Her Majesty's Government deal with the United States Government of the day, and with them our relations are very good indeed.<br/>
But let me now give the House some account of what happened about Korea under the late Government, and also since we have become responsible. The reason why I have to use guarded language instead of simple facts is that if military action, like, for instance, bombing, were referred to precisely, it would reveal what had been agreed and might therefore expose British and American airmen to extra danger. There is nothing I should like better than that all the relevant documents on this subject should be published. But that is not possible while fighting is going on or may be resumed on a large scale.<br/>
I will give the House the fullest account I can at this present time. On several occasions in the last year the United States asked the British Government what military action they would agree to if certain things happened. Questions were addressed to the late Government and later to Her Majesty's present advisers. On the first occasion in May of last year, before the truce negotiations began, the right hon. Gentleman the late Foreign Secretary replied to an inquiry that His Majesty's Government had decided that in the event of heavy air attacks from bases in China upon United Nations forces in Korea they would associate themselves with action not confined to Korea.</p>

<p>On a point of order. Is the right hon. Gentleman quoting directly from Cabinet papers? If he is, then I move that the papers be laid. If, as I understand, the right hon. Gentleman is making references to discussions inside the previous Cabinet, then he is in order in doing so. If he is quoting, then he must lay the papers, and I so move.</p>

<p>I am not quoting at all. I am carefully avoiding making any quotations on that account, but I am undoubtedly entitled in defence of our own position, which has been subjected to this shameful attack, to place the

<p>On a point of order. I understood the right hon. Gentleman to say that some inquiry was addressed at some time by the American administration to the previous Government. Such an inquiry would presumably have been either in a document itself or, if the inquiry were made to the Cabinet, then in a document circulated to Ministers. Therefore, once the right hon. Gentleman has referred to such an inquiry he has by implication referred to a document. That being so, I ask you, Mr. Deputy-Speaker, whether the House is not entitled either to have the document laid before it or to have the statement withdrawn?</p>

<p>Further to that point of order. Once a thing is paraphrased, the paraphrase may be a comment, but the right hon. Gentleman did not do that. He referred to a specific question asked by one administration of another. That, Mr. Deputy-Speaker, is not a paraphrase.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1952-02-26a.970.3" hansard_membership_id="9996" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/17624" speakername="Mr. Deputy-Speaker" colnum="970" time="">

<p>If it is against the public interest so to do, it is against the public interest to make reference to it. May I respectfully submit to you, Mr. Deputy-Speaker, that my first recollection of an action of this sort was when the right hon. Gentleman made a quotation from a Cabinet document and was afterwards seriously chastised by the late Earl Lloyd George? It was on the occasion of the Stack assassination in Egypt, and the right hon. Gentleman had to come down to the House of Commons and apologise for quoting without permission from a Cabinet document.<br/>
In my submission all parties in the House in this case are seriously handicapped, because it should be to the interest of every party to see that there is no


partisan disclosure of Cabinet papers unless the whole truth is made available. I ask you, Mr. Deputy-Speaker, to accept my Motion that the papers be laid.</p>

<p>All I can do is to quote briefly from the Manual the exact words which are probably better than those I gave in my own language. It says:
<q>If a Minister of the Crown quotes in the House a despatch or other state paper which has not been presented to the House, he ought to lay it on the table. This rule is analogous to the rule observed in courts of law against quoting documents which are not produced in evidence. It cannot be applied to private documents or to documents which are alleged by the Minister to be of such a nature that their production would be inconsistent with the public interest.</q></p>

<p>I certainly understood that the right hon. Gentleman the Prime Minister was giving us the text of a dispatch. I think in that case and on all precedents that the whole of the document must be laid, and I submit that. I should like to know what we are having, whether this is some paraphrase or whether it is the actual dispatch because, after all, in fairness to the Government of the day, it is very easy to paraphrase things and to give them a twist. I should like to have the actual words.</p>

<p>I can only deal with one point of order at a time. I was listening very carefully to what was said. I understood&#x2014;and I was reinforced by the Prime Minister after the point of order was first raised&#x2014;that he was paraphrasing and not quoting.</p>

<p>Further to that point of order. I respectfully submit that the Prime Minister did not say, and could not say, that he was paraphrasing. What he said, expressly, was that on 15th May, 1950, a certain question&#x2014;which he quoted to us&#x2014;was addressed by the American Administration to Mr. Ernest Bevin. By no possible twist of language can that be called a paraphrase.<br/>
On the other point&#x2014;as to whether it is in the public interest&#x2014;I submit that the Prime Minister cannot possibly claim that

it is not in the public interest to disclose it, because he has already disclosed it. Therefore, since this is not a paraphrase and it is not claimed to be in the public interest that it is not right to disclose it, I submit that the conditions of the Standing Order have been fully satisfied and the House is entitled to the papers. I beg leave to second the Motion which the right hon. Gentleman moved.</p>

<p>It seems to me that that point is rather contradictory. If it has been quoted at all, it does not mean that it has all been quoted, and it may not be in the public interest to lay the paper before the House.</p>

<p>Then, in my submission, that puts my Motion entirely in order, because whether the right hon.

<p>I am stating the facts perfectly clearly, as you will see when they are all set forward. They will show how very little ground there is for hon. Gentlemen opposite making their slanderous accusations against us.<br/>
In September last year the Americans proposed that in the event of a breakdown of the armistice talks and the resumption of large-scale fighting in Korea, certain action should be taken of a more limited character. These proposals were accepted by the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Lewisham, South and they were endorsed by the then Prime Minister. Whereas in May the right of prior consultation had been required by the late Government in the specific instance, before our consent could be assumed, in the more limited proposals of September the Socialist Government did not insist upon this right. In both cases Her Majesty's Government consider that the decision of our predecessors was right and, in my view, in both cases it justifies the words which I used in the United States Congress, namely "prompt, resolute and effective."</p>

<p>I was waiting until the right hon. Gentleman had got to the end of his observations on the attitude of the late Government. I am not crying about it, because neither my right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition nor I, nor any Members of the late Government, have anything to be ashamed of&#x2014;but I am bound to say that I think it is unusual, doubtful in taste and constitutional propriety, for the Prime Minister to delve into the papers of his predecessors&#x2014;as to the principle of which there are well known constitutional rules&#x2014;and then come here, not with a fair statement of what took place, but with a partisan version, adjusted to his own tactical needs and, when he is faced with a demand for papers, to hedge and evade, because of what he had done.<br/>
As far as I am concerned&#x2014;and I think I speak for my right hon. Friend&#x2014;I am quite willing for the papers to be fairly laid; but the right hon.

There were long discussions with the United States about this and there is no analogy between what he is now discussing and what we were discussing earlier on.

<p>I am in the hands of the Chair, but when a practice of this kind is introduced I think I have the right to deal with it. I was about to finish. If I was standing up while you were on your feet, Sir Charles, and if that was the point of your complaint, I apologise. Had I seen you stand up I should certainly have sat down at once. I finish by saying this. The discussions earlier on had very wide demands which were resisted&#x2014;</p>

<p>Yes, that is right. In principle, one cannot stand by in that case and do nothing whatever about it, but there was insistence at our end that every effort should be made to see that there was consultation, because people can go a little bit off the rails in believing that something has happened when in fact something has not happened. Therefore, we required prior consultation. But that limited and direct military point about something happening in the field of military activities is a wholly different thing from this other argument in favour of widespread war and invasion.</p>

<p>On a point of order. I do really submit to you now, Sir, that this position is becoming quite farcical without the papers. Here is a debate going on between the Prime Minister on one side and my right hon. Friend on the other about the effect of certain communications made a long time ago, and about whether it is fair or unfair to make a comparison between those matters and the matters we are now discussing. In that dispute the rest of the House is completely lost. We do not know what the argument is about.<br/>
The whole purpose of the Standing Order to which reference has been made was always to prevent the House from being put in the ridiculous position of having to listen to a debate between two of its Members about matters of which

the rest of the House remained in ignorance. I say to you, Sir, that it is quite impossible to continue this debate in this way without the House having access to the documents to which both right hon. Gentlemen are referring.</p>

<p>We now come in the narrative which I am giving Parliament to the change of Government in this country. The General Election took place and Her Majesty's present advisers became responsible. The question was put to us by the United States: What would happen if a truce were agreed upon and then treacherously broken by the Chinese, greatly to the loss and disadvantage of the United Nations' armies, and if heavy fighting were resumed on a large scale?<br/>
This involves one hypothesis on top of another, and on the whole it does not seem very likely to happen, especially if, as we hope, peace negotiations follow the present truce. Nevertheless, when allies or members of a common body like the United Nations are working together, the one who bears nine-tenths of the burden may well ask the others what they would do in certain circumstances, and Her Majesty's present Government agreed that it would be prudent to make clear that serious consequences would follow the breach of the terms of an agreed truce.<br/>
As I have already said today, and as I pointed out when I spoke a month ago, it is not possible, while military operations are going on, to state either positively or negatively exactly what those consequences might be. But let me make it clear that we conformed, in principle, to the policy of our predecessors. Indeed, in some respects it might be said that we did not commit ourselves even as far as they had done. Nevertheless, the action to which we agreed, like that of the Socialist Government before us, fully justified the description which I gave to Congress of being "prompt, resolute and effective." The dispatch in which our policy was set forth was approved by the Cabinet in December, and various communications were sent to other members of the Commonwealth. All this happened before my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary and I set out for Washington.<br/>
It is a fact that we did not discuss the matter further at any conferences in Washington with our American colleagues. They did not raise it, and we had received no answer to our reply. It is absolutely true therefore to say, as in the words of the Opposition Motion, that we adhered to the policy followed by the late Administration with regard to the Korean conflict and the relations between Great Britain and China. It is not true to say that I in any way departed from this position. There is no truth in the suggestion that any secret or private arrangements were made or any change of policy agreed upon, formally or informally, actual or implied, by me or my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary, on these issues during our visit to the United States.<br/>
Having told the House these facts, some of which evidently surprised them, let me come to the address which I was invited to deliver to the Congress of the United States. I am very glad that the House wished to have this document circulated to them and that it should have been examined with so much attention. I cherish the hope that it will be found, as time passes, not to have been injurious to British and American relations which are, of course, all-important to our survival here at home and to the part we can play in averting a Third World War.<br/>
It is the design and intense desire of the Soviet Union and its satellites and all its associates and fellow-travellers in many lands to drive a wedge between the British and American democracies and everything which tends to consolidate the mighty forces of the English-speaking world, upon which the hopes of United Europe also depend. Anything that secures that unity must be considered a service not only to freedom but to peace.<br/>
I must ask the indulgence of the House &#x2014;if there is any of it left at the end of this statement, though I hope some of the excitement may wear off as we go along&#x2014;to let me present the background in my mind to what I said to Congress, for which I have been criticised by the official spokesman of the Opposition, the late Foreign Secretary. It was certainly no easy task, in the present circumstances of bitterness here at home and during election year in the United States, to choose the points on which to dwell.<br/>
In July last, when I was a private person, a delegation of the American Senate, which had been sent round many countries, came to London, and during their visit they asked to see me, and I received them in my home. I was impressed by the fact that this powerful body was greatly disturbed by the anti-American feeling which they thought existed in the House of Commons. So I said to them, "Do not be misled. The anti-American elements in Parliament are only a quarter of the Labour Party, and the Labour Party is only a half of the House. Therefore, you may say that one-eighth at the outside, give vent to anti-American sentiments. The Labour Party as a whole, and the Government of the day, supported by the Conservative Party in this matter, are whole-heartedly friendly to the United States, and recognise and are grateful for the part they are playing in the world and of the help they have given to us."<br/>
This was the message which I tried to give to Congress when I spoke, and in so doing I felt I was speaking&#x2014;I hoped I was speaking&#x2014;for the great majority of the present Parliament. Today, however, I must say that the attitude of a fraction of the late House of Commons and apparently of a larger proportion of the present House of Commons and the mood and temper which this Vote of Censure which the right hon. Gentleman has moved personally upon me implies, can be made use of throughout the United States by Isolationist forces and by the anti-British elements which form a powerful minority throughout the great Republic.<br/>
I say to those former Ministers whose records lie behind them and who have put their names to this Motion: "Beware lest in petty manoeuvres about the leadership of the Socialist Party you do not injure causes to which you have pledged your honour and all our fortunes."<br/>
I had no wish or need to proclaim any new policy to Congress because, so far as policy is concerned, in Korea and China, we were only following in accordance with our own convictions the policy entered into and long pursued by our predecessors. But I hoped by my visit to the United States, first to establish an intimacy and an atmosphere of goodwill

in the high circles that rule in Washington which would make it much easier in the future to deal with problems as they arise. I also felt a keen sympathy with the American people in their losses, and in having so many of their men serving far away from home.<br/>
I hoped also to give the Congress and people of the United States something of a glow and sense of our abiding friendship for them, and of our gratitude to them for all they have done for us, and for the causes which we also are resolved to serve with all our strength. On the whole I cannot feel, in spite of this party challenge, that I have failed in what I sought to do.</p>

<p>I should like to thank the right hon. Gentleman and to ask him in all seriousness if, as he says, he made no new commitment additional to the one made by the late Government he can tell us why it has been widely reported in the United States responsible Press that there has been a change of policy in relation to Korea as a result of the right hon. Gentleman's visit to the United States.</p>

<p>I am afraid that it is very difficult always to follow with complete accuracy all the movements represented in our own Press here at home, and I really cannot undertake to have a similar mastery of the mighty Press of the United States. But what I have stated here is a fact&#x2014;that I made no new commitment in this field of foreign affairs of any sort or kind.<br/>
However, there are a few points of detail in this meticulous heresy hunt on which I will touch. The right hon. Gentleman the


Leader of the Opposition complained in his speech the last time we debated this matter that I had used the word "United States" more often than I had used the words "United Nations." Surely, when speaking to the American Congress, whose troops have contributed nine-tenths of the fighting power and whose casualties are 20 times as great as all the other members of the United Nations put together, it would not be unnatural that I should speak of them and of their sacrifices.<br/>
But technically I have a right to speak of the United States as a prime factor because it is their commander who, under the United Nations, is the head of the Unified Command provided by the United States Government over all the forces employed. It only shows the limited and lopsided character of the Socialist trend of thought that they should complain that I did not deny the United States, in their own Assembly, the honour which belongs to them of being the supreme agent and chosen leader of the world instrument against Communist aggression.<br/>
The Leader of the Opposition admitted the other day that he agreed with what I had said to Congress about Formosa. This is what I said:
<q>I am very glad that, whatever diplomatic divergencies there may be from time to time about the procedure, you"&#x2014;</q>
that is, Congress&#x2014;
<q>do not allow the Chinese anti-communists on Formosa to be invaded and massacred from the mainland.</q>
It is the only thing that one could say about Formosa which could be agreed on both sides of this House and on both sides of the Congress of the United States, and, indeed, on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean. I thought it was rather a good selection&#x2014;almost a bullseye. The fact that I selected it was, by implication, adverse to other statements which could be made on the subject and was, I believe, so understood and accepted by the great majority of my audience on that occasion.<br/>
I have been accused of speaking with two voices on different sides of the Atlantic. That is not true. I speak with the same voice, I can assure hon. Members&#x2014;the one to which they are having the opportunity of listening today. Wherever I speak everything that I say on these occasions will no

doubt be immediately reported or broadcast in the fullest manner on both sides of the Ocean. I am not conscious of the slightest change of thought or conviction on these important issues, and I do not retract a word that I have used on either occasion, here or on the other side, on our foreign outlook and policy.<br/>
Let me then sum up. First, there is no change in our policy towards the United States, towards the United Nations or towards the war in Korea. Secondly, on the circumstances which might justify action not confined to Korea, we have only followed and conformed to the policy for which the late Government were responsible and for which no two men were more personally responsible than the right hon. Gentleman the Leader of the Opposition and the right hon. Gentleman who has just spoken to us and who has thought it compatible with his personal candour and public behaviour to move this Motion.<br/>
Thirdly, I believe that on both sides of the Atlantic we are convinced, as I have argued since the beginning of these troubles, that nothing could be more foolish than for the armies of the United States or the United Nations to become engulfed in the vast areas of China, and also that few adventures could be less successful or fruitful than for Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek to plunge on to the mainland.<br/>
Fourthly, if the truce is made only to be broken, a very grave situation will arise in which we must act as good comrades to our American and other United Nation friends and as a loyal member of the United Nations Organisation. In this case, our action, like that contemplated by our predecessors, will be prompt, resolute and effective.<br/>
Finally, the prospects of a truce being reached and respected in Korea will depend to a large extent upon the unity between Great Britain and the United States being proved to be not only unbreakable but growing stronger, and the attempts of all who seek to weaken or divide us being repulsed and condemned as they will be tonight by the House of Commons.</p>

<p>I should like to start, as I did not intend to do, by making a reference to the most unusual device adopted by the right hon.


Gentleman in making a summary of a State paper, and I should like to say to hon. and right hon. Members on both sides of the House that they ought to begin to reflect seriously on the consequences that might follow from that precedent.<br/>
First of all, it does not concern me, obviously, because the date mentioned by the right hon. Gentleman was after my resignation from the Government. Therefore, I can hardly be accused of a private preoccupation by the disclosure. But I should like to point out to the right hon. Gentleman that, if it is proper for any Cabinet Minister who has access to all previous State papers to make any reference that he likes to them without being under the obligation to publish them, that will deal a deadly blow not only at the probity of Government but at the principle of collective Cabinet responsibility.<br/>
I want to point out to the House what follows from this, and I want to remind the right hon. Gentleman that, of all people, he ought not to have done it, because I remember him having the biggest hiding of his career at the hands of the late Earl Lloyd George for a previous act of similar mischief.</p>

<p>What is involved in this? In the first place, if the right hon. Gentleman will kindly give me his attention and suppress his innate frivolity, he will realise that all Cabinet meetings are already summarised and not reported verbatim. Therefore, if we who have been members of Cabinets are to be exposed to a summary of a summary, all our past conduct can be completely falsified and made the

subject of a series of lying innuendoes. If it be accepted&#x2014;this is of the utmost constitutional importance and I want hon. Members opposite to remember that we have access to Cabinet papers&#x2014;nothing can stop me going to Cabinet papers&#x2014;just as nothing can stop right hon. Gentlemen opposite&#x2014;and nothing can prevent me, if this precedent is to be accepted, from summarising Cabinet papers, State papers or Cabinet minutes. Before we know where we are the British Constitution will be engulfed in a series of fruitless recriminations. It is only the right hon. Gentleman with his eighteenth century psychology who would have indulged in the trick at all. In fact, he would have been a worthy member of Lord North's administration.<br/>
Hon. and right hon. Members opposite may think they have won a temporary advantage by this method, but they must measure and weight its consequences. This is a boomerang, and the wounded will not only be on this side of the House. I warn right hon. Members who are members of the Cabinet that if this is going to be done, there should be a shorthand report of all Cabinets and Ministerial committees; otherwise, they may find themselves in the hands of summaries which have bowdlerized what they say and the advice that they have given; and some future political enemy may further bowdlerize it in a debate in this House. I should have taken the right hon. Gentleman on one side and asked him whether he has not done British constitutional practice a great injury by this piece of irresponsible foolery this afternoon.<br/>
I say this with due humility, that in the course of the last 20 years I have given considerable attention to the study of Parliamentary practice. [An HON. MEMBER: "And other things."] The hon. Gentleman will probably be confined to one thing. In the course of that time it has always seemed to me&#x2014;and I put this in all respect before the House &#x2014;that the informality of our discussions, which is the envy of the world, is only rendered possible by having it maintained within a strict formalism of procedure. Once that formalism is broken down and once the tacit assumptions of political relationships are broken, then there is no limit to the damage which can be done to the British Constitution. 'Therefore, I earnestly hope we shall not


have a repetition of what has been done this afternoon.<br/>
Even now the right hon. Gentleman ought to respond to the invitation of the Front Bench and publish the paper, because to take hold of a State paper, which he says it is not in the public interest to publish, and then to indicate a part of its contents&#x2014;[<i>Interruption</i>.] The right hon. Gentleman, according to Erskine May and the strict constitutional procedure, has nothing to shelter behind except that it is not in the public interest to disclose a document. If, therefore, be does not publish the document at this moment, but contents himself with giving what may be a lying summary.&#x2014;[<i>Interruption</i>.] How do we know it is otherwise, because there is nothing in the right hon. Gentleman's career that would guard us against that. [HON. MEMBERS: "Withdraw&#x0021;"] I do not propose to withdraw; I have said nothing which is out of order.</p>

<p>You, Mr. Deputy-Speaker, quoted Erskine May, where it says:
<q>It has also been admitted that a document which has been cited ought to be laid upon the table of the House, if it can be done without injury to the public interests.</q>
If its publication would injure the public interest, the right hon. Gentleman ought never to have made reference to it at all.<br/>
At the conclusion of his speech the Prime Minister inferred&#x2014;this shows the extent to which his ego now fills the whole cosmos&#x2014;that an attack upon him might be construed as an attack upon the United States. That is an astonishing doctrine. We have always known that the right hon. Gentleman believed that any attack upon him is an attack upon Great Britain. We have always known that his ego has expanded to that extent, but surely it is now an unusual doctrine to suggest that for the Opposition to move

a Vote of Censure upon him is imperilling Anglo-American relations.<br/>
Of course, the right hon. Gentleman might complain, as the Foreign Secretary himself complained, of what might be described as anti-American feeling in this country and as anti-American feeling on this side of the House. I have never had any anti-American feeling. [<i>Laughter</i>.] I can tell hon. Members opposite that I have more friends in America than I have on the other side of the House. Hon. Members opposite must get these facts right. No one is wholly in favour of British policy. Is there complete unanimity in Great Britain about British foreign policy? Of course there is not. Is there complete unanimity in the United States behind American foreign policy? Of course there is not.<br/>
This attempt to make nations into homogeneous units, and so make it impossible to criticise any aspect of the administration of a country without being charged with being against the country as a whole belongs to juvenile polemics. No one is more adept at that than the right hon. Gentleman the Prime Minister. I should like to ask the right hon. Gentleman this. He himself, I am quite sure, would admit that there are different currents of opinion inside the United States of America. We therefore are entitled to criticise certain of those currents without being accused of anti-Americanism.<br/>
For example, I am not going to quote from Senator Taft. I am not going to give quotations at all. I am not going to quote from Americans in an electioneering year, because we all know that Americans in their electioneering are even less scrupulous than hon. Gentlemen opposite. It would be distinctly unfair to suggest that Senator Taft actually believes what he is saying any more than the right hon. Gentleman believes all that he is saying. In fact, I am going to ask the right hon. Gentleman one or two questions.<br/>
What we are anxious about here&#x2014;and our anxiety is shared outside this House and we must all keep it within our consciousness&#x2014;is that if there is one thing that lies heavily upon the hearts of hundreds of millions of people it is the fear that the statesmen of the world may not be able to prevent a third world war. Therefore, we have to consider these matters in the light of that all-pervading anxiety. That is the reason why we were


so much upset by what we thought the right hon. Gentleman had said.<br/>
I freely admit that the right hon. Gentleman is the most articulate Englishman that has ever lived. He has a gift of language, both in speech and in writing, and many of his spoken and written contributions are adornments of the English language. If there is anyone who has the gift of making himself clear, it is the right hon. Gentleman. It is a gift not shared by the Foreign Secretary, who is able to shelter a very opaque foreign policy behind ambiguity of language. The right hon. Gentleman is above all men, clear.<br/>
How did it come about that he was so much misunderstood? [An HON. MEMBER: "By you."] Not only by us but by reputable elements in the United States of America? It is no use hon. and right hon. Gentlemen shaking their heads. Not only must they have spoken to large numbers of Americans who take the same view, but they must know that almost every organ of responsible American opinion put a different construction upon the Congress speech than the right hon. Gentleman has given this afternoon.<br/>
Therefore I am bound to ask myself, as I am sure we are all bound to ask ourselves: How did he come to be misunderstood? Did he succumb to the warmth of his reception? Was he seduced by his immediate audience? Were his indiscretions the result of his lack of self-control? If that was the case, we will give him a series of warm receptions on this side of the House, hoping to receive the benefit of a similar number of indiscretions.<br/>
The United States of America believed that, as a result of the right hon. Gentleman's visit, a change had taken place in British foreign policy towards the Far East; and, indeed, what other conclusion could they form? My right hon. Friend the ex-Foreign Secretary has made a quotation, and it stands out here startlingly:
<q>What I have learned over here convinces me that British and United States policy in the Far East will be marked by increasing harmony.</q>
Does that mean that they are moving towards us or we are moving towards them? Being a Welshman, I am interested in the structure of harmony.

"Increasing harmony" means being of increasing accord. The Foreign Secretary made it quite clear on the last occasion that there were deep differences of opinion between Great Britain and the United States on China policy. Are we moving towards them, or are they moving towards us? From what situation does the harmony arise? I wish the Prime Minister would listen, because he will not hear as much good sense from the Chief Whip as I am giving him.</p>

<p>It was not a good enough joke to repeat. The point that I am putting is this. Here is a quotation from "The Times" of 12th February&#x2014;and I am not quoting politicians who are trying to get votes&#x2014;
<q>Mr. Dulles, during a broadcast discussion last night, said that the United States must let all the Far East know that it would not stand idly by while any part of the world remained under the rule of either Communist or Fascist dictatorship.</q>
Does the right hon. Gentleman approve of that? Are our arms to be engaged in a war against Communism as such? [HON. MEMBERS: "Answer &#x0021;"] Does the right hon. Gentleman agree with that statement? During a broadcast, Mr. Dulles has said that the United States must let all the Far East know that it would not stand idly by while any part of the world remained under the rule of either Communist or Fascist dictatorship. I think he put "Fascist" in as a make-weight. Does the right hon. Gentleman accept that as a definition of British Foreign policy?</p>

<p>In other words, there is no harmony there. Will the right hon. Gentleman now&#x2014;he has not told us in his speech&#x2014;indicate where the harmony arises? This is a serious matter. We are discussing here not merely the conduct of the right hon. Gentleman in the United States but, it may be, the end of what is described as bi-partisan foreign policy in this country, and we want to know where we stand. Apparently the right hon. Gentleman does not agree with that. I will go on. I am very glad that we


are getting together, even if the right hon. Gentleman is not getting together with the American Administration. This report goes on:
<q>American intervention"&#x2014;</q>
mark the words&#x2014;
<q>in the Korean conflict was a step in this direction"&#x2014;</q>
this is still Mr. Dulles speaking&#x2014;
<q>because it showed its determination to prevent the spread of Communism.</q>
So that, from the mouth of Mr. Foster Dulles, this is not a United Nations operation to contain an act of aggression, but an intervention by the United States over a long distance of time against Communism. Does the right hon. Gentleman accept that? Is this not a complete justification of the charge being made that behind the guise and fa&#x00E7;ade of the United Nations the Americans are waging an ideological war with weapons against the Soviet Union?<br/>
We must warn our American friends that not one British soldier, sailor or airman will risk his life behind a policy of that kind. In saying this I am speaking for myself and not for my party as a whole. However I believe that is the view of the overwhelming mass of the rank and file of every party in Great Britain. It would be a great mistake to leave American public opinion under any delusion about that.<br/>
Mr. Foster Dulles goes on:
<q>The United States should stir up all possible trouble and inconvenience for the Communist r&#x00E9;gime in China, and should take the raps off General Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist forces in Formosa in their effort to harass the Chinese Communists.</q>
I wonder whether Mr. Foster Dulles knows what he is talking about. Does he seriously understand the implications of those words? Why should the Chinese People's Government come to terms in Korea when they are now told explicitly, not merely implicitly, that the United States is actively promoting a resumption of civil war on the mainland of China? It is a terrible responsibility to take.<br/>
In the last debate we had on this matter the Foreign Secretary asked us to put ourselves in American shoes. Let us put ourselves in Chinese shoes for a change. Let us ask ourselves what we would do. Everybody here knows&#x2014;at least every miner, railwayman and

agricultural worker knows very well that if he were in China he would be a Communist peasant. He would not be a Chiang Kai-shek, he would be a Communist. Of course he would be. Anyone who had lived under the r&#x00E9;gime of Chiang Kai-shek would become a Communist. [An HON. MEMBER: "He would be forced to be one."] He would not be forced to be a Communist because everybody knows that when the People's Armies marched they occupied a country where the people received them willingly, while Chiang Kai-shek's forces were retreating in a partly hostile country&#x2014;I do not know what the right hon. Gentleman the Prime Minister sees to laugh at in that&#x2014;</p>

<p>The right hon. Gentleman now suffers from certain physical disabilities and he ought not to reinforce them by inattention. [HON. MEMBERS: "Withdraw."] We are now in great difficulty. On this side of the House we are afraid that the activities now going on in Korea are being slowly converted into a world-wide attack on Communism, and we believe that, if it is allowed to continue much further, it will mean the end of independence in British foreign policy and it may mean the end of civilisation.<br/>
Therefore I suggest to the right hon. Gentleman that he should say to the American Government in explicit terms that we repudiate the Foster Dulles document. However, the right hon. Gentleman had a sinister passage in his speech today in which he found it difficult to distinguish between what he called types of wars. In fact, he described what is happening in Korea as war. I asked, what was happening in Spain when Italian and German forces were there. Was it war? What did hon. Gentlemen opposite do about it? [HON. MEMBERS: "What did you do about it?"] What the party opposite did about it was to shelter themselves behind a hypocritical policy of non-intervention to help Mussolini and to help Franco and to help Hitler establish a Fascist r&#x00E9;gime in Spain.</p>

<p>The Chinese call their troops volunteers like the Italians and the Germans did. In fact, what we have been hoping to do by using the same language is to try to contain the fighting there. So far it has been contained. I believe it has been contained for reasons that I do not think are apparent to hon. and right hon. Gentlemen opposite. They, and the American administration in particular, have all along deceived themselves into thinking that this irredentism in the Far East and the Middle East is the result of a Kremlin plot. It is no such thing.<br/>
In so far as the Soviet Union still believes in power politics&#x2014;and heaven knows it is getting a lot of excuses just now&#x2014;it is true that the Soviet Union seeks to take local advantage of social disturbances. However it is also true to say that that irredentism is entirely indigenous. No one can suggest otherwise. If, in fact, the Soviet Union is so powerful and is so omniscient as to be able to stir up and manage and direct all these social forces all over the world, we ought to send a postcard to Stalin and give in. [An HON. MEMBER: "You would."] It is because the right hon.

<p>I submit to your Ruling, Sir, but will you do the House a favour? Will you tomorrow look at the speeches of the Prime Minister and myself and see whether mine is wider than his? The Prime Minister, throughout a considerable portion of his speech, twitted this party on trying to hide their policy behind a difference of description of the war going on in Korea at the present time.<br/>
We are saying, and I repeat this, that what is happening in the Far East and the Middle East is in consequence of all-pervasive poverty. It is the consequence of a revolution that will go on for the rest of this century and will not be contained by the military arms of the United States of America, Great Britain or Western Europe all together. That is why we think that a very great deal of energy, of material wealth, is being thrown away on fighting the wrong sort of war. The war that we want fought is a war against those despairing social conditions that give rise to war.<br/>
As a result of pouring out our treasure on a myth, on an assumption that all this is Russian military aggrandisement, Europe has been ruined. That is why I plead for more vigorous British leadership, because nothing that has happened in the last six months can give us any confidence in American diplomatic leadership at the present time.<br/>
France is being ruined. We are facing a financial crisis. [An HON. MEMBER: "No."] We are not? Then the party opposite should not steal the Health Service. We are facing a financial crisis. All Western Europe is facing grave economic difficulties, largely as a consequence of the fact that all the statesmen in America and Great Britain are becoming the victims of a mythology that they are meeting the Machiavellian plots of the Kremlin where, in most instances, they are meeting the natural rebellion of the ordinary human being against intolerable conditions.<br/>
Therefore, I suggest that what the people of Great Britain want to see is not how we can make more effective war


against the Chinese. What they want to know is what steps we are taking to make a peace, not how big a gulf we are digging between ourselves and the Soviet Union; and what far reaching plans we are making to pacify the world. It is because they do not believe that the Prime Minister is capable of seeing things in that light that they have no confidence in him in this matter. [HON. MEMBERS: "They sent him here."] If he went to the country tomorrow, he would be handsomely beaten. [<i>Interruption</i>.] That is why I suggest that the time has arrived to state the facts clearly to the Americans as we see them. Do not believe that this will cause so much difficulty as is suggested. Americans like to be told the truth, roughly&#x2014;they state it themselves.<br/>
Do not let us believe that behind the monolithic face of the Soviet Union there are no differences of opinion. That would be a very great mistake. Dictatorship has schisms, as well as democracies; the difference is that they are hidden from the public gaze. There must be inside Russia at present roughly two schools of thought&#x2014;</p>

<p>I remind the hon. Member that it is no more use abusing the Soviet Union than abusing the United States. If that is the point of view he adopts, he is not fit to occupy a public position.<br/>
This universal indictment of nations ought to be left behind in the adolescence of mankind. Behind this facade in Russia there must be two main contending streams of thought. There are the younger ones, the younger revolutionaries, who have come of age since the Revolution was consummated, who, probably, had illusions of imperial grandeur and might want to have an adventure. They are reinforced in their advice, in their propaganda, by the growing belief that the combinations of the Western World might take on aggressive intentions, because behind this language of Foster Dulles, behind what is being said in the Embassies of Europe, there is a good deal of chatter about bringing the thing to an issue, ending it all, and the Russians know this. Therefore, there must be in Russia advisers who say, "Let us take it on be-

fore they get stronger than they are now."<br/>
But, obviously, those advisers have lost, because there is another school in the Soviet Union. That school has always thought that it is not necessary to try to accomplish the world revolution by military methods, that they can always rely upon differences of opinion; and so far, their point of view has been in the ascendancy. We do not want any differences of opinion between us and the United States of America to encourage hopes of a military adventure anywhere, but we do not want such subservience to American opinion that convinces the Russians that there is no hope for them except through another blood bath.<br/>
We want no homogeneous policy on one side, and no homogenous policy on the other side. We want frank exchanges of opinion, hoping that mankind will still have the wisdom to find a better way out of its difficulties than another insane holocaust.</p>

<p>The right hon. Member for Ebbw Vale (Mr. Bevan) has made a speech, some of the points in which require an immediate statement and answer. I agree with him and perhaps he would agree with me, that the test which we should apply to our words, our actions and our Motions in the House is whether they are likely to contribute to world peace or otherwise.<br/>
I wish to put forward one or two points of view about the Motion which is before the House. I am not going to say anything about the personal motives which may have inspired it, because it is in the interests of the House and of the country, and of the world as a whole, that we should so far as possible damp down this sort of controversy. In seeking to put certain points of view before the Opposition today, I find myself very much in the same position as I was, time after time, during the United Nations meetings in Paris, in attempting to prevent matters reaching the extremities of controversy.<br/>
So far as criticism of my right hon. Friend's speech is concerned, there was one matter to which the leader of the Opposition in particular referred in his


speech on 5th February. The former Foreign Secretary gave expression to a similar view today, and to some extent it was implicit in what the right hon. Member for Ebbw Vale has just said. On 5th February, criticising the speech of the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition said:
<q>I cannot but think that in doing so he tended to represent us as an ally, even a comparatively minor ally, in an American war.</q>
That was the thought which was implicit in the speech to which we have just listened.
<q>It is significant that he only mentioned the United Nations once in the whole of that speech, and that was only very much in passing, mainly to emphasise the fact that physical action had been taken on the largest scale by the United States for a moral action by the United Nations."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 5th February, 1952; Vol. 495, c. 838.]</q>
That was the criticism, I thought an important criticism, which is well worth meeting.<br/>
But, of course, the Leader of the Opposition did not in fact read to the House or pay just attention to what my right hon. Friend had said because, after the reference which I have just given, after the statement about Formosa and after welcoming the patience of the negotiators in the armistice negotiations and after the passage referred to by the right hon. Gentleman about increasing harmony, my right hon. Friend spoke of the sympathy in British hearts for the Americans who had given their lives and went on to say:
<q>Whatever course events in Korea may take in the near future I am sure that our soldiers and your soldiers have not made their sacrifices in vain. The cause of world law has found strong and invaluable defence and the foundations of the world instrument for preserving peace, justice and freedom among the nations have been deepened and strengthened. They stand now not on paper, but on rock.</q>
I maintain that it was a totally unfair criticism of the Prime Minister's speech just to mention that passing reference to the United Nations withou quoting the passage, to which I have referred, making it clear that the context of these operations was in regard to the strengthening of the world instrument for preserving peace, justice and freedom. I do not think there is a single person in this House at present who, having heard the

speech of the Foreign Secretary on 5th February, and the speech of the Prime Minister today, now believes there are any additional commitments of any sort entered into. There has been the most explicit undertaking given in regard to that by both my right hon. Friends.</p>

<p>The next suggestion&#x2014;and here I come to one of the points made by the right hon. Member for Ebbw Vale&#x2014;was that by his speech my right hon. Friend was helping dangerous elements in the United States of America. I do not think there can be a better answer to that&#x2014;and I apologise for another quotation&#x2014;than from the leading article in the "Manchester Guardian" of yesterday, which is headed, "Who Helps Taft?"
<q>Who is doing most to help them: Mr. Churchill and his Cabinet or Mr. Attlee and some of his party?&#x2026;the Labour Party itself seems to be doing more in Senator Taft's case than Mr. Churchill has ever done. How does Mr. Attlee suppose that the Opposition motion will be read in the United States? Its finer point&#x2014;that the House, although approving the Foreign Secretary's statement of policy, regrets the Prime Minister's failure to give expression to that policy&#x2014;will be lost. (That is in any case a formula to hide differences among Labour Members.)</q>
<q>It will look to many people in America like a plain statement that Labour will not go along with the United States in any effective action against China if a truce is broken. It is enough to make Senator Taft whoop with joy. It is exactly what he has been saying: that America cannot count on anybody. And the more Americans of all persuasions come to believe Britain cannot be relied on, whatever the Chinese do, the less they will be willing to listen to our views.</q>
<q>The trouble with the Opposition motion and with Labour's action in forcing it forward again is that it emphasises disunity.</q></p>

<p>I meant neither of those things, but I will endeavour to unfold my arguments. One of the troubles is that there is some difficulty in unfolding a continuous argument because of the great deal of assistance that is given. I will come back to that point because I wish to do so, but I wish first to deal with the latter part of the speech of the right hon. Gentleman. I think his argument is fairly put in these terms: that re-armament on its present scale is not the right answer to Communism.</p>

<p>The right hon. Gentleman is so good as to nod his head to show that I am not putting it unfairly. I think the attitude of Her Majesty's Government should be made quite clear on this point. We certainly do not agree and do not maintain that it is the only answer, but, in our view it is the first essential answer because, unless the independence and security of the free nations can first be assured, it is foolish to talk of economic aid to under-developed countries. The one is a condition precedent without which the other is impossible.<br/>
This argument is used often&#x2014;and it is one of the reasons why I sought to intervene at this moment&#x2014;as though we were not giving any help or making any attempt to give help to under-developed countries in the world. In a supplementary question yesterday there was a reference to one of our contributions as "a paltry contribution." I think I shall have the support of right hon. Gentlemen opposite because I think the record of assistance we have given other countries in the past six years really entitles us to a very great deal of credit.<br/>
One thinks of the assistance given in South and South-East Asia; the releases from sterling balances of something like &#x00A3;400 million from the end of the war to June, 1949; &#x00A3;172 million from June, 1949 to June, 1951; the Colombo Plan, which envisages something like &#x00A3;300 million&#x2014;these are figures of releases from sterling balances and also of gifts and loans. As

far as our colonial territories are concerned there is the &#x00A3;140 million under the Colonial Development and Welfare Act; the loans raised in the United Kingdom in this year alone, 1951, of &#x00A3;23 million; the &#x00A3;110 million of the Colonial Development Corporation's capital and the very large sums financed out of the resources of the colonies themselves.<br/>
In the Middle East there is the help given to Palestinian refugees; specific matters like locust control; and help in Jordan, Libya and Eritrea. Then there are the various international agencies and sums of money devoted to those for this current year amount to nearly &#x00A3;3 million.<br/>
These have all been referred to by right hon. Gentlemen opposite and when it is put forward again and again that our only attempt is to deal with the matter on the basis of re-armament, that is not fair to the sacrifices the British people have made in the last six years in order to give assistance to these under-developed territories. In these matters I say straight away that right hon. Gentlemen opposite are entitled to a great deal of credit.</p>

<p>The previous figure was for 18 months, so the figure is 10 per cent. The grant of &#x00A3;760,000 was for 18 months and the figure of &#x00A3;450,000 is for 12 months only. On a <i>pro rata</i> basis, if the same rate had been maintained it would be &#x00A3;500,000 and it has been reduced to &#x00A3;450,000. I think we all regret the necessity for having to make the reduction.</p>

<p>One of the reasons which caused us to make a reduction was the fact that of previous contributions only 10 per cent. had been spent by the end of September. In that circumstance, this new figure has not damaged or affected contributions made by other countries. Considering all the other difficulties, and the fact that we have increased our help in certain other respects, and having regard to the overall picture I do not think we have anything about which to be ashamed with regard to this help to underdeveloped territories.<br/>
The main point for consideration by public opinion throughout the world is that we are not seeking to say that rearmament is the only answer to Communism. The last Government, and this Government, the two parties together, are in agreement and are taking very substantial measures, considering our financial circumstances, to give assistance to under-developed countries throughout the whole world, and we shall certainly continue to do everything we can within our means. But unless we are strong enough to defend ourselves all this really would be money wasted.<br/>
After all, when people blame us for this re-armament programme it should be remembered that it is not our fault; that it is not so much a question of a conflict of ideologies, but because the Soviet Union has driven its frontiers further westward. In particular, we remember the fate of Czechoslovakia, and in view of a threat like that to the free countries, one by one, it seems to me impossible for any responsible body of opinion in this country not to support the re-armament of this country, in concert with its Allies, as the first essential defence against the Soviet Union.</p>

<p>I take it that the right hon. and learned Gentleman is indicating that there is no difference with the opinion expressed by the right hon. Member for Ebbw Vale (Mr. Bevan) against re-armament, but that he is actually in agreement with the view expressed by the right hon.

<p>I think that on all these matters of foreign affairs, it is exceedingly important to get the greatest possible measure of unity on both sides of the House. The hon.

<p>In this controversy, as in others, the right hon. and learned Gentleman is identifying the term "re-armament" with the re-armament programme. They are not necessarily the same things at all. As a matter of fact our contention is that the re-armament programme which is being effected has now left us weaker than if it had been smaller.</p>

<p>I was dealing with what I might call the ideological point: that it was suggested that we believe that rearmament, whether the re-armament programme or anything else, is the only answer to Communism. I think it necessary to put on record at the earliest possible moment that that is not our view; but we do believe that it is the first essential in facing Communism. The other matter which again I think arises out of the speech of the right hon. Gentleman&#x2014;</p>

<p>Would the right hon. and learned Gentleman bear in mind that one of the reasons why my hon. Friends and, indeed, why thousands of people up and down the country believe that the Government bases its opposition to Communism solely in re-armament is because of the record of the Prime Minister in the wars of intervention against the Soviet Union in 1918, 1919 and 1920?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1952-02-26a.1000.4" hansard_membership_id="7902" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/30317" speakername="Mr. Lloyd" colnum="1000" time="">
<p>The hon. Gentleman may believe that, but I do not think that more than an infinitesimal fraction of the people of this country share that view.<br/>
The other matter which, as I say, I think should receive a great deal more publicity than it has received at present is the question of a preventive war. I may be doing the right hon. Gentleman an injustice, but I think I detected in his speech the idea that we in some way favoured, or at all events were supporting people who favoured, the idea of a preventive war against Communism. There has been a great deal of criticism of the


speech of the Prime Minister and I think it right we should draw attention to the passage towards the end of the speech where he made it clear that we
<q>seek or covet no one's territory. We plan no forestalling war.</q>
That should be taken in conjunction with what the American Secretary of State said on, I think, 21st February:
<q>People of my country and the peoples of the other countries of the Atlantic community do not cherish military strength for its own sake.&#x2026;We seek to build forces adequate to deter aggression or to meet it. We do not seek to create greater strength than we need for this purpose; we do not desire military forces great enough to launch a preventive war. We desire peace and the aim of all the efforts we have undertaken&#x2026;is solely to ensure that we shall live in peace.</q>
When we are hearing a great deal of unfavourable things about what certain American people have said, I think it only fair to give great prominence to that clear statement, which is precisely what the Prime Minister said in his speech to Congress. I submit, taking these arguments one by one, that there are no grounds at all, to use one of the right hon. Gentleman's own phrases, for this miasma of suspicion and misrepresentation about what has been said.<br/>
There is another aspect of this Motion and I would urge this point of view on hon. Members opposite, because I hope it is not too late for them to have second thoughts about this matter. What will be the impression upon the world of this Motion, and the voting against the Government upon it? It will be said that the Opposition have voted against the Government on foreign policy and that this is the end of bi-partisan foreign policy. It is no good hon. Members opposite failing to appreciate that fact.<br/>
I would remind them of the example of the Second Reading of the National Health Bill, in 1948. The Conservative Party made it quite clear on that occasion that they were not voting against the principles of the Bill, but they were voting on a reasoned Amendment which clearly set out our view. Ever since then the Labour Party has maintained that we voted against the principles of the Bill. They have said it again and again, and I expect that they succeeded in convincing a good many people of it.<br/>
It is exactly the same with regard to this Motion, although there is this rather

clever form of words seeking not to make it a Vote of Censure on the foreign policy of the Government, but only on the Prime Minister. It will be read, in fact, as showing disunity between the major parties on this matter and disunity between the United States and a large section of our people; and I suggest that that will be a lamentable conclusion.<br/>
The right hon. Member for Lewisham, South (Mr. H. Morrison), the former Foreign Secretary, talked today about playing the Communist game. The people who will delight in what is taking place in this House today, if this Motion is pressed to a Division, will be Mr. Vyshinsky and his colleagues, with whom I have been endeavouring to deal during the past three months. During the whole of the last Session of the United Nations they spent their time attempting to split the United States and the United Kingdom apart, to shake our confidence in one another and to shake the will of the free world to resist. I said that to them at the time and it was perfectly obvious that that was their endeavour.<br/>
I believe the greater majority of hon. Members in the House are in favour of maintaining our freedom. We may differ about the method, but I believe that by far the larger number of hon. Members wish to see this country and other free countries united in their defence of freedom. It is all very well to think of this as an academic or theoretical discussion, but it is not, because we have seen the frontiers of Soviet Communism gradually expanding to the west, and many a time right hon. Gentlemen on the Front Bench opposite have testified to the degree of that menace and to the necessity for our being strong enough to defend ourselves against it.<br/>
Some hon. Members, in point of fact, have said that in their view the threat of war had come very much nearer in the past three months, but the right hon. Member for Ipswich (Mr. Stokes) said the other day, in South Africa:
<q>I believe that the immediate danger of war has passed</q>
I do not agree with either of those statements. I think that, as we gather our strength in this country, so the threat of war will diminish, but to say that the immediate danger is past is to make by far a too optimistic statement of the case.<br/>
I should have thought that we in this House should be concentrating all our efforts upon increasing the common ground between the parties and the common ground between ourselves and the United States with regard to tackling this danger to the free world. First of all, we should build up together our defensive strength, both military and economic, and we are agreed upon that. We should sustain the rule of law, and again we are agreed on that. We should strengthen the authority of the world instrument to preserve peace, justice and freedom. We should help, to the utmost of our capacity, economically and technically, those people whose standards must be raised, and we must do all that, not in a spirit of patronising superiority, but as partners.<br/>
These are the objectives which are in common between most hon. Members opposite and those on this side of the House. I believe that they are the common objectives between the United States of America, or by far the larger proportion of its citizens, and by far the larger proportion of our citizens, and that the Prime Minister's speech to Congress, to quote again the words of the "Manchester Guardian"
<q>&#x2026;revived the sense of partnership between the two Governments.</q>
I think it was a substantial contribution towards the attainment of the objectives to which I have just referred.<br/>
I say again, in all seriousness that I think one is perfectly entitled to debate these matters. I think the right hon. Gentleman made a most interesting contribution, developing a point of view which most certainly had to be debated and answered. I do, however, ask hon. Members and those responsible for this Motion to think twice about registering a Division in the House today, from which the world will certainly draw the inference that the general agreement between the two parties in this country on foreign policy has ended. If that, happens, it will certainly endanger the cause of peace, and any censure to come will rest not upon my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister but upon those who support the Motion in the Division Lobby tonight.</p>

<p>I hope that the House will bear with me

for a few moments while I enter into this debate and make my maiden speech.<br/>
As an Irishman, I feel that the foreign policy of any Government should be aimed to achieve one objective&#x2014;world peace. I think everybody agrees on that, but, in order to achieve that objective, we have to recognise one basic principle, and that is the right of free and equal partnership for all the nations of the world. To quote President Truman when he spoke at San Francisco on 4th September, 1951:
<q>The peoples of our country want, and are determined to have, a world at peace, where there is justice and freedom for all nations.</q>
In this respect, I believe that this Government, and, indeed, past British Governments, have a wrong conception of nationalism. According to the policy of this Government, it would seem that nationalism, as applied to some countries, is a very great virtue, but, in other countries, it would seem to be regarded as a very great vice. That is not true of the world today, because we have reached a stage in our civilisation when every country can manage its own affairs, without being a menace to its neighbours or a danger to world peace.<br/>
As an Irishman and an Ulsterman, I took a special interest in the Prime Minister's visit to America. The right hon. Gentleman had a wonderful opportunity, as a professed democrat, to enlist world opinion over there for international peace, but I am afraid that it is just another case of having missed the bus.<br/>
During that visit, the Prime Minister made two statements with regard to Ireland. In one, he is quoted as saying that Britain will never consent to a plebiscite in Ireland, and in the other he says that Britain will never desert Northern Ireland. To the Irish people, these statements constitute a threat, they are wholly inconsistent with democracy and have only succeeded in estranging the whole Irish race, both the Irish people in Ireland, in America and all over the world.<br/>
The Prime Minister should have been well aware of the wishes of the Irish people, because in 1918, which was the last opportunity which the Irish people had of voting as a whole, over 80 per cent. of them voted for a free Ireland, and that position holds good today. I feel that, in this matter, I am merely pushing an open door, because both the


Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition have made specific statements in this respect. The Prime Minister himself said, in 1948:
<q>The will of the people, expressed in conditions of freedom and universal franchise, must prevail. That is our root principle.</q>
The Leader of the Opposition said, in 1947:
<q>We are seeking, not to enforce our views on other people, but to try to see to it that every nation and every country and people are freely able to choose their own form of Government.</q>
What has occurred to cause these two right hon. Gentlemen to change their views? Why did they insist on maintaining a minority rule in Northern Ireland by force and at a time when the country could be of immense value, not only to this country alone, but to the whole western world? The days of minority rule went out with Lord Salisbury, and we hope they will never return, unless the Prime Minister envisages a dictatorship. We hope not. The will of the people must prevail in every country everywhere, and the sooner this Government realises that fact the better it will be for everybody, for Britain and the whole world.<br/>
I should like, on behalf of my colleague and myself, to state that we do not desire to take any part in the domestic affairs of this country. Neither do we desire to be affiliated with any party here, but, to show our detestation of the policy of the present Government in having failed absolutely to make any approach towards a just solution of the Irish problem, we shall vote against the Government tonight.<br/>
We seek the co-operation of all parties in our effort to achieve Irish unity. That is our sole objective here&#x2014;to achieve the unity of Ireland&#x2014;and I say to hon. Members of all parties: the friendship of the Irish people is worth having you can have it for the asking. It only requires one simple operation&#x2014;take your troops out of the Six Counties and leave Ireland for the Irish.</p>

<p>I said "peaceful penetration." But perhaps this is a beginning. Having said that, I should like to try to get the debate back to the Motion which, in one way and another, seems to have been rather neglected this evening.<br/>
I think few people would dispute that one of the most important features of British foreign policy since the war has been the measure of agreement which has existed between Government and Opposition on most of the main issues. Whatever the exact wording of the Motion that was finally tabled by the Opposition, the important thing about today's debate is that it marks a break in this limited but nevertheless valuable co-operation between the two great parties in the State, and I should like to spend a few moments examining how that break came about and what its effects are likely to be.<br/>
During the late Government's period of office, many of us on this side of the House showed ourselves at different times highly critical of their conduct of foreign affairs, but what we criticised was not so much the underlying principles of their foreign policy as its timing and the methods by which its exponents sought to carry it out. Once the leaders of the party opposite had got over their lingering, sentimental affection for Russia, once they had belatedly grasped the imminence of the danger threatening this country, once they had realised&#x2014;again belatedly&#x2014;the need to re-arm and to strengthen the bonds which united us with our allies&#x2014;once, in short, they had realised the need for collective security&#x2014;then they were able to count on our support and to count on it with far greater certainty than on the support of many Members of their own party.<br/>
I think that no one on this side of the House would deny the great services rendered by Ernest Bevin to the cause of world peace&#x2014;services for which he was bitterly attacked by Members of his own party. Similarly, I do not think that any of my hon. Friends would deny the


fundamental wisdom of the re-armament programme initiated by the present Leader of the Opposition&#x2014;once more to the accompaniment of persistent sniping from behind.<br/>
Again we on these benches gave the right hon. Gentleman our wholehearted support when he took the courageous step of committing this country to war in Korea in defence of the principle of collective security, when later he authorised General MacArthur to cross the 38th Parallel, and finally when he joined the United States in branding the Chinese Government as aggressors. We now know that he went even further. On every one of these occasions, the then Prime Minister and his Government were able to count on the loyal support and co-operation of His Majesty's Opposition.<br/>
That is what happened when a Labour Government was in power and when we were in Opposition. What happens now when the conduct of foreign affairs is in Conservative hands? What line do the Labour Party take now? Sabotage from the very beginning; at the Election the warmonger scare, the then Foreign Secretary, broadcasting to millions all over the world, doing his level best to queer the pitch for his successor; and now a China scare, just as harmful, just as artificial, and created from just the same motives.</p>

<p>I would rather have red meat than the Red Flag, which most hon. Members opposite seem to prefer.<br/>
To return to the China scare. To give him his due, the Leader of the Opposition has not gone as far as some of his more enthusiastic back benchers would have liked. It is true that he stopped short of putting down a Motion censuring what is virtually his own foreign policy. But, as is so often true of half measures, he has gone quite far enough to make himself look perfectly ridiculous. And, what is much more important, he has for purely party reasons jeopardised the whole principle of national unity where matters of vital importance are at stake.<br/>
I said "for purely party reasons," but it is not even that. The Motion that is before the House&#x2014;this hybrid Motion which has been cooked up and tabled&#x2014;is the direct result of the various stresses and strains that exist inside the Labour Party. It is a sop to the yapping Cerberus who sits for Ebbw Vale. It is intended to appease the hon. Member for Nelson and Colne (Mr. S. Silverman), who admits quite frankly that, wherever anybody else might stand, he himself stands on the side of the Communists.<br/>
If we lived in more peaceful times, if the issues involved were less vital, a shabby political expedient of this kind would, at a pinch, be understandable, even excusable; but we do not live in peaceful times and the issues involved affect the survival not only of this country but of the whole of Western civilisation. And I must say that, in the circumstances, I find it incredible that a patriotic man like the present leader of the Opposition should lend himself to such low-down manoeuvres.<br/>
The situation in the Far East is, after all, clear enough. In Korea, we have a case of flagrant aggression committed by the North Koreans, aided and abetted by the Chinese and the Russians. We have allied soldiers being killed and wounded


by the Communists. We have allied prisoners of war being shot by them in cold blood. And yet there is an important section of the Labour Party who seek to condone this aggression and who try to confuse the issue by making out that the Americans are the aggressors and the Chinese are the aggrieved party.<br/>
Even the former Foreign Secretary talks about the danger of provoking the Chinese by imputing to them unworthy motives. It never occurs to him for a moment to think whether the Chinese have not provoked us. Hon. Gentlemen opposite try to ignore the plain, inescapable fact that for over a year the Chinese have been killing our lads in Korea. They raise their hands in horror at the idea of any retaliatory measures against China.</p>

<p>In fact, they advocate a policy of total appeasement towards the so-called People's Democratic Republic of China, which shows its popular nature and its democratic character by massacring hundreds of thousands of its unfortunate citizens in the best totalitarian style. The right hon. Member for Ebbw Vale (Mr. Bevan) said that any railwayman, any agricultural worker, if he were in China would be a Communist. What about all these hundreds of Chinese who are massacred? What about them? Were they all wicked capitalists and Fascists? There were an awful lot of them if they were.<br/>
And it is to pacify this lunatic fringe, to appease these arch-appeasers that the Leader of the Opposition has tabled a Motion of censure on the Prime Minister. Just what has my right hon. Friend done to merit this personal attack? There is his speech to Congress, first of all. By it, by promising "prompt, resolute and effective action" in case of any further Chinese aggression he did two things. First of all, he dashed Russian and Chinese hopes of a breach between Great Britain and America&#x2014;hopes which had risen very high under the last Administration. Secondly, he gave Stalin and Mao Tse Tung a clear warning of the consequences of any further attempts to extend their Asiatic Empire.<br/>
Personally, I can think of no greater, no more effective contribution to the cause of world peace. I think all parties in the House are agreed in not wanting to see an extension of the war in the Far East if it can possibly be avoided. I believe all parties are equally anxious to see a cessation of hostilities there. What some hon. Members tend to forget is that whether or not the war in the Far East is continued or extended does not depend exclusively on the Western Powers. It also depends on Stalin and Mao Tse Tung.<br/>
At the present time, the enemy are reinforcing in a big way in Korea. If, as seems very possible, fighting flares up there again, are we simply to abandon everything we have fought for? If the Chinese, as they may well do, invade Indo-China or Burma, if they attack Hong Kong, are we still to do nothing? Are we still to stop our aircraft from operating across the Chinese border? No; quite clearly we should have to strike back and, that being so, it is far better that everybody concerned should know the position in advance. Prevention is far better than cure.<br/>
What we have to do is to deter the Chinese from starting anything in the first place. That we can best do by demonstrating the unshakable strength of our alliance with America and by ensuring that the Chinese understand what will happen to them if they do attack. That is exactly what the Prime Minister has done by his speeches here and in America. As he himself said,
<q>We have secured a better chance of reaching an agreement [with the Communists in Korea] by making it plain that the United States and Britain are working together in true comradeship and, that in the event of a treacherous renewal of war, would together take prompt, resolute and effective action.</q>
It is for doing that, that he is now being subjected to this attack.<br/>
What have hon. and right hon. Members opposite done? They have done something quite different. They have done their best to give an impression of disunity&#x2014;of British disunity and of Anglo-American disunity&#x2014;by their silly yammering, they have strengthened the hand of Mr. Taft, about whom they say they are so worried, and of the other isolationists in the United States. And they have encouraged the Chinese to believe


that they can continue their career of aggression with impunity. In other words, they have, by their conduct, not diminished but increased the risk of war.<br/>
I say that if there is to be a vote of censure, it should be on hon. Members opposite and on their leaders.</p>

<p>Before I comment on some of the points made by the hon. Member for Lancaster (Mr. F. Maclean), with many of which I agree, I want to say a word or two about the speech of the right hon. Member for Ebbw Vale (Mr. Bevan). I agreed in some considerable measure with the latter part of his speech. I think, however, that the implications of many of the views which he put forward are not fully understood, and particularly, perhaps, not entirely understood by his own followers.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman stressed, for instance, the need to increase the happiness, the welfare and the standards of living of the poorer people throughout the world. I entirely agree, and I was very glad to hear what is being done by the Government, as explained by the Minister of State. But in the long run, the standards of living and the welfare of those people will be increased by allowing them to make more use of the raw materials which their countries provide and by allowing them to make manufactured goods. We should not deceive ourselves. It means that we shall not be able to obtain those raw materials and food to the extent which we should like and that we shall face more competition from those countries with our own industries.<br/>
What I think should be put fairly before the working people as well as the better-off people of this country is this: if we are sincere in our desires to raise the standards of living of millions of people throughout the world, it is not just a question of a few Colombo Plans and a few million pounds handed out for this or that purpose. It is a question of facing the fact that at the moment we are a better-off nation and we must forgo some advantages and face some considerable inconvenience and competition if the standards of these people are to be raised.<br/>
Secondly, we cannot afford to leave a vacuum in these countries. The concept of Empire is now perhaps rightly suspect, but our obligations are not over when we give self-government to a country. We have an obligation towards them for their education and economic development, and I sometimes wonder if we have not gone too far back from the ideals expressed by Mr. Kipling.<br/>
Is there not a very great need today for the young men of this country to go out to the Far East and to Africa to take service not necessarily with our Government but with the United Nations and the Governments of those countries themselves and to fill that vacuum which must exist if one hands over a country like Burma or the Dutch East Indies to their own people, who have no experience in the conduct of affairs?<br/>
The right hon. Member for Ebbw Vale referred to the very serious state of Europe and I agree with, though not in laying the blame largely at the door of the United States. If the Government are to be censured at all in this debate they are very much open to criticism for some of their European decisions. Apart from the military value to the European Army, there would have been a great psychological value if they have pledged a contingent of British troops to serve in Europe for a definite and prolonged time. By so doing we should strengthen the hands of democratic forces in France and the hands of Dr. Adenauer, and would encourage the people throughout Europe who are trying to build up unity and self-respect among European nations.<br/>
Whatever the dangers&#x2014;and I agree there are great dangers in re-arming Germany and I should not like to see a German General Staff revived&#x2014;do not let us make the mistake of failing to support moderate elements in Germany when they are in power, and thus run the risk of the rise of immoderate elements later.<br/>
The right hon. Member for Ebbw Vale also referred to speeches by Mr. Foster Dulles and the effect that it might have had inside the Soviet Union. They might have some effect there, but to my mind far more serious is the effect of these speeches in the free countries themselves. Communism does not exist only behind the Iron Curtain. It is the alternative throughout the free countries of the world


and has a great following in Europe and the Far East. The danger of these speeches is not that they will influence Russian policy, which is determined by other and long-term objectives: it is the effect they may have in weakening confidence within the free world.<br/>
In the early part of the speech of the right hon. Member for Ebbw Vale I must confess that there seemed to me some whistling to keep up confidence. Now we know that we were committed by the late Government to drastic action within Chinese territory whether the truce was broken or not. The right hon. Gentleman indicated that what the Prime Minister told us might be inaccurate, but we had it confirmed by the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Lewisham. South (Mr. H. Morrison). Whatever papers are laid or not laid before the House, the late Government committed themselves to retaliatory action outside Korea in the event of certain things taking place. The right hon. Member for Ebbw Vale spoke of Lord North. I should have thought that that was an example of secret diplomacy which might well have been undertaken by Lord North.<br/>
Whether papers are laid on the Table or not is secondary. Whatever anxiety there is about that, it is nothing to the anxiety of the people of this country when they read the statement, not by the Prime Minister, but by the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Lewisham, South. I am entirely with him in his dislike of ideological war, but I must confess that ideology in foreign affairs is much more often brought in from the extreme Left than the Right.<br/>
I was rather surprised to hear the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Lewisham, South, in moving this Motion attacking the Conservative Party for being warmongers. In the Conservative Party, as in other parties, there are many shades of opinion. Far be it for me to demand unity in a party. But in recent history many of us think this country was brought to war not by the warmongering of the Conservative Party but by their ostrich-like and pathetic belief in the pacific intention of the dictators.<br/>
As for imperialism, the Conservative Party were the party who gave us the India Bill and gave up the Irish bases. Certainly, these were not examples of im-

perialism, and there is certainly something in the continual whipping they have received from Lord Beaverbrook for their very lack of interest in the Commonwealth and in imperialist ideals.<br/>
I regret this Motion because I think it will have the very opposite effect to that desired by the Labour Party. The aims of foreign policy today, as in the time of the late Government&#x2014;and as they should be&#x2014;are that we should be strong enough to deter aggression on one hand and that we should be able to build up the welfare of the free nations on the other. But in both these jobs, and not only in the job of defence, we must have whole-hearted co-operation between the Commonwealth and the United States.<br/>
I would impress upon people who attach the greatest importance to building up the standard of life in the Far East that this is impossible without a large influx of American capital. I should like to say to the Americans that they must shake out of themselves their prejudice against Commonwealths like the British Commonwealth. Imperialist they may have been, but they now play a useful part in holding together and building up the welfare of the world as a whole and we desire the United States to co-operate with us throughout our Commonwealth as well as outside it.<br/>
It would be disastrous if anything were to be done which would seriously weaken that co-operation. Furthermore, it would be disastrous if by this Motion we gave the impression that we were going to pull back in any way in the Far East. I am not one of those people who think that there is a very pressing danger of a major war in Europe, but I think there is a danger of a series of Korean attacks throughout the Middle and Far East.<br/>
I should like to spend a little time in commenting upon the much quoted speech of General Bradley. I must say I am surprised at the agreement it provoked. He said that war in China would be a war against the wrong nation at the wrong time, and so on. Undoubtedly, the habit of conducting our diplomacy by public speech is one of the most serious handicaps from which we suffer. Let us think of the effect this speech would have had on us if it had been made by a Russian. We would have said that it implied a Russian intention to prosecute


the right war at the right time against the right nation, and we would be much inclined to rejoice if they found themselves pinned down in a place in which, obviously, they did not want to fight.</p>

<p>As I shall say if I am lucky enough to be called, this excellent phrase was initiated not by General Bradley but by myself some four months earlier in the United States. Therefore, I feel I can speak on this subject with some authority and I assure the hon. Member that if he had been in the United States at that time, speaking on this subject against General MacArthur, he would have found that the phrase was an extremely powerful one and helped the cause of limiting the war.</p>

<p>I daresay it had an excellent effect in America, but what I am doubtful about is its effect in Russia. After all, we have no reason to suppose that speeches made in America will be reported only in that country. After all, we should not be having this debate here tonight if they were.<br/>
I hope that the approval shown to this phrase does not mean we are in any way lessening our determination to maintain our interest in the Far East. It seems to me that at any rate one set of opinions behind the sort of remarks made by Mr. Taft and others is the feeling of many Americans that, if Chiang Kai-shek is willing to have a go at the mainland of China, why not try to fight the war with his men instead of American boys?<br/>
I do not believe we should necessarily assume that it shows on the part of Americans a desire to fight a bigger war themselves. I am certain that behind it is partly the desire to get someone else to take part of the responsibility of a war in China, and that, if Chiang Kai-shek is willing to do so, let him try. I believe that that is a very dangerous state of mind, but I do not think we are going to abate that state of mind by showing any signs of pulling back in the Far East.<br/>
Incidentally, I should like some further enlightenment as to what now are the permanent arrangements for discussing political matters between the members of the United Nations concerning the Far East and whether the method by which decisions are reached concerning political

and military matters has been altered and improved.<br/>
The second reason why we should not lessen our influence in that area is that it is of immense importance to the Commonwealth. Canada, Australia and New Zealand are very intimately concerned with what happens in the North Pacific. The third reason is that I believe that peace is still indivisible. That, I think, is a Russian phrase. If we are to ask the Americans and other nations to assist us in Europe it is up to us to play our part in areas that seem far away from us today, but which are of the greatest importance to our Commonwealth. To my mind, just because we have a different approach to the Far East from that of the United States, we should be prepared to play, if anything, a rather greater part, and not put too much stress on keeping our powder dry for a hypothetical war in Europe which may never break out.<br/>
Peace and prosperity throughout the Pacific area are very much a British interest, and it must rest in the first place on a feeling of security. I think that we ought to be very careful to define what are our interests, and not only our interests but those of the free world. I think we should make it very clear that we are bound to resist any attack not only on those places for which we are responsible but on Burma, on French Indo-China, and on any of the free countries in that area. But the destruction or even the permanent enfeeblement of China is not a British interest, and is not an interest of the free world; and I am very glad to hear that point of view, as I understand it, re-affirmed by the Government.<br/>
Mr. Kennan's book has pointed out that the tendency of democracies, once they begin to engage in war, is to attach great moral indignation to their fighting. That makes it very difficult for a democracy to take on a war of limited objectives. It makes it, I think, very difficult for a democracy to say that there can be any benefit in not completely crushing its enemy. But I think Mr. Kennan is right in saying that, probably, if we were to have history over again, we would treat Germany more fairly than even we did after the 1914&#x2013;18 war. I think that certainly, in the instance of Korea, and probably other similar wars carried out in the Far East, they must


inevitably be wars with limited objectives, and, therefore, we should if possible keep out of them moral and ideological overtones.<br/>
Though I hold no brief at all for Communist China, I believe that the only hope for the Chinese is in a gradual change within their own country, and I am sure it would be not an advantage but a very heavy disadvantage for the free world if they were faced not only with an attack on that country but with a totally disrupted China, a China completely defeated by atomic warfare or turned into a state of complete internal chaos.<br/>
By all means let us stand up and defend our legitimate interests in the Far East, but let us not become either permanently embroiled in China or seduced into thinking that it is a British interest completely to smash up the existing fabric in the Far East&#x2014;in China or Japan&#x2014;until at least we have something, which we have not at the moment, to put in its place.</p>

<p>The Government, by drawing a limited commitment by the previous Government&#x2014;by drawing this red herring&#x2014;across the trail, have attempted to divert the House from the real problem we have to face, namely, the problem set for Britain and for world peace by the trend in opinion in certain sections of the United States towards spreading the war in China.<br/>
What is said by Mr. Foster Dulles and what is being defended by the Prime Minister tonight is something quite different from the specific, limited commitment in certain eventualities which had been given by the previous Government. This commitment was given subject to consultation and was directly connected with military operations already going on in Korea.<br/>
But the real problem is this trend in United States opinion, and it presents a problem which no reasonable person surely can deny. We cannot just dismiss statements such as those read out and made by Mr. Foster Dulles. Those opinions are not shared by the United States Administration. They, I am sure, would not claim Mr. Foster Dulles as one of their members.</p>

<p>I know the argument on that point, and I cannot give way; but it is important opinion.<br/>

<p>No, again, the hon. and gallant Member is mistaken in the opposite direction.<br/>
It is quite impossible to regard Mr. Foster Dulles simply as a private individual, for various reasons. He holds a position of responsibility in the United States of America. Equally, however, it is wrong to consider him a member of the United States Administration, and I think it is unfair to the United States Administration not to point out that the most vigorous and effective critics of the views of Mr. Foster Dulles have often come from within the Administration itself.<br/>
The point tonight is: Have the Government shown any signs at all that they recognise that this problem exists? What measures have they taken or are they proposing to lessen the influence of these people? Do they understand that the Prime Minister, in his visit to the United States, did, in fact, whatever his intention, give aid and comfort to those who hold these views?<br/>
Nothing that the Prime Minister has said&#x2014;and he laid false trails in his speech &#x2014;gives us any reassurance on these points. It is the judgment, I think, in many quarters of the House and in public opinion, that we should go all out for an armistice in Korea, and that it would be neither wise nor morally justified to spread the war there; that such action would not shorten the war but prolong it, and, perhaps prolong it almost indefinitely; that it would cost more lives, British, American, Chinese and Korean, and that it would destroy the West's political influence in Asia. It would also be strategically foolish.<br/>
On the subject of the strategy, may I for the record make one point clear. I


have here a news cutting dated 12th January, 1951, from the "Louisville Courier," which quotes me as stating, during a speaking tour in U.S.A.:
<q>We, the British, are not prepared to play into Russia's hands by committing more of our limited military resources against China; tying up in the wrong places at the wrong time against the wrong country.</q>
Naturally, I was most satisfied that within four months this phrase which I had used should be picked up by General Bradley. I was even more gratified when the idea penetrated the understanding of even the Prime Minister, and was commended to my hon. Friends and myself most warmly in a recent statement in the House.<br/>
Though it may seem churlish, let me make this point to the Prime Minister. He would do much better explaining the British point of view to the Americans than learning the British point of view from an American source in order to lecture us about it in this House, especially when the lecture originates from ourselves. I would also like to make this point. My speeches there, like those of many Members of the House, were made under the auspices of the British Information Services.<br/>
It seems to me a supreme folly, at a time when it was never more necessary to explain the British point of view in the United States, that among their foolish cuts the Government should include cutting of B.I.S. Every time the Prime Minister goes to America the British Information Services becomes more necessary to explain the muddles and clear up the mess, and I say that, not only in going to America and making ill-advised speeches but in cutting the British Information Services as well he seems to be over doing it altogether. There really is a problem in the growing trend of opinion in certain quarters of the United States towards spreading the war. It is a problem which the Government must understand, face, and remedy; but it is this problem which this Government seems to have difficulty in understanding and no intention of remedying.<br/>
May I now turn to a very different subject? Because the problem which I have just been discussing is the most immediate and urgent one, there is the danger of thinking that the impatience

of certain Americans is the only, or the main, threat to world peace or to peace in Asia today. But we have also to face the fact, as responsible people, that China, allied with the Soviet Union, has the aim of driving all Western influence out of Asia.<br/>
I do not think many of us would contest that they want to avoid world war, but from their acts and speeches it cannot be doubted, but that they have the aim of destroying Western influence in Asia, of using nationalism to combat the West, and subsequently, we can hardly doubt, of using Communist forces to oust the nationalist forces in the so-called liberated countries. We have to face this problem because we cannot avoid responsibilities in Asia. In India, in Burma and in Korea, as Members of the United Nations, and as members of the Commonwealth, we cannot avoid facing this fact.<br/>
This is surely the whole difficulty of our problem. If we had only to deal with the problem of the rising impatience of certain sections of United States opinion our foreign policy would be clear and simple, and we need not have any controversy about it. But the difficulty and danger is that in the minds of these Communists, in the minds of the Chinese and the Russians, side by side with fear is ambition. The same doctrines that make them fear the West make them hate the West and wish to destroy the Western r&#x00E9;gimes. The desire for security in the minds of Chinese and Soviet Communists is almost indistinguishable from the drive to expand, the drive for world power. The way they think, those two things are almost indistinguishable, and that is the problem we have to face.<br/>
We must, therefore, have a twofold approach to solving this problem. We have on the one hand to have policies of conciliation, restraint and patience&#x2014;really trying to get into the minds of the Communists in China and Russia; trying to look at things from their point of view; trying to estimate what the impact of our actions will be on them; showing them by all possible means that we have no intention of forcing war upon them; showing them by every possible means that ours is a policy of live and let live; and strengthening democracy in countries outside the Communist orbit by measures of economic aid.<br/>
That is one way in which we can deal with this menace. But, equally, there is the second approach&#x2014;the approach of making it perfectly plain that clear-cut aggression will be resolutely resisted. We cannot have one approach without the other, and the whole task of foreign affairs today is surely to try to balance these factors which often conflict with each other to an awkward degree, but which are both necessary if we are to increase the chances of avoiding war.<br/>
We have not always succeeded in this in the past. We have only to look at Korea itself to see the mistakes made by the Western Powers under both these headings. We made a mistake under the first heading, of the need for patience and imagination, when, after crossing the 38th Parallel, the United Nations Forces, flushed with victory, rushed up to the northern frontier without sufficiently stopping to consider what the impact of this would be on the mentality of the Chinese Communists. A little more restraint there, a little more imagination, and a little more patience might&#x2014;I only say might&#x2014;have helped to avoid the disaster of Chinese intervention in North Korea.<br/>
But, equally, in Korea the Western countries were wrong&#x2014;anyhow, the United States was wrong&#x2014;under the second heading as well. It did not make clear that it was going to be resolute in resisting aggression against South Korea in the first place. Looking back now to 25th June, 1950, who can doubt but that one of the reasons why the Soviet Union unleashed the North Koreans against South Korea was because they, like many observers in the West, thought that the United States had written off South Korea altogether.<br/>
If we had made clear in advance that such an act of aggression would be resolutely met, as it was met, by united military resistance, that act of aggression might never have taken place at all. Thus Korea shows&#x2014;and many other examples could be given&#x2014;the need for a twofold approach in keeping world peace at the present time.<br/>
No one should doubt but that the Labour Party and my hon. and right hon. Friends do stand for both these principles. That is shown in this Motion. It

is shown, too, in the six years of Government after the war; six years of Government when this country was, on foreign policy, well-governed, obeying the principles of patience and strength enunciated by Mr. Ernest Bevin. We have got fat more right to speak about the principle of collective security than hon. Members opposite. They had their chance to organise a collective security system before the last war, and they rose to the occasion in the most lamentable way at Munich. Indeed, it was we who led the way to making a reality of collective security since the war, in the North Atlantic Treaty and under the United Nations&#x2014;things which have helped to stabilise the situation in Europe today.<br/>
We have every right to speak on this subject with authority. We have also shown ourselves ready to bear the cost of defence, provided it is fairly done and not by just soaking the schoolchildren and pensioners, as hon. Members opposite seem to advocate. I think that my hon. Friends will agree with me that it is useful to say this if only for one reason; that we on this side of the House are coming back into power very soon.<br/>
If the impression were given that the Labour movement was not resolute in its intention to resist clear-cut aggression and to defend by all proper means Britain's fair claims and rights in the world, that, we know, would recoil on us on our return to power. I am not thinking only of Communist countries like China and Russia, but of Spain, Egypt and the Argentine to whom these remarks might apply and who might get adventurous ideas and be reluctant to negotiate fairly with us if they got the wrong impression.<br/>
In conclusion, I would urge that the Government must understand that there are two sides to this peace-making, and this Motion calls them to account because on his visit to the United States the Prime Minister failed to make plain that there is a basic difference here between the British and a powerful section of United States opinion which could be disastrous if it were not made plain. Instead of explaining and asserting the British point of view he tried to explain it away, to obscure it and to apologise for it, and this deserves the censure in the Motion before the House tonight.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Woolwich, East (Mr. Mayhew, has given us a series of faint echoes of the more extreme speeches that have come from his side of the House. He did not, although he accused my right hon.

<p>I am glad of the hon. Gentleman's interruption because that is one of the points with which I intend to deal in my speech, which I hope will bring us back to the Motion which we are discussing, and which has been discussed on this side of the House but hardly touched upon on the other side. The speech of the hon. Member for Woolwich, East, was in glaring contrast with the sensible and thoughtful speech made by the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Grimond). [HON. MEMBERS: "Why?"] The reason is that the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland happens to be a very sensible man.<br/>
I had not originally intended to speak in this debate, but because the Opposition have shown such irresponsibility and have based their arguments on so many fallacies, I am glad, Mr. Deputy-Speaker, that I caught your eye. I very much regret the tone of the debate as set by the Leader of the Opposition, and I am sorry he is not in his place because I want to deal with some of his remarks. He tried to blow up a storm in a Chinese teacup. During the 1930's no one can deny that the party opposite took every possible opportunity of making a partisan approach to foreign affairs. I had hoped that the war and six years of Labour Government would have taught them a sense of responsibility. But I was wrong.<br/>
The Prime Minister today dealt in very characteristic fashion with the unbalanced remarks of the right hon. Member for Lewisham, South (Mr. H. Morrison). I want to analyse the attack that was made by the Leader of the Opposition. Let us admit, because there is no denying it, that the speech which my right hon. Friend made to Congress has been grossly misinterpreted in some sections of the United States Press. We can all agree on that. One has only to read the papers to see that is so.</p>

<p>The hon. and gallant Gentleman has said that the opinions expressed in the American Press have misrepresented the views of the Prime Minister in his speech to Congress. Do I take it that he is making the point that the whole of the responsible Press in America is irresponsible in this particular matter, because it is not only the left wing papers who have been criticising what the right hon. Gentleman said?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1952-02-26a.1024.1" hansard_membership_id="1058" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/12142" speakername="Major Beamish" colnum="1024" time="">
<p>The Leader of the Opposition quoted "an American writer" as saying that
<q>'Prompt, resolute and effective action' was widely interpreted here as willingness to join the United States in such measures as bombing Manchurian airfields.&#x2026;"&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 5th February, 1952; Vol. 495, c. 838.]</q>
If those words were misinterpreted in some quarters of the United States Press, they were not by the United States Government. Fancy quoting "an American writer." Who was it&#x2014;Mr. Walter Winchell? The misinterpretation in the United States Press was deliberately stoked up by the Socialist Party who sought to misinterpret those words themselves, although they knew perfectly well what they meant. They have been guilty of stirring up the very trouble of which they have accused my right hon. Friend of being responsible.<br/>
I do not think that is a very good way in which to help this country. We have been told that my right hon. Friend should be criticised for saying, "We take our stand by your side," during the course of his speech to Congress. Let me remind the party opposite of the words of the Leader of the Opposition on a similar occasion when he went to America on the advice of my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary. He said:


<q>In fair and foul weather as long as the Stars and Stripes fly in Korea the British flag will fly beside it</q>
With those sentiments I heartily agreed at the time. What is the difference between that and what the Prime Minister said in Congress, except maybe that the Leader of the Opposition used rather more emphatic words.<br/>
The Leader of the Opposition wants to know what is the Government's policy to keep the peace in the Far East after the armistice which he agrees, as we all do, should be first settled. When he was in power he never gave this House the faintest indication of any long-term policy in the Far East. My right hon. Friend and the Government have taken the earliest possible opportunity not only of looking towards long-term policy through the machinery of the United Nations but of raising this question when they were in the United States. There is a very distinct contrast here. It is clear to me that throughout this debate there has not been one single constructive suggestion from any hon. Member opposite so far as Far Eastern policy is concerned.<br/>
The speech of the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Lewisham, South was purely destructive. In mentioning him, I am reminded of the complete misinterpretation that he has put on something which is going on at present. He sought to argue that the Japanese Government is in process of recognising General Chiang Kai-shek's Government as the legal Government of China. He is wrong in saying that, because only on 22nd February Mr. Yoshida, the Japanese Prime Minister, speaking in the Diet, said that a Japanese delegation in Taepah, Formosa, was negotiating a bilateral treaty which would recognise Nationalist sovereignty only over territory acturally controlled by the Nationalists at the moment. The right hon. Member for Lewisham, South, was completely wrong in his remarks.<br/>
We are now told that it was unfortunate that my right hon. Friend mentioned Formosa. The Leader of the Opposition said:
<q>The trouble is that there is only one point that was touched on by the Prime Minister in his Congress speech&#x2014;and I think it unfortunate that he mentioned it&#x2014;and that was Formosa."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 5th February, 1952; Vol. 495, c. 839&#x2013;40.]</q>
What complete rubbish that is&#x0021; I have never heard such rubbish in my life&#x0021; I

cannot believe that the right hon. Gentleman had read the Prime Minister's speech. Only one sentence in it referred to Formosa, while there were two paragraphs about Korea, a paragraph about South-East Asia, and a paragraph about Japan. Yet we are told that Formosa was the only thing that the Prime Minister mentioned. If that is supposed to be an attack on the policy of my right hon. Friend, it has completely mis-fired.<br/>
It is clear to me from what has been said today and what we knew before that there has been no change in Government policy in the Far East. The only reason I can give for the kind of speeches we have had today from the Opposition is that many hon. Members opposite are beginning to regret the implications of the policy which they themselves laid down.<br/>
I want to say a few words about Formosa and put one or two questions to hon. Members opposite. About 18 months ago the United States President announced that the United States Seventh Fleet would neutralise Formosa, would assure that there would be no attack on Formosa by the Chinese Communists and that troops from Formosa would not move to the mainland. That was described by "The Economist" as a "thoroughly respectable police operation." That was a very fair description, and I agree with it.<br/>
For more than a year the Leader of the Opposition was unable to make up his mind what the British Government's policy was on this matter. As late as 15th August last he said that the Government was not concerned with Formosa. Eventually he made up his mind. The policy of the Chinese Government towards Formosa is not in doubt. If any hon. Member has any doubt, I will read him something from one of last Sunday's newspapers quoting Peking radio, on which General Nieh Jung-chen, Chinese Deputy Chief of Staff, was quoted as saying:
<q>We shall liberate our territory of Taiwan.</q>
That is Formosa. Therefore, the Chinese Government's intentions towards Formosa are perfectly clear. In the same speech, the General made it clear that any liberation of that kind would be done in cooperation with China's allies.<br/>
As I understand it, the main reason for the neutralisation of Formosa is one


of simple military security. It is that we dare not allow Formosa to fall into hostile hands while the United Nations is opposing aggression in Korea. Does any hon. Member opposite disagree with that? Apparently not. Secondly, the object is to try to localise the war. Does any hon. Member opposite disagree with that? Apparently not. That is fine.</p>

<p>A little earlier the hon. and gallant Member was complaining that hon. Members were interrupting him. Now he is taking it for granted that if we do not interrupt him we agree with what he says.

<p>All right. It seems to me to be very important that we should find out, what, if anything, there is behind the attack which has been made during the debate, and that is the reason for my questions. My third question is: Is it agreed that the future of Formosa should be settled by the United Nations and not by force of arms? [HON. MEMBERS: "Agreed."] Then we can put "Agreed" to that.<br/>
If hon. Members have any doubt about it they should read Article 73 of the United Nations Charter. It seems to me that hon. Members opposite, who may not be in complete agreement with this policy, are rather overlooking the views of the Formosans themselves. Article 73 lays it down clearly that territories detached from enemy States come under the trusteeship section where:
<q>&#x2026;the principle is laid down that the interests of the inhabitants of these territories are paramount.</q>
We can all agree with that. [<i>Laughter</i>.] Have I said something funny?</p>

<p>Mena House? I am not concerned with where it was settled. I am trying to find where there is common ground about this. I was criticising the Leader of the Opposition for attacking my right hon. Friend for mentioning For-

mosa at all in his speech to Congress. That has been the main burden of the attack from the Opposition.</p>

<p>All these questions which are directed to the Opposition are entirely beside the point. Will the hon. and gallant Gentleman realise that what troubles me and many hon. Members of this House in relation to the speech made in Congress are the implications which have been drawn from the speech in the United States Press and also not by the irresponsible Press in this country but in a leader, now quite famous, in the "Manchester Guardian," in which the speech was deplored as creating a wrong impression? That is the gravamen of our charge.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1952-02-26a.1028.1" hansard_membership_id="1058" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/12142" speakername="Major Beamish" colnum="1028" time="">
<p>That is a vote of censure against the Press. I am dealing with the words which my right hon. Friend used in Congress, and I am answering the attack by the Leader of the Opposition. I intend to go on with it. If the hon. and learned Gentleman wishes to criticise the Press for putting a wrong interpretation on words which were quite clear, he can do so, but I want to get on with my speech.<br/>
In these circumstances, we on this side of the House are entitled to ask what all the fuss is about. My right hon. Friend was criticised for saying that prompt, resolute and effective action would be taken in the event of an armistice being signed and the terms of it being broken by the Communists. That was the least that he could say. [HON. MEMBERS: "Why say anything?"] That is what hon. Members opposite cannot understand, and I will go on to explain it.<br/>
Why should hon. Members opposite censure my right hon. Friend for using those words? It is still worse when they try to pretend, when they know it is not true, that a secret plan was made to extend the war. That is a disgraceful and unworthy charge to make. Goodness knows, we have all suffered enough in the war. Not a single hon. Member in the House wants to see the war extended. Those who make that kind of charge are making a most unworthy charge. That kind of charge hurts me as much as any of my hon. Friends, because my own regiment was in Korea&#x2014;although it is now in Hong Kong&#x2014;during some of the worst fighting an several of my very best friends who


survived the Second World War have now lost their lives. That is the kind of thing I do not like. It is a repetition of the warmongering tactics of the election.<br/>
Hon. Members opposite were taken completely by surprise when my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister disclosed to the House&#x2014;much to the annoyance of the Socialist Party&#x2014;that it was agreed by the last Government that if certain things happen the fighting could not be confined to Korea. This forced the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Lewisham, South, to turn one of his famous political somersaults, at which he is such an adept.<br/>
Let me now turn to one or two points with which I can deal quite easily from the back benches. Why are we blinding ourselves to possible new developments in the Far East? Supposing, for example, that the Chinese Communists themselves extend the war to the Chinese mainland by bringing to bear heavy air reinforcements against the United Nations troops fighting in Korea.<br/>
The estimated strength of the Russian aircraft available for the Koreans and Chinese fighting in North Korea is at least 1,700, of which 900 are modern jets. It is perfectly true that so far the United Nations have comparative air superiority over Korea, but the enemy have not yet been using the full force of their attack. Supposing Soviet aircraft were used in very large numbers and supposing United Nations troops had to pull back, might that not create a new situation, which would require prompt, resolute, and effective action?<br/>
Supposing again that the Chinese Communists intervene on a large scale with their so-called volunteers against Indo-China, which is so strategically important. I see in today's "Daily Telegraph" &#x2014;[<i>Interruption</i>.] That is a newspaper which is extremely well informed on the Far East, and I regard their reports as particularly reliable. They report in today's issue:
<q>Russian and Chinese equipment played an important part in Viet-Minh Communist operations which forced the French to withdraw from Hoabinh, 35 miles south-west of Hanoi, Indo-China, on Friday night and yesterday.</q>
They go on to give detailed evidence of the kind of equipment available. I have

also a reliable report that something like 250,000 well trained regular troops under the command of General Teng Hua, who was recently a Chinese delegate at the truce talks in Korea, are massed along the Indo-Chinese border.</p>

<p>But I am going on to make my speech.<br/>
In those circumstances it was obviously very proper that my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary should have issued the warning he did when he spoke in New York during his recent visit to the United States. He used these words, and they ought to go on record in HANSARD:
<q>It should be understood that intervention by force by the Chinese Communists in South East Asia, even if they were called volunteers, would create a situation no less menacing than that which the United Nations met and faced in Korea. In any such situation the United Nations would be equally solid to resist it.</q>
It seems clear to me that why my right hon. Friend thought it necessary to give

that dire warning was because of the distribution of Chinese troops along the Indo-Chinese border to which I have referred.<br/>
Is there any reason in anything I have said now why my right hon. Friend should be censured by the party opposite? Supposing, for example, a new thrust developed against Burma, a country whose Government is already half paralysed by the Chinese rebels who are disrupting the country, would not that create a new situation, and would not this situation call for prompt, resolute and effective action from ourselves and the other members of the United Nations? It is equally true to say that if the Chinese Communists sent reinforcements to back up the Communist rebels in Malaya in a big way, by land or sea, it would create a new situation which would call for prompt, resolute and effective action.<br/>
The "Observer" last Sunday summed all this up very sensibly, and I would like to read a few lines from it. Speaking about China, this newspaper said:
<q>If she breaks a Korean armistice or commits a new aggression in South-East Asia or elsewhere, war with China will be inevitable; and Pekin should be given clear warning of this.</q>
The newspaper goes on to add:
<q>While China should be clearly warned that further aggression on her part means war, she should also be reassured in the clearest terms that, if she stays within her borders, nobody will attack her merely from dislike of her r&#x00E9;gime.</q>
I believe that to be a fair and sensible summary of the situation.<br/>
Some hon. Members have suggested that General Mao Tse Tung will become another Tito. I hope he will, but I shall believe it when I see it. After the most careful study I do not see signs of it at present. There is a good deal of evidence that General Mao Tse Tung's r&#x00E9;gime is coming increasingly under the orders of the Kremlin. I feel that "China for the Chinese" may one day be a rallying cry, but not "China for Chiang Kai-shek." I have never said that, and I do not believe it. It is highly problematical whether Chiang Kai-shek will ever be welcomed back into China at all. All the twisted arguments and Fabian clap trap that we have had in this debate cannot alter the facts which I have given.</p>

<p>I am dealing with the Far Eastern situation. The hon. Gentleman and I have shared platforms in the past and have debated the Middle East. There are very few matters connected with the Middle East on which we do not see eye to eye, but I do not want to be sidetracked to that subject now because the argument would take us too far. This is the first time I have heard the point mentioned in the debate.<br/>
How does the Far Eastern situation appear to sensible people? The situation ought never to have been used by the party opposite as a vehicle for a partisan attack on the Prime Minister. There is no denying the fact that Communist forces in the Far East have a very great military preponderance indeed, in comparison with United Nations forces, and that they have the enormous advantage of working on interior lines. The mobilised armed strength of the Communist forces is in the neighbourhood of 5&#x00BD; million. On the Soviet Border, the latest estimate I have yet received shows that there are 5,000 Soviet aircraft in that area, 26 infantry and seven airborne divisions, and&#x2014;</p>

<p>Some of these figures have been quoted on many occasions. It does not matter whose figures they are, I am giving actual figures and as far as I know, they are accurate. They were

quoted in the "Observer" only a few weeks age.<br/>
I say that some of us cannot help being apprehensive about the military advantages that may have been gained by the Communists during the prolonged truce negotiations which have been conducted with such good faith by ourselves.<br/>
All this seems to me to underline the urgent need for a global strategy to be agreed between all the free countries. It seems also to underline to a considerable extent the failure of the Socialist Party to provide such a strategy. It must be the supreme objective of Allied strategy to win a victory over aggressive international Communism and to avoid a war.<br/>
There are many things that need to be done in working out this strategy. The responsibility for it lies clearly on the shoulders of the Government, but the Opposition has a duty too. The Opposition has a duty to criticise constructively, and not to try to curry favour with an unthinking electorate by refusing to support unpopular measures even though they are vital, and are known to be vital, for British security and for the preservation of peace. I have many friends who sit on the opposite side of the House and I greatly regret that so many of them who belong to the majority of the party opposite&#x2014;the 75 per cent. or so who are really social democrats&#x2014;are allowing themselves during the course of this debate to be led by the nose by the Marxists and fellow travellers whom I group together under the heading of the Bevanites.<br/>
I say to the party opposite that the only honest course for them in this debate is to withdraw their Motion of censure on my right hon. Friend and admit the hollow nature of their charges. To press this Motion to a division will be to give positive proof that the Socialist Party is playing politics at a time of national peril. And not only will it give proof of that but it will also give proof that the whole of the Socialist Party is being swept off its feet by the Ebbw Vale tide.</p>

<p>&#x2014;whatever may be thought of the general issue of the Division tonight, which I personally warmly welcome, and of the extent to which it may mark or symbolise the end of bipartisanship, as it is called, in our foreign policy.<br/>
There is, however, one point&#x2014;if I can have the attention of the hon. and gallant Member, because he had the attention of the House for quite a long time&#x2014;on which I agree with him. I can accept his sincerity and, indeed, honour him for the feelings expressed in the short passage in his speech referring to the casualties in Korea, to the death of men he knew in his old regiment. I ask him, however, in all earnestness, whether he does not conceive it possible that those lives might have been saved, that many thousands of other lives&#x2014;British, American and Chinese&#x2014;might have been saved, if it had not been for the insane strategy of General MacArthur when he went right up to the northern end of Korea and, in the view of many of us, provoked and alarmed the Chinese into crossing the frontier. It is, perhaps, unprofitable at this moment to try to sort out the exact responsibilities and provocations on each side, but at least one should not be accused of "condoning aggression," or anything else wrong, if one simply tries to analyse and assess current history as it is being made.<br/>
The Minister of State, in his intervention this afternoon, appealed to us on this side to have regard to what he called the "explicit undertakings" given by the Prime Minister and in other quarters. He seems to feel that because of these explicit undertakings our suspicions and the universal impression, not merely of a few irresponsible newspaper men in America, but of the most reputable Washington diplomatic correspondents, could be set at rest and that, therefore, we should not divide the House tonight. Unfortunately, many of us find it difficult to accept those explicit undertakings at their face value.<br/>
Explicit undertakings have a way of coming unstuck, of coming apart in the hands of the present Government. Per-

haps I may quote, in passing and by way of illustration, an example from another part of the world. The Minister of State will remember giving an answer yesterday in the House on the question of the Sudan, in which he said that he had nothing to add to or subtract from a most explicit undertaking and assurance given by the Foreign Secretary on the first day of this debate. Indeed, the Foreign Secretary showed that he realised how explicit it was by adding <i>sotto voce</i> at the end of that passage in his speech, "I do not think this will help me much in my negotiations with Egypt" or words to that effect.</p>

<p>I am in the middle of what I described as a passing illustration. There have been long speeches about Ireland, Germany, and other parts of the world. I know the point which the hon. Member wants to make, and I appreciate the motives which prompt him to do so.<br/>
I was drawing the attention of the Minister of State to some very serious statements contained in the broadcast last night by the Egyptian Prime Minister, reported thus by Reuter in today's "The Times":
<q>The people were unanimous that evacuation and unity of the Nile Valley be realised, and he assured them that he would not negotiate"&#x2014;</q>
that is, in the impending negotiations with us&#x2014;
<q>over the principle of evacuation, but on the means of implementing it and achieving the unity of the Nile Valley.</q>
That was the Egyptian Prime Minister speaking. If it is true, it means that we are now negotiating, or are about to do so, with Egypt, among other questions, on the question of our recognising Egyptian sovereignty over the Sudan. [An HON. MEMBER: "Nonsense."] It is no good saying "Nonsense," if words have any meaning at all. That is what was said by the Prime Minister of a country with which we are just entering into negotiations. I do not understand why we should be negotiating about that subject at all. In my view, it ought not to be on the agenda&#x2014;unless the Foreign Secretary wants to transfer his riots from Cairo to Khartoum.<br/>
That was just a passing, brief deviation from the main subject of the debate, but I hope very much that whoever replies tonight will be able to say a word of further reassurance, if that be possible, because great concern and alarm are caused when these explicit undertakings are, apparently, broken so soon after they are given.<br/>
On the main subject of the debate, I thought that the Prime Minister was quite exceptionally evasive, no doubt deliberately. He did not understand, or he pretended not to understand, the real point of the charges against him and his speech in Congress. It was not so much what he said as the way that he said it and the impression that he conveyed. The Prime Minister himself, many years ago, laid down a set of rules for young speakers. He said that there were three important principles of public oratory and that they were important in this order: first, who you are; second, the way you say it; and, third, and only third, what you say.<br/>
I think that that applies well to the speech it the Prime Minister in Congress: it was not so much what he said&#x2014;although some of that was objectionable to us on this side of the House&#x2014;as the impression he conveyed, an impression immensely reinforced by the unanimity with which, as I say, these Washington correspondents, diplomatic commentators, and so on&#x2014;no doubt inspired by official hand-outs from inside the State Department and elsewhere&#x2014;interpreted that speech as illustrating a reorientation of British policy on lines which have caused so much alarm here. It is no good the Prime Minister riding off with a light remark to the effect that he cannot chase up all the comments which have appeared all over America. He knew perfectly well what we meant.<br/>
Furthermore, he was evasive on one particular subject which was dealt with at some length by the hon. and gallant Member who spoke immediately before me, but who has already left his place in the House&#x2014;the subject of Formosa. What the Prime Minister said to Congress about Formosa may be in itself unexceptionable, although I agree with the criticism by my right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition that it was an unfortunate subject to introduce with so much

emphasis. But no one has yet mentioned in this debate the curious phrase used by the Prime Minister in his statement in the House on 30th January:
<q>What I have said and repeat is that he"&#x2014;</q>
that is Chiang Kai-shek&#x2014;
<q>and those who fought with him against the Communists and have taken refuge upon the island of Formosa should not be invaded and massacred there while the United Nations Forces possess such overwhelming naval superiority."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 30th January, 1952; Vol. 495, c. 201.]</q>
This was not the point at which he made that slip of the tongue, which has been referred to already. This was a considered statement, and he said:
<q>while the United Nations Forces possess such overwhelming naval superiority.</q>
Surely the implication of that is that the Prime Minister is now committing us, committing the Royal Navy, committing our troops, possibly, to uses in Formosa to which the previous Government did not commit them. He does not say, "while the United States has such overwhelming naval superiority there," but
<q>while the United Nations Forces possess such overwhelming naval superiority,</q>
thus implying that, in his view, an intervention in some revival of the Chinese Civil War, on the side of Chiang Kai-shek, would be a legitimate activity for our Forces.<br/>
My right hon. Friend the Member for Ebbw Vale (Mr. Bevan) dealt with the claim that there is "increasing harmony" between the Americans and ourselves. Either that was empty rhetoric or it was extremely sinister&#x2014;sinister in that it would justify our attacking the Prime Minister today for having apparently surreptitiously re-orientated British policy and re-aligned it with American policy. The Foreign Secretary used another rather similar phrase in his speech. He spoke about "the Atlantic approach." He said:
<q>I hope that in the political field this sense of the Atlantic approach to international problems is going to grow."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT. 5th February, 1952; Vol. 495, c. 823.]</q>
Goodness knows what that particular bit of woolly rhetoric really means or is meant to mean, unless the Atlantic approach to foreign affairs is an approach in which those who make it are usually out of their depth.<br/>
Seriously, there is no such thing as an Atlantic approach to international affairs. I know that geography has now been revised, and that Greece and Turkey are on the coast of the North Atlantic. But, what identity of purpose, ideologically or economically, is there between the various Powers on the Atlantic seaboard &#x2014;ourselves, the Americans, the Portuguese, the various other Powers there? I wish we could clear our minds of some of the cant and hypocrisy which underly these bromides with which the speeches of Ministers are so freely bespattered nowadays.<br/>
The reason why there is not and cannot be complete harmony or unity of approach between ourselves and the Americans is that there is a rather interesting contradiction in the whole American approach to international affairs. The principal motive and emotion in the minds of our American friends is an almost obsessive fear and hatred of Communism. But they have a secondary and by no means inconsiderable motive and emotion in international affairs&#x2014;an equally obsessive and irrational inherited hatred of what they regard as British imperialism. They have a somewhat old-fashioned idea of British imperialism, which has been cleaned up a good deal in the past six years, thanks to the Labour Government. Quite a few of them still have the sort of idea of it which is held by Mr. Hearst and Colonel McCormick and people like that. These two antipathies are, in a sense, mutually contradictory. The Americans cannot have a show-down with world Communism unless they can be sure that we will "go along," as they say, "at all costs," as the Prime Minister says. Yet all the time they are taking economic action, especially in the Far East and South-East Asia, which is extremely damaging to the British Commonwealth and British trade.<br/>
I say that we should not go along with the Americans at all costs: not at the cost of sacrificing our independence of approach to international affairs; not at the cost of the disruption of the British Commonwealth and British Commonwealth trade&#x2014;the loss again, it may be, of Hong Kong and Singapore. The would-be liquidators of the British

Commonwealth do not sit on these benches. They are the American planners who have built up Japanese export trade on a competitive capitalist basis and have, furthermore, induced the Japanese by pressure to cut themselves off from their natural markets on the Chinese mainland and thus to attack our natural markets in South-East Asia even more intensively.<br/>
This is the fundamental contradiction in the Anglo-American complex, and I cannot see that the Prime Minister has done anything to resolve it by merely blurring the differences and by pretending that they do not exist, as he did in his speech to Congress. On the contrary, that seems to me to be the most dangerous of all attitudes. Several hon. Members on the other side of the House have said how important it is that the Chinese, or the Russians, or anybody else, should understand clearly in advance what we will and will not do. It is equally important that the Americans, as our potential allies, should understand clearly in advance what we will and will not do.<br/>
It is because the Prime Minister deceived them, intentionally or unintentionally, bemused them with his rhetoric, and made them think that we would go along at all costs, and that he would have the British people behind him, that it is necessary for us, by this Division tonight, to record the fact that the Americans cannot have their show-down unless we are in it with them; and that the Prime Minister cannot take us into it with him, and with them, against the wishes of more than half of this nation.</p>

<p>I rise to support the Motion which stands on the Order Paper in the names of my right hon. Friends and myself.<br/>
This Motion has been criticised on many grounds by hon. and right hon. Gentlemen opposite, but I think that they will at least agree this about the debate to which it has given rise. There was, undoubtedly, for whatever reason, some confusion about the true meaning of the things which the Prime Minister said and did on his visit to the United States, and, as a result of this debate, there will surely be some clarification and some improvement.<br/>
I have only been able to make notes of what the Prime Minister has said,


because, in the nature of things, I have not been able to see HANSARD. We have had from him categorical statements in the course of this debate to this effect. He said that he was opposed to action involving us in war in China, and that he had never departed from this, publicly or privately. In winding up the passage of his speech relating to Korea, he said there were no secret or private agreements, actual or implied, on this issue given either by himself or the Foreign Secretary on their visit to Washington, and, when summing up the whole of his speech, he said there has been no change of policy towards the United States, the United Nations or the war in Korea.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman said that he had only conformed to the policy of the late Government in regard to action to be taken in Korea in certain circumstances. He also said that nothing would be more foolish than for us to become involved in Asia, or for Chiang Kai-shek to enter into adventures on the mainland of Asia.<br/>
I believe that these are useful statements on British Government policy, and I only regret that they were not clearly made some five weeks ago in the United States. They are not, in every respect, however, wholly clear, as I hope to show in the course of my remarks.<br/>
I want, first, to say a brief word or two about the background against which, it seems to me, the Prime Minister made his speech in the United States. It will be known to most hon. and right hon. Members that, for something like 18 months, there has been going on in the United States what they call "the great debate," and a great debate it is, about the fundamentals of United States foreign policy. It deals with issues such as isolationism, the emphasis to be placed on United States interests in the Eastern or Western Hemispheres, relations with the Soviet Union, Communism, and so on.<br/>
Within this debate, there has recently emerged, as one of the major practical issues, the question how far world problems, and, in particular, the problem of the relations between Communism and the free world, can be solved, wholly or mainly, by military means, and the testing ground of this issue at the present time is, inevitably, the Far East.<br/>
I hope no hon. Gentleman in this House will seek to deny that there is in the United States a considerable body of

opinion, which we might broadly describe as the military school, which tends to believe that strong military action is the main, if not the only, weapon to be used.<br/>
I am not going to give the House any more quotations, of which we have had very many. We had quotations in the earlier part of the debate, and we have had them again today, from such people as the American Secretary for the Navy, Admiral Fechteler, Mr. John Foster Dulles, and so on. I think there can really be no doubt that there is a school of thought of this kind, and an influential one, in the United States. It is not at all a straight issue between Britain and the United States; it is also an issue among Americans themselves. Indeed, the extent to which some of the best minds in America are at the present time both speaking and writing against the military attitude towards world affairs is, I think, some proof that this issue is a live one in that country.<br/>
How the United States decides this issue is a matter of vital importance to all of us. It is a sobering thought that the political leaders of the United States have the responsibility for guiding their country's decision aright in all the perplexities of an election year. That is a field in which I think we should be wrong to enter, and here I agree fully with the Prime Minister.<br/>
For us, this is not an election issue; it is a matter of national survival and of world peace and I think the Prime Minister had an altogether unique opportunity&#x2014;and I use the word in the strict sense, for there is no American leader at the present time and no foreign leader who had the opportunity, or could have had the opportunity, of speaking, as the right hon. Gentleman might have spoken, to the American public and to the world, and not merely to the Administration in Washington, the other day.<br/>
He had, therefore, not only the opportunity but the duty to his own people to make full use of that occasion to state the British case. My misgivings about what the right hon. Gentleman's attitude in America might be started before his speech in Congress. They started when I read the official communiqu&#x00E9; which followed his conversations with the President of the United States. It seemed to me almost as though Britain had been represented there simply by her Minister


of Defence and as though the Prime Minister, with his wider obligations, had in some way been left outside the conference room.<br/>
I dare say many hon. Members have not very clearly in their minds what was in the communiqu&#x00E9;. It was not very long&#x2014;far less than a column in "The Times"&#x2014;and it was almost wholly military in flavour. It began with one or two general statements about building the strength of the free world which might have been taken to be more than military but which clearly had a military connotation. It went on to refer to the United States' bases in Britain, to the Supreme Command of the Atlantic, to the standardisation of the rifle, to the European Army, to Middle Eastern defence and to Britain's need of steel exclusively for defence.<br/>
Those are very important topics, but one would have expected that something more than a couple of platitudes would have been put into that long list of military subjects to cover the whole field of non-military statesmanship. If that really represents the ratio in the Prime Minister's thinking of military strategy, on the one hand, to diplomacy and statesmanship, on the other, I think it is a very dangerous thing for this country, and I think the Foreign Secretary, who has my sympathy in this matter, had better try to secure for himself at least a small niche in policy-making by applying for the new post of Under-Secretary in the Ministry of Defence.<br/>
That was only, as it were, the <i>hors d'oeuvre</i> of the feast which the right hon. Gentleman was going to give us and it was, of course, the Congress speech which aroused people's fears here and aroused a good deal of confusion on both sides of the Atlantic. In particular, there were those two phrases which have been discussed and have been made the subject of our debate&#x2014;the first, where he said our response, in certain circumstances which are familiar to the House, would be "prompt, resolute and effective"; and the second his brief phrase about Formosa. The right hon. Gentleman's speech today seemed to bypass any discussion of the effect which those phrases produced. He has now told us what was in his mind, but he seems to think that it was only his political

opponents who had any cause to misinterpret those phrases.<br/>
As I said, I shall not add to the surfeit of quotations, but if there is anybody here who thinks it was only the right hon. Gentleman's political opponents or only the Americans who were worried by the meaning of those phrases, I recommend him to look up the leading article in "The Times" in the same issue as that in which the right hon. Gentleman's speech was reported&#x2014;that is to say, before anybody here could possibly have expressed in public any reaction to the speech&#x2014;and, at the same time, the leading article in another very responsible paper, on the other side of the Atlantic, the "New York Herald-Tribune" of the same day.<br/>
The editor of "The Times" saw fit to say, in an article, that it would be perilous to deduce from this speech that in the event of there being any new setback there would be automatic involvement in a wider war in China. Anybody who knows the style of "The Times" knows that that would never have appeared had it not been that on a first reading of that speech the editor of "The Times" had felt certain that some such deduction would be drawn. How right he was was proved by the fact that at that very same moment the deduction was being drawn by the "New York Herald-Tribune," in an equally important leader, that we were now agreeing to those attacks on Chinese centres which Britain had so strongly opposed when they were suggested by General MacArthur. That will be found in leading articles on the same day&#x2014;18th January&#x2014;in both "The Times" and the "New York Herald-Tribune."<br/>
Since then there has been controversy in many responsible papers, including the "Manchester Guardian" and the "Economist," finally ending with the debate in Congress when the right hon. Gentleman was accused of "double-talk." I do not think I would be exaggerating if I described that situation by saying that the right hon. Gentleman certainly cannot be congratulated on having clarified Anglo-American relations on this subject.<br/>
The Prime Minister went further on that line today, and I want to say a word or two about those two phrases&#x2014;first of all the one about a response
<q>prompt, resolute and effective.</q>


We have been told by the right hon. Gentleman that he meant by that no change from the policy of the previous Administration. He described the policy of the previous Administration&#x2014;and I have got it as nearly as possible verbatim&#x2014;in these words to which I take no objection: "If heavy attacks were launched from Chinese territory upon our troops in Korea we would be prepared, subject to consultation, to associate ourselves with actions not confined to Korea in order to protect our troops."</p>

<p>I take no objection to that, though I should like to ask, without delving deeply into controversy, where the right hon. Gentleman was quoting from and whether our United States Allies were consulted before he chose to make public here at least the gist, if not actually the text, of what was, at the time, a private communication to us and an equally private reply?<br/>
In commenting upon that description of the policy of the late Labour Government I should like to point out first of all that, as I have said, this was not issued as a political gesture, as a public warning, but as a private exchange of views of what might have to be done tactically in the field to meet a specifically military situation, namely, an attack by air starting from Chinese soil upon our troops.<br/>
I dare say that that policy is unpalatable to many people, but I have always taken the view that no Government could take any other attitude towards their own troops but one of saying that if they were heavily attacked from such airfields the military must be ready to take such action. But that is not at all&#x2014;not in the least&#x2014;what the right hon. Gentleman said in his speech. [An HON. MEMBER: "It is exactly."] It is not exactly what he said.<br/>
In the first place, he made clear in his own speech that he made this statement in Congress in pursuance of a decision he had taken to give a public warning. He was not discussing a military plan&#x2014;what he might have to do in response to certain action on the Communist side. He was deliberately, as a matter of policy, giving a public warning. And what he said by way of warning was

<q>&#x2026;if the truce we seek is reached only to be broken our response will be prompt, resolute and effective.</q>
I quote that from the White Paper.<br/>
There is no mention there at all of the condition that this should be done only as a retaliation for military action taken from non-Korean bases. This was not a tactical military measure at all. [HON. MEMBERS: "Oh."] Hon. and right hon. Gentlemen should not jeer. What this means is that the right hon. Gentleman was prepared to authorise action not limited to Korea.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman says he associated himself with that policy when he used that phrase. He said it was our policy from which he had not departed, and that policy was related to action not confined to Korea. In his Congress speech, however, he said he was giving a warning that he would take such action, not in the event of attacks being delivered from other territory, but simply if the truce we were seeking was reached only to be broken&#x2014;a phrase which may relate exclusively to further aggressive action in Korea.<br/>
Moreover, when such a warning is uttered publicly as part of the policy which he has indicated to us, one cannot overlook the possible effect of it upon the obtaining of a truce; and in that connection I should like the right hon. Gentleman who is to follow me to tell us whether it was agreed with the United States that this warning should be issued at the time of the right hon. Gentleman's Congress speech&#x2014;well in advance of the truce.<br/>
I should have seen very much more sense in it if it had been agreed that some warning would be given, after the truce had been obtained, of what might follow upon a breach of the truce; but to make this warning well in advance, while one is trying to get the truce, and to suggest it is going to assist us in doing so, seems to me very curious reasoning.<br/>
On these points we want a very firm statement tonight, because the right hon. Gentleman cannot have it both ways. If he says he did not make any change of policy, as he described our policy, in words which were his, and not mine, then it follows that he has not, in fact, agreed that any action can be taken outside Korea except in the circumstances in which we envisaged it, and we want to


know whether this is correct, because it does not appear so from the remarks he made.<br/>
Then, as to Formosa, he made, I think, a very revealing remark. In describing why he had chosen to make that remark he said that, after all, it was the only thing he could say about Formosa which could be agreed on both sides of the Atlantic. It was not a question of whether it was useful; whether thereby he was expressing the British point of view; but whether it would be acceptable to his American audience.<br/>
I suggest that that was not a good enough reason for coming out with a remark which, rightly or wrongly, has been interpreted, particularly in the United States, as denoting sympathy&#x2014;a new sympathy&#x2014;on the part of the British Government for what has previously been quite specifically the policy of the United States towards the Nationalists in Formosa, and not the policy of the British Government. I think that we want to be quite clear, there again, that he has not sought in any way to depart from our policy on that count.<br/>
We must accept from the right hon. Gentleman, I think, subject to those points on which I hope we shall have a reply, that there was no change of formal commitment at all. But was there a change of climate as a result of his speech? I believe that there was. I think that it is clear, from the many statements made by leading Americans since the right hon. Gentleman's visit, that those leading United States spokesmen are not taking more account than they did before of the British point of view. And no wonder. Because he did not trouble to express the British point of view when he spoke to the American public.<br/>
I would submit to the House that, quite as alarming as these particular, ill-chosen phrases, was the Prime Minister's omission to set out what is distinctive in his country's policy. I believe he was perfectly right in the early part of his speech to emphasise the unity of our two countries. There was nothing new in that. My right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition, the late Mr. Ernest Bevin, on many occasions, and my right hon. Friend the Member for Lewisham, South (Mr. H. Morrison), have all done the same thing in communiques and in

speeches when they have visited the United States.<br/>
But I should like to say here that I do not for a moment accept the right hon. Gentleman's suggestion to this House on I think, 30th January that a special gesture was needed by him to convince the United States that Britain, in addition to being good comrades in the field, would also be good comrades at the council table. I repudiate absolutely any suggestion that any special gesture of that kind was required by him. We have, in fact, particularly in regard to Korea and the United Nations' action in the Far East, been exceedingly good and loyal comrades to the United States; but of course, we have not said, as part of that arrangement, that we are going to refrain from expressing our own point of view.<br/>
The Prime Minister has been attacked for the phrase he used&#x2014;which he has never withdrawn&#x2014;in a previous debate in this House when he said that we mean at all costs to be friends and allies of the United States. He wishes us to take that as merely a manner of speaking. I do not know how often we are to be asked to take his vivid phrases in that sense. In any case, I think he probably will agree that taken literally it is not a self-respecting basis for an alliance.<br/>
I should like to give the House one more quotation, which is the one exception I wish to make to my rule that I would give no more, because I think this is a particularly interesting one. I prefer very much to the formula used by the right hon. Gentleman for an Anglo-American alliance the formula which was used by Thomas Jefferson when he, as an ex-President of the United States, was giving advice to President Monroe on a proposal from the British side for Anglo-American co-operation at a time when the Americans were the lesser partner in the partnership.<br/>
It is therefore closely applicable to us today in the opposite sense. He ended a long passage, which I should like to quote in full but from which I take only two sentences, by saying:
<q>With her,</q>
That is, with Britain; and for that today we should read the United States&#x2014;
<q>With her, then, we should most sedulously cherish a cordial friendship, and nothing would tend more to knit our affections than to be fighting once more side by side in the same cause.</q>


Then comes this sentence:
<q>Not that I would purchase even her amity at the price of taking part in her wars.</q>
I suggest that is a very admirable formula, to which our United States allies cannot possibly object, for the partner who is materially the less powerful in a solid Anglo-American alliance. We have been entirely loyal to our United States partner in every joint venture freely entered into, but the condition is that it should be really a joint venture.<br/>
Since we on this side have been accused of having said nothing constructive, I should like briefly to suggest one or two of the things that the right hon. Gentleman might usefully have said, not to pick a quarrel, not to touch on sore points in Anglo-American relations, but to put in British perspective matters which are of common concern. In his speech the right hon. Gentleman saw fit&#x2014;and, again, I make no quarrel with this&#x2014;to mention Japan. He said only one sentence on it, and it was, quite frankly, an empty compliment paid to the United States Occupation Forces. Surely he realises that there is a distinctive British point of view upon the Japanese Peace Treaty and future relations with Japan; that many things were left over in the Treaty for subsequent negotiation, in which we shall have very deepest interest. If he did not know that, many of his hon. Friends who represent Lancashire constituencies could have told him.<br/>
I think, further, that he should have put the military and non-military factors in the Far Eastern situation, particularly in Korea and South-East Asia, in a proper perspective. We all know that it is extremely difficult to reach a truce in Korea. We also know that it is likely to be even more difficult when we get to the stage after the truce and are seeking a political settlement. I have no objection whatever to the issue of a warning that there will be a United Nations response to aggression. Nor am I under any illusion that we shall earn Chinese respect by being soft with them. I do not, moreover, think that when talking of the necessity of not spreading the war we should think we are the only ones who might spread the war. It is possible that war might be spread against our will by action on the other side.<br/>
I think, however, that if these military warnings are to be issued they should

be balanced by an indication that we have equally in mind the other obligations placed upon us by the United Nations' Charter to seek a peaceful settlement of disputes. We should not only say what we would do if there is renewed aggression. We should also indicate that, if there is not renewed aggression but an offer of fair dealing, it will be met with fair dealing on our part; and that the Korean war is not for us, as it appears to be for Mr. Dulles, the first step in a continental counterrevolutionary crusade.<br/>
The Prime Minister maintained no such balance in his speech in the United States. Indeed, the one indication which he gave, as I have already indicated, of his attitude towards the Chinese internal situation was this phrase about Formosa which was taken wrongly, as we now hope we can believe, to indicate that Britain, too, was interested in the cause of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, who in the eyes of all Asia represents counter-revolution.<br/>
If the Prime Minister had been aware of his position as a leading spokesman of a Commonwealth which contains very important independent Asian members and many Asian dependencies he could not have made this gratuitous blunder. I think it is at least as important that he should have indicated that he did not take a narrowly military attitude to South-East Asia either. This is largely a colonial area which could be lost in more ways than by Chinese military invasion. I believe that the political and economic factors are likely to be in the long run the determining ones, and that they are factors which get all too little attention in the United States.<br/>
It is to these factors, I believe&#x2014;the need for accelerating political progress despite the great handicap of having to fight military aggression at the same time&#x2014;that he should have called attention. He seems to have forgotten that British policy relative to Asia and the Far East so far&#x2014;and we hope that he is going to continue it&#x2014;has combined in it at lent as much economic as military measures.<br/>
The economic question is a very important one. At the recent meeting of the Economic Commission for Asia the Soviet Union was angling for an agreement to


exchange raw materials for finished industrial goods, and we should recognise that that is in the long run an extremely serious temptation to the whole of this area, more particularly should we find it difficult to supply the varying needs in industrial products. These are simply examples of the general theme which, I believe, the right hon. Gentleman should have made much more plain than he did in his visit to the United States&#x2014;the theme of firmness and level-headedness during the military phase coupled with a constant effort to look beyond that phase and prepare the way for a political settlement.<br/>
We all know that in the United States they have a habit of looking for quick results. In the industrial field that is a part of their great strength, but in settling great international questions that attitude can only lead to an attempt to cut many Gordian knots by force. While we sympathise with United States impatience due to the impact of their losses in Korea, we cannot afford to accept that as a basis for our joint policy in the Far East, and I am quite confident that the overwhelming body of British opinion, backed by the overwhelming body of opinion in Europe and Asia as a whole, believes this is the view which Britain should always be impressing upon her allies.<br/>
I believe that it is essential to do so if we are to limit the Far Eastern War, and great credit is due to those Americans, including the Administration, who have so far succeeded in limiting the war in the Far East. It was little enough help that was given to them by the Prime Minister in his speech.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman, in the opening remarks of his speech to Congress, talked of "the bi-partisan habit of mind" which he hoped would be cultivated in Britain as well as in the United States. We would have been more grateful to him if he had gone on to formulate a more balanced account of his own country's policy in the Far East, instead of which he made a speech which was so faulty in its basic thought, so ambiguous and so misleading that he and his Foreign Secretary between them have had to spend a month in explaining it away.<br/>
It is that policy&#x2014;which he now proclaims that he follows, as it was followed by the Labour Government and as it has

been reaffirmed by the Foreign Secretary &#x2014;that the Prime Minister allowed to go entirely by default in Washington, and such failure of judgment and of will is something that we on this side of the House are not prepared to condone.</p>

<p>Before I come to the actual terms of the Motion which will shortly be put to the vote, perhaps I may be allowed some general reflections. The relations between the people of the United States and ourselves are perhaps of greater importance today than at any time in history. It is vital that we should understand each other, for only by such understanding can our co-operation be healthy and fruitful, and on our co-operation depends the future of the whole free world.<br/>
By a curious chance, I can claim one advantage, as I think it, which I share with my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister and also with my right hon. Friend the Leader of the House. We all had American mothers. It also happened that I was privileged for three years in the war, at an Anglo-American headquarters, to serve under a great leader equally respected by the British and the Americans who served under him&#x2014;General Eisenhower. My experience certainly is that the very fact of the connection between our two countries is in a sense a kind of danger, for the connection of language and origin may sometimes of itself be a danger, because of all forms of quarrel a family quarrel can be the worst.<br/>
I very well remember many occasions when there were great differences between the British and the American points of view during the Mediterranean campaign, differences not of strategy and tactics, for they did not come under my direction, but of politics, and I agree with the former Foreign Secretary that our American colleagues did not resent any divergence of view, however strongly expressed, so long as it was put forward openly and straightforwardly. But he made one proviso, and that proviso is very important. He said that it depended upon those differences or arguments being put forward upon a deep sense of friendship and underlying singleness of purpose. After all, that is the basis of any partnership. That was the secret of the


Prime Minister's success in his relations with President Roosevelt and the leading American political and military figures during the war. That was the secret of the success which he repeated on his visit to the United States a few weeks ago.<br/>
The right hon. Member for Grimsby (Mr. Younger) seems to think that the Prime Minister ought to have taken advantage of his visit to America to lecture the American people from his superior knowledge, on all their errors and mistakes. The Americans are very anxious to hear lectures&#x2014;they sometimes pay very substantial sums to listen to them&#x2014;but I do not think they would be likely to appreciate their being lectured in the sense or in the terms to which the right hon. Gentleman has just referred.<br/>
No; my right hon. Friend did something very different. He made no change of policy regarding the Far East from the policy pursued by the last Government, but he made a great change, and a much needed change, in the mood and in the warmth of our relations. He did much to re-create the old spirit of partnership that we had during the war. He did much to undo the harm done by the follies of hon. Members opposite. We hope to restore the prestige and authority of the British people. Meanwhile, I do not think&#x2014;[<i>Interruption</i>.] Hon. Members opposite will not like a lot that is coming.<br/>
We ought not to forget the significance of the radical change in policy and outlook in America since the old days. Any of those who knew America in the old days quite realise the significance of that change. Bred to a long tradition of isolation, with a deep-rooted hatred of war, hatred of foreign entanglements of every kind, the American people have now accepted responsibilities upon a prodigious scale. They hate war, and if large American armies are now in Korea and if 100,000 casualties have been suffered in Korea, do not let us forget that they took on this job in a spirit of idealism and genuine devotion to the cause of collective security.<br/>
We all remember the thrill when we felt, at the start of this terrible campaign, that there was not going to be appeasement, and that there would be an attempt

to challenge this aggression. We all feel in these dark and rather gloomy periods that there may be some slight divergencies arising, but let us remember that they are divergencies of method and not of purpose. Our objective is the same. Our objective is peace, and not the peace of surrender but the peace of honourable and successful curtailment of aggression wherever it may come.<br/>
But this is not to say that British policy should be subservient to American policy. On the contrary, Britain and the British Commonwealth and Empire have their own rights and duties. One of the most vital is to re-establish the power and prestige of the British people at home and overseas, and to rebuild their economic strength. This we are determined to do with our partners in the Commonwealth, for on the self-reliance and strength of the Empire as well as upon the revived unity and strength of Europe depends whether we can, with the United States, play our full part in the dangerous years that may lie ahead.<br/>
It is the independent economic and military power, both of the Commonwealth and of Europe, that are vital to the stability of the grand alliance. No one wishes us to be satellites of the Americans, least of all the American people, but it is equally necessary that we should not, out of false pride or petty logic-chopping, try to seek out occasions for dispute where none exists. Throughout his speech to Congress, my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister insisted over and over again on the tripartite character of this effort, Britain and the British Empire and Commonwealth, America and Europe. I sincerely believe that it is under Providence that these three great forces are joined together today. I say let no man seek to put them asunder.<br/>
There are bound to be differences of method and circumstances. The Foreign Secretary very frankly referred to certain points on which Her Majesty's Government and the Government of the United States had not been in agreement. One of those points was in relation to Japan and her relations with Formosa. He preferred one way, and the State Department preferred another. There was no attempt to disguise this either by the Secretary of State or by the Foreign


Secretary. I think the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Lewisham, South (Mr. H. Morrison), who moved the Motion, tried to make something of this incident. I could not see what relevance it had to this Motion, for this matter was handled by the Foreign Secretary, who explained all the circumstances to us. The right hon. Gentleman said that there had been differences of opinion, but the Motion says that the Foreign Secretary has carried out a splendid policy, and it was the Foreign Secretary and not the Prime Minister who carried out this particular part of our relations.<br/>
Of course, there are other points of contact. The Prime Minister ventured to observe that the Chinese Communist refugees in Formosa should not be allowed to be massacred by an expedition from the mainland. I noted that the Leader of the Opposition agreed with this proposition, so there is not very much in this. It is also true that, while Her Majesty's Government have recognised the Chinese Communist Government, the Government of the United States have not. I am not quite so sure how far the Chinese Communist Government have recognised us&#x2014;but we will let that pass.<br/>
It is true that some Americans&#x2014;it happens in free and democratic countries &#x2014;criticise their own Government and even try to embarrass them. That is not altogether unknown here, so that is a link between us. It is true that there are some Americans who put forward dangerous, and perhaps we may think foolish, ideas, but surely we must all be impressed by the control and the responsible attitude of those who are actually in charge of the American Administration. There may be argument about what may or may not happen regarding the armistice in Korea, the negotiations for which have been so prolonged, but there is no doubt that both Her Majesty's Government and the Government of the United States are united in hoping that the armistice may take place as soon as possible and be followed by a general political settlement. There are other differences small in kind and character.<br/>
We must remember that the Americans in this war have had actually more casualties than they suffered in the whole

of the First World War, nor should we forget the heavy burden that has fallen on our French Allies in Indo-China. Very few people realise the terrible cost to them in blood and treasure, and how the difficulties have been increased, alas, by the tragic death of their great soldier-statesman, General de Lattre de Tassigny.</p>

<p>I cannot give way, because of the time that has been agreed upon. We, too, have a very difficult and baffling task in Malaya. Do not let us forget that if peace is indivisible, so perhaps war may be, and that it will be no encouragement to our boys in Malaya or in Hong Kong to try to make out that there are fundamental differences of policy between the Government of Great Britain and the Government of the United States.<br/>
Even while he was speaking, the former Foreign Secretary, I felt, was not very happy. He was also unhappy when the Prime Minister was speaking and when his right hon. Friend the Member for Ebbw Vale (Mr. Bevan) was speaking. The former Foreign Secretary used a great variety of quotation but did not make much of a case against the Prime Minister. He told us that he disliked the Prime Minister's instincts, rather like the man who said, "This animal is very vicious. When attacked it defends itself."<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman soon found the force of this remark. When the counter-attack came, he and his friends were simply blown into the sea. Talk about "hoist with your own petard"&#x2014;I have never seen any boomerang come back the way this Motion has come back upon them. It was a real knock-out. And what made it all the more galling was to watch the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Ebbw Vale gloating while they took the count.<br/>
The Prime Minister, as was his right and duty, summarised the narrative about our agreement with the United States regarding certain possible contingencies in Korea. Naturally my right hon. Friend had to trace the beginning of the negotiations in order that the later stages could be told as a coherent story. He was criticised for doing so, but, since the Motion criticises the Prime Minister for failing to give adequate expression to the policy of the previous Government, how


could he defend himself, and how could the House and the country judge whether he had departed from or followed it unless we knew what was the policy of the previous Government?<br/>
When this came, the official Labour Party was stunned. The right hon. Member for Ebbw Vale was very quick to get up and move for the documents and it was rather significant that the Motion was seconded by the hon. Member for Nelson and Colne (Mr. S. Silverman). Of course, the right hon. Member for Ebbw Vale would dearly like to see these documents published. I think he would like to get the serial rights for the "Tribune," unless, of course, the "Daily Worker" had a prior claim upon them, or perhaps the "Daily Mirror" might publish them under the title "Whose finger was it on the trigger, after all?"<br/>
This has certainly been a strange and hypocritical Motion.</p>

<p>We have gone a long way since then. I thought the mind of the right hon. Gentleman worked a bit quicker than that. As I say, I suppose the Motion is intended to divide the Government, for it seeks at the same time to praise the Foreign Secretary and to censure the Prime Minister. Of course, it is based upon their own conception of loyalty and team spirit. They really think they can drive a wedge between the

Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary, regardless of the affectionate association between our two leaders during some of the darkest and most perilous days in British history. If they believe that, they are very ingenuous. Perhaps the true purpose of the Motion is not to divide the Government, but to unite the Opposition. If that is the object, I am bound to say that as a tactical exercise it has been singularly unsuccessful.</p>

<p>With all their differences, the speakers chosen by the party opposite have only one thing in common: that they seem, for some reason or another that I do not understand, to be somewhat allergic to the Prime Minister. The former Foreign Secretary has never disguised his dislike of him, and has made taunts which he has had afterwards to withdraw; but today he is generally credited with the honour, if it be an honour, of being the creator and inspirer of the "warmongering" cry.<br/>
He tried to defend this today by a piece of casuistry which I think he would not have ventured upon if he had known that he was going to be acclaimed and saluted as one of the leaders of the great Government that, with five years of effort and vast expenditure of public funds, was just on the point of producing the British atom bomb. It is a pity that the tests were not ready last October&#x2014;or, perhaps, they were ready; I do not know. If the explosion had taken place in October, it really might have been some explosion then&#x0021;<br/>

<p>I wish to raise a point of order concerning the conduct of the hon. and gallant Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Brigadier Mackeson), who acts as one of the Government Whips. I am raising this point because I think it would be difficult for my right hon. Friend the Member for Lewisham, South (Mr. H. Morrison) to raise it himself&#x2014;[<i>Interruption</i>.] My right hon. Friend has been the victim of an act of schoolboyish vulgarity. It was obvious to a number of my hon. Friends&#x2014;</p>

<p>It was obvious to a number of my hon. Friends that the hon. and gallant Gentleman, not content with the quite natural jubilation which we should not grudge him when he declared the result of the Division, proceeded to add to that by what one might call, I suppose,

a technical assault on my right hon. Friend. [<i>Interruption</i>.] With great respect, Mr. Speaker, I am on my feet because you have called me to address you on a point of order. May I inform hon. Members opposite that I propose to remain on my feet until I have said what I have to say? I want to submit to you, Sir, that the gravity of this matter is not the act itself, which is trivial, but the attitude which it represented of, as I say, vulgarity, disrespect to the House and ignorance of the normal politenesses which are required of a Government Whip.</p>

<p>If I may say so, for two years in this House I fulfilled the duties


of junior Government Whip. It will be within the experience of all who have filled that office that they often had to contain themselves in patience and to sit in silence listening to the very great provocations of their political opponents. [<i>Interruption</i>.] I would explain to the Patronage Secretary&#x2014;and the Patronage Secretary, having interrupted me, might at least have the good manners to listen to the comments I am about to make; I see that at the moment it is the Prime Minister who is prompting the Patronage Secretary, instead of the other way round.</p>

<p>I must ask the hon. Gentleman to come to the gist of this matter. I am still completely in ignorance about what happened. I understand that some sort of technical assault was made on the right hon. Member for Lewisham, South (Mr. H. Morrison). He does not look any the worse to me. I should be glad to hear this matter speedily disposed of.</p>

<p>I submit to your Ruling, Mr. Speaker, and I will put the matter very briefly. I thought what happened was in the view of yourself and most hon. Members. What the hon. and gallant Gentleman who is supposed to support the dignity of the Government Front Bench did was to strike my right hon. Friend lightly across the forehead with his hand. I quite agree that my right hon. Friend appears none the worse for it, but I submit very seriously to you that conduct of this kind does not conform with the dignity of the House and that it is particularly offensive when it comes from somebody who is supposed to keep himself aloof from the heat of controversy, but who has shown on previous occasions that his arrogance of manner and behaviour disqualify him from the office which he holds.</p>

<p>The right hon. Member for Lewisham, South (Mr. H. Morrison) made a joking remark to me. If I was in any way discourteous to him, I ask his pardon and the pardon of the House. I offer him my unqualified apology and assure him that what I did was meant in the best possible taste. I stand rebuked by the hon. Member for

Fulham, East (Mr. M. Stewart) and his colleagues, including, of course, the hon. Member for Dudley (Mr. Wigg), who sets us such an excellent example in these matters.</p>

<p>I am very much obliged to my hon. Friend the Member for Fulham, East (Mr. M. Stewart). It was good of him to take up the matter, because there was an assault&#x2014;a cuff on the head which, I admit, was less dangerous than the last attempted assault on me&#x2014;throwing a penny&#x2014;which might have caused great injury. But I accept entirely the spirit of what the hon. and gallant Gentleman the Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Brigadier Mackeson) has said. He has expressed his regret; I accept his apology and, as far as I am concerned, the incident is closed.</p>

<p>I beg to move,
<q>That an humble Address be presented to Her Majesty, praying that the Milk (Control and Maximum Prices) (Great Britain) (Amendment No. 3) Order, 1951 (S.I., 1951, No. 2065), dated 28th November, 1951, a copy of which was laid before this House on 29th November, 1951, be annulled.</q>
I think it would be for the convenience of the House and would very much expedite our consideration of these matters if we could have a general debate on this Prayer and the two succeeding Prayers on the Order Paper. The second and third are:
<q>That an humble Address be presented to Her Majesty, praying that the Milk (Control and Maximum Prices) (Northern Ireland) (Amendment No. 2) Order, 1951 (S.I., 1951, No. 2066), dated 28th November, 1951, a copy of which was laid before this House on 29th November, 1951, be annulled.</q>

<p>I am much obliged. Perhaps I can mention briefly what these Statutory Instruments do. The first Order, No. 2065, is an amending Order increasing as from 1st December last the maximum prices of milk by 4d. a gallon. The second Order, No. 2066, is also an amending Order which increases from 1st December, 1951, the maximum retail prices of milk to the same amount in Northern Ireland.<br/>
The point in which I am interested in the third Order&#x2014;Order No. 2067 of 1951&#x2014;is that it extends the scale of maximum prices of classified sugar confectionery, previously limited to 5s. a pound, to 5s. 10s. a pound.<br/>
If I may deal with the last Order first, I think it is objectionable because this does not seem to me to be a time when we should allow manufacturers to increase the maximum prices. If the manufacturers&#x2014;and no doubt they have proved their case&#x2014;could not, in fact, produce these lines at cheaper prices, I think the Minister ought to have obliged them to concentrate upon the production of the cheaper lines.<br/>
I think that is especially reasonable in view of the fact that the Minister himself has progressively reduced, and is no doubt going on reducing, the sweet ration. I know quite well from experience what arguments can be raised about this. It can be argued that on a reduced turnover the unit profit margin must be increased. But we have to realise that in manufacture and all trading concerns we have to take the ups and downs. It would have been far better if the Minister had resisted this application to increase the maximum prices of these lines.<br/>
But I regard as far more serious the first two Orders, which increase the prices of milk. I am concerned primarily with the retail prices of milk. Any consideration of the question of a price in-

crease of this character must depend upon the policy of the Minister and the Government about food subsidies, and I am in this difficulty&#x2014;I quite frankly anticipate what the Parliamentary Secretary may be going to say&#x2014;that the House can no longer place any reliance whatever on anything the Parliamentary Secretary may say. [HON. MEMBERS: "Why not?"]<br/>
I will give an illustration. The House will remember that we discussed the question of the Christmas bonuses, and the Minister and his Parliamentary Secretary said they were driven to the course they took because of the stock position. What did the Minister say in this House only last week when I challenged him on the heavy stocks that his Ministry is carrying? These are his words:
<q>I tried to explain that these vast stocks were mostly acquired up to November last year."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 21st February, 1952; Vol. 496, c. 521.]</q>
I invited the right hon. Gentleman to apologise to the House&#x2014;</p>

<p>On a point of order. May I ask you Sir, what the Christmas bonuses and the vast stocks that have been accumulated have to do with milk or chocolate or sugar confectionery or cocoa products?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1952-02-26a.1068.1" hansard_membership_id="8300" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/22151" speakername="Mr. Willey" colnum="1068" time="">
<p>The point I am prepared to argue is this. We are discussing a price increase consequent upon the decision of the Government to keep within the subsidy ceiling. If that is so, then surely we cannot be precluded from considering the stock position, because the realisation of stocks affects the subsidy position.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1952-02-26a.1068.2" hansard_membership_id="10753" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/28935" speakername="Mr. Taylor" colnum="1068" time="">
<p>I suggest that there are no stocks of fresh milk that are kept. I suggest that to the hon. Member, who is now making his case just as badly as he did when he was Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Food.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1952-02-26a.1068.3" hansard_membership_id="8300" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/22151" speakername="Mr. Willey" colnum="1068" time="">
<p>The subsidy position of the Ministry of Food is affected by the amount of its sales. If it sells more, for instance, of a subsidised food, then it has to face an increased amount which must be provided within the subsidy ceiling, if the policy is to have a subsidy ceiling. However, I shall not deal with this any further except to touch upon this further point regarding stocks. The Minister last week, also referring to the


stock position of subsidised foods, referred to tea. He said that tea stocks were not&#x2014;</p>

<p>I think the hon. Gentleman is going beyond the Order now. There is nothing about tea in this, is there?</p>

<p>May I call your attention to the fact, Sir, that these Orders are signed by the Minister of Food? Surely it is proper for my hon. Friend to argue that, because of the statement made about stocks, this signature on the Order can no longer have the credence of this House?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1952-02-26a.1069.2" hansard_membership_id="9996" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/17624" speakername="Mr. Deputy-Speaker" colnum="1069" time="">
<p>No. The signature is not actually part of the Order.</p>

<p>Surely, in discussing whether or not this House should accept this Order we are up against the fact that it proposes an increase of 4d. in the price per gallon of milk. In considering whether this is justified or not we must have regard to the total amount available to the Ministry of Food for subsidies. Therefore, it is surely open to hon. Members to argue that the price of milk should not be increased, but that that of some other commodity affected by the subsidy should be.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1952-02-26a.1069.4" hansard_membership_id="9996" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/17624" speakername="Mr. Deputy-Speaker" colnum="1069" time="">
<p>I think the hon. Gentleman dealt with the larger point. He is now going on to things like tea. We could deal with such subjects for a very long time.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1952-02-26a.1069.5" hansard_membership_id="8300" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/22151" speakername="Mr. Willey" colnum="1069" time="">
<p>I have no wish to prolong the debate unduly, but I would return to this point about stocks. It is relevant in two senses. One is that the stocks held by the Ministry are worth a certain cash value. Whether that cash value is realised, and so made available, is a matter which does affect the financial position of the Ministry of Food. It also affects, directly, the subsidy position, and although I cannot anticipate what the Parliamentary Secretary is going to say, I am content to leave the matter in this way.<br/>
I will not, in view of your Ruling, Mr. Deputy-Speaker, pursue this subject any further. But, as I mentioned tea, I would just say that if we have lower stocks of tea now compared with 12 months ago, we ought to be told where the tea has

gone, because the Trade and Navigation Returns show that we have received considerably more tea than over the previous 12 months.</p>

<p>I really must ask you, Sir, if it is possible for us to discuss the whole question of food subsidies on these three narrowly drawn Orders? I ask that because the hon. Member opposite says, in discussing the question of the increase in the price of milk, or chocolate, that it will be legitimate to discuss the subsidy on tea and other food products, and the stocks which the Ministry may, or may not, hold. Would you please say if we can discuss the whole question of the food subsidies?</p>

<p>On a point of order. Since the hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. C. S. Taylor) has admitted that he did not know which Order referred to what, and that he had not read the Orders, may I explain that they provide for &#x00A3;6 million reduction in the food subsidies? Therefore, I respectfully suggest that the subject is obviously open for discussion.</p>

<p>No, the whole of the food subsidies cannot be discussed. The first Order, which we are now discussing, deals only with milk, and the hon. Member for Sunderland, North (Mr. Willey) said he was about to finish the point he was making.</p>

<p>I intended to indicate that I was ready and willing to leave the point about stocks, as you say, Sir, but I wanted to deal with the subsidy issue because this price increase becomes necessary as a result of the Ministry having fixed the subsidy ceiling at &#x00A3;410 million. Is it the case that the Ministry has out-run that and the increase is, therefore, necessary? Will the Parliamentary Secretary confirm that?</p>

<p>I think the whole House has been a little dismayed by the behaviour of the hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. C. S. Taylor) in not appreciating which Order was being discussed. It was agreed when Mr. Speaker was in the Chair that the three Orders might be taken together, and my hon. Friend the Member for


Sunderland, North (Mr. Willey) was dealing with the third that is the one which deals with chocolate.<br/>
The whole point of what is the right price for these commodities must depend on how many of these commodities there are in stock and can be brought out at the old price, or what profit the Ministry can make beyond this and, thus, for that reason, we are making our inquiry into the stock position. If we cannot discuss the stock position, there is no basis for knowing upon what it is that the charge is based. If there are no stocks, for example, one would expect a far higher charge than if there were stocks in existence.</p>

<p>It seems to me that the House is called upon to discuss the increase in the price of milk. It is quite impossible for us to make up our minds on that issue unless we also make reference to the other subsidies which the Government have to bear in mind because of the ceiling imposed over the whole range of commodities. It is impossible to see whether the price of milk should be raised without discussing what effect that policy will have on the other items covered by the subsidies.</p>

<p>On a point of order. I had deferred raising this point of order until one of the hon. Members from Northern Ireland was here. I have been very worried since I have been in the Chamber this evening, because one Order relates entirely to Northern Ireland and it has always been the custom, certainly in the last Government, when an Order relating to Northern Ireland has been debated in the House for one of the Ministers from the Home Office to be present to deal with it. That is most important.<br/>
I see that one has just arrived. He has not heard what has been said. I also understand that he is the Minister for Welsh Affairs. There are two Ministers in the Home Office who are concerned with Northern Ireland, and it is an insult to that great and loyal part of Northern

Ireland that it should here be fobbed off with a reply on behalf of the Government by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Food. This is a serious point. We are not being treated with the dignity that this matter deserves. I hope to catch your eye later, Mr. Deputy-Speaker, and make much of that point, because it is relevant.</p>

<p>On a point of order. As an attack has been made upon me by the hon.

<p>The Minister of Food need not have raised these prices. In an explanation which he has given publicly he


said that he has been obliged to raise them because of the decision to keep within the food subsidies ceiling of &#x00A3;410 million. In explaining to the House how it comes about that at present the subsidies are running at over &#x00A3;410 million, he has given us some very confusing figures. The statement attached to the Supplementary Estimates is open to some serious points of criticism.</p>

<p>I return to the explanation which has been given by the Minister of the present price increase. He said that it is necessary to increase the price of milk to enable the Ministry to remain within the &#x00A3;410 million which the Government has agreed should be the subsidy ceiling. It can be said that the hon. Gentleman, and his right hon. Friend, if they are in difficulties always quote precedent. They say that they are doing what the last Government did. The hon. Gentleman is not doing that.<br/>
The last Government, when it thought it proper, exceeded the ceiling which had been set. It is true that when the Chancellor of the Exchequer in the Labour Government dealt with prices, or possible price increases, in the summer during the economic debate he suggested that if there were further pressure upon the food subsidy ceiling there would probably have to be price increases. But the circumstances then were very different.<br/>
My right hon. Friend the then Chancellor of the Exchequer said there would have to be re-introduction of price controls, and we at the Ministry of Food took steps for the re-introduction of fish price control. If that control had been proceeded with, prices would be much less than they are now.</p>

<p>I want now, Sir Charles, to deal with the point to which you asked me to address myself&#x2014;the effect of the


annulment of this Order&#x2014;and also to point out by way of illustration that there is no comparison between the position obtaining today and that obtaining in the summer when the Chancellor in the last Government dealt with the question of such price increases. If this Order is annulled the Treasury will have to allow a raising of the food subsidy ceiling.<br/>
The question therefore arises whether there is money available at the Treasury to allow a raising of the food subsidy ceiling. I understand that there is, but there was not in the summer, because in the summer the Treasury were proceeding on the assumption that we should be able fully to complete that part of the re-armament programme which had been planned for this financial year. We have now received the information that it is no longer possible to do that. The money has been raised on the assumption that it would be possible, so that if this Prayer be successful, and if the Order be annulled, we need not be unduly concerned, because the Treasury have the money to avoid any unpleasant consequences.<br/>
I want to deal with another reason why the hon. Gentleman should not persist with this Order. As I pointed out the other night, I realise that he is, with his right hon. Friend, a National Liberal: he is not a Conservative. I have tried to find out what are the policies of the National Liberals on such matters as we are discussing tonight&#x2014;price controls&#x2014;and the only statement of policy on what we are discussing tonight that I can discover is that the National Liberals
<q>believe that it is essential to freedom that money should be allowed to fructify in the pockets of the people.</q>
Well, I do not know what that means. I do not even know whether I am in order&#x2014;</p>

<p>No, Sir. This is a recent statement by the National Liberal Party. If the hon. Gentleman pays any regard to what he said to the electorate he ought to feel that now is the appropriate moment to withdraw this Order. But this, after all, is not a National Liberal Administration: it is a Conservative

Adminstration. I therefore looked at the Conservative Party programme to see whether they had any mandate for increasing the price of milk, and I find that they have no such mandate.<br/>
I want to keep this part of my speech as short as possible, so I will quote from only one of the pamphlets issued during the General Election. It was headed:

<p>I indicated that I do not want to dwell for long on this point, but I think it is in order to say that the action being proposed, the present price increase, is contrary to the undertakings and pledges that the party opposite gave to the people at the recent General Election.

<q>hard up through high prices and fed up with small food rations.</q></p>

<p>Hon. Gentlemen opposite agree that that was their Election policy. It was certainly agreed by all those who observed the election to be the major factor which gave the party opposite their present slender majority.<br/>
If the hon. Gentleman has any political integrity, then I think he should accept what financial consequences there may be, but withdraw this price increase. It is within the power of the present Government to avoid this price increase. When this is avoidable, to come to the House now, after pledges so recently given, is a political disgrace, reflecting upon the party opposite. Another reason why this avoidable price increase should be avoided today is that we are living in a dangerously inflationary situation.<br/>
The Minister of Food, referred the other day to price increases generally and made comparison with the position obtaining before. But this is the true comparison. We know now that the January figure for the cost-of-living index showed an increase of two points. In the first three months of the Tory Administration, the cost-of-living has gone up three points. Let us compare it with the previous three months of the Labour


Government. Then the cost-of-living went up one point&#x2014;</p>

<p>I will say no more on this and pass on to my next point.<br/>
If we compare with the immediately preceding three months or the corresponding three months last year, the rate of increase of the cost-of-living index at present it is three times what it was under a Labour Government. That is a very serious inflationary position, in which the Government, if it be within its power, ought to avoid all price increases. Supposing the hon. Gentleman says that, in spite of all these arguments and, in spite of the weight of the case against him, he must have, nevertheless, a price increase to provide this sum to set-off against the subsidy ceiling, why should it be milk of all foodstuffs?<br/>
The hon. Gentleman, if he runs true to form, again will quote precedent and say we increased the price of milk. That is the very reason, of course, why he should not increase the price of milk. It has already borne an increase. When we increased the price of milk on a previous occasion in the summer, and the party opposite did not pray against it, we carefully considered what effect it might have upon the consumption. We came to the conclusion that it would not affect consumption adversely to any marked degree. We were right.<br/>
Although production of milk, as the present Minister of Food now says, was less than the previous year owing to the weather, the consumption of fresh milk in 1951 was greater than the previous year. If we take the two months before the imposition of this price increase, the con-

sumption of fresh milk, which is the milk affected by this Order, was greater than for the corresponding period of the previous year. If we look at the position now, though it is early to dogmatise about it, the situation obtaining after the imposition of the present price increase shows that there has been a very serious fall in the consumption of fresh milk.<br/>
If we compare December, 1951, which is the first month after the imposition of the price increase we are now discussing, with December, 1950, we find that there was a fall of two million gallons of milk, which, I believe, is a very serious matter for the country. I believe it indicates that we were right. I will give another illustration which will assist the House in coming to a judgment on this question. We faced then, and will face for a considerable time, difficulties in the autumn of the year in matching up milk production with consumption. We face a difficulty this year.<br/>
The suggestion was made in certain quarters that we ought to increase the price of milk, so that it would be easier to match production with consumption.</p>

<p>For the last 10 minutes the hon. Gentleman has been using generalities about suggestions made in certain quarters. Will he tell us what those quarters were?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1952-02-26a.1078.1" hansard_membership_id="8300" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/22151" speakername="Mr. Willey" colnum="1078" time="">
<p>As I have repeatedly told the hon. Gentleman, I have a habit of making my speech in my own way.<br/>
I am telling the House that the suggestion came from certain responsible quarters&#x2014;[HON. MEMBERS: "What quarters?"] If the hon. Gentleman and his colleagues will conduct some research, they will find out from which quarters they came. The argument was seriously made that we could avoid this recurrent difficulty of matching consumption with production by increasing the price. It was for that very reason that we were not prepared to consider that suggestion.<br/>
Milk is not a food which ought to bear that increased price because it has already borne an increase in the summer. The fears which we had about a further increase in price seem to be borne out already, although it is too early to say definitely that this is so. If we look to milk as a food, we find that, for the financial year, milk is bearing today a


much less subsidy than was anticipated when the original estimates were laid before the House. In other words, we cannot say that it is because of the increased cost of milk that it ought to bear an increased price. The facts are just to the contrary.<br/>
If we take the unit subsidy margin, we estimated, at the beginning of this financial year, that milk would bear a unit margin of 3d. per quart. The last figure I have seen for 1951&#x2013;52 shows that milk is bearing a unit subsidy of 2&#x00BC;d., and this price increase has been operating only a short time. Therefore, it is quite clear that the unit subsidy margin on milk today is less than 2d. In other words, the Government, by this price increase, have heavily cut into the subsidy enjoyed by milk.<br/>
It cannot be said that this price increase is consequent upon the special Farm Price Review. I will tell the House what the National Farmers' Union have to say about this:
<q>That 4d. on milk; it goes to the Exchequer. To correct any misunderstanding about the recent increase in the price of milk the N.F.U. wish to emphasise that the 4d. per gallon increase in the retail price goes, not to the farmer nor the retailer, but to the Exchequer. This 4d. increase has no direct connection with the award made at the recent special Price Review, when the price paid to the farmer for milk was increased by only.68d. per gallon to off-set higher production costs resulting from the recent agricultural wage award.</q>
This price increase operated before the special price award was made. They also anticipated what I regretfully anticipate.
<q>Should, however, consumption of milk fall because of the higher retail price, the retailers' income would be less than before.</q>
I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will not quarrel with the statement by the N.F.U. about the increase in the price of milk. If the Minister of Food had wanted to save money at the expense of the milk subsidy he could have had a look at the subsidy now enjoyed by some of the trade users. I know from experience the administrative difficulties involved, but I think that if he was determined to reduce the subsidy on milk it would have been more profitable for him to spend his time looking at this particular problem regarding the milk subsidy, rather than penalising the housewife and children which is what he is doing by this price increase.<br/>
If one is obliged to consider price increases consequent upon the decision to

remain within the subsidy ceiling we have to look at all the foodstuffs. We have to look at the position from various points of view. One of the most important that 1 and my right hon. Friend considered was the nutritional angle. If a price increase is obligatory we have to pay attention to all the consequences nutritionally and see whether they are avoidable.<br/>
I am quite sure that as the old "Radio Doctor" the hon. Gentleman would pay regard to the nutritional consequences of the decision which he might feel obliged to take regarding price increases. I know that the right hon. Gentleman has a particular love for animal proteins because he has already told the House so. He has stressed the importance of animal proteins and gave a picture of the men at the benches not pursuing their work as energetically as they might for want of animal proteins. He said we might get a smaller daily output of work if we could not increase the amount of animal proteins in our food.<br/>
The foods that one would surely safeguard and the foods to which one would look if one wanted more animal proteins are meat, bacon, fish, rabbits, butter, cheese, eggs and, of course, milk. What has the hon. Gentleman done to help the worker to get more animal proteins? He has cut the meat ration. The meat ration is lower than it has ever been. He has cut the butter ration&#x2014;</p>

<p>Is the hon. Member saying that the meat ration is lower than it was last year?</p>

<p>Yes, the meat ration is lower than it was a year ago. Those are the two ration cuts, and looking at the problem of what price increases were to be selected the hon. Gentleman knew that he had cut the meat ration, although the Minister has told us that we have larger stocks than last year. He cut the meat ration and, by keeping a temporary cut permanent, he has cut the butter ration.<br/>
He has also looked to the other animal protein foods. The Minister told the House on Monday that he has increased the price of bacon and of cheese. The price of fish has increased because he did not re-impose controls. Fish and meat paste has increased in price, rabbits have increased in price, and now he has


increased the price of milk. There is hardly an animal protein food that has not been either reduced in the amount of the ration or increased in price.<br/>
It seems that the hon. Gentleman has specially sorted out the animal protein foods when he has been considering either ration cuts or price increases. The animal protein food we are now discussing is most important of all. The explanation can only be that the co-ordinating peer, for some reason or other, is determined to frustrate and humble the hon. Gentleman. Of all the attacks that both of them have made upon the housewife this is the most objectionable.<br/>
Milk is entirely home produced. We are all proud that we have increased milk production by almost half as much again as it was before the war; and I am proud of what the farmers have done. I am also proud of the advantage that has been taken to give a subsidy on milk to serve a social purpose.<br/>
What do we find? While milk production has increased by half as much again compared with before the war, the consumption of fresh milk by the working class has been doubled and by the poorest classes of all has been nearly trebled. As for the milk policy of the previous Government, we are proud that by price control and subsidy we have enabled those in greatest need to enjoy the increased production that has been achieved.<br/>
But I was rather worried when I was at the Ministry of Food that some evidence was already appearing that people with large families were not enjoying as much milk as they ought to have, in spite of the welfare schemes. I see the hon. Gentleman nods; he is equally aware of this factor. Therefore, I should have thought the last thing he would have done would have been to increase the price of milk in considering the whole range of subsidised foodstuff's.<br/>
I can only think that by this step the hon. Gentleman is taking a deliberate step calculated to discourage the increased consumption of fresh milk to make it easier to match consumption and production. I would rather he faced the difficulties. He is setting the clock back and marking the beginning of a radical change in subsidy policy.<br/>
The Order clearly reveals the different objectives of the two political parties. It

is admitted that we on this side believe that the subsidy should be used primarily, nowadays, for social ends; the party opposite have never agreed with this and they believe that it should serve as some economic device. Viscount Waverley said a few days ago that this scheme of food subsidies was not conceived as a social service, it was in essence an economic device to keep the level of wages and prices stable.</p>

<p>On a point of order. It was ruled by your predecessor in the Chair, Mr. Speaker, that it was grossly out of Order to discuss food subsidies generally. That reference that is being made to a speech in another place is a specific reference to food subsidies generally. Is that out of order?</p>

<p>I was about to rise to my feet because I thought the hon. Gentleman was straying outside the confines of what was permissible under a Statutory Order.

<p>I apologise if I have gone beyond the limits of what is permissible. I will conclude by saying that a choice has to be taken of which foods should bear the increase. Taking the choice the hon. Gentleman has done has revealed the political difference between the two sides of the House. These Orders do mark a difference in outlook towards food price increases, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will pay regard to what has been said and think again.</p>

<p>I beg to second the Motion.<br/>
As the hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. C. S. Taylor) seemed to think I said something to misrepresent the intervention he made I will give a specific answer to his question. If he will refer to the three Orders he will find that the two Orders which increase the price of milk are the Milk Orders and the Order dealing with confectionery is the Confectionery Order. I hope that makes the matter plain to him.<br/>
The Order relating to confectionery increases the price by 10d. per lb., and I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary, if and when he replies&#x2014;no doubt in accordance with the new tradition of the House he will postpone his reply to the latest possible moment&#x2014;to tell us what are the costs that have caused the increase, how this conforms with the anti-inflationary policy of the Cabinet, how it conforms with the detailed criticisms on prices we were subjected to week after week in the last Parliament, and how it conforms with the policy put to the electors at the last election.<br/>
There was some dubiety last night on the question of declaration of interest, so may I say that I have no interest myself in the price of milk. I am 49 years, and for the last 48 years I have not been a large-scale consumer. But my interest in milk was aroused some 27 years ago when I was a member of a county council in a dairy farming county and a member of the agricultural education committee. We initiated a policy of supplying milk to school children if they could afford to pay for it. We supplied one-third of a pint a day to children at a small price.<br/>
We did not do that because we thought children needed it, but because we could not in those days sell the milk. But we were faced with the difficulty that the Leicestershire cows were not fully apprised of the details of what may be called the Orpington theory of supply and demand. There were in the county many families that greatly needed milk, but in the terms of economics there was no effective demand because many families could not afford to pay, and the cows not having been apprised of this, and being probably indignant at the advice of the Farmers' Union that half the milk should be poured down the drain, went on producing and we had some difficulty in disposing of the milk.<br/>
But the substance of this point, which we wish to convey to Her Majesty if this Prayer is successful, is that we happened to have a very active medical officer who took the weights and sizes of the children who got approximately a third of a pint a day, and those who did not get any; and the result of that remarkable test was so startling that I have never forgotten it but regard it as one

of the most graphic political illustrations I have ever known.<br/>
The Parliamentary Secretary, who often gave us advice when we knew him as the "Radio Doctor," has often spoken of the beneficial results of taking this commodity; I have not followed the advice in detail, but have well understood that he would not argue with me if I suggested that, in these days of strain, a substantial increase in the price of this commodity becomes a matter of great moment.<br/>
There has been some discussion, and you, Sir, have the advantage of advice from your predecessor upon the subject of the ambit of this debate. But may I inform you that the Parliamentary Secretary was good enough to give the House a Written answer to a Question on this subject recently and what he said was the result of this Order is that &#x00A3;2 million will go to the producers and distributors of milk, and &#x00A3;6 million to the Treasury?<br/>
In those circumstances, I submit that it is well within the Rules of debate that we should venture to suggest that one of the matters which Her Majesty may have to consider if our Prayer is successful is where that money is going and whether it ought to go to that precise destination. In the Parliamentary Secretary's answer there was reference to an increase last May&#x2014;[HON. MEMBERS: "No."]&#x2014;well, I may have got the wrong month, but I think the Parliamentary Secretary will agree that about that time there was a price increase and I would ask him now if he wishes to intervene and tell us&#x2014;because we were not given the information previously&#x2014;how much went to the retailer, or the wholesaler, how much to the farmer, and how much to the Treasury. I am suggesting that not a penny piece went to the Treasury. Will the hon. Gentleman answer?</p>

<p>It was always the policy of the last Government for the price to be kept down on the principle that milk should be a subsidised item. But the result of the operation of this Order is a tax of 3&#x00BC;d. to help to pay for re-armament, or whatever one cares to suggest, and that is the most shocking thing that I think I have heard in this House for some time&#x2014;[HON. MEMBERS: "Oh."] Well, perhaps that is putting it a little


too high, but it is one of many shocking things. Of course, the Parliamentary Secretary may say that it is not a tax because it reduces the subsidy, but either it is a reduction of subsidy or a tax on subsidised milk.<br/>
Surely he will tell us what were the reasons that prompted the Government to take this action because I understand that the National Farmers' Union does not agree that the price increase was necessitated. We have had some unusual things happen in the House during this debate. We on this side, during the tenure of office of Her Majesty's present Government, have not used the weapon of Prayers against Statutory Rules and Orders at all, although in the last House there was a deliberate campaign of organised obstruction on the part of the party opposite by the use of this procedure.</p>

<p>I appreciate what you say, Mr. Speaker. I will put my point as I had intended to put it. We regard it as important because this is the first Prayer that we have tabled since 25th October. We have deliberately abstained from the policy which was adopted in the last Parliament of using Prayers as a political weapon instead of as a means of resolving social injustices and legislative anomalies.<br/>
We ask the Parliamentary Secretary to be frank about this. Even in his Written answers there seems a certain coyness about this matter, an unassuming modesty which we have not come to associate with him when we have heard him addressing a wider audience throughout the land.<br/>
How did it come about? Who decided it? Was it decided by the Minister of Food? Was it decided by the noble Lord the Minister for the Co-ordination of Food and Agriculture, or by the Cabinet? Or did it come from above? Or was it a suggestion by the Treasury, who said that they were hard up? We are entitled to know. I would willingly give way to the hon. Gentleman if he wishes to answer. We are entitled to an answer now. [HON. MEMBERS: "He cannot answer."]<br/>
I have referred to the fact that this is the first time that we have prayed against a Statutory Rule and Order in this Parliament. If I were expressing my own opinion, I should not hesitate to say that in these days of encircling gloom, when the bruised and battered shoulders of the British people are having new and unprecedented burdens put upon them, when the anxious observer looking with foreboding at the political sky sees only the darkening clouds which presage the gathering storm, when this once the great palladium of our liberties is fast becoming the necropolis of the people's aspirations, I should not hesitate to suggest that we might well be doing our duty by sitting here <i>de die in diem</i> grappling with the problems that confront the nation and with the increasing burdens that confront humanity; and I should be willing to take my humble share of that task. But my right hon. Friends above the Gangway have not yet taken that serious decision, and I bow to their judgment.<br/>
I have this to say to the Parliamentary Secretary. Of all the things that were done in the bad old days, the cut in the milk ration was on the whole the one which redounded least to the credit of the Tory Government of that day. Of all the things that were done, that always seemed the most incredible and the most mean. What they have done today is not to cut supplies but to increase prices, to put a taxation on an essential commodity, one essential to the health of the community.<br/>
I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to face that matter and to say fully and completely to the House why and how and under whose instructions it was done. I have heard no reason given and I have heard no explanation of the Order, and, in default of any explanation, the nation will be entitled to assume that it is a deliberate campaign against the health and the prosperity of the people.</p>

I have to disclose that I have an interest in the milk industry, and I am proud of it. It is an interest in a company. It pays a lot of tax. I do not want to talk only about milk, but upon the chocolate Order, and I have no interest in chocolate.<br/>

<p>I will try to keep within the Rules of Order, Mr. Speaker. I am trying to answer some of the arguments which the hon. Gentleman put forward before you resumed your seat in the Chair.<br/>
The hon. Member has accused H.M. Government of making certain price increases which are unnecessary. I would say that comes ill from the Parliamentary Secretary of a Government which produced so many Orders that it was impossible for us to keep pace with them. We could not compete with the number of Orders which increased the price of various commodities from time to time. But one would expect increases in the prices of commodities to result with an incompetent Government.<br/>
The present Government has been in office only a short time, and the number of Orders increasing prices, of which the three under discussion are examples, have been kept to a minimum, and are the direct result of previous bad administration. The second complaint made by the hon. Member for Sunderland, North, was about the small rations that have been given to the community by the present Government.</p>

<p>With the greatest respect, Sir, all these points were made, with the leniency of your predecessor in the Chair &#x2014;[HON. MEMBERS: "Withdraw."]&#x2014;not a bit. There was no reflection meant in that remark; none whatever. With the greatest respect, Mr. Speaker, the question of prices and of the smallness of the ration was raised in the speech of the hon. Member for Sunderland, North. A great part of his speech he devoted, not to the present price increase, but to the smallness of the ration of, not only milk and chocolate, but of other commodities such as tea and fish; and even armaments were mentioned.</p>

<p>The third effrontery of which I think the hon. Member for Sunderland, North, was guilty was in making a speech of interminable length at such an hour of the evening. Those are the three criticisms I have of the hon. Gentleman's remarks.<br/>

As a matter of fact, I had read them; I was fully aware of what was in them. The mover of the Motion began by asking if he might take the three Orders at the same time, and said "I am now going on to deal with the first Order." I therefore merely asked which one of the three he would deal with first.

<p>I wonder whether, after I have made a short point, I may ask the Parliamentary Secretary to intervene at this stage? It would be desirable as my hon. Friends would like to have an explanation of their various points. I want to emphasise that I find it difficult to identify the Parliamentary Secretary with these Orders, particularly the milk order. I know the position of a Parliamentary Secretary: it is responsibility without power. I feel that the hon. Gentleman, in his particular capacity, should have brought certain pressure to bear upon his right hon. and gallant Friend, who has not the professional knowledge which the Parliamentary Secretary possesses.<br/>
I also feel he might even have approached the Co-ordinating Minister, who certainly has not a small part of the knowledge which the Parliamentary Secretary possesses in these things. He must consider these Orders very carefully. As my hon. Friend the Member for Sunderland, North (Mr. F. Willey), said tonight, he is increasing the price of an essential food, a food which nutritional experts describe as a perfect food. I would recall, and I think probably there is no need to remind the hon. gentleman of this, that a great friend of his, Sir Wilson Jameson, two or three years ago, when he was Chief Medical Officer of the Ministry of Health, said that the decreased infantile mortality must be related to the enlightened food policy of the Government of that time.<br/>
The Labour Government did stress the importance of the consumption of milk and now, apparently, as my hon. Friend, the Member for Sunderland, North, whose memory, perhaps, is more fresh than mine, reminded the Parliamentary Secretary, since the last increase in milk prices the consumption of milk has


dropped. He must know that is a most serious thing. We on this side of the House with the support of the hon. Members opposite, who are interested in social reform, were delighted to find that the consumption of milk, particularly in the poorest sections of the population, had increased. The Parliamentary Secretary does agree, I am sure, that must be related to the low infantile mortality rate. I am not making a debating point. I am making a statement which, I believe, will eventually prove to be absolutely valuable.<br/>
If, tonight, the Parliamentary Secretary lends himself to this price increase in milk, it will inevitably mean that the consumption of milk will drop even further. It will be lower again among those people who are in the greatest need, the poorest section of the community. I have not to remind hon. Members that the poorest section of the community is that section where there is a large number of dependent children, who are the milk drinkers of the nation.<br/>
This hits the milk drinkers of the nation, not my hon. Friend the Member for Oldham, West (Mr. Hale). He has confessed tonight that he had forgotten the taste of milk. There is not one person in this House, probably, whose health would deteriorate because he is deprived of milk during the next month or so. He already has a balanced diet. But the Parliamentary Secretary will have it on his conscience if he allows &#x2014;[<i>Interruption</i>]. The hon. Member for Croydon, East (Sir H. Williams), who interrupts, has forgotten what milk tastes like.</p>

<p>I can only say that the hon. Gentleman has reformed since he sat on the Opposition benches below the Gangway and I was the answer to his Prayers. Right hon. Gentleman and hon. Gentlemen opposite kept me up, night after night, answering Prayers, and generally Prayers of a frivolous nature.<br/>
I say tonight that, in praying against these Orders, we are adopting a very responsible attitude, and I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to think again. These figures are not disputed, and I remind hon. Members opposite that this Government have increased the price of 39

foods since they have been in office. Tonight, they are doing this, I believe, without careful thought.<br/>
I think I am right in saying to the Parliamentary Secretary that this is, in fact, what may be regarded as a bookkeeping transaction, which the Ministry of Food have to do because the Treasury expect them to do it. The pressure comes from the Treasury. I ask the Parliamentay Secretary to tell us why he has chosen milk. Why has he chosen what he has probably himself described in speeches as the perfect food, because the constituent elements of milk represent a balanced diet for a child? This must inevitably be reflected in our public health statistics.<br/>
I ask him to take away this Order and think again. I ask him to bring the pressure which he has to bear upon his right hon. Friend and upon the Coordinating Minister, because this is a retrograde step which we are now discussing. It is not just a question of an increase in the price of milk, but of the effect which that will have on the most helpless, most dependent people in our population.</p>

<p>As I have no doubt whatever that the right hon. Lady put her point in complete sincerity, and on the basis of a belief in milk which I share, I gladly follow her suggestion of intervening now in order to state the position as I see it.<br/>
If it were true that this latest increase in the price of milk had effected an appreciable reduction in the consumption of milk, then there would be&#x2014;and I say it without reservation&#x2014;great substance in what the right hon. Lady said, but, as I shall show a little later, there is, in fact, this month, a substantial increase in the consumption of milk, and that has happened despite the price increase which is the subject of these Orders.</p>

<p>I will compare the figures in detail.<br/>
I want, briefly, to set aside the chocolate couverture point, because I think that what interests hon. Members much more is the subject of milk. Let it be


said, on the subject of chocolate couverture, that it is, in part, as the hon. Member for Sunderland, North (Mr. F. Willey), who moved this Motion, will realise, a re-definition arising out of a judgment, and, in part, a small increase in price.<br/>
Perhaps it will suffice to say that what is involved here is 0&#x00B7;5 per cent. of the production of the chocolate and sugar confectionery industry, and an amplification of a scale to meet a mere handful of 25 products out of a total of more than 20,000 products covered by the Order.</p>

<p>Would the hon. Gentleman explain what S.14 and 5.130 are?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1952-02-26a.1093.1" hansard_membership_id="6090" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/28880" speakername="Dr. Hill" colnum="1093" time="">
<p>I had hoped to save the time of the House by not proceeding with that explanation, as no hon. Member had raised the question, but I shall be glad to explain. Hon. Members will see in the Order in 2 (<i>b</i>) the product groups S.130, S.14, 5.140, and so on. In S.130 there are some 19 different kinds of sugar confectionery of the marzipan kind. In S.14, that is the 5/4 limit group, there is one item, a form of nougat; I think that is the expression. In S.140 there is as yet nothing. In S.15&#x2014;[<i>Laughter</i>]&#x2014;If the House desires I will go into the detailed explanation of this position.<br/>
It is that there has recently been a permitted increase in the price of sugar confectionery of 2d. It is an inevitable repercussion with an increase of 2d. in a scale which formerly had a maximum of 5s. that there should be a group, in this case S.130, with a maximum of 5/2 in order to permit the increase in that group. That involves the majority of the items here, some 19 items.<br/>
There is at the other end S.150, a different problem, perhaps the hon. Member will remember it. It is a chewing gum problem where the size of the machines makes it impossible by adaption of the size to meet the requirements of the new scale. It is necessary, for mechanical reasons, to devise this bracket at the 5/10 level.<br/>
For the rest, the interim brackets are there in part because there is one item which is appropriate to S.14, and in part to leave elbow room for what might subsequently happen, the reappearance in due course when materials are available of some of the more high Quality and

more expensive items in this field which existed before the war.<br/>
I now pass to the subject of the Orders raising the price of milk. Strange though it may seem, in view of some of the fabric outlined by the hon. Member for Sunderland, North&#x2014;and some of that fabric I accept as accurate&#x2014;this increase is a direct consequence of two factors. One is an increase in the cost, and the other is, as the hon. Member put it, the subsidy ceiling of &#x00A3;410 million. I am referring, of course, to the increased costs over the food field generally and the calculation, which as the hon. Member knows is made month by month in the Ministry, as to how the Ministry stands in relation to its &#x00A3;410 million subsidy position.</p>

<p>If the hon. Member will allow me, at his powerful behest I will explain the position.<br/>
Each month that calculation is made and my right hon. Friend has from time to time within the limit of that ceiling to make such adjustments in the prices that he thinks appropriate, which is a point to which I am coming in a moment, to keep within the subsidy ceiling. On 30th September, 1951, the position was that the subsidies were running at an estimated level of &#x00A3;430 million, or &#x00A3;20 million above the ceiling. That position could have been dealt with by the hon. Gentleman's right hon. Friend, but he failed to deal with it and it was one of the inheritances of Her Majesty's Government. The position on 31st October was roughly the same&#x2014;&#x00A3;432 million. While the policy of a subsidy ceiling of &#x00A3;410 million laid down by the late Government remains, then it becomes necessary, whether we like it or not, to keep within the framework of that policy by finding the money.<br/>
I agree that in the absence of a raised level of subsidies the only course is to increase charges.</p>

<p>I apologise for interrupting and for having spoken so long tonight. Surely the hon. Gentleman is saying what I said: that the past Government at that time was open-minded and was keeping the matter under review?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1952-02-26a.1094.3" hansard_membership_id="6090" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/28880" speakername="Dr. Hill" colnum="1094" time="">
<p>If the hon. Member says that we are in agreement so far then I am happy to accept it, whatever suspicions it might arouse in one's mind. The fact


remains that the ceiling of &#x00A3;410 million was laid down&#x2014;it obtained for the last two years&#x2014;and we discovered on coming into office that subsidy expenditure was running at &#x00A3;20 million over that level. There being &#x00A3;20 million to be found to remain within the subsidy ceiling, I agree it is a matter of argument where the added cost should be imposed. There is ample room for difference of opinion. It was decided to impose such increased charges on milk as would yield &#x00A3;6 million of that &#x00A3;20 million.<br/>
It is necessary to get the background complete to look at the subsidy position of milk. The amount of subsidy has grown. In 1942&#x2013;43 the total milk subsidy was &#x00A3;28 million; in 1945&#x2013;46 it was &#x00A3;44 million; in 1950&#x2013;51 it was &#x00A3;105 million. Approximately 30 per cent. of that was in the welfare field and the remaining &#x00A3;75 million was not within the welfare field. Out of &#x00A3;410 million, in 1950&#x2013;51 &#x00A3;105 million was on milk.<br/>
Had the experience of last year revealed that the increased charge had lowered the consumption of milk below available supplies, I agree with the hon. Gentleman that it would be a powerful argument against a further increase in price. Having made one increase in the price it would seem&#x2014;it is certainly arguable&#x2014;that milk would not appropriately fall for a further increase.</p>

<p>I gather that the hon. Gentleman is reversing the policy of the late Government. I explained that a matter of which we were proud was that the increased production had gone to those in greatest need. The hon. Gentleman says that when he took over a sum of &#x00A3;20 million had to be obtained on the food subsidies. He has told us the steps that his right hon. and gallant Friend and he took to get &#x00A3;6 million. How was the other &#x00A3;14 million obtained?</p>

<p>Most hon. Members know perfectly well of the other increases we made. I am dealing with this one.<br/>
Let me come to the question of consumption, and the point raised by the right hon. Lady. I appreciate the point she made about taking comparable months. This is a tricky piece of com-

parison unless you do. Let us go back to the first effect of the cut. There was a small reduction in consumption in December last year of 0.8 per cent. Last month that fall had practically disappeared, and the position as we calculate for February is that consumption has risen by 2.7 per cent.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1952-02-26a.1096.0" hansard_membership_id="8300" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/22151" speakername="Mr. Willey" colnum="1096" time="">
<p>The figures given in the Annual Digest for December are these: milk consumption for December, 1950, 111.6 million gallons; for December, 1951, 109.7 million gallons. These figures cannot possibly be reconciled with the statement that the difference is 0.8 per cent.</p>

<p>Let me give the exact figures for the December months. In 1950 they were 130.86 million gallons, and in December, 1951, 129.80 million gallons, a fall in total consumption of approximately 1.06 million gallons. I have given the figures for December and January, and my answer to the right hon. Lady is not that the increase would not have been more if there had been no change in price&#x2014;I am not speculating&#x2014;but that consumption has risen in spite of the increase in price.</p>

<p>Am I not right in saying that the drop in December was the first time there had been a drop in consumption for many years, and is that not a warning signal that the Parliamentary Secretary should observe?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1952-02-26a.1096.3" hansard_membership_id="6090" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/28880" speakername="Dr. Hill" colnum="1096" time="">
<p>The fact is that the drop which one might have expected to have been appreciable was trivial and indeed, began to disappear in January. We have now an increase in February which more than outweighs the drop in December and January.<br/>
Let there be no qualification about what I say in praise of milk. The right hon. Lady has spoken of it, and let us combine to inform the hon. Member for Oldham, West (Mr. Hale), that it is the strongest drink, bar none, and that its nutritional value is outstanding. But that is no reason why the level of subsidy on milk outside the welfare field should stay at &#x00A3;75 million a year, and it is no argument as to the appropriate amount of money which should go in subsidy for that which is not included in the welfare field.</p>

<p>The Parliamentary Secretary did promise to say what the subsidy was now running at, and he did say that the cost of the 4d. worked out at &#x00A3;8 million&#x2014;&#x00A3;2 million to the producers, and &#x00A3;6 million to the Treasury. But I find it difficult to reconcile that figure with the cost of subsidy.</p>

<p>Yes, Mr. Speaker, but the Parliamentary Secretary has wasted a quarter of an hour in saying that the Order was necessary because we had gone over the notional ceiling; that the Government are committed to the ceiling, and that because of the law of the Medes and the Persians the increase had to be made.</p>

<p>I cannot go over the whole of the picture. Before the latest increase in price, the subsidy figure, as I have said, was &#x00A3;101 million, of which the welfare schemes cost &#x00A3;32 million. Following the price increase on 1st December, the subsidy stood at &#x00A3;95 million, of which the welfare scheme cost &#x00A3;33 million; so that the subsidy for welfare purposes&#x2014;and which I support with the right hon. Lady and every other hon. Member&#x2014;has been higher, although there has been less subsidy in the general field.<br/>
Finally, I want to pose this question. Is there anything that is wrong about this

principle, first, of keeping within the subsidy ceiling and, second, of making price increases in order to keep within that ceiling? If there is, the hon. Member for Sunderland, North, should know, for during his tenure of office, for precisely the same reasons and considerations, there were nine such increases in the months April to July, 1951, and the cost in the financial year was no less than &#x00A3;112 million. There is, therefore, a somewhat hollow note to his protestations.<br/>
No one likes this increase in the price of milk. I should be very unhappy about it if it had resulted in a reduction in the consumption of milk. It has not so resulted. The Government have followed the right policy in keeping within the &#x00A3;410 million ceiling and in taking the necessary steps to find the &#x00A3;20 million, which the late Government could have found by increasing prices of food in September last had they not been more interested in another approaching event. Her Majesty's Government have thus been left with the task of finding the &#x00A3;20 million which was on the debit side of the account when the late Government left office.</p>

<p>One of the three Orders that we are discussing refers to the price of milk in Northern Ireland. From an intervention of mine earlier, it was reasonable to assume that I was going to raise the matter of Northern Ireland. In those circumstances, I am very surprised that the Parliamentary Secretary did not give any attention to the position of Northern Ireland. It happens that there are on this side of the House, in my party no hon. Members from Northern Ireland&#x2014;</p>

<p>I hope that the hon. Member will forgive me. I intended no discourtesy to him. He referred to the desirability of there being here a Minister from the Home Office to answer for Northern Ireland. One of the Joint Under-Secretaries for the Home Department is here.</p>

<p>I hope that the Joint Under-Secretary will intervene very soon and answer my points. As Under-Secretary at the Home Office, it was my duty to come here on more than one occasion and reply, on just such a matter as this, to points peculiar to Northern Ireland.<br/>
I was saying that there happens to be on this side of the House no hon. Member from Northern Ireland belonging to my party. Therefore, since it was my duty for so long to keep an eye on agriculture in Northern Ireland, I consider it my duty to make these points and get an explanation from the Government.<br/>
One Order is entirely related to' the increase in the price of milk in Northern Ireland. A very elementary knowledge of agriculture in Northern Ireland leads one to realise that conditions there are completely different from those in Great Britain. Northern Ireland has always been an exporter of milk. The conditions are in no way similar to those in this country.<br/>
I wish to know what proportion of the increased consumption to which reference has been made was in Northern Ireland. Production conditions there are very different from those in this country. Even if it is admitted that it is right in Great Britain to raise the price of milk, it will be interesting to see if it can be justified in Northern Ireland from the point of view of the consumer and also of the producer.<br/>
I should like the Joint Under-Secretary to say how this has affected milk producers in Northern Ireland, especially those who farm under the curious type of tenancy there&#x2014;the conacre tenancy. There is a different right of tenancy in Northern Ireland, as the Joint Under-Secretary will find when he goes over there. It is important that he should keep up to date with matters of agriculture in Northern Ireland and such things as the potato Orders and so on. My first intervention on an Order was on a potato Order relating to Northern Ireland. I hope that the Joint Under-Secretary, when replying, will relate his remarks to the justification for the increase in Northern Ireland and will say why it should be necessary in a country which always has such a vast surplus of milk.</p>

<p>In the last Parliament there sat on these benches an hon. Gentleman who, whenever a reply was given by a Government spokesman, always commented, "Completely unsatisfactory." That description applies

to the speech of the Parliamentary Secretary tonight. His reply is unsatisfactory because it betrays every pledge which the party opposite gave to the electors during the General Election. Members of that party promised specifically to bring down the cost of living, and this Order increases the price of the most essential food. It hits the staple food of the most unfortunate and the poorest.<br/>
This increased price will bear most heavily on old age pensioners, on those who are sick, and on the increasing number of unemployed which is a result of the policy of the present Government. If one might paraphrase the right hon. Gentleman the Prime Minister, I think it would be true to say, "Never in human history have so few done so much damage to so many in so short a time." The Parliamentary Secretary lacks the courage and determination of the Service Ministers. He ought to have told the Treasury that his Department was not prepared to impose this hardship upon the people: that he wanted the money so that the price of milk could be kept within the reach of the majority of the families of this country. The Services do that and get from the Treasury all they want, whether the Service is the Army, the Navy, or the Air Force.<br/>
The Parliamentary Secretary, because of his professional experience, ought to know that one of the best defences that the people of this country can have is an adequate diet, and that in laying this Order he is doing something which will lessen the amount of milk which will be available to the poorest. Thereby he is undoing much of the good work he-has tried to do in advising people how to live and what to eat. I hope that he is going to reconsider this and that he made a slip when he talked about the subsidies running at &#x00A3;200 million above the ceiling figure. Some of us fear that it may not have been a slip and that on 11th March it may prove to be a reality.</p>

<p>There is one aspect of the Order dealing with chocolate, sugar confectionery and cocoa products which has

not been dealt with, and on which I think we should have some explanation. In that Order there is a new definition of the term "Chocolate couverture," and it would have been desirable had the House been informed as to the reason why the definition in the previous Order has been changed. I understand that the Joint Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department will reply. The point to which I am addressing myself might more appropriately have been dealt with by one of the Law Officers, but unfortunately I do not see any of the Law Officers of the Crown here.<br/>
If the purpose of the change in the definition is to make more certain that a competent and proper prosecution can take place under the Order, then I want to make a number of observations. Firstly, what was the difficulty under the original Order which this new definition seeks to overcome? Secondly, is the Parliamentary Secretary satisfied that even with this new definition it will be possible to overcome the legal difficulty? Under the Order, if a person is guilty of contravention he is liable to criminal prosecution, and in order to get a successful criminal prosecution it is essential to have a proper and competent definition in the Order, otherwise it may be impossible for the court to enforce it.</p>

<p>May I seek to help the right hon. and learned Gentleman? I did not deal with this in great detail because, quite frankly, the hon. Gentleman moving the Prayer did not seek to deal with it in much detail. There was a conviction by the Recorder of Leeds which went to appeal, and the Lord Chief Justice made certain comments about the definition of "Chocolate couverture" then appearing in the Order. I do not know whether the right hon. and learned Gentleman wishes me to go into that. An effort has been made to meet the views as expressed by the Lord Chief Justice, by simplifying and shortening of the wording of the Order. Heaven forbid that I should seek to pretend to be able to pronounce on the future of this one in that possible field. I thought the right hon. and learned Gentleman would wish to know.</p>

<p>I am obliged for the Parliamentary Secretary's explanation but, as he is probably aware, these Orders apply to Scotland as well as to England. The dictum of the Lord Chief Justice is


not binding on the Scottish Courts. We have rather a different procedure in Scotland in our criminal prosecutions. I would like to know if the test as to whether this would stand up to scrutiny in the Scottish courts has been considered. We go in more for relevancy in Scotland than in England.<br/>
In order to formulate a proper charge, it is essential to have sufficient notice given to the person, who is accused, of the standards to which he has to subscribe, otherwise sufficient, fair notice has not been given and the courts, in such circumstances, have held complaints to be irrelevant. If one looks at the definition in this Order, one sees it might be difficult for a person charged under it to know exactly to what standards he has to subscribe. It is not sufficient in the courts merely to echo the words of the statute or of the Order, if that criterion, to which I have referred, is not satisfied.<br/>
Accordingly, is the Government satisfied that both in the Scottish and English courts, the mere echoing of the words of the Order would be held to give sufficient notice to the accused person of the standards to which he is expected to subscribe? I am not making this as a debating point because I am anxious, if we are passing what is after all penal legislation, that we should do it in a way the courts can enforce. Otherwise, there is no purpose in passing that legislation.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1952-02-26a.1103.0" hansard_membership_id="6090" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/28880" speakername="Dr. Hill" colnum="1103" time="">
<p>I go timidly into this complicated question. We have been advised on both the Scottish and English legal aspects of it.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1952-02-26a.1103.1" hansard_membership_id="9892" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/22038" speakername="Mr. Wheatley" colnum="1103" time="">
<p>In that case, we must await the test of time, if and when a case is raised in court. May I ask one question, and ascertain from the hon. Gentleman whether those who advise him have given him an answer to this? If we read the definition of the Order, one will see that the "Chocolate couverture" means
<q>any chocolate product that would be regarded in the chocolate industry as properly sold under the trade descriptions of chocolate couverture, bakers' covering compounds&#x2026;</q>
If a person were charged with a contravention of the Order in the respect that he had sold the commodities which did not conform to that definition, and he, by way of defence, laid evidence from two witnesses, or maybe one witness is

sufficient in England, who are in the trade, that the commodities, which the accused person had sold, was a commodity which had been properly sold under the trade description schedule, would that be a complete defence? There is no criterion save that it should be a commodity that was properly sold under that trade description. If witnesses say it was properly sold under that description because they themselves sold a similar commodity under that description, albeit that the prosecution may have laid abundant evidence to prove it was not, is that to be a full and satisfactory defence to obviate the possibility of getting a conviction?<br/>
Accordingly, I think the hon. Gentleman might look at the matter very carefully from that point of view. I am not saying it necessarily means taking the Order away at this stage. If we are going to pass legislation with penal consequences, we should be sure that legislation will be effective in our courts. If, on further reconsideration, the hon. Gentleman is of the opinion that definition might provide loopholes, which would prevent the Order being effective, it would be in the interests not only of the Government but of criminal courts that a better, more comprehensive, and more water-tight definition was provided.</p>

<p>I should like to give an answer to the points which have been raised by the hon. Member for Lincoln (Mr. de Freitas), who asked about Northern Ireland. The position in Northern Ireland is that the Northern Ireland producers receive the full benefit of the agricultural guarantee, and their milk, therefore, costs the same as in Great Britain. In fact, the subsidy <i>per capita</i> and also per gallon is higher in Northern Ireland than in Great Britain, because of the difference in the economies of the two countries.<br/>
The hon. Member also asked for certain figures, and I shall try to give them as best I can. He asked for the change in production in Northern Ireland during this month, as compared with the corresponding month of last year. That figure is an increase of 8.9 per cent. The change in consumption, in which I think he was particularly interested, is an increase of 6 per cent., but I must warn


him and the House that these figures are not exactly what they look, because this is Leap Year and we are comparing February with February when it has not been possible in the time to make the necessary adjustments in the answer to the hon. Member.</p>

<p>Earlier tonight, or rather last night, before we were involved in a discussion on the delicacies of chocolate and milk, we heard a good deal about Korea. I wish to raise one particular aspect of the operations there, namely, the amenities available to our troops in that theatre, using the term "amenities" in its widest sense.<br/>
I am drawing attention to this subject, because I was able to visit the United Nations front in Korea during the Christmas Recess. Only two other hon. Members of this House have visited Korea since hostilities began, the hon. Member for Maldon (Mr. Driberg) and my hon. Friend the Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Aitken). In some ways it is a pity that more hon. Members have not been able to make that journey.<br/>
So far as my own visit was concerned, I would express my thanks both to the American and our own military authorities for the facilities they put at my disposal, particularly the Commander-in-Chief of the Commonwealth Forces, General Bridgford, who lent me his plane to visit the front, and the Divisional Commander, General Cassels, for letting me see everything I wanted to see and answering all the questions I wanted to ask; and for allowing me to have the experience which is rather unusual for an ex-intelligence officer of going into action in a tank against the enemy.<br/>
My experience was that the morale of the troops was extremely high. They were in good heart, they were well fed and, after some regrettable delays, I think well clothed. But they have some grouses. They are discontented about pay and allowances. The nature of the United Nations Command throws into relief the disparity in the rates of pay. Our troops are almost the worst paid troops with the possible exception of the Turks and the South Koreans. Even the Greeks and the French are paid more than our men.<br/>
All ranks, and particularly officers, resent having to pay Income Tax on their pay. The Commonwealth Forces, the Australians and the New Zealanders do

not pay tax, and the Canadians pay tax only on the first 30 dollars of their pay. There is also some discontent about there being no local overseas allowance. Troops who have been peace-time soldiering in Hong Kong had this allowance, but when they went to Korea they found it was withdrawn. The excuse has been that there is nothing on which to spend their allowance in Korea. There are no clubs, cafes, golf clubs or cinemas. But the troops from Hong Kong who have gone to Korea have, in many cases, had to leave their wives in Hong Kong and have to maintain them while they are in Korea.<br/>
It is a good thing that gratuities have become payable and that these men are receiving them, but it is important they should know when they became payable. I understand they become payable when the men are posted away, but only the other day I had a letter from a National Service man's mother to the effect that her son, demobilized six months ago, had not received the gratuity he was entitled to. I ask the Minister to assure the House that he will do everything he can to ensure the gratuities are promptly paid.<br/>
There was also some complaint at the N.A.A.F.I. prices. Articles like shaving brushes and tooth-brushes, and soap and cleaning equipment bear higher prices in N.A.A.F.I. stores in Korea than in other theatres, notably Germany. I would ask the Minister to keep a strict watch on these prices and to bring them into line with those charged in other theatres.<br/>
I wore the clothing issued when I was in the front line and thought it extremely good and adequate, but I did see some men who wore last year's clothing, with battledress and woollen jerseys. I ask the Minister to assure the House that all ranks have now been issued with the new type winter clothing. There was also a complaint about equipment, particularly stoves, or space heaters as they are called, and I would ask the Minister to see whether all these needs have been met. I know of at least one firm in this country with a supply of heaters that could meet any deficiencies there may be.<br/>
Then there is the lack of entertainment. Korea is a very bleak place and there are few recreational facilities. There is a very great need for live entertainment, and there was great disappointment when


it ceased last November. The excuse given in official quarters was that it was too cold for entertainers to go out there, yet that did not deter the Americans from sending a plane load of stars to entertain their forces at Christmas time.<br/>
Mr. Carroll Levis, a well known entertainer, offered to take a party of six out, and there is no doubt it would have been appreciated by the troops, but the offer was turned down. I understand some concert parties are due to go out in March, but entertainment is wanted now, particularly entertainment provided by someone like Mr. Carroll Levis or even Miss Gracie Fields. There is also need for mobile film units. It may be that more of these are now available, but five weeks ago the men told me that there was only one such unit in the whole Commonwealth Division. I would appreciate it if the Minister would say whether these cinema projectors are now reaching the command in greater numbers.<br/>
Another point is mail. I understand the men have still to pay postage in some cases on their letters home. Cannot this charge be remitted? Another point is that on gifts of more than 10s. their relations are liable to Customs and Purchase Tax. This applies even to gifts purchased in the N.A.A.F.I. For example, if Japanese silk goods, such as a kimono costing about &#x00A3;2 10s., are sent, it does seem unfair that the recipient should have to pay Customs Duty and Purchase Tax on it.<br/>
There are good supplies of newspapers, but I did meet with the complaint that these were largely confined to national dailies and weeklies and magazines. There is a feeling that there should be some local newspapers, because the men like to have the local news and gossip from their home towns. At present these papers have to be sent by relatives at a cost perhaps of 2s. per paper by air mail, and I wonder whether this charge could not be remitted or supplies of local papers sent out.<br/>
In conclusion, I should like to quote from a letter I received the other day from an ex-trooper in the 8th Hussars which summarises how many of the men feel on this question of amenities. He says:
<q>In August, 1950, I was recalled to the Colours, and I served that last terrible winter

in Korea. Our clothing was of the poorest to meet the climate&#x2014;we had only battle dress and a so-called windproof. I would like to state that, although I served from 1939 to 1946 with Tank Regiments in Africa and Italy, I have never undergone the hardships imposed upon us by the Korean climate, by the complete lack of entertainment of any description, and by the absence of reasonable leave. I would like to thank you for visiting the troops, as one of our main grouses was that no one in authority ever visited us. Had they done so, they would have seen how the Government had neglected their troops in one of the hardest wars of all times.</q>
Whatever the faults may have been in the past the Secretary of State now has a great opportunity of putting them right. I would ask him most seriously and earnestly to take that opportunity, and in doing so to earn the lasting gratitude of our troops in that theatre who are fighting with other United Nations forces in the cause of freedom.</p>

<p>I too had the privilege of visiting Korea, not quite so recently as the hon. Member, but I did much the same trip. I visited the troops beyond the Imjun River, and saw something of the conditions and difficulties under which they were fighting. Everything I heard, from Army headquarters, corps headquarters, divisional headquarters, right down to the front line, was that our troops probably have the lowest standard of welfare and pay of any of the European troops in Korea. Even the Turks, who were the lowest paid soldiers on this side of the iron curtain&#x2014;and among the bravest&#x2014;are now on the American standard of pay, which is four times that of the British soldier.<br/>
On the other hand, it was a proud and splendid thing to hear some of the comments, which applied from the Army commander down to the humblest G.I., about the record of our troops in Korea. Everywhere you heard expressed this high regard in which our troops are held for their fighting skill, courage and discipline.<br/>
I want to take up the point made by my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Belfast, North (Lieut.-Colonel Hyde) about newspapers. During the last war the importance was recognised of getting newspapers out to the troops oversea. The W.V.S. organised a very efficient method of collecting national and local newspapers. I think the emphasis in this case should be placed on the local newspaper, and if


these efficient ladies were asked to go into high gear again I think they would do it. I am sure that if transport facilities could be arranged&#x2014;and they should be&#x2014;it would be possible to arrange matters so that every soldier in Korea would regularly get his local paper. In that grim and desolate country &#x2014;and anybody like ourselves who is privileged to go there&#x2014;will realise that news from home means a very great deal to our soldiers in Korea.</p>

<p>In the minute or two left to me I would echo what was said by the hon. and gallant Member who raised this subject, and I would congratulate him for having done so. I would echo what he says about local overseas allowance.<br/>
As some hon. Members will know, a number of us raised this question repeatedly throughout the last Parliament without getting any satisfaction at all; but, looking at it in retrospect, I do not think that it was the fault of the War Office, or any intentional meanness on their part. They sent repeated signals to the Commander on the spot asking if a case could be made out for overseas allowance, and perhaps he did not realise that this repetition was a hint. But he replied that he could not make the case, and I think that as a small consolation, or substitute for that, the late Government decided in August or September on the special gratuity scheme; and that, although not very much, is better than nothing.<br/>
Now there is a new Government, and there has been a change of Commander out there, and I can only express the hope that the Under-Secretary will look sympathetically at this question.</p>

<p>Almost all the points in this discussion this evening have been the subject of recent Parliamentary Question and answer or the subject of Adjournment debates. But, I am glad that the matter has been raised afresh in order that our troops who are fighting so gallantly in Korea may know that their problems and troubles are constantly in the minds of hon. Members here. The fact that the hon. Member for Belfast, North (Lieut.-Colonel Hyde) was able to

visit them in their distant fields will, I am sure, be greatly appreciated.<br/>
Let me say, first, that the morale and health of the troops out there is good; and when one gets these two factors there is probably not much that is radically wrong. Of the many questions touched upon by the several hon. Members who have spoken, I think that the most acute is that of pay, and if I set forth the factors which play upon this complicated situation, I would ask hon. Members what, in the circumstances, they would have done. The first factor, to the exclusion of all others, and which is the most pressing of political matters today, is the need for national economy.<br/>
The second is that the British Army has always accepted that we should pay a soldier the same wherever he is asked to perform a task, and whatever that task may be. That is a principle which should not be lightly abandoned because the moment one tries to make an increase of pay for, say, fighting, or suffering some special hardship, one embarks upon a sea of endless trouble.<br/>
How can one assess the degree of discomfort in, say, Korea, as compared with Malaya, or the Canal Zone? Again, how can one assess the degree of discomfort in different parts of the same theatre of operations? The complications are deep and widespread. Let us also remember that, however unfavourably&#x2014;I agree that from many aspects they are unfavourable &#x2014;our rates of pay compare with those of other countries, they at least compare not unfavourably with civilian rates at home.<br/>
We must also realise that we, almost alone among the nations who have sent contingents to Korea, have also got important garrisons elsewhere. The United States, our Dominions, Turkey and Greece have virtually only one fighting zone to consider, whereas we have the Canal Zone and Malaya and the other commitments of a far-flung Empire.<br/>
Let us remember, too, so far as the United States and Canada are concerned, that the pay of their troops has to bear some relationship to the cost of living in their countries. They are high cost of living countries, and their troops very often have to send home from their pay something to help to maintain their families. Our troops are not the lowest paid, although we come fairly low down


the scale. Turkish, Indian and other troops are lower. But the Turks draw ahead from us, as so many Continental nations do, in the pay of their officers.<br/>
Income Tax has been mentioned. Only some of the countries exempt pay from tax. Income Tax in one form or another is levied, as with us, by the United States, Canada, Greece and Turkey.<br/>
I admit that there is a gap. My first reaction, like that of my hon. and gallant Friend, was one of resentment, but, bearing in mind all these facets to the problem, I still return to the question that I should like hon. Members to ask themselves: What would they have done in these circumstances? Hon. Members may retort by asking what we have done.<br/>
The hon. Member for Maldon (Mr. Driberg) mentioned the Korean gratuity. In an attempt to narrow the gap&#x2014;I do not pretend that it comes anywhere near closing it&#x2014;the Government instituted a Korean gratuity and extra terminal leave, and since the terminal leave is paid leave, it is another form of reward. The gratuity for a private is on the basis of &#x00A3;10 for service in the Korean theatre up to three months plus &#x00A3;1 per month for each month thereafter. A private may earn something in the region of &#x00A3;25 and a 2nd Lieutenant something like &#x00A3;45. Nor must we lose sight of the provision for marriage allowance, which many of the other nations fail to provide.<br/>
If we were to double the Korean gratuity, it would cost the Services, on the basis of the numbers involved in that theatre in the past year, an extra &#x00A3;432,000 a year. But I will undertake to see that those who are entitled to gratuities are not held up waiting for them to be paid. These problems of comparative pay always occur when troops of different nations are fighting alongside one another in the same theatre. They arose in the First and Second World Wars, and I am afraid that they will never be eliminated until there is a United Nations Army paid out of a common budget.<br/>
Now a word about the local overseas allowance. What has been said is broadly true. It is an allowance instituted to compensate our troops for serving in areas where the cost of living is higher than it is at home. Whether the question was put to the G.O.C.-in-C. out

there in the form suggested by the hon. Member or not, it is clearly open to him at any time to make out a case for it in Korea, but he has not made out such a case, and it is hard to see how it can be made out at the present time.<br/>
In Hong Kong the position is otherwise, and the local overseas allowance is paid there. We have been asked why, when a husband is posted away from Hong Kong to Korea, the allowance is withdrawn from his family in Hong Kong. The answer is buried in the problem of trying to provide for a united family in the Services abroad. When the husband goes to Korea the family for the moment can no longer be considered to be united. Consequently that family is offered a homeward passage free, and incidentally if that passage is accepted it eases the acute housing situation in Hong Kong. If that passage is refused, the local overseas allowance is withdrawn altogether. They well know the purpose of the local overseas allowance and what will happen if the passage is refused.<br/>
Now a word on N.A.A.F.I. prices. The prices of some articles are higher, and some lower, than of comparable articles in B.A.O.R., and at home, but overall they compare not unfavourably in spite of the high cost of transporting the goods to that theatre. In this connection N.A.A.F.I. are making arrangements for a better supply of films for cameras, and for the developing of films.<br/>
On clothing, it is generally admitted that the clothing furnished to all troops is as good as the best. Although the situation came in for a good deal of unfair criticism, the earlier forecasts which my right hon. Friend gave to the House have been exceeded. As to space heaters, although there was some initial delay owing to production difficulties in the United States of America, our full requirement of 3,900 of these heaters has now been met. Mention has been made of a concern in this country which might be able to supply them, and we would be glad to have the name of that firm.<br/>
I come now to the question of entertainment. It was at the express request of the Command out there that no entertainment parties were sent in the period between November and February, owing, no doubt, to the weather. However, the hon. and gallant Member, with that well-known sense of humour possessed by all


his countrymen, may perhaps have helped in part to remove that deficiency. From March onwards increased provision is being made, and eight parties from the United Kingdom and Australia are to visit the theatre at monthly intervals. Mobile cinema shows have been arranged, and each major unit now has two 16 millimetre projectors for films supplied by the Army Cinema Corps and the United States Army.<br/>
Lastly a word about mail and newspapers. Regarding homeward mail, lightweight letters by air are carried free for the Forces without limit. Ordinary airmail letters cost 2&#x00BD;d. for one ounce. Civilians pay 2s. 6d. for the same weight. I will take up with N.A.A.F.I. the question of whether N.A.A.F.I. goods, such as silk articles, can be exempted from Purchase Tax and Customs Duty.<br/>
The question of supplying local and provincial newspapers was raised in August, and when we asked Korea Command for its views the reply was that there was no great demand for weekly provincial papers but a constant demand

for more national Sunday papers. These with others, are sent out on the basis of one paper for every five men. They are flown out and issued free.<br/>
I hope that all this, unrolled rather rapidly, will serve to show that the needs and wants of the troops in Korea are very present in our thoughts. They on their part have shown that our youth has not lost either its vigour or courage. We want to do all we can in return for the fine job that they are doing, but I ask them, and hon. Members, to remember the financial limitations by which we are so hard pressed just now.</p>

<p>Before the hon. Gentleman sits down, may I ask whether the extra leave facilities in Japan, which mean that troops can spend more money there, will provide an excuse, as it were, for a local overseas allowance? Will the hon. Gentleman look into that?</p>
