<p>I desire to present a petition, on behalf of the Sunderland Old Age Pension Association, signed by 31,000 of His Majesty's subjects in the county borough of Sunderland and district. The grievance set forth in the petition is the insufficiency of the old age pension of 10s. a week for the maintenance of life and the avoidance of hardship. The petition states:
<q>Wherefore your petitioners pray that this honourable House will pass legislation to provide for the payment of a pension of one pound a week at the age of 60 years, or withdrawal from industry or service, to include all aged spinsters, widows, and the widows of pensioners who are under pensionable age.</q></p>

<p>The Board inform me that there is no question of requiring a waiting period in these cases as a matter of rule and irrespective of the individual circumstances. Cases do, however, occur in which the recent employment history and the remuneration received provide grounds for the view that the applicant is not in need of a supplementary grant immediately on cessation of work.

<p>The percentage rate of unemployment in County Durham in June this year was 19.6, but, I would point out, that is half what it was in June, 1933. In reply to the second part of the question, I have nothing to add to the answer which I gave the hon. Member on 17th February, 1938.</p>

<p>Can it be said the claimant "continues to receive wages" notwithstanding that his employment has terminated when the employment terminated on 7th May, 1938, and there was no receipt of wages until r6th June, 1938?

<p>Wages are not paid daily, therefore an interval of a few days between the termination of the employment and the receipt of wages does not prevent the application of Section 35 (6) of the 1935 Act (see Decision 4886/ 28). What length of time intervening between the termination of the employment and the receipt of wages entitles a finding that there is a continuation of the receipt of wages depends upon the facts of each case. Where wages are paid weekly or fortnightly

an interval of a week or a fortnight respectively might be held not to break the continuity of the receipt of wages. In the present case the claimant's wages were, presumably, paid weekly, and the receipt of wages five weeks after the termination of his employment cannot be held to be a continuation of the receipt of wages.</p>

<p>I have had no communication with the justices about this case, and it would be wrong that a court of justice should be subject to the directions or approval of the executive as to the course to be followed in dealing with a particular case. As regards the general question, I am advised that when justices are making a preliminary investigation of an indictable case for the purpose of determining whether or not a defendant should be committed for trial, they are not required to sit in open court, though it is the practice for them to do so. In my view they should not sit in private save in exceptional cases such as those in which they are satisfied that publicity given to these preliminary proceedings will prejudice the ends of justice.</p>

<p>Yes, Sir. I have received from Mr. Stedall's solicitors a full report of the facts of this case. Mr. Stedall in swerving to avoid another car collided with a third car of which the driver was killed. Mr. Stedall and the driver of the car which he swerved to avoid were both charged with dangerous driving. The other defendant was acquitted but Mr. Stedall was convicted and sentenced to four months' imprisonment. Mr. Stedall appealed to quarter sessions but his conviction and sentence were upheld on appeal. Subsequently at an inquest held on the person killed the coroner's jury returned a verdict of accidental death and added a rider to the effect that the driver who had been acquitted had put Mr. Stedall in great danger. This rider does not, in fact, necessarily exonerate Mr. Stedall, but in any event a rider by a coroner's jury, whose sole function was to determine the cause of death and who, I am informed, had no evidence additional to that considered by the convicting Magistrates and by quarter sessions, would not afford grounds for reviewing a conviction by the courts established by law for the trial of offences and the hearing of appeals. I have considered the representations made on Mr. Stedall's behalf and can find no ground for interference with the sentence which the court thought fit to impose.</p>

<p>Trouble broke out in April between the Jaipur Darbar and the Rao Raja of Sikar, who is a feudatory of the Maharaja of Jaipur and whose Thikana is part of Jaipur State. The cause appears to have been the degree of control which the Darbar exercises over the Thikana. As a result of the informal intervention of the Resident in Rajputana, the Rao Raja left Jaipur on 29th April. On 25th May the Jaipur Government appointed a commission under the chairmanship of an officer of the Indian Political Service to investigate the causes of the trouble and suggest remedial measures. But the continued refusal of the inhabitants of Sikar to allow the re-establishment of normal administration there prevented this commission starting work on the spot. On three occasions on 5th July, armed supporters of the Rao Raja opened fire on Jaipur troops and police who returned their fire. Two Jaipur police were killed and seven wounded. Fourteen of the Rao Raja's supporters were killed and 30 wounded.</p>

<p>I regret that I am not yet in a position to make a full statement, since the consultations on this subject are not yet complete. His Majesty's Government have found it necessary to ask the Burgos authorities to explain the


exact meaning which they attach to their disclaimer of their intention to make deliberate attacks on British ships. His Majesty's Government have frequently expressed their view that the deliberate bombing and sinking of merchant ships has never been admitted by international law, still less the machine-gunning of their bridges and decks.<br/>
I might add that the Burgos authorities have intimated their intention to make practical proposals with the object of humanising warfare as far as possible, and I need hardly say that His Majesty's Government will give any such proposals their most sympathetic consideration.<br/>
My right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer has already informed the House of the suggestion made by the Burgos authorities for the establishment under certain restrictive conditions of a safe port at Almeria. Preliminary examination of this suggestion has revealed certain difficulties such as the deficiencies in the facilities afforded by such a plan for the discharge of vessels, communications with the rest of Spain and other factors. The position at the moment is that the Government have under consideration the views of the British shipping interests on the subject.<br/>

<p>I beg to move, "That this House doth agree with the Lords in the said Amendment."<br/>
The House has reaffirmed several times that the Coal Commission itself should decide, first, whether leases should be granted; and, second, as to cases of renewal. That was the subject of discussion last night. Now we come to a further and smaller point. This Clause deals with the situation when there is a lease and there is some dispute with regard to some matter in the lease. It is common practice in leases to include some method of resolving difficulties of that kind. It is quite a normal thing in coal leases to make provision for arbitration in these circumstances. We envisage that the Coal Commission should be a model landlord, certainly as good in every way as the best landlords. We think it is reasonable that if there should be a dispute about the carrying out of a provision in a lease, there should be a power of arbitration, as is suggested here. I have no doubt that whether this new Clause is put in or not there would probably be such a provision in the leases, as is generally the case to-day, but it is perhaps desirable that there should he some method of resolving a difficulty of the kind I have indicated.</p>

<p>We object to this Amendment on the very simple ground that it is imposing upon the Commission a restriction which is not imposed on the ordinary landlord. It may be that the Commission would wish or would not wish, or that the lessee with whom they are in negotiation would wish or not wish, to have such a provision in the

lease. If it is part of the general law of the land that such a provision should be included there is no objection to the Commission being governed by that law, but what we object to is a provision such as this, inserted in another place, which puts the Commission in a less advantageous position as landlords than the ordinary landlord. This is only part of the intention to try to cut down and regulate the powers of the Coal Commission in order that they may be in a less free and advantageous position as regards the leases into which they enter. That purpose is shown by the fact that this new Clause was included in a single Amendment with the new Clause C which the House rejected yesterday. That new Clause C was a more stringent form of control imposed upon the Commission, and this is a lesser form. It may be unimportant in one sense; it may not be a matter of very vital importance as to whether the Commission are compelled to do this or not, but the principle of setting up a Commission and then applying to it particular restrictions which are not applied to other people is in our opinion entirely wrong. If you are going to have a Commission and to trust it, it should operate under the ordinary law of the land as regards the granting of leases. It should not be dragooned or hampered by having to include in leases a particular provision which other people are at liberty to include or exclude as they wish. For that reason we shall oppose this Amendment.</p>

<p>The courts of this country exist in order to do justice as best they can. Parties often agree to arbitration, because in the particular circumstances of cases it is more convenient. Parties sometimes agree to arbitration because they know that the way they propose to carry on their business will not really stand the light of day, and they could not go into a law court. They prefer, therefore, to agree to arbitration. There are two short objections to this new Clause. The first is that it is undesirable that the Legislature should go out of its way to say to an important public body, "Our view is that we had better keep away from the courts and go to arbitration." The second objection is that when noblemen like the particular Noble Lords who are probably responsible for


this Amendment say, "As we and our like will be taking leases from the Commission and we know that our operations will not stand the light of day, let us have no risk; do not let us trust the Commission about arbitration; let us compel them to put in an arbitration Clause."</p>

<p>I hope the Government will accept the Amendment. I think it is a very reasonable Amendment and I cannot see that the contention of the Opposition is correct. The hon. and learned Member for East Bristol (Sir S. Cripps) contended that the Commission should not be put in a different position from an ordinary landlord. I contend that the Commission is not an ordinary landlord. It is a monopoly landlord and is in a completely different position. For that reason it is most important that people who must go to the Coal Commis</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1938-07-07a.624.0" colnum="624" time="">
<p>sion if they wish to have a coal lease, should have a measure of protection. There should be some provision for arbitration. The hon. and learned Member for North Hammersmith (Mr. Pritt) objected to an arbitration clause being inserted, and argued that these matters should rather be dealt with by the courts, but as one who is not as familiar with the legal profession as is the hon. and learned Member, and speaking as a member of the commercial community, I say that one of the reasons why people like arbitration clauses is that they find arbitration both cheaper and quicker. As one engaged in the coal industry I personally prefer arbitration. For all these reasons I hope the Government will agree to the Amendment.</p>

This Amendment and the following Amendment will change the words in paragraph (<i>e</i>) so that the latter part will read:
<q>which, if done, would be likely to cause actual damage other than of a purely nominal amount.</q>
This Clause refers to the prevention of actions being brought to restrain what would be purely technical trespass through other people's land underground. After consideration it was found that as "substantial" might not prevent a person doing damage of a small, though real, amount, the proper phrase is "other than of a purely nominal amount."</p>

<p>This is another illustration small in scope, but substantial in reality, of the way in which under this Bill the Commission is step by step being sabotaged, if that is not too strong a word. These words will not so much hamper the Commission as ensure that more money will go out of the public purse into private pockets than would

otherwise be the case. The position is fairly simple so far as a necessarily complicated Bill like this can make it. The Commission have power themselves, or by licence to give other persons power to do a good many things in the way of underground operations that are necessary. It is then provided that they are not to have the power to interfere with underground operations or with the surface of any land and to do other things provided for in the paragraphs in this Clause, all of which are quite reasonable. As paragraph (<i>e</i>) left this House it was a very sensible and enlightened provision dealing with the difficulties of the law of trespass and, indeed, of nuisance.<br/>
The law of trespass is an all-embracing law which says you can be stopped doing a thing which interferes in any degree with a person or his property. The law of nuisance, while much less strong and definite, is a thing of which great use can be made by adjoining landlords and proprietors of property. Almost everybody knows of the threat of action for nuisance to light, in regard to which the House of Lords gave a sensible decision in another capacity, in which they shine much better, limiting the matter to cases of real damage. For almost half a century the threat of an action for an injunction, designed not so much actually to hold up building operations, but to obtain by something little better than blackmail sums of money from people carrying on building operations, has resulted in the cost of building and rents going up.<br/>
That is a typical illustration of the way in which the law of this country can be used by rich interests to make themselves richer and to make other people poorer. As this paragraph left this House it was really a very enlightened provision. The Commission were told they were not to do any act which, but for this Clause, would be actionable as a trespass or nuisance and which, if it were done, would cause actual damage of a substantial amount. Except that it would have been simpler to say "substantial damage," it was a very good provision. The other place says that you must not do anything which, if it were done, would be likely to cause actual damage other than of a purely nominal amount. That does two things. It gives or preserves a cause of action in a case where the actual damage is likely to cost 42s.,


because 40s. is nominal damage, so I suppose that 42s. is damage other than a purely nominal amount. It also gives the right not merely when it would cause actual damage, but when it is merely likely to cause actual damage.<br/>
Therefore, the predatory enemy of the Commission being a lessee or owner of some bit of land or interest in land, which enables him in one way or another to come within this proviso, is given the one thing that he ought not to be given. He is given the right to obtain an injunction or the right to threaten to obtain an injunction. Unfortunately, our legal system is so complicated and extensive that to give anybody a right even to threaten an action is to give him a right to hinder and even to hold up the operations of the Commission by threats which he may be willing to withdraw if he is paid a sum of money, provided only that it is large enough. This is essentially a case in which the House ought to stand by its opinions as expressed when this Bill went to another place, and to say, "We made up our minds that the proper thing to do was to get rid of purely technical causes of action, the opportunity of wasting time, of extracting money by threats of action in purely technical matters." This House ought to say, "Persons shall rightly and properly be saved from acts which, if done, would cause substantial damage to them, and not be given the opportunity to employ their lawyers or other agents to hamper the Commission by saying, We do not say it would cause substantial damage; we only say it would be likely to cause substantial damage.'"<br/>
Lawyers ought to welcome it, unless they have some sense of public duty and responsibility, but as it stands it might just as well not be there at all. It enables everything that could be called a trespass or a nuisance&#x2014;and practically everything can be called a trespass, as practically everybody can be called a nuisance&#x2014;and so long as the thing is little more than purely nominal the whole dreary business of solicitors, counsel, threats and talk of injunctions, waste of time, and sudden realisation that a plaintiff groaning with indignation is prepared to quench that indignation for &#x00A3;25 or &#x00A3;250, starts its weary round again, as if this House had never expressed an opinion to the contrary. I ask this House to say, "We do not subscribe

to everything that is selfish, reactionary, and objectionable that another place proposes."</p>

<p>We on this side are getting a little bit tired of never having any answer whatsoever to the arguments put up on these Clauses. Time after time in the course of these Debates we have put up what we consider to be arguments of some value, and then waited, and there has never been a reply upon them, except in one or two isolated cases. Surely when a Minister opens a case of this kind and an argument is put up, as my hon. and learned Friend has put one up, by someone who has at least some understanding of the law, Ministers might at least have the courtesy of pointing out to the House why they think that that argument is wrong, in order that the House might form some opinion upon the merits of the Amendment. This is a case which, I agree with my hon. and learned Friend, is a serious matter as regards the future of the Commission. The Commission were protected by this House from having actions and threats brought against them unless there was damage of a substantial kind actually caused, and that is a matter where the onus would have been on the plaintiff to prove his case.<br/>
Now the position is that an act can be done, and it is judged by whether it is actionable or not, and it cannot be done if it can be shown that it can be likely to cause actual damage other than of a purely nominal amount. The Commission would have to show in such a case that purely nominal damages would be done if they did the act. It has shifted the onus from one side to the other, and it has made the criterion, not substantial damage, but other than purely nominal damage. It has made the criterion not whether it would cause damage, but whether it would be likely to cause damage, leaving an enormous area for threats if the Commission want to do something which they consider necessary for the purpose of exerting the rights which this House has given them. It is just this sort of Amendments that one comes across time after time in this Bill, Amendments intended to hamper the Commission and to give a neighbouring landowner a threat of some kind by which he can extort something further from the Commission,


in order that they may become the mulch cows of the neighbouring landlords, to get what money they can from them. This kind of Amendment is not drafting, but is put in purposely and definitely to benefit landowners who will be adjoining the land of the Commission, and we think Ministers should give some answer to the argument as to the alterations that have been made. Surely prima facie we can assume that the Bill, as it left this House, was a Bill assented to by the Government, and assented to by the House by a majority, but here we find a material alteration, and when arguments are put forward to show the effects of that alteration and that we could not assent to it, we cannot get an answer from the Front Bench opposite.</p>

<p>I apologise to the hon. and learned Gentleman, but I was waiting until the Debate had concluded, and indeed I was taking down notes of what the hon. and learned Gentleman opposite was saying. He sees in this an important alteration, but we consider it as merely a change in the form of words to bring them into line with what the House intended. We think this is merely a verbal alteration and that it does not at all affect what is intended, which is merely to prevent any actions being brought to restrain what might be a purely technical trespass of a very minute nature. It has not been put in to hamper the Commission or to assist neighbouring landowners; it has been put in because we thought this was a better form of words to carry out the decision of this House. I hope the hon. and learned Gentleman opposite will take my assurance that there is no ulterior motive about this, and that we have really tried to bring to the notice of the House any matter which we thought could possibly be of substance.</p>

<p>I should be much obliged if the right hon. and learned Gentleman the Attorney-General would advise the House on this matter, as to whether these words do or do not make a difference in this Clause as it left the House.</p>

<p>I have a fairly clear recollection of the intention of the original Clause when it was before this House on

the Committee stage, and I think I remember pledging myself&#x2014;I cannot charge my memory exactly&#x2014;in the clearest possible terms that the intention of this Clause was to prevent actions being brought against the Commission in what my hon. and gallant Friend has just said was purely technical cases of trespass. The alteration is to the words "would cause actual damage," and surely nobody can pretend that the Commission should be free to do acts which would be likely to cause actual damage. The Committee must have intended that what were to be ruled out were cases in which the act would be likely to cause actual damage. I appreciate the astute eye with which my hon. and learned Friend opposite detects subtle differences here.</p>

<p>Because it is a more accurate expression of the intention. The words "would be likely to" carry out the intention which was embodied in the word "would" and carry it out more accurately. With regard to the question of damages "other than purely nominal," I submit that there is no difference, but that it is a more accurate way of framing the intention of the original Clause as it was accepted by this House. What was intended to be done was to protect the Commission against claims of a purely technical kind.</p>

<p>Would the right hon. and learned Gentleman say that he would be in the same position if he was told that, on the one hand, he was to receive in a case a substantial fee and, on the other hand, he was to receive something more than a nominal fee?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1938-07-07a.632.3" hansard_membership_id="12013" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/20792" speakername="The Attorney-General" colnum="632" time="">
<p>That just shows the danger of taking words out of their context and putting them in somewhere else. I think it is clear that if we read the word "substantial" in this Clause as it was originally drafted, its meaning was "other than nominal," and the correct words are "other than nominal," because that is the intention of the Clause. I suggest that this is more accurately and more precisely expressing the intention of the original Clause.</p>

<p>I beg to move, "That this House doth agree with the Lords in the said Amendment."<br/>
In the Bill there are already two Clauses dealing with what is called the interim period between valuation and the vesting date, and the property is held during that period with certain obligations arising from the sale. This Clause extends to some extent those provisions, of course in favour of the Commission, by saying that from the passage of the Bill the property will be held in a fiduciary capacity, and that really amounts to those


obligations which come into effect on the valuation date being ante-dated from that date to the date when the Bill passes. I am sure that every one will agree that this is an improvement, and I hope that there will be no difficulty in the minds of anyone about accepting it.</p>

<p>I think this Amendment partially carries out a suggestion which we on this side put forward in an Amendment in another form when the Bill was in Committee, which was rejected by the Government, and we therefore have no objection to this new Clause provided that it is spelt rightly. In the last line but two I presume that the word "factitious" is meant to be "fictitious," because a factitious value would be a very odd thing to come across, while a fictitious value is quite a reasonable thing to find. As their lordships apparently cannot spell we may as well put it right.</p>

<p>Surely, as it is speaking of value, it must mean a fictitious, or artificial, value. I see that an hon. and learned Member opposite wants to get up to explain the position.</p>

<p>I had the curiosity to look this up in the Oxford Dictionary at lunch yesterday and the two words mean exactly the same thing. "Factitious" comes from <i>facio,</i> and fictitious from <i>fingo,</i> and the meaning in each case is "artificial."</p>

<p>If someone so conversant with mining matters and with this legislation as the hon. and learned Gentleman had to resort to the Oxford English Dictionary to find out what the word means I suggest that we put ordinary English into the Bill, and the ordinary English is certainly "fictitious" and not "factitious," and if it means nothing but artificial I suggest that we leave it out altogether, because we have "artificial" in already. I should like to move an Amendment to leave out the words "factitious or."</p>

<p>To satisfy the hon. and learned Member, the word "factitious," which I understand is perfectly correct in this case, according to the Concise Oxford Dictionary means "designedly got up, not natural."</p>

<p>As the hon. and gallant Gentleman had to look it up in the dictionary, I may say that I have never come across the word in any legal document or Act of Parliament. I have often come across the word "fictitious." It is really fantastic that we should put into Acts of Parliament words of which nobody in the House knows the meaning until they look in the Oxford English Dictionary. I suggest that we are making fools of ourselves if we do that sort of thing, and I ask you, Mr. Speaker, as a matter of guidance, Is there no way of preventing us making fools of ourselves?</p>

<p>Lords Amendment: In page 19, line 41, after Clause 17, insert new Clause F&#x2014;(<i>Power of the Court to appoint receiver and manager on the application of the Commission.</i>)

<p>I beg to move, as an Amendment to the Lords Amendment, in line 5, to leave out the words:
<q>the Court in which the proceedings are pending,</q>
and to insert:
<q>and in any other case where the premises are or are about to become subject to a coal-mining lease, the Court</q>
The object of this Amendment is to assist the Secretary for Mines to attain the objective which he announced yesterday when we were discussing the Amendment to Clause 2 of the Bill by which we proposed to insert the words "continuing employment." He pointed out that it was not necessary to insert those words because this new Clause, put into the Bill in another place, would cover the point we had in view, and he told us that the Commission could at any time go to the Court in a case where a lease was either terminated or about to terminate and get a receiver and manager appointed, and that the manager could then continue the undertaking, and that that provided for the case in which there was sudden termination or the danger of sudden termination of the employment of the workpeople. We put the view&#x2014;I think the right view&#x2014;that the new Clause F as drafted did not cover what the Secretary for Mines thought it covered. When our Amendment was turned down by the House, we thought that it was only right and proper that we should put in an Amendment to make the new Clause F actually do what the Minister thought it did, thereby giving him the opportunity of voting for the Clause in the form in which he would like the Clause to be.<br/>
In the original Clause F as inserted by their Lordships,
<q>in any proceedings in which the Commission claim to recover possession of premises vested in them from a lessee thereof, or other relief in respect of a breach by the lessee of his obligations under the lease, the court in which the proceedings are pending may, on the application of the Commission, make"&#x2014;</q>
certain orders, among them orders for the purpose
<q>of enabling operations for coal-mining purposes to be carried on on the premises.</q>
The Clause at present is limited to cases in which proceedings have been brought before a court by the Commission

<q>to recover possession of premises vested in them from a lessee thereof, or other relief in respect of a breach by the lessee of his obligations under the lease.</q>
The case which we desire to cover is not that in which there are proceedings but in which the lessee, for some reason or other which we discussed at great length yesterday, gives up the lease, and the Commission are met with the difficulty that they cannot continue to produce coal or carry on the operations of coal-mining because they have no power so to do.<br/>
What we suggest in the Amendment is that they should be permitted in such circumstances to make application to the court to appoint a receiver and manager of the empty mine or the mine which may become empty, who should on their behalf be allowed, under conditions made by the court, to carry on the operations so that the Commission would then be able to arrange provisions in the interim whereby the mine might be permanently carried on by a new lessee. It was generally agreed in the House yesterday that that is the only effective way by which you can keep a mine in proper order for letting to a new lessee. If the mine is allowed to become derelict, in the sense that production ceases altogether, you not only diminish the value of the property but you diminish the chance of getting someone to take over the mine for permanent production. This Amendment of ours will get over any difficulty in the Commission permanently carrying on any undertaking. They will be entirely subject to the control of the court as to how long the receiver and manager can continue, and as to the conditions under which he shall operate.<br/>
We suggest this course as a second-best way to getting the Amendment which we moved yesterday. It is a method which will enable the difficulties that we mentioned to be overcome, without any danger whatsoever of infringing the precious principles of Capitalism which this Bill shows to be so inefficient in the carrying on of coal-mining.</p>

<p>I do not think that the argument which the hon. and learned Gentleman has given is exactly what my hon. and gallant Friend said yesterday. I have looked at what he said and I see that he started his reference to the Clause which we are now discussing by saying:


<q>If there were for the time being a breach of any coal-mining lease."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 6th July, 1938; col. 438, Vol. 338.]</q>
He made it clear that that applied only in certain circumstances. This is not strictly in order on the discussion that we are having, but I thought it right to make a reference to it.<br/>
In view of some observations which were made by the hon. and learned Gentleman opposite, as to the general tendency of the Government in these matters, namely, to limit the power of the Commission, it is perhaps relevant to point out that the Lords Amendment gives the Commission power which they did not possess when the Bill left this House and when there was no power in the Commission to appoint a receiver and manager to carry on the business of coal-mining in any circumstances. It is only right to point out that an Amendment has come from another place which increases the power of the Commission. So attracted is the hon. and learned Gentleman to the lead which has been given to him by another place that he is anxious to carry the matter a little further. I think I can put shortly the position as it was in the Bill.<br/>
Let us take the case of a lease which comes to an end in the normal way, that is to say, at the end of the period for which it has been entered into. The Commission will know in that case when the date is coming, and they will be able to negotiate for a renewal of the lease with the existing lessee; or, if for any reason the existing lessee does not want to continue, and the mine has to continue in working, the Commission will have plenty of time to look round for another lessee to take the place of that lessee. In that case the Bill would operate as it left this House, namely, that no power would be required by the Commission to carry on the working of the mine. The Commission now have a power which they did not have, enabling them to take steps to see that the mine is preserved. The new Clause proposed by their Lordships deals with the covenant in which the lessee is in default. I suggest to hon. and right hon. Gentlemen opposite that the case which they put yesterday and which we are now considering is that in which the lessee is in default. In all these cases there is a covenant to work the mine, and if the mine is closing down and men are being thrown out of employment,

there is a breach of the covenant to work. If the colliery is becoming insolvent&#x2014;it may be in arrear with its rent&#x2014;and if the mine is continuing in work, there is not a breach.</p>

<p>I am not saying that there may not be such cases, but the normal case contemplated in the speeches made yesterday was that in which there was a breach of the lease by the company. If the mine continues to be worked, men will not be thrown out of employment, whereas if men are being thrown out of employment there will have been a default and a breach of the covenant. There may be other breaches and there may also be arrears of rent. Under the proposed new Clause the Commission will have power to apply to the court for relief against the lessee who, <i>ex hypothesi,</i> is in breach. Relief can be applied for against him and an order can be obtained from the court
<q>for the purpose of enabling operations for coal-mining purposes to be carried on on the premises or for the preservation thereof, during the continuance of the lease and during any period that may elapse between a determination thereof and the granting of a new lease.</q>
That covers the circumstances which were considered yesterday and does, in our view, adopt the right principle, having regard to the principle affirmed in this House that in ordinary circumstances the Commission are not to carry on the business of coal mining. If you find that owing to default by a lessee a mine is not being carried on, any court can order this power to be exercised on the part of the Commission through a receiver and manager.<br/>
The hon. and learned Gentleman would carry it further. He would throw upon the court further jurisdiction, and would provide that where there has been no default against the lessee and where mines are or are about to become not subject to a coal-mining lease, the court might give the Commission permission to exercise that power. The hon. and learned Gentleman's Amendment would open up the whole question which we discussed yesterday, because it seeks to cover the period when a coal-mine lease has come to its end in the normal course and when


the Commission have had months or years of notice to make any arrangements they want to make for the continuance for the working of the coal mine. In those circumstances, their new power would not be exercisable under the new Clause F, in its present form. The other point concerns the words "are about to become." We have to consider in what circumstances, if the lease has come to an end in the normal period, the mine is about to become not subject to a coal-mining lease, because the 60 or 70 years of the lease have run out. The observation which I made just now is relevant. We do not think that in those circumstances a court or anybody else ought to give the power to appoint a manager to work that coal mine. If there has been no default and the lease is about to come to an end, application can be made to the court under the new Clause F as it stands, and if the court thinks it is a proper case&#x2014;the House knows that application can be made pending proceedings&#x2014;that position is safeguarded in the Clause as unamended, except in the case which we do not desire to cover, where the lease has come to an end through the effluxion of time.<br/>
I would make one further observation with regard to the hon. and learned Gentleman's proposed Amendment. It would confer, I think, an unusual jurisdiction upon the court. There would be no parties. The Commission would be going to the court to ask the court, on principles on which no particular guidance would be given to them, to decide, without argument or issue or substantial guidance, whether in the circumstances the Commission should appoint a manager. That would be an unusual procedure, because the Order would entitle the manager to use other people's property. For instance, debenture holders might have rights over the property. Very likley the hon. and learned Member would be able to suggest ways of getting over these difficulties, but under the Clause as we have it the parties will be there, and we believe that the Clause, giving this power in case where the lessee is in breach, is a sufficient protection against the evil which has been apprehended of a mine being put out of action merely because the lessee is in default and is unable to continue working. We suggest that the hon. and learned Member's Amendment

goes far wider than is necessary, that it would contradict a general principle affirmed by the House, and that other difficulties would arise out of it which would make it an impracticable suggestion.</p>

<p>We are dealing here with the coal industry, and the legal arguments to which we have listened from both sides of the House indicate that we are dealing with something which is very material. I submit, however, that it can be cut down to very human considerations. I understand that the Attorney-General is prepared to accept the Lords Amendment, which provides for cases in which the lessee is in default. In such cases the Government are prepared to accept the position that the Commission may go to the court, and that the court may, on the evidence, empower the Commission to keep the mine open. The Amendment of my hon. and learned Friend the Member for East Bristol (Sir S. Cripps) broadens the Lords Amendment to the extent that, where the lease is expiring or has expired, it would enable the Commission to go to the court for powers to carry on the mine until such time as in their judgment they thought it was expedient to close it, or a new buyer came along.<br/>
I would ask the Attorney-General to look at this matter from the angle from which I am looking at it. It may be that a colliery company decides to give the necessary notice under the lease to discontinue working the mine. That may be due to financial reasons, or it may be due to bad management, but bad management has a very direct connection with financial reasons in the running of any business. The Attorney-General says that in that case the Commission would have sufficient time to look round to get a new lessee. They certainly would have some time to look round, but it does not follow that they would have sufficient time to look round to get a new lessee, and, in the event of a new lessee not coming forward, then, merely because of a fear of putting too much power into the hands of the Commission, the pit is to go out of production, which means in many cases, as some of my hon. Friends on this side know from actual experience, going out of commission for ever. Pumps are drawn, electricity is cut off, everything


is finished, and the water is allowed to rise. Then it is a matter of great expense to de-water the pit, and you cannot find a lessee willing to come in with sufficient capital to de-water the pit and bring it back into production.<br/>
At the last pit but one where I worked, it was decided, for financial reasons, that it was not possible to carry on any longer. The concern went into voluntary liquidation, a receiver was appointed by the court, and, if I recollect rightly, it was in the hands of the receiver for two years. During that time coal was being produced, everything was kept in perfect order, and then a new lessee came and took the place and we got several more years' work as the result. It meant employment for some 700 or more men and boys, and money coming into the town, which unfortunately, since then, has become more or less derelict. Is the fear of putting too much power into the hands of the Commission a sufficient reason for resisting the Amendment of my hon. and learned Friend? The consequences of a pit being closed are only known by those who have been in a district where it has happened. My hon. and learned Friend's Amendment would entirely meet such a situation as I have described, and, in view of the fact that the Attorney-General has advanced no valid reason against it, it seems to me that the Amendment should be accepted.</p>

<p>May I, with the leave of the House, make one or two observations on what the Attorney-General has said? As I understand his argument, it is that it is sufficient to make this provision in cases in which a lessee is in breach of his obligations. I cannot, however, understand the mentality that would determine the possibility of the continued employment of, say, 1, 000 men at a pit by whether or not a lessee is technically in breach. That is what it comes to. It means saying to the men, "Your possibility of continuing in work and not being scrapped will depend upon the technical question whether a breach was committed before the lease was given up." That is the attitude of the Attorney-General. Take the case of a trustee in bankruptcy who, perfectly legally, disowns the lease, as he has full right to do, and the rights under the lease are re-vested, at perhaps very short notice, in the Commission. The

Attorney-General would say that that is a case in which the Commission have no right, the men have no right, nobody has any right, because it so happens that the bankruptcy law has allowed a trustee in bankruptcy to disown the lease.<br/>
If it is right, where there is a breach of the lease, for the courts to have power to order the appointment of a receiver and manager to carry on the mine, surely there cannot be an conceivable objection, if the lease is disowned by a bankrupt, to following exactly the same procedure. There is no difficulty whatsoever as regards the procedure. An application can be made to the court for the appointment of a receiver and manager, and the court will have to be satisfied by proper evidence, as it always has to be satisfied in these cases, that the receiver is the right man, properly qualified to receive and manage the property, able to put up a bond, and all the other things which are necessary; and they will have to be satisfied that the circumstances are such as to entitle them, under the general policy laid down by the Act, to appoint a receiver. Clearly, in a case such as the Attorney-General cites, where a lease runs out in the ordinary course, they would not dream of appointing a receiver, because they would say there were no circumstances which made it necessary or proper to do so. But even in a case where the lease does run out, supposing that negotiations for the new lease are just ready for the new lessee to take on without cessation, and something happens as a result of which the negotiations cannot be completed by the time the old lessee goes out, so that there is a gap of a week, a fortnight, or a month, nothing at all can be done to keep the pit going during that period.<br/>
We are not so concerned with the question of the condition of the property; we are vitally concerned with the men, and we are most anxious, under such safeguards as are considered necessary, to make a provision by which, in such circumstances, somebody has the power to say that the case is one in which it is proper that the men should not be thrown out of work for a fortnight, or a month, or whatever the period may be. If there is no provision unless a lessee is found to be in breach, you are compelled to start proceedings against him, whether you want to do so or not, in order to get a receiver and manager


appointed. In many cases there may be a technical breach of some kind on account of which you would not dream of proceeding to an action, because it would be perfectly useless and simply throwing good money after bad. But in such a case you would be forced to start proceedings, because otherwise you could not get the relief asked for. We ask the House to insert these words, so that this protection may be given to the men. It will always be under the control of the courts, and it is perfectly certain, in view of the terms of the Bill, that the courts will not be in the least likely in any case to extend the conditions in which they will appoint a receiver and manager so as to allow the Commission to carry on permanently under the cloak or guise of a manager-ship. For these reasons, we ask the House to support the Amendment.</p>

<p>With the leave of the House, perhaps I might make a very brief reply to the speeches which have been made. The hon. Member for Morpeth (Mr. R. J. Taylor) put the case in which a colliery company went into liquidation and the mine was carried on by a receiver until a new lessee appeared. That will be just as possible under this Bill as it was when the coal was in private hands. If a colliery company were in liquidation, a receiver would be appointed, who could carry on in exactly the same way, and there is nothing in the Lords Amendment to prevent that happening.<br/>
With regard to the hon. and learned Gentleman's point, the one example which he put against my argument was the case of a disclaimer by a trustee in bankruptcy. I cannot think that that is a case which would prevent application under this Clause. Trustees in bankruptcy do not descend, so to speak, instantaneously. They are the unfortunate result of previous events: a process of insolvency, the filing of a petition and so on. I cannot but think that, prior to the appointment of a trustee in bankruptcy and a disclaimer of the kind described, there would have been a default, and investigation would have been made and, one way or another, an arrangement would have been made. For those reasons, I do not think this Amendment should be accepted.</p>

<p>I would commend this as the lamest explanation given by His Majesty's Government on either a small or a large point. Let us take this case. A man or a partnership is running a pit. They hold on as long as they can without disclosing that they are in difficulties. The last thing they want to do is to ruin their asset&#x2014;or the asset of their creditors&#x2014;by closing the pit. Then the crash comes. Everybody who has even an elementary knowledge of bankruptcy law knows that the matter is not made public until it reaches a certain stage. First the bankrupt, before he becomes bankrupt, and then his trustee in bankruptcy, will, at all reasonable costs, keep the pit running. But then they come to a Friday, let us say, when they see that they can no longer keep it running. They give their notices, and finally out they go. At the same moment the trustee in bankruptcy disclaims. The law says that that is an absolutely lawful thing to do. It involves no breach by anybody. There never having been a default&#x2014;because of the necessary sensible commercial effort to keep going&#x2014;the law steps in and says to the trustee in bankruptcy that it is right in the general interest that whereas the bankrupt could never say "I am walking out on this lease and dropping it without default," the trustee may say that he is walking out without default.<br/>
The instance given by my hon. and learned Friend was not one which merely might happen or could be avoided. It is practically certain in every case. Therefore, you will get the position that in practically every bankruptcy of a firm or an individual the trustee in bankruptcy will disclaim, and the Commission will have to say: "Thanks to the wisdom of the Attorney-General on 7th July, 1938, we are absolutely compelled to say that this asset shall go to minor, or perhaps major, ruin."<br/>
With regard to the other illustration given by my hon. and learned Friend, what possibility there is of answering that is best gauged by the fact that the Attorney-General, who spoke again with the leave of the House, wisely left it unanswered. What amazes me about the whole thing is that hour after hour, on Amendment after Amendment, it is pointed out to the Government that they are sabotaging this Bill, and the Government


either say nothing or say, "We do not think we are," when it is plain to everybody that they are. It is perfectly obvious that either they are terrified of Lord Cromwell, terrified of the coalowners, or that they do not know what they are doing.</p>

<p>I intervene with some diffidence in this controversy to say how it appears to me as a layman. Hon. and learned Member on this side say that the words they propose to introduce will, in some cases, be useful. I thought they made out a very strong case from that point of view. The Attorney-General answered them by saying that no circumstances would arise in which the words they propose to introduce could be of any use. While he was speaking I was carried away by his argument. It seemed to me that he was right. Subsequently it seemed to me that the legal arguments on this side were a little stronger.</p>

<p>I beg to move, "That this House doth agree with the Lords in the said Amendment."<br/>
We had considerable discussion at one time as to whether the three kinds of rents which could be reduced, and are in Sub-section (2) of Clause 21, were to be taken in that order or not, and I expressed the view at the time that the Commission could choose which of them they wished. The Amendment is introduced in order to make that quite clear, if there are any doubts anywhere. It</p>

<p>I do object to the Lords dealing with finance in this way. Empowering a body to borrow to pay other people's bad debts seems to be about the most unsound kind of finance. Perhaps it is the sort of finance with which their Lordships who are interested in this Bill are familiar. We shall, therefore, oppose this Amendment on the principle that the Lords ought not to interfere with the Privilege of this House as regards financial matters, and also because it seems to us thoroughly unsound finance.</p>

The Amendment is consequential on the alteration that has been made in Clause 10.</p>

<p>I am not certain that this alteration is necessitated by the amendment of Clause 10. This Clause makes provision as regards the limitation of costs payable in disputes between adverse claimants, and it is an over-riding provision which covers the whole of this part of this Bill and the Registration Act. The Clause provides that with respect to the payment of costs by the Commission the provisions of this part of this Act and of the Registration Act shall have effect subject to a limitation. That is to say, the liability shall not extend to costs incurred after the date of the passing of the Act that are occasioned by any proceedings for the determination of disputes between adverse claimants.<br/>
I do not see why, because in Clause 10 a code of costs has been laid down, that code should not also be subject to this over-riding exception, that the Commission should not have to pay costs as between adverse claimants. If it is said that cases are not likely to arise under Clause 10 as it is now drafted in which adverse claimants will have costs against

one another, then there is no reason for inserting this exception. We take the view that there is no reason why the Commission should pay costs as between adverse claimants. They have to pay under various Clauses, but in no circumstances should they have to pay the costs as between adverse claimants. Surely, it is perfectly fair and just to say that, however much they may have to pay the costs of claimants, they should not have to pay costs solely incurred by virtue of two adverse claimants engaging in proceedings one against the other.</p>

<p>This matter arises from difference of machinery after the Amendment that we passed yesterday. Under the old machinery the conception was that there would be two leases drawn up, one dealing with coal rights and the other with surface rights, and the costs in connection with those leases were to be borne by the Commission, As I explained yesterday, under the new procedure there will be no new leases but an apportionment of the rent under the old lease. In case of dispute it arises necessarily from the vesting under the Act. It is a dispute as between adverse claimants by reason of the vesting of the Act, and it is therefore right that the provision in the present Amendment should be made.</p>

<p>Some difficulty arises here. It is in this Clause that you get any reference to the High Court or the Court of Appeal. In the body of the Bill the reference, so far as I have been able to discover, is to the court, not to the High Court. The term "court" is not defined in Clause 40, and in a previous Lords Amendment it was a reference to the court not to the High Court. In a section of the Clause there is a reference to "the court in which proceedings are pending," and in Clause 9, Subsection (3), there is also a reference to "the court" which makes a declaration. It is not the High Court. Accordingly it seems to me that the Lords Amendment should read "the court" and not the Court of Appeal.</p>

<p>No, I think not. It is plain that where there is a reference in the Bill to "the court," and nothing more is said, there is no need to translate it, because a reference to "the court" in a Scottish Act is an intelligible reference. The difference is where it is a reference to the High Court. It is true that in the Clauses to which the hon. and learned Member has referred, the reference is to "the court," but there are references, particularly in the Schedule, to the High Court. We have no High Court in Scotland and, therefore, it means the Court of Session.


The reason why the Court of Appeal is taken out of the Bill is because there is no reference in the Bill to the Court of Appeal.</p>

The reason for moving this Amendment is because in a number of other Clauses in the Bill there is a provision for the Lord President of the Court of Session to act as the nominator of the arbiter in certain matters, and under this provision any question in law will ultimately come to the Court of Session, not to the sheriff.

This new Sub-section is rendered necessary by a doubt expressed in another place as to the possible effects on rating of the changes made by this Bill. The doubt was whether the severance of coal from the surface might in certain circumstances render the annual rateable value of the subject higher than it would have been if matters had been left as before. It is not the intention of the Government that the result of the Bill should be to increase the burden of the local rates, end therefore, this Sub-section is put in with a view of obviating any possibility of that occurring.</p>

We now pass from the question of royalties to the other functions of the Commission. The House will recollect that the Commission have certain duties cast upon them in regard to the reduction of undertakings, and as the Bill left this House the Commission, if they considered that adequate progress had not been made in that direction, could make a report to the Board of Trade and recommend that their powers to submit amalgamation schemes should become exercisable in the area which they specified in their report as one in which the reduction was inadequate. These words clearly give some idea of what the report should contain. It says that in the report they should set forth their proposals with regard to the area, and the advantages which they expected to follow from amalgamation. As a matter of fact, it is hard to imagine that a statutory Commission of this kind in submitting a report to the Board of Trade as a result of which action is to be taken, would not give in outline what they intended and what they hoped would follow from the action. At some stage it will have to be done, because Parliament itself will want to be satisfied. This makes it clear that in our opinion it is better it should be done at the earliest possible moment.</p>

He would have said that to pick out two special matters like this and particularise them is quite wrong and very dangerous, because it might be said that they are the only two matters which need be put in the report, and he would beg the House not to pass so foolish an Amendment, because if you limit what shall be put in the report it will become the maximum rather than the minimum. On those grounds he would advise the House very strongly to reject the Amendment. Now as it comes from his master's voice, he says that we had better accept it.</p>

This is to say that after receiving the recommendations of the Commission the Board of Trade may bring a report before Parliament with recommendations, and it is to make it clear that the Board of Trade may in submitting a Provisional Order to Parliament modify the proposals recommended by the Commission. It also requires that the Order itself shall prescribe the period within which the compulsory powers shall be exercised. That is a reasonable provision, because I do not think Parliament will want to pass an Order and then have it left in cold storage in the offices of the Commission, and people who may be expected to come into the scheme not know whether it was going to be carried out this year or next year. The Amendment is an improvement on the Bill and does not do anything contrary to the intentions of this House.</p>

<p>I beg to move, "That this House doth agree with the Lords in the said Amendment."<br/>
We now come to the powers of the Commission to obtain information. Under the Bill as it left this House any member or officer or technical agent appointed by the Commission and authorised by the Commission to make inquiries for the purpose of securing information, could enter premises and take copies of whatever might be necessary, and any person who obstructed him in the exercise of these powers to get information was guilty of an offence. This is a slight limitation and it is a limitation which, as a matter of fact, several hon. Members voiced in this House. They fear that the Commission might authorise some person who would have a kind of completely roving commission and be able to look at all sorts of information of great interest, but which was not necessary for the actual purpose in hand. Therefore, this Amendment says that where the Commission require information to discharge their duties and where they consider it necessary to cause inspection to be made, they shall serve notice on the persons carrying on the undertaking to say what is the general nature of the information required. That would seem to be a reasonable thing to do, and obviously it is what, in fact, the Commission would do. They would not be likely to swoop down on a colliery undertaking without giving any notice. This Amendment would not limit the Commission as to how often it made such an inspection; it would not limit it to any great extent; and in any case, if anybody obstructed the Commission or refused to divulge information, the powers which have been taken under the Bill to safeguard such a position are quite untouched.</p>

<p>It is contemplated that the Commission will have these inspectors. They will operate not only for one Part of the Act, but presumably for the Commission generally. They will not go to a mine on one day and say that they are acting under Part I of the Act, and on another day, under Part II of it; they will go to a mine for the purpose of making an inspection, ascertaining facts, seeing plans, or whatever it may be, in a dual capacity. They will not be able to divide up their functions between Part I and Part II, unless there is to be great expense placed upon the Commission. Therefore, I assume that if one of these inspectors goes to a mine in Lancashire, he will go there to carry out all these functions. He will not go to a mine on one day and say that he is a Part I inspector, and then go again on the next day and say that he is a Part II inspector. If that is done, it will lead to enormously increased expense. What this provision says is that the inspector, or the mineral agent, when he goes to a mine to carry out his functions equally under both Parts of the Act, will have to give notice to the lessee, who will be the lessee of the Commission. Therefore, the lessee will always be told in advance when the inspector is coming.<br/>
If the hon. and gallant Gentleman says that the Commission is going to run its business so that the inspectors will be kept separate and will aways be operating either under Part I or Part II, the point which I am raising will not arise in practice; but if it is to be run as a practical business proposition, the inspector must carry out both functions when he is inspecting a pit. In that case, such an inspector or agent will have always to notify a pit or a colliery company in advance that he is coming and the general nature of the information which, under Part II, he requires. I cannot see why that notification should be given. Why cannot the mineral agent who is going round for the purpose of ascertaining facts as regards Part I or Part II, when he goes to a colliery on Part I business, also say to the manager, "While I am here, you might let me see the plans for the purpose of some amalgamation scheme." He will not be able to do that under this provision. I cannot see the value of this Amendment, except to hamper the Commission in the performance of their duties under Part II, which no doubt is the object of the Amendment.<br/>
I cannot see the object of putting in this requirement that notice should be given in advance not only that the inspector is coming, but also of the general nature of the information that is required by him. When this matter was discussed in the House before, all sorts of limiting suggestions were put forward and the Government rejected all of them, because they said that it was necessary, for the efficient carrying on of the business of the Commission, that they should have powers as in Clause 44, Sub-section (1). Now the other place wants to make it more difficult for the Commission to work Part II, and the Government say that it is advisable to accept this Amendment.</p>

<p>The hon. and learned Gentleman the Member for East Bristol (Sir S. Cripps) made quite clear what he thinks should be the powers of the Commission. Surely, it cannot be suggested that if the Commission send a representative to a mine for the specific purpose provided for in Part II, namely, to make an examination from the point of view of an amalgamation, they should be able to use that power for every other purpose under the Bill. I should like

to be informed by the Attorney-General whether the Commission would have the right, having got this power for the specific purpose which is made quite plain in this Part of the Bill, to make use of that power for any other purposes. This Part of the Bill deals specifically with amalgamations, and it should be made quite clear that those representatives will not have a roving commission which will enable them to do exactly as they like as regards every Part of the Bill. The hon. and learned Member for East Bristol, in the speech which he has just made, made quite clear what are his political opinions; he wants the inspectors, under this provision, to be able to do almost anything. I should have thought that the power which we are now discussing had particular reference to amalgamations.</p>

<p>I think my hon.and learned Friend the Member for East Bristol (Sir S. Cripps) made it clear that, since the Commission are to be the owner of all the minerals, they ought to have the right to examine their own property without going through these formalities. Clause 44, as it left this House, gave to any member or officer of, or technical or professional agent appointed by, the Commission, the power to examine a colliery, and all that was required was that he should be authorised in writing by the Commission to represent it. Having such an authorisation in writing, he could go to the colliery and would be empowered to carry out all the examinations involved in Sub-section (1) or any part of them. Presumably, the Commission would do that when they were considering a project for reorganisation or amalgamation. In such a case, it would be essential for the Commission to have available to it all the information necessary to arrive at a sound decision.<br/>
Therefore, the Commission ought to be empowered to seek their own information in their own way, and to send their inspectors to ask for books to be produced when they arrive, and not to have to write and ask for the books to be produced two months hence. I remember that when I was in a pit, as a boy, there was on one occasion feverish activity; everything was being cleaned up. I asked what was going to happen, and I learned that it was in anticipation


of an inspector arriving. If the Commission are to be compelled to give notice in advance and to say that in a week's time their agent is going to a colliery to examine the books or to look over the colliery, everything will be prepared. Surely, the Commission ought to have full power to make test audits and test inspections as they require, and I do not think they will be able to do their business properly unless they have such a power. We are setting up this Commission, and I have already expressed very grave doubts&#x2014;</p>

<p>I do not object to the hon. Member's description of me, and I make no apology for believing in private enterprise, but I remember that on the Committee stage, the hon. Member was very doubtful about these amalgamations. He suggested to the House that at any moment a person representing the Commission might go to a colliery, take the books, and form an opinion about an amalgamation without the people concerned having a proper opportunity of putting the full facts before him, because they had not had notice beforehand. Seeing that the hon. Member was doubtful about these amalgamations for that reason, would it not be better that notice should be given so that the people concerned would have proper time to get everything ready?</p>

<p>I was doubtful about the amalgamations because I did not want the Commission to arrive at a decision on information given to them which they had no means of checking and verifying. The Commission will have very grave responsibilities. They will decide upon schemes, and they will have to send a report to Parliament. Presumably, long before they take advantage of the powers under this Clause, they will have had reports before them and will have considered whether it is in the interests of the industry and the nation that there should be an amalgamation. They will

have certain information before them, particulars of the output, and so on, and they will want to check that information. If this Amendment is accepted, will there be any power in the Bill which will enable the Commission to send an officer to make an examination on the spot without giving any notice? Surely, it is right that the Commission should have that power. As the Secretary for Mines knows, an inspector, for the purpose of safety in mines, has the right, which is essential for his job, to arrive at a colliery and to go down without asking anybody's permission. Surely, the representative of the Commission ought to have that power as well. Under the Clause, he must be authorised in writing by the Commission, and when he is so authorised, he will be representing the Commission, which represents the nation. I urge the House, in the interests of the Commission and the work which it has to perform that the Commission should have that power. The original Clause provides&#x2014;
<q>Any member or officer of or technical or professional agent appointed by the Commission, authorised in writing by the Commission to make inquiries on their behalf as to any coal-mining undertaking &#x2026; may for the purpose of obtaining information required by them for the discharge of the functions to be performed by them by virtue of this part of this Act enter any premises," etc.</q>
If the Amendment is accepted then where information is required by the Commission for the discharge of its functions and where the Commission consider it necessary to cause an inspection of premises to be made they
<q>may after serving upon the persons carrying on the undertaking a notice showing the general nature of the information required authorise in writing</q>
any of the persons previously mentioned to make inquiries on their behalf. We suggest that it is essential that the Commission should have the power to go to any undertaking and to make a test. Suppose that having asked for and obtained this information they are not satisfied that it is correct. Suppose that it is information about the pit itself, about its equipment, about the coal seams and so forth and that they are not satisfied of its accuracy. Then under the original Clause they would have had the right to authorise a person to make investigations on their behalf but if we accept the Amendment they will have no such right. In that


respect the Commission will be handicapped. They ought to have the full power intended by the original Clause.</p>

<p>This Part of the Bill relates to amalgamations and amalgamations alone, and from the practical point of view it is better, both for the person who is making the inspection and for those in charge of the colliery undertaking, that the details should be put down on paper before the inspector arrives. If that is done a great deal of trouble will be saved. The inspectors will not be prevented from getting information. On the contrary they are much more likely to get all the information they want and to get it more quickly if they put down on paper, clearly, what they want. As regards Part I of the Bill there are other powers and other means of getting information, but as regards this Part of the Bill the more clearly the Commission define what they want the more likely they are to get the information.</p>

<p>Some of my hon. Friends are not in favour of amalgamations but I am in favour of them, and I am in favour of Clause 44 in the form in which it left this House. This Amendment is merely a delaying action on the part of those in another place. It would compel the Commission to notify the colliery proprietors of the information which they desire to have. Only if that information is refused, can they, under the Amendment, authorise a person to go to the colliery and get it, as they have a general power to do under the original Clause. What is wanted is the power to get firsthand information immediately and this Amendment is merely delaying in its character.<br/>
Further, this House thoroughly examined the Clause in its original form, and I object to another place seeking to exercise its power by putting Amendments of this character in a Clause which has already been fully considered in this House. Clause 44 as it left here covered every point which we desired to have covered in relation to the powers of the Commission. It gave the Commission full power to authorise persons on their behalf to get whatever information was desired in connection with amalgamations. This is one of the attempts which are being made by another place to kill the

Bill and I am surprised that the representatives of the Government who expressed themselves satisfied with the Clause as it left this House, should now agree that a better way has been found in another place of expressing what they intended. I hope they will be firmer in their attitude, and will not give way on this question. I hope that the House generally will take a more definite stand and resist Amendments of this kind.</p>

<p>Far from the other place having altered this Clause in a manner which is contrary to the view of the majority of this House, I believe that the majority of Members here will support the Amendment. I am aware that hon. Members opposite do not agree with the Amendment, but we must remember that the majority in this House do not believe in people being allowed to walk into anybody's office, at any time, without notice and to call for any documents they care to demand. I certainly wish to place on record my protest against any legislation of that kind. I think it forms a dangerous precedent and that all Members here who are not Socialists should oppose such legislation. As a matter of fact, great benefit is being conferred by this valuable Amendment passed in another place. An hon. Member drew an analogy between this case and the case of mines inspectors, who have an absolute right of entry without giving any notice but there is no such analogy.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Brentford and Chiswick (Mr. Mitchell) has adduced an extraordinary


argument. He takes strong exception to Government inspectors being empowered to enter premises without giving notice of their intention to do so, but I wonder what attitude he took when this House decided that inspectors should go into the homes of unemployed people for the purpose of carrying out the duties imposed on the Unemployment Assistance Board. I understand that in pursuance of those duties, those inspectors have to go, even into the bedrooms of the unfortunate people whose homes they are visiting, and I have never heard any protests from the hon. Member against Government inspectors going into the homes of the working class. The hon. Member is much behind the times. There are on the Statute Book many enactments which confer powers on Government inspectors to enter mines and factories, and I assure him that in no case are the factory or mines inspectors required to give notice of their intention to visit a factory or a mine. Those of us who, like my hon. and learned Friend the Member for East Bristol (Sir S. Cripps) and myself, have vivid recollections of the facts of the terrible disaster at the Gresford Colliery, will agree that the trouble there was not that the mine inspectors had not given notice of their intention to visit the mine, but that they had not gone there at all. It will not help matters to require these inspectors to give notice, and I hope the House will reject the Amendment.</p>

<p>Surely it is confusing the issue to bring in the case of factory inspections. What we are dealing with here is obtaining information required in connection with compulsory amalgamations. That persons should be authorised to go into offices and demand to see books and documents seems to presuppose that the undertakings already belong to the public instead of being in private ownership. As long as they are in private ownership, I suggest it necessarily follows that notice should be given before a demand is made for private information about these businesses. As an ordinary matter of business and in order to save time, notice should be given in these cases and I suggest that the opposition to this Amendment is all a storm in a teacup.</p>

<p>In view of the spirited protest made by the hon. Member for Brent-ford and Chiswick (Mr. Mitchell), it seems to me that if he had been doing his duty in the Committee stage he would have voted against this Clause in the form in which it appears in the Bill. In connection with these amalgamations the normal way of doing business will be to give notice of inspections, but cases may arise in which it is desirable that inspection should be made quickly and without notice, in the interests of the Commission, who represent the public. If we accept this Amendment we preclude the Commission from taking that step. Hon. Friends of mine who have a closer acquaintance than I have with mining inform me that it is possible, in a week, to alter the underground conditions so as to cause a pit to appear a much more valuable property than it really is. One can hardly call it "window-dressing" since it is underground, but I think hon. Members understand the idea. I understood that such a practice was not unusual in gold mines in other countries, but until this afternoon I was not aware that it had been attempted in the coal mines of this country. The Commission should be in a position to send in inspectors where they have reason to suspect such practice. If we pass this Clause in the form which satisfied the hon. Member for Brentford and Chiswick in the Committee stage, we may rest assured that notice will normally be given, but at the same time the Commission will not be precluded from making inspections without notice where they consider it in the public interest to do so.</p>

<p>It seems to me that those who are in favour of the Amendment may be divided into two categories, and it is somewhat significant that two separate arguments are sometimes to be found in the same speech. The first is that the intention of the Amendment is to facilitate the work of the Commission, and the other is that the work of the Commision ought not to be facilitated in that way because it is an unwarrantable interference with the rights of the owners. The two arguments cancel out each other. I hesitate to believe that those who are responsible for putting in this Amendment did it with the intention of assisting


the Commission and facilitating compulsory amalgamation. It seems to me in the highest degree unlikely, and from that point of view the interruption which referred to the power of inspection of mines without notice under other legislation was fully justified. It is said that it will be very much better if notice is given, it will allow people to know when the inspector is coming and what kind of information he desires, and time will be saved when he comes. There is nothing in the Clause, as it stands, to prevent the Commission from working in that way. In instances where prior notice will be helpful, the Commission may be trusted to give it. You do not need to legislate in order to compel it to give what is in its interest to give. But if the Commission feels that there are occasions on which it might be better not to give facilities, why should the over-riding power to send an inspector without giving notice be withheld except in the interest of those who do not want the Commission to carry out its work?<br/>
Those who desire the work of the Commission to be facilitated may accept the Clause unamended with a free conscience and a clear mind, and no harm will be done. Those who do not, ought not to be assisted. There are dozens of instances under existing legislation where the power of inspection without notice must be possessed by the State if the intentions of Parliament are to be carried out. Who could imagine an inspector of weights and measures, or one under the Food and Drugs Act, giving notice to a shopkeeper that he is coming on such and such a day to see whether his scales are correct? The power may never need to be used. The more power of that kind there is, the less it will need to be used. But there is no reason why this over-riding right to inspect should not be given. Those who drafted the Amendment do not appear to have done their job very well even from their own point of view, because there is nothing to say when the notice is to be given. A general notice might be served the day after the vesting date on every concern, giving some indication of the general nature of the information that might be required. It is clear that the authors of the Amendment had only one intention in their mind, and that was to obstruct the work of the Commission, as far as they could, in defiance of the will

of this House. I should have thought in those circumstances that the House would not hesitate to reject the Amendment.</p>

<p>This seems rather a storm in a teacup. I do not agree with the Amendment. I do not see that it has any great advantage and I certainly do not see that there is any great safeguard in the idea that you are going to stop people prying. The Amendment does not seem very well drawn if that is the intention. We should perhaps be wiser to reject it, because it is all dealt with in Clause 44, and anyone who thinks that it provides a safeguard is being deceived.</p>

<p>I was amazed at the simplicity of the hon. Member for South Bradford (Mr. Holdsworth) in accepting the point of view that the Commission would only deal with certain books and figures and certain aspects of the mine. If the Commission is inspecting a mine from the point of view of amalgamation, it will have to satisfy its mind upon every aspect. It will have to take in tonnage, the conditions of the mine, the output, and every question that applies to mining operations. This question of amalgamation has been brought forward by the Government because of the refusal of the owners to carry out any successful policy in this respect. The mine-owning interests are more heavily represented in another place than they are here and it is, therefore, right that the Commons, when dealing with Amendments coming from such an interested source, ought to inspect them very carefully and not accept them with the simplicity of the hon. Member for South Bradford, which to me is amazing but consistent.<br/>
Hon. Members opposite talk about a certain brand of Socialism prying into the affairs of people. Socialists have objected most strenuously to interfering with the liberties of people in their houses and in many other spheres of public life. But this is not prying into private affairs at all. It is a question of dealing with a national industry which is necessary for the good of the nation, and we are dealing with a section of the community which has forced the Bill upon the Government because of their refusal to assist amalgamation schemes in the national interest. Now hon. Members are saying that the


Commission should be restricted so that they must state definitely in writing exactly what they want to see or to do and must not ask questions about anything else. If they did, the owner would say, "Really, in our circle that sort of thing is not done."<br/>
The suggestion that is put forward means that we are to have a Commission composed of people who are either very stupid or who are not going to do their work in the way that the House of Commons desires. I believe the Minister is extremely unhappy. I believe he is divided between standing by the House of Commons and accepting the Amendment. He has placed his arguments before his masters. They have turned him down and sent him back to support a position in which he does not believe. If we want the Commission to be efficient and able to carry out their duties, we ought to extend to them the fullest powers possible.</p>

<p>I should be very unhappy if I thought that the arguments that have been adduced were really convincing, but I am only unhappy because I cannot have made myself clear in introducing the Amendment. Perhaps it is that the word "inspection" has brought a line of thought to hon. Members which it does not really connote. Hon. Members have spoken as though this was a case of somebody wanting to rush down a pit without any notice because he wanted to make an inspection of something or other. The cases of the inspector of weights and measures and the inspector of mines and the like have been cited, but this provision has nothing to do with that kind of inspection. The only point of this Amendment is that the Commission should give notice when it wants to inspect certain things, and that in doing so it should give a general indication of the kind of things it wants to get. The question was asked why notice should be given, and it was answered by my hon. Friend the Member for Ecclesall (Sir G. Ellis) when he said that that would be the quickest way of getting what was wanted.<br/>
Let me again remind the House that the Commission have two entirely different functions although they may merge in some directions. First, it will

be the universal landlord and will own all the coal. In so far as many of the speeches we have heard were concerned with the problems which were raised, I dare say the kind of inspections that the Commission will require as landlord will be governed by the clauses of the leases, I have yet to learn that a royalty owner to-day has any conceivable right, rhyme or reason under his lease or in any other way to go and make inspections of the books and the ordinary financial accounts of the colliery company which is his lessee. He may inspect the colliery for certain reasons, because he is the landlord, but this Amendment deals with information of quite a different kind. The second function with which the Commission starts is the reduction of undertakings, and in order to make up its mind whether it is necessary to close an undertaking, it has to get some of the kind of information on which it would naturally have to rely; and would also want a good deal of other information, financial information and the like. These are rights which the Commission as landlord has not got, and the Clause makes it possible for it to get that kind of information.<br/>
The only question is whether it should do it without notice and without giving any indication of what it wants. The common sense of it is that if there is a question of amalgamation and the Commission wants information of a financial and technical nature, it is not possible to go and pick it up on the spur of the moment. It is, therefore, desirable in everybody's interest for the Commission to say, "We want this information and we are coming down on a certain day; will you please have it ready for us." If that is not enough it can get further information and if there is any obstruction to getting the information, that is provided for in the Clause. Some of the arguments on this Amendment have been based on a false analogy. It does not have the result of hampering the Commission or making it difficult for it to get information. What it does is to remove the fears of certain of my hon. Friends that this Commission will have what they call a roving commission to go and look at all sorts of matters in which it is not directly concerned. I hope it will be convenient for the House to come to a decision on this point now because the business is to be interrupted.</p>

<ol>
<li>(1) For the further and better protection of highway authorities than is afforded by the Gas Works Clauses Act, 1847, in respect of the laying of pipes and mains by the company in county roads and any other roads vested in any local authority, the filling in and restoration of such roads after the pipes and mains have been laid, and the duty and expense of altering the position of such pipes and mains after any subsequent diversion, alteration, or improvement of such roads.</li>

<p>This matter is obviously a non-party one, and I think all of us in this House will agree with the objects of the Bill as set out in the circular which has doubtless been sent to all hon. Members, namely, the better co-ordination of gas supplies, the elimination of small and uneconomic gas manufacturing units, and the fuller utilisation of manufacturing plants. I would, however, point out that what is proposed is not the ordinary form


of gas undertaking to which the Gas Works Clauses Act, 1847, was originally intended to apply. What is proposed by the promoters, as I understand it, is in effect a merchanting business, whereby the company would not be under the ordinary obligation of a gas undertaking, to supply gas to all and sundry within its area who care to apply for it, but would only be under an obligation to supply those whom it cared to supply, and that makes a very considerable difference. An ordinary gas undertaking is under very serious obligations, but this particular undertaking would not be under those obligations.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1938-07-07a.685.0" colnum="685" time="">
<p>The proposals which are made are in general unexceptionable, but in some matters they are extremely serious. They are that over an area of some hundreds of square miles the company should have privileges of an ordinary gas undertaking and should also have the right of a free wayleave, in effect, over the whole of the roads in that very large area. The proposals would involve interference with public rights, and would inflict, unless there is some control such as my Instruction proposes, great inconvenience and very great expense on the general public. I have no doubt it will be said that the Gas Works Clauses Act, 1847, is sufficient protection, but I submit that that is not the case. That Act, which was passed 90 years ago, laid down a general code relating to the manner in which roads might be broken up by authorized undertakers. I think it would be agreed on all hands that that code was drawn up at a time when the methods of road construction, the character and number of sub-surface works, and the volume of traffic were very different from those existing to-day. I think we should also agree that that code is now almost obsolete and requires very drastic revision.</p>

<p>Why?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1938-07-07a.685.2" hansard_membership_id="9340" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/29941" speakername="Major Milner" colnum="685" time="">
<p>Because it does not fit the circumstances of the present day. It is surely uneconomic and improvident that the road surface which is demanded by modern road conditions should be liable to interference and damage by periodic breaking-up for the purpose of laying or repairing sub-surface pipes. Then there is the question of the modern methods of road construction. As many hon. Members know, when a concrete

foundation is laid nowadays it is in the nature of a raft, supported both by the ground below and by its own inherent strength. That concrete, for the purposes for which this company is established, may have to be cut longitudinally in order to lay or repair a pipe or main, and the road will then be filled in, in the endeavour to comply with the provisions of the Act, but I think it would be obvious that that interference would affect the strength of the concrete raft and tend to reduce its life.<br/>
For this reason we claim that the restoration of the road should be supervised and carried out in accordance with the directions of the highway authority. The Gas Works Clauses Act does not provide for that protection. It provides for superintendence by the local authority of excavations, but curiously enough there is no provision for supervision by the local authority or the laying-down of specifications or anything of that sort whereby the road may be restored to its former condition. Having regard to the very special methods of modern road construction, I hope hon. Members will agree that that is absolutely necessary in these days, when the state of the roads is of the utmost importance to the general public. This company, as I have indicated, if the Bill receives the approval of this House, will obtain valuable way-leaves over public roads, free of charge, throughout almost the whole of Yorkshire, and I submit that it is not unreasonable, therefore, that greater obligations should be placed upon the company than are contained in the Gas Works Clauses Act.<br/>
The Instruction deals with further and better methods of protection in respect of three points&#x2014;first, with regard to the laying of pipes and mains by the company in county roads and roads vested in any local authority. If a main is to be laid by the company, for example, in a county, it may have to traverse quite a long distance&#x2014;9, 10, 15, or even 20 miles&#x2014;and surely it is desirable that the local authority should have the right, subject, of course, to the usual provisions for arbitration in case of dispute, to lay down the route to be followed by such a pipe line. In Clause 53 of the Bill there is a provision that county boroughs, boroughs and urban districts should have the right to lay down such a route, but


there is no provision that a county council should have a similar right, and county councils, having regard to the long lengths of road that we all know they have under their charge, clearly ought to have that protection, and ought to have it without the limitation as to increased expenditure in Sub-section (4) of Clause 53, which renders the Clause almost nugatory. It is perhaps not of great importance in urban or borough localities, but it is of the greatest importance in counties, where the roads may be of very considerable length.<br/>
The second point to which the Instruction relates is the filling-in and restoration of the roads after the pipes and mains have been laid. On this point the existing provisions in Section 10 of the Clauses Act are inadequate, and I submit that it is necessary in the public interest that local authorities should have the right to lay down specifications and to superintend and direct the restoration of the roads which have been taken up. That power is not contained in the Gas Works Clauses Act, and the Instruction that I am moving would ensure that protection being given to local authorities.<br/>
The third point is that if the road be diverted, altered, or improved, and for that reason it is necessary to move the pipes and mains, that work should be done by the company at their own expense. In the memorandum circulated by the promoters of the Bill, I see that Section 153 of the Public Health Act, 1875, is cited, but that is not in point. That Act refers to street works in an urban district, but hon. Members know that nowadays there are tremendous road improvements, widenings, and so on, which are being carried out in almost all the counties in the British Isles, and a company which exists for profit and has privileges such as this company is seeking should surely bear the expenses of any alteration required in the public interest.<br/>
I then come to the question of the second part of my Instruction, relating to amenities and air-raid precautions. Many hon. Members in this House are constantly pressing on the Government and on local authorities the necessity of safeguarding amenities, and surely it is only right, unless Parliament shall have sanctioned the site of a gasholder, that a county council should be entitled to veto

the site if in their view it offends against the amenities. It is also necessary that the local authority should have some say in the location of a gasholder, in view of the possibility of an air raid. If the Bill were passed in its present form, it would be possible for an open space to be obtained and, with the consent of householders within a distance of 300 yards from the proposed gasholder, for the company to put up a gasholder in the middle of a very congested area. I am sure it will be agreed that that would not be a right thing to do, and that the local authority should have the right to say whether a gasholder, either on the ground of amenity or on the ground of precautions against air raids, should be situated in one place or another. That is the purpose of the second part of the Instruction.<br/>
It is suggested by the promoters that the setting-up of a Select Committee or a Joint Committee to consider the question of general legislation on these questions might be an appropriate course to adopt, but the Company refused, in another place, to be put under any obligations which might result from the decisions of any such Select or Joint Committee. I have no hesitation in saying that if the promoters will agree to the protective Clauses, which my Instruction will ensure being inserted in the Bill, now, subject to those Clauses being amended or superseded by any general legislation which came in later as a result of the decision of a Select Committee, the county councils will be perfectly agreeable to that course. This is a special form of company, and in my submission it is reasonable to ask for protection on the lines which I have indicated. In connection with that suggestion about a Select Committee, I need not remind hon. Members how long such a course might occupy. Government Departments would have to be consulted, revisions would have to be considered, and the Government would have to pass legislation. It might well be a matter of years before any general legislation was introduced, and meanwhile the whole of the roads of Yorkshire, and later on, it may be, of other parts of the country, might be open to the possibility of being taken up in the way I have indicated and without the protection for which I am asking.<br/>
I am glad to see the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Transport


here. The Ministry have not found it possible up to now to issue any report on the Bill, and so far no very definite guidance has been offered. I would point out to my hon. and gallant Friend that his Department is responsible for the trunk roads, and that in the West Riding of Yorkshire we have no less than 150 miles of trunk roads, in the North Riding 56, and in the East Riding 20, and that many of those roads are within the area covered by this Bill. The protection which the county councils are asking for should also be a matter of supreme importance to the Ministry of Transport, who must also be interested in the location of gasholders in relation to Air-Raid Precautions.<br/>
Finally, what this Instruction will ensure is reasonable protection for local authorities and the people in their areas, and in my submission that protection is not now afforded by the Gas Works Clauses Act. Hon. Members will observe that this Instruction has the support of Members of all parties. It may be said with some truth that a Yorkshire team is usually able to make a good show off its own bat, as witness the recent match against the Australians, but in this instance I am afraid that Yorkshire needs the support of Members from all parts of the country, and as they may one of these days be threatened similarly I hope I may ask them all to unite to support this Instruction.</p>

<p>In seconding the Motion I should like to point out that I am speaking for the North Riding, while the hon. and gallant Member for South-East Leeds (Major Milner) was speaking for the West Riding. I shall submit different arguments in speaking for a different county council, and my arguments are, if anything, stronger than his, because of the way in which my council has been treated by the promoters of the Bill. The area of the North Riding to which this Bill refers is an area of very small villages and towns and large and important roads. Hon. Members who occasionally go to Scotland, whether to speak, or to shoot, or to agitate, or for any other purpose, will I hope recollect when they are passing through very pleasant country in Yorkshire that they are going through my constituency, and that when they are in less pleasant country it will be some

other hon. Member's constituency. The North Riding County Council, because of these small villages and important roads, desire to be protected against the dangers of this Bill. My hon. and gallant Friend said that the gas legislation of 1847 is not quite up to date, and that has been recognised by the House of Commons in certain Gas Orders and Bills passed since that date, to which I shall refer later.<br/>
My county council wrote to the promoters of the Bill and asked if they could have that form of protective legislation which is in the Tring Gas Order. They wrote down the heads of the protection they required. The promoters replied saying that they could not agree to all that my council asked for, and made some suggested amendments in red ink. Hon. Members engaged in business, like those acquainted with the law, know that documents written in black ink often bear amendments in red ink, and further amendments in green ink, and, in short, all the different coloured inks. We got to the stage of the red ink. We came to an arrangement with the promoters that we would not oppose the Bill in the House of Lords because we were going to negotiate a settlement. My council wrote to say that although what was suggested in red ink did not meet all that they would like to have, was not, in fact, nearly so much as the West Riding County Council were asking for, they would be content to accept that protection in order to save the county rates the expense of fighting the Bill in the House of Lords or in this House. That would appear to have been an agreement: anyhow, we will call it a "gentleman's agreement." No more was heard, but in course of time the House of Lords turned clown the West Riding County Council. Then, hon. Members will be surprised to learn, the promoters of the Bill, who are now coining to this House with haloes round their heads, went to the North Riding County Council and said: "Because the West Riding did not get what they asked for, although you did not fight the Bill in the House of Lords, and although we had an arrangement that we would try to negotiate a settlement, we will now repudiate that settlement and give you no protection at all."</p>

<p>That was the "gentleman's agreement." That is the gravamen of the charge by the North Riding County Council against the promoters of this Bill. I will state the heads of the agreement. Under the Gas Works Clauses Act, 1847, before a gas company, wishing to interfere with any main under a road, start picking up the road, they have to give three clear days' notice to the local authority; in this case the county council. In the case of a busy county council responsible for many miles of road, it is not unreasonable to suggest that three days' notice is not sufficient, and the first head of agreement was that there should be a longer period&#x2014;I think it was 14 days, but I do not want to be tied to that. The second head of agreement was that in cases where there had to be a replacement of road surfaces which had been hacked up the resurfacing should be done by the North Riding County Council and not by the gas company. The object of that was to secure uniformity of surface. Those who are road users will appreciate the importance of not having replacements done at different times and in a different manner by a gas company; they ought to be left to the highway authority, in order to secure uniformity of surface. When driving I have often come to places where a replacement has not been done in an altogether happy manner, and there is great danger from skids in wet weather. Those who believe in safety on the roads will agree that what we ask under the second head of agreement was reasonable.</p>

<p>I understand that this is the first occasion on which anybody has challenged this agreement. I understand that this was a negotiated settlement, and if that is so then the whole question about prejudice relates to the earlier proceedings and would not be followed in law. Perhaps my hon. and gallant Friend has put it from a business point of view, but in law we regard it as a negotiated settlement, and my people have a perfect right to say what was the settlement on which they decided not to oppose the Bill in the House of Lords. They did not tell the House of Lords Committee anything of this, because it was an agreed settlement, and if I am not allowed to say

what has been agreed to, what it is the company are backing out of at the last moment, I think it will be a sorry sort of justice that we get in the House of Commons. Before I was interrupted by my hon. and gallant Friend I was saying that the second head of agreement was that the replacements should be done by the council at the expense of the company. The last head of agreement was that the company should not take up more than a certain length of road at one time. Again, I suggest, a reasonable agreement, because one does not want to have one-way traffic for mile upon mile, as is sometimes the case, and is a cause of great delay to road traffic. Those are the three heads of agreement, and I do not think anyone could consider them to be unreasonable.<br/>
Then there is this much stronger point. In my area of the North Riding we are at present governed by four different Gas Bills or Gas Orders. One part of the area is governed by legislation which was passed by this House in 1927 and in 1936, and in that legislation we obtained the form of protection which comes under those three heads of agreement. The rest of the area is under Gas Orders of good old vintage&#x2014;of 1871 and 1880. Those orders give no protection for road traffic, which in those days was an entirely different problem. If we are not to have protection on the lines of this Instruction it will mean that one part of the area will be bound by these protective Clauses and the rest will not, and that does seem to be extremely unfair. If we do not get this protection it will not be the county council which is not protected, but the wretched little ratepayers who will have to pay heavier rates because this large vested interest, I was going to say, this large gas company, puts the ratepayers to that expense in order to help its own shareholders. If the House looks at it from that point of view I think they will realise that this Instruction should be passed. When the 1847 Act was passed it was clearly laid down that whenever a gas main is laid under a street the expense of putting in the main should be entirely one for the undertakers, and that the county ratepayers should be entirely free from that expense.<br/>
I have mentioned three heads under which protection is required; I will mention one more, in respect to which we were not able to get an agreement. I may


point out to my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Buckrose (Major Braithwaite) that in this case I am not talking of anything which was in this agreement. We ask that the cost of moving the mains that belong to the company should not be put upon the backs of the ratepayers who, in many cases, are not taking the gas at all and who are already very heavily rated in North Riding&#x2014;I do not know about the East Riding. Those ratepayers ought not to have to pay for altering the position of the gas mains. This is a very important matter. Some part of the Great North Road goes through the areas mentioned in the Bill, and will be diverted. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Transport will tell us about that aspect of the matter. He is always very busy about the Great North Road, and it is clear that a lot of diversion is going on. Some of it we do not like, and some of it we do not mind quite so much. The question is, if there are to be by-passes, is the taxpayer or is the gas company to pay for moving these great gas mains which are underneath the road? We ought to know the answer to that question.<br/>
One road goes through Yorkshire to Middlesbrough. I see on the benches opposite an hon. Member who represents one of the divisions of Middlesbrough and he will agree that much heavy traffic goes up that road. We are trying to improve that road, and there have been diversions all the way along it. More will come. Are the ratepayers to pay for moving those mains, or are we to get back to the principle laid down in 1847 that the gas undertakers who put the gas main under a highway without paying any rent would have to pay if they pa it anywhere else on the King's highway, and that they should pay the cost that flowed from their introduction of the gas main?<br/>
I hope that this Instruction will be agreed to by the House for the reasons put forward by the hon. and gallant Member for South-East Leeds (Major Milner) and also for the reason that if the Instruction is rejected, encouragement will be given to large bodies such as the West Yorkshire Gas Distribution Company, to treat local authorities and ratepayers as some county authorities have been treated already. The House of Commons should not tolerate in their private legislation

that treatment by these big bodies. If that happened, we should always have to fight every Bill in future in every place and to pay more money which would come on to the rates, knowing that we can never take a gentlemen's agreement to be a gentlemen's agreement.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend has stated that I said something which is inaccurate. Unless he withdraws that statement he should prove it up to the hilt.

<p>I did not use the word "inaccurate." I do not impugn my hon. Friend's accuracy, but his interpretation of the negotiations. It is certainly not the interpretation put upon it by the promoters. I will give the reason why. As my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Buckrose (Major Braithwaite) has said, the negotiations were carried out without prejudice, and they were in the usual form. I have here the original document of the suggested draft clause for an agreement. I have all the coloured inks to which my hon. Friend referred, with the appropriate dates. That document was sent between solicitors, between legal people on both sides, with a view to coming to an agreement. The last one was green amendments from Ellis and Ellis, on 14th May, 1938. In response to that, the promoters' legal advisers promptly telephoned and said they could


not agree to the green amendments. Therefore, no agreement was ever reached.<br/>
These negotiations were the ordinary negotiations with a view to coming to an agreement, between legal persons, in which certain Amendments as described by my hon. Friend were put in in different coloured inks. The last ink put in was the green ink, which was not acceptable to the promoters. There has never been, in fact, any agreement. I was not accusing my hon. Friend of any wilful inaccuracy but of his interpretation of what has taken place. I think I have disposed of that.</p>

<p>I do not know what other facts hon. Gentlemen want. Here is a document that has passed between us. [HON. MEMBERS: "Read it."] What, this lot? [HON. MEMBERS: "Yes."] I thought hon. Members wanted to get on with the business. I want to refer to a point made by the hon. and gallant Member for South-East Leeds (Major Milner), who rather ridiculed the Gas Clauses Act, 1847. I think he will agree with me that that Act was drawn in very wide terms and that several interpretations are equally applicable to it. The words "reinstate and make good" are included in that Act, and if that is done to the satisfaction of the highway engineer, surely nobody will suffer.</p>

<p>If the hon. Member would look at Section 9 he would see that streets are to be broken up only under the superintendence of the highway authority. The hon. Member has quoted Section 10 which says
<q>undertake with all convenient speed.</q>
and&#x2014;
<q>reinstate and make good.</q>
There is nothing said in Section 10 about the superintendence of the local authority, and that is the point which my Instruction would ensure.</p>

<p>In point of fact, that is always done. It would not prove satisfactory in the period of 12 months which is also provided for, if it were not done to the satisfaction of the highway engineer. By a strange coincidence those

words were put in before ferro-concrete, tar macadam, all the developments in the surfacing of roads and heavy traffic were ever heard of. It is amazing to think that those words, written in 1847, are generally applicable to-day. As I pointed out, in point of fact, when reinstating and making good take place, they are done with the approval and generally with the superintendence of the local authority. I happen to know, because I have done many reinstatements myself many years ago. There is no cause of complaint, except in the actual words.<br/>
This is a very difficult matter to debate in this House, which is not the appropriate place to discuss the matter which we have before us. If the matter arises at all&#x2014;I am not considering its merits or demerits at the moment&#x2014;it should be by Public Bill and applicable to all public utility undertakers and those who use the roads. That comprises not only gas companies but bodies interested in water, electricity, telephones, telegraphs, hydraulics and so on. If an Amendment is needed for them it is not appropriate to a Private Bill. As a matter of fact the House of Lords Committee turned down Amendments that were submitted to them a few weeks ago on this very point. I know that the House of Lords is not in very good odour to-night, for other reasons, but the fact remains that they put their brains to work on this matter, with all the evidence that could be presented to them, and they turned this point down on a question of principle.<br/>
The company, which is asking for certain statutory powers, is the first to link up a national gas grid in this area. There has been a gas grid in Sheffield which has worked very successfully. There are 19 undertakers with four coke ovens. The proposal is that the gas is to be put into this grid, and taken out and distributed by those statutory undertakers who have now powers to distribute. That is a point to which I wish to refer in a moment. Investigation which has taken place in that area shows that there is a large potential industrial demand which is estimated to be at least double the present demand for the area. The situation is that the supply of gas in detail will be carried on by the 19 undertakers who have that power, but their plant is equivalent only to a domestic supply. They did not and have not visualised the potential industrial developments, and the


need for a cheap gas for industrial fuel&#x2014;which is coal, our native fuel, conveyed in pipes.<br/>
The gas grid will meet the industrial demand that exists. There are 820 miles of mains in this area, owned by the 19 gas undertakers. It is proposed that the company which is linking up those separate entities shall lay ultimately 75 miles of main. You will, therefore, see that the mileage of mains is very small for the purpose of linking up the actual supply and distribution. I will mention, in passing, that the gas mains in the city of Leeds, part of which the hon. and gallant Gentleman so ably represents, are 1,200 miles in length. It will therefore be seen that the Bill is asking for powers for only 75 miles. On the question of disturbance, I am given to understand that no main will be larger than 15-inch, which is relatively small by comparison with town-distribution size. As there will be no service to the individual consumer, there are practically not more than a couple of dozen consumers from the grid that is being fed from these 75 miles of mains. It is essential to keep that point in mind, because it does not mean breaking up the roads, of which probably hon. Members are thinking in connection with the present arrangement. It is pretty clear that this company will on every occasion, for their own advantage, use private property for the purpose of laying their mains, but the point I wish to make is that they will, in going along a road, use the verge, for their own convenience and the convenience of the highway authority.<br/>
One of the points that I strongly resist in the Instruction is that, if the mains have been laid to the requirements of the highway authority, and 10 years elapse, the Instruction provides that, on the highway authority giving notice to the gas undertakers, they may have to take those mains out and put them in another position at their own expense, because the highway authority, in carrying out its proper functions, may be widening the road. It appears to me that there is an almost complete analogy to that. My hon. Friend builds a house on a building line on a road in every respect to the satisfaction of the highway authority and the local authority. Ten years elapse, and they widen the road. Then, if this Instruction means anything at all, the local authority can make my hon.

Friend, at his own expense, demolish his house and build it further back.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend is not suggesting that they should pay a rent to the highway authority? [HON. MEMBERS: "Why not?"] Because they are carrying out a public duty. If that analogy is not a perfect one, I hope it will be challenged by subsequent speakers. On the question of amenities and the siting of gasholders, there is no present intention on the part of the promoters of the Bill to erect a gasholder anywhere, but that is beside the point, because they have taken power to do so. If protection is desired for amenities, there is ample machinery for it in the Town and Country Planning Act, 1932. A local authority which is very keen on its amenities would have no difficulty in preparing a scheme and negotiating with the local undertaker as to the site of a gasholder. If the North and West Ridings still desire to oppose the Bill, they will have their opportunity in the Committee upstairs to put their case and propose definite Amendments, and I submit that it is quite inappropriate to discuss a matter like this on the Floor of the House. If by any chance this Instruction goes to the Committee, it will prejudice the Committee in coming to a fair decision with the full evidence and information before them.</p>

<p>It may assist the House if I intervene thus early, because this Bill undoubtedly affects highway authorities, and also because what I have to say might&#x2014;I do not say it will&#x2014;have the effect of enabling the Debate to be shortened. I would remind the House that my Minister, since the passing of the Trunk Roads Act, is now the highway authority for


trunk roads, some 100 miles of which might be affected by this Bill. I tell the House this because I think that, in connection with a Bill of this kind, the question of protection of the highways is one which should be considered most carefully by the Committee to which the Bill will be sent. I would also point out that road construction in 1847 was a very different matter from what it is today, and the adequacy of the Gas Works Clauses Act of that year to meet present-day conditions is, I suggest, a matter which deserves consideration. On the other hand, I do not want to prejudice the issue before the Committee and I am afraid that, if we pass this Instruction in the form in which it is on the Order Paper, it will prejudice the position. The words on the Order Paper are:
<q>That it be an Instruction to the Committee to insert provisions in the Bill&#x2014;</q>
<q>(1) For the further and better protection &#x2026;</q>
and so on. My Minister is prepared to leave it to the Committee, after having heard the evidence on both sides, to decide, first, whether further and better protection is necessary; and, secondly, if so, what form that protection should take. I would point out to the House that, if this Instruction is passed as it appears on the Order Paper, consideration of the first of these questions, namely, whether further and better protection is necessary, will not be possible, because we shall be telling the Committee that, whatever they feel after having heard the evidence they must put in certain provisions. Therefore I hope the House will not pass the Instruction, certainly in its present form, because to do so would prejudice the issue. I think it should be for the Committee to decide what, if any, extra powers should be given to the highway authorities in this Bill.<br/>
The Committee may think that, owing to the large area of supply, this is a special Bill, in which special protection is required. But, while this Bill may be a special case, I would point out to the House that the question of the breaking up of streets is one which gives rise to difficulty, not only in the case of gas, but also in the case of water and electricity, and my Minister proposes to- consult with the other Departments concerned about the type of protection which might

be suitable in future Bills of this character. That, of course, does not prejudice the Committee in dealing with the present Bill after it has received its Second Reading in this House. Further, we are prepared, in the case of this Bill, to furnish the Committee at the appropriate time with a report setting out our views for their consideration. It will also be desirable to add a short Clause to the Bill to give the Minister of Transport the same protection as is afforded to county councils, and to provide appropriate machinery for appeals.</p>

<p>This is a Bill which affects scores of thousands of ratepayers in Yorkshire&#x2014;in the West, North, and East Ridings.

<p>On a point of Order. The hon. Member opposite&#x2014;I did not catch all he said, but he appeared, Mr. Deputy-Speaker, to make certain implications against my hon.

The hon. Member then in possession did not seek to take that broad hint but reasserted his observations in respect of the attitude of the hon. Member for Newport.

<p>The last question does not seem to be a point of Order. With regard to that raised by the hon. Member for South Croydon (Mr. H. G.

<p>I do not see any point of Order there. The hon. Member does not even know what I said, nor anything that I implied. I have done with the


hon. Member for Newport, and I have come to the Minister. I was equally amazed at the Minister. He opposed this Instruction, but he was prepared to leave it to the Committee to deal with it, if it cared to do so, and he promised us legislation at some time in the future. When that will be no one knows, because he is not in a position to say that legislation will be introduced in respect of gas, water and electricity and when it will be. Here we have a Bill dealing with a very large area and scores of thousands of ratepayers will be affected by it, and the opposition to this Instruction is that, because of an Act passed 90 years ago, we should not pass the Instruction. The roads of this country, and of this particular area, were much different, less than 90 years ago, from what they are to-day.<br/>
I live in the area affected by this Bill, and I remember, not so very long ago, when you had to have a man walking before an engine which went along the road; but now you drive at 90 miles per hour on the road, and over the man if you like. In those old days even a donkey and cart would be considered to be going too fast because the roads were so bad, but it is not so now. Roads, even in country districts, are marvellously well laid and have cost a tremendous amount of money. If they are to be dealt with, we ought to deal with them from the point of view that they are a new proposition from what they were 90 years ago. These Instructions say:
<q>In respect of the laying of pipes and mains by the company in county roads.</q>
I live in a mining area, and as a member of the local authority I have seen the gas company's balance sheet for many years. That balance sheet used to show an allowance of 25 per cent. for subsidence and leakages. Should not the local authorities have some regard for the places where the mains are to be laid? Is there anything wrong with that Instruction? They cannot lay all these mains along the grass verges nowadays. They have to be laid in the road, and local authorities, whether Socialist or anti-Socialist, must look after the interests of the ratepayers, and so ought Members of this House, instead of looking after their own interests, as they do on many occasions. The conditions on the roads

nowadays, with motor cars and fast speeds, make things nearly as bad as conditions on the roads of Ireland during the time of the "Black and Tans." The roads are choked up, and if you leave it to gas and similar companies there will be no getting on to the roads, and there will be more danger to people riding in motor cars than is the case to-day. That is another matter that can be dealt with by the local authority. Wherever you go in the area covered by the Bill, every railway bridge or any sort of bridge is the worst part of the road, because the company are supposed to keep it in repair and do not do so. These things are not done unless an Instruction is given definitely that they should do them. This Instruction ought to be carried because of that fact. The roads ought to be made fit and not left as the company might wish to leave them.<br/>
The Instruction also says that they should have some regard, if they are to erect gas works or anything in the area, to the amenities of the district. I live in a village where I have lived all my life, as did my father and many before him. A week last Tuesday an accident happened at the gas works. The gas works is in the centre of the place, and it ought to be taken out of the district right away from the houses and the people. At 2 o'clock, a week last Tuesday morning, an explosion occurred at the gas works. The wind, fortunately, was blowing away from the gasometer or it would have been a serious matter for the village. Villagers went out in all kinds of dress and undress into the fields for fear that there might be a more serious explosion. Should not it be an Instruction that a gas company or any private company, when seeking their own gain, should have regard to the interests of the ratepayers and inhabitants of the locality. The amenities of a district are important and ought to be considered but these gas companies and such like have no regard for these things. Their own personal interests always come before the public interest.</p>

<p>I make no apology for taking part in this discussion, although I do not live in the district covered by the Bill. I want to make an appeal to those who have put down the Instruction to withdraw it. I agree entirely with the object contained in the Instruction, but I believe that the better way of obtaining what is required would be by withdrawing the Instruction and allowing the Bill to go to Committee, where the matter could be settled after they had received more evidence and information as to whether the Instruction would be hard to enforce. That, I believe, would be a very much better way. I suggest a withdrawal rather than going to a vote and perhaps having it defeated.</p>

<p>No, Sir, I have no connection whatever with either promoters or opposers. I am speaking with the authority of a private Member, which is the only authority I require for the observations I am making. I ask the supporters of the Instruction to withdraw it for this reason. We know how votes are taken in this House. It may possibly be that a Division will be called and Members will come trooping in, and, not having heard what we have heard, the Division may be swayed one way or the other. The impression of the Committee upstairs and the public would be that the House had voted on the merits of the

case, which would not be so. Consequently it would be very much better to withdraw the Instruction and allow the matter to go for full discussion in Committee. On the merits of the case, it does not go far enough with regard to the make-up of roads.<br/>
In a Bill promoted by the Staffordshire County Council, which was passed by this House, it is possible for the local authority themselves to make up their roads and charge the company. If it is the responsibility of the local authority to make up the roads it will be properly done by the men who understand how it should be done. That is not in the Instruction, and that again supports the suggestion which I am putting before the House. I am sorry that gasometers cannot be put underground. They are an obstruction to the view and interfere with the amenities. They are a necessary evil, but let us see to it that, as far as possible, they are not a greater evil than can be avoided. I appeal to those who are putting forward this Instruction&#x2014;I agree absolutely with what they are trying to do&#x2014;to withdraw it, so that we may get on with the business of the House which has to follow.</p>

<p>When a Private Bill is before a Committee of this House there is usually somebody who can speak for the promoters. Not only do I represent part of the county where this company operates, but I know the district very well, and I say quite frankly that we are not opposing the company in that they are going to do this work, but we are seeking a guarantee that local authorities are not to be compelled to pay money when they have no right to pay. Whether or not the hon. and gallant Member opposite is a director of the company, I do not know. I have looked at the Stock Exchange Year Book, and I have seen a name that I know, but I have been in this House long enough not always to take names at their face value. I can sometimes detect interests when points of view are expressed.<br/>
There does not seem to be anyone to speak for the promoters. With regard to the Minister, in giving his views he was about fifty-fifty. Sitting on the fence seems exactly to cover what he said. He said that in the opinion of the Department certain protection must be given and that we must bear in mind so-and-so, and then he went on to say something which was helpful to those who are moving this Instruction. He said that when the Committee upstairs meet to deal with the Bill the opinions of the Department would be expressed. I suppose that opinion will relate to the particular things contained in this Instruction and generally deal with the Bill.</p>

<p>I have been a member of a committee on Private Bills and have

heard the representatives of various Departments telling us exactly what they think of the Bill and the point of view of the Department. With regard to the second part of the Instruction, we say that a private undertaking should not have the right to put up a gasometer where they think fit, without the sanction of the local authority. The hon. Member for South Croydon (Mr. H. G. Williams) asked the hon. Member for Rothwell (Mr. Lunn) what he meant with regard to the second part of the Instruction. If he had read the Instruction he would have found out exactly what we want. The Instruction says:
<q>For requiring the approval of the county council and the local authority to the site selected for the erection of any gasholder or container for storing gas so that due regard may be had to the amenities of the district and to the prevention of interference with air-raid precautions.</q>

<p>I have no interest in this matter except from two points of


view. One is, that I spent a very happy Whitsuntide vacation in driving through a part of the district in question, and the other is that I am very much interested in the question of the way in which legislation in this country with regard to a great many local problems has been allowed to fall lamentably behind the times. I am very much obliged to my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for South-East Leeds (Major Milner) for having brought this matter to the attention of the House, because I think it lamentable that in the year 1938 we should have to deal with the question of roads from the point of view of public utility companies by means of a Statute that was passed not merely long before I was born but, I believe, before any Member of either of the two Houses was born.<br/>
The problem which worries me&#x2014;and I am speaking for the moment to a great number of hon. and right hon. Members opposite who, I am conscious, know a great deal more about local administration than I do or ever shall do&#x2014;is this, that our legislation with regard to roads and with regard to public utility companies generally is hopelessly out of date. What we are proposing to do if this Instruction is carried is a shirking of our responsibilities as a House. We are not really grappling with this question as we ought to do. I hope the House will not think that I am lecturing them, but during the last four years I have spent a good deal of time considering local legislation in this country. I have spent a good deal of my time outside the House considering the results of exceptions made to the general law by local Bills passed in this House. I appreciate the difficulties in administration which result from there being one system of law in one district and another exceptional system of law in another. That being the situation, this House is engaged now in forcing, as it seems to me, upon a company, with which I have no concern in any way, on the one hand, and a number of local authorities, on the other, with whose work I have every sympathy, the task of examining at their own expense the actual situation with regard to the Act of 1847, and by instructing Parliamentary agents to find out how that legislation ought to be amended.<br/>
I say quite definitely that to put such a burden upon local authorities and upon

the particular corporation engaged in producing this Bill, is to put a burden upon them which this House ought to shoulder itself. We are dealing with a gas company, and the Parliamentary Secretary has told us that the same problem arises in regard to water and electricity. We are going to deal with the problem from the point of view of one locality. When you deal with the same problem as it arises in my county, which is a poor county, or in the case of Montgomeryshire, which is one of the poorest counties in Wales, you have to go through the same procedure, get this same question raised and determined by briefing members of my own profession, and instructing Parliamentary agents, when the House of Commons ought to grapple with these problems itself.<br/>
I have no views about the rival merits of these two contestants. So far as the observations of the hon. and gallant Member for South-East Leeds and the hon. Member for Thirsk and Malton (Mr. Turton) are concerned, I have the utmost sympathy with the statements they have made, but why should these two particular contestants be engaged in a fight upstairs at enormous expense when the real problem is that this House has not grappled with this question so far as gas works are concerned since 1847, and so far as electricity companies are concerned since 1882? I hope the House will not think, in these circumstances, that there is any lack of sympathy on my part for the case put forward. I am not quite sure that the case has always been completely understood. As I understand the Instruction it is aimed at a rather peculiar problem which the Act of 1847 never contemplated. We are engaged in the greater part of the country at the moment in an endeavour to widen and better our roads, and when you do that the existing mains of public utility companies under the roads have to be shifted, and the Instruction, as I understand it, is intended to try and grapple with the problem as to what is the fair thing to do, when you widen a main road enormously, with the mains which already exist underneath the roads.<br/>
I hope that hon. Members will scrutinise this fact rather carefully, because none of us, in regard to a matter which concerns a public utility company and a local administration,


desires for a moment to do anything which is in the least unfair or which is likely to deprive the people of the utility they desire to have. The problem is not so simple as that put forward by hon. Members opposite. The Act of 1847, as far as it goes, is good enough, but, of course, it does not touch the modern problem of the wide new road, differently constructed, the straight road, as compared with the wiggly-waggly road which a famous English writer once described as having been made, he supposed, by an English drunkard. What the House is engaged in doing at the moment is not in saying that this ought to be considered, as indeed it manifestly ought to be considered, but in saying "shall" to the Committee upstairs. Members of this House who do not happen to sit upon the Committee are perhaps more ready to criticise, but we all know the admirable work done with great care and attention, and we are telling the Committee upstairs what shall be put into this Bill, whereas we ought to be directing the attention of the Committee to the fact that it is high time they considered this whole problem.<br/>
I emphasise this for this reason: The matter was fully discussed by a Select Committee of the House of Lords. But this House is not in the least bound by what was done and can decide to reexamine it anew just as if the decision had never been arrived at. But do let us remember that the case was put in the House of Lords and that they did reach a conclusion. Is it not in those circumstances a little unjust, or may have the appearance of being unjust, if we say, "We do not care whether you won or lost; you shall do so-and-so when the Bill goes to be considered upstairs"? Speaking with the utmost sympathy for those who have moved this Instruction I hope they will be able to adopt the suggestion that we should give a direction to the Committee upstairs to consider this matter in all its bearings. I understood from the Parliamentary Secretary that the particular problem of the roads and the public utility things which lie under the roads, is to be a matter to be considered between the different Government Departments. If he will forgive me for saying so, it is high time that was done, but it being high time, I am not going to object to its being done. However, I should like to feel

that that moment will not be unduly delayed.<br/>
I wish to say a few words with regard to the second part of the Instruction. Nobody desires that public utility companies should be entitled to dump gasometers or any other of the things which beautify our country nowadays anywhere they please, but I think that possibly in the West Riding of Yorkshire, and indeed in the North Riding, there may be such a thing as a town and country planning scheme which may have had something to do with that particular problem, and if it has not, then, in just the same way, speaking as a Private Member, I should be only too happy to concur in the notion that the Committee upstairs should be required to direct their attention to that problem also.</p>

<p>Having regard to what has just been said by the hon. and learned Member for Bridgwater (Mr. CroomJohnson) and the obviously substantial measure of agreement in the House, and what the Minister said, I should like to ask for your guidance, Captain Bourne, as to whether, in the event of my withdrawing this Motion for an Instruction, it will be the duty of the Committee upstairs to consider the specific matters set out in the Instruction.

<p>As I understand the position, there are petitions, and two of the three county councils of Yorkshire are against this Bill dealing with the specific points raised in the hon. and gallant Member's proposed Instruction. I am also informed that the Ministry of Transport propose to put in a report dealing with these matters. It will obviously be the duty of the Committee upstairs to consider both the report of the Ministry of Transport on the subject and the petitions which have been presented against the Bill by the county councils concerned; and it will be their very obvious duty, notwithstanding anything which may or may not have happened in another place, to consider that problem there put <i>de novo,</i> in the light of the information to be put in front of them. I think that perhaps, that will satisfy the hon. and gallant Member.</p>

<p>I wish to make a few remarks on this matter. I do not represent the company or any of the public authorities concerned, but I happen to be a member of an organisation known as the Conjoint Conference of Public Utility Associations, to which is affiliated, I think, every municipal gas, water, and electricity authority, and every company authority. The problem of the use of the roads for this purpose is one of the greatest possible complexity. For some eight or nine years past, negotiations have been proceeding between the company and municipal-owned public utility undertakings and the highway authorities. The reason I rose to speak was that I want to put it on record that every town council in this country is vitally concerned in this matter in opposition to the highway authorities. That is a point which has to be appreciated. Hon. Members opposite have been discussing this matter as though it were an issue between the public authority and the company. It is a much wider issue.<br/>
The issue is between the public utility undertakings and the highway authorities, and on that issue, if the borough councils&#x2014;not the county boroughs, because they are both public utility authorities and highway authorities&#x2014;and the urban district councils, who are proprietors of gas works, electricity undertakings, sewers and water works, were familiar with the situation in the House to-night, they would be almost unanimously in opposition to the hon. and gallant Member for South-East Leeds (Major Milner). I rejoice that an agreement has been arrived at, but I want to put it on record quite clearly that what we are dealing with now is an issue of principle far wider than the issue in regard to this particular company. The issue which is raised is far wider than has been appreciated in the House to-night. I think that three-quarters of the hon. Members opposite, in certain circumstances, would be subjected to intense pressure from their own county boroughs on this matter to take a line completely opposite to that which they have taken to-night. I want the House to realise that there is an issue of principle involved which is very much greater than that which has been appreciated so far.</p>

<p>I want to say a word or two with regard to the speech of the hon. and learned Member for Bridgwater (Mr. Croom-Johnson). What I am afraid of is that if notice is taken of the argument which he made, the Committee may with justification argue that we have put it in this House that the question of altering the law and making protection for various things is a question for the Whole House to decide, at some future time, and that therefore, they, as a Committee, have no business to deal with the matter on this occasion. I hope that will not be done. The larger issue might have to be decided by the House, but in view of the Debate which has taken place, it appears to me clearly to be the wish of the House that we should do something in this particular case on this occasion. I hope the Committee will see to that. Finally, I hope the promoters of the Bill also will have some regard to the opinions which have been expressed in the House to-night and will do something to help to get some of the protection for which hon. Members in various quarters of the House have asked.</p>

I gave a short explanation of this Amendment in the survey which I made of the Lords Amendments. It was explained in another place that it would be quite easy to get the information which will be conveyed under this Amendment by means of putting down a question. In another place for some reason or other they preferred that the information instead of being obtained by way of question and answer, should be obtained by way of a statement laid before both Houses. We have no desire that anybody should be able to say that we are concealing any information which ought to be made public, and which in any case would be made public, and if it is believed in another place that publicity should be given in this way, I am prepared to advise this House to agree.</p>

<p>I beg to move, "That this House doth agree with the Lords in the said Amendment."<br/>
This paragraph in the First Schedule deals with the various interests or securities which members of the Commission must dispose of before they can accept office. I do not think that these words are likely to make much difference or that the possibility of a member of the Commission holding a few shares in a company which made machinery and plant for coal mining would be likely to arise very often. It is to be remembered that the people who will be appointed to this Commission will be responsible people, and exception having been taken to the inclusion of these words, I think we might agree to leave them out.</p>

<p>These words were inserted in this House by the Government, for the purpose of protecting the impartiality of members of the Coal Commission. I could understand the hon. and gallant Gentleman saying that it was not necessary to have any restrictions at all, but that would be contrary to the practice followed in recent Acts of Parliament. If the aim of that practice is to eliminate corruption&#x2014;and that presumably is the object of such provisions&#x2014;then surely the manufacture of machinery and plant for


coal mining is the most dangerous of all these matters in the present case. The Commissioners will be in close contact with the lessees, and a lessee who desired to get favourable terms could best accomplish his end with a dishonest Commissioner&#x2014;and it is to guard against dishonesty that such provisions as this are made&#x2014;if that Commissioner were a person who sold machinery and plant. The lessee in that case would be able to give the Commissioner's firm orders for such machinery, in exchange for the Commissioner's support in obtaining particularly favourable terms.<br/>
I am not suggesting that any Commissioner will be dishonest, but if we are to put in any provision like this, and such provisions as I say have become common form in Acts of Parliament, then the one important thing to avoid here is the risk of having a Commissioner who is intimately connected with a business from which lessees will be large buyers. This business is even more important than the sale of coal or the manufacture in the sale of by-products. I cannot understand why these words, of all the words in this part of the Schedule, should be omitted. I should have thought that it was most valuable to retain them and that if we are to have anything in the way of protection of this kind, we should have the protection given by these words.</p>

<p>I am sorry to disagree, not for the first time, with the hon. and learned Gentleman, but I do not think that the importance which he suggests is to be attached to these words. It is to be remembered that an alteration was previously made in the Schedule making it possible for a member of the trade union organisation to be a member of the Commission on the ground that that would not affect him in the discharge of his duty.</p>

<p>I beg to move, "That this House doth agree with the Lords in the said Amendment."<br/>
This is the first of a series dealing with the subsidence problem. Under the Bill


as it left us there passed to the Commission the right to withdraw support. That was subject to the obligation of making good or of paying proper compensation for damage. The question whether damage should be made good or compensation paid rested within the discretion of the colliery undertaking. In many cases is was a convenience, because they had their own staff of repairers. A good many complaints were made by hon. Members opposite that very often, especially in the case of small properties, these alleged repairs were not always satisfactory. The effect of this Amendment is exactly the same about the obligation of making good or paying proper compensation, but it is put the other way round, that the consent to have the damage made good rests with the surface owner instead of the colliery undertaking. It is a desirable Amendment from the point of view of those who suffer damage.</p>

<p>I should be less than human if I did not say a few words on this Amendment. I am delighted that this alteration has been made. I have long held, from such experience as I have had, that the right to make good is a fictitious and artificial right. The primary right of anybody who suffers from subsidence is that his loss should be made good by a monetary payment. Only he knows what repairs are required to his house or his property, and his primary right is to have money paid to him by the person who does the damage so that he may make it good in the way in which he wants it made good. I agree that there are a number of cases where possibly a very small and passing damage is done to the structure, where the owner may be willing that the person causing it should come in and do the repairs. These cases are the exception, and my criticism of the original Schedule was that the owner of the houses on the surface had to submit against his will to the Commission coming in and propping up his houses or binding them together or employing the hundred and one devices that have been employed by persons responsible for subsidence in trying to make good damage. This is an Amendment of major substance in favour of those who will suffer from the subsidence which comes within the provisions of this

Clause, and I hope that the House will realise that it is an Amendment designed to benefit a vast number of people.</p>

<p>I hope that hon. Members on this side of the House will be able to support the Amendment. Although it is in accordance with their interests as landlords that the other place is prepared to take action of this nature, I think that hon. Members on this side will be prepared to accept the Amendment because it secures a measure of justice to the unfortunate victims of mining subsidence. This matter was thoroughly discussed on the Committee stage in this House, and an attempt was made to secure some measure of compensation for those who had suffered as a result of subsidence prior to the coming into force of this Bill. That proposal was unfortunately rejected by the Committee, and therefore it is something to have obtained an Amendment of this nature. It is an advance on the present law and to that extent it is to be welcomed.</p>

<p>I hesitate to say a word against helping people who have suffered subsidence, but I ought to offer a word of warning that we are saddling the Commission with a burden that might wreck it. Responsibility is now to be placed on the Commission to accept full responsibility for subsidence. There have been many hard cases in the past and in many of them the royalty owners have been able to pass the responsibility on to the coal-mining industry. Colliery companies, many of them small struggling concerns, have had to bear it. The hon. and learned Member for Ashford (Mr. Spens) said that he was delighted with this Amendment, but I do not share his delight. I look upon all these Amendments from another place with suspicion because they want to wreck the Commission. This is one of the first big experiments in public ownership. The nation is to become the owner of the coal, and we ought to guard against saddling the Commission, which will represent the nation, with responsibilities which the royalty owners have passed on to somebody else whenever they could. Will the Minister state whether the Commission, in granting a new lease to a colliery company, will be empowered to ask that


company to accept full responsibility for subsidence?</p>

<p>I am rather suspicious of this Amendment because of the source from which it comes. This kind of thing can be abused. My hon. Friend the Member for Spennymoor (Mr. Batey) has knowledge of a case where enormous claims for damage were made on a colliery company. The first call was made by a shipyard company which claimed &#x00A3;100,000 damages, and got it. That was immediately reflected by a large number of other claims and 600 men were dismissed from the colliery. I fear for the Commission if this responsibility is imposed upon them. The shipyard company which made this large claim never even stopped operations. It claimed merely because there had been a subsidence of three inches. Following that many other people began sniffing round to see if there were claims that they could make for damages, and one man even claimed damages for subsidence in a seam that was below the one where the action was taken. I know of a colliery in Durham which was most generous in the treatment of its men, but a lot of these claims came in and all the things that the firm had been doing for the employ&#x00E9;s were cut off. One of these claims was by a man who wanted &#x00A3;2,500 damages for his house, and he got it. He said he went to bed one night when everything was all right and that when he got up next morning he could not open the door. He got &#x00A3;2,500 damages. But that was only one claim; the sharks were no numerous you could not count them. All legal men are sharks. This man claimed &#x00A3;2,500 and got it, and two years afterwards he went back to the house and lived in it till he died. The point is that in these cases, where money is to be had, this Commission will find a draught as we did on that occasion.<br/>
Here is another case. The plasterers used to be paid after that for putting up

people's ceilings that were affected by subsidence. Subsidence was all that was responsible. It mattered not whether there were births, deaths, or marriages; if there was subsidence, that was all that was responsible. It was found, when the matter was taken to court, that every enterprising plasterer went round to houses and asked the people in them whether their ceilings were giving way. They were rather astonished at being so well attended to, and when they asked about it, he replied, "If I were you, I should go to the colliery and make a claim for your ceiling." The result was that he repaired the ceilings of everybody in the town, and the only people who did not grumble were the people in the cemeteries. This thing went on until it was found that not only the plasterers were getting their work paid for in this way, but the painters also, and even people who were carting furniture out of the houses.<br/>
I have joked about the matter, but I am very serious about it, and, as I say, I have seen 600 families who were removed because of the sheer greed of gold. We know from practical experience how claims are made for subsidence. If miners working 1,500 feet below the ground, with millions of tons of water running 600 feet below the surface, where were the miners to be, if these things were happening on the surface? Everything that anybody thought they could get they got&#x2014;to this extent, that we were ruined for years&#x2014;out of the most generous colliery that I have ever known. We knew that over a wide area in a large town we suffered to the extent of losing 600 men in the first instance, from a colliery company which was as generous as it could be, and the older men in the colliery felt it very keenly indeed.<br/>
I am afraid of the hon. and learned Gentleman over here, with that clever, incisive, kindly way of twisting your tail when you are not looking. I am never afraid of a blatant, threatening lawyer, but I am afraid of a kindly lawyer. I listened to the gentlemen in the other place till midnight. They can stay till midnight when they like. A Prayer Book or a Coal Bill will keep them up till any time in the morning. Prayer and property work together. But I am really anxious about this. I am convinced that if they are going to get rid of this capital, they see that there is going to be subsidence in


their land, and they say, "Let us have full compensation for such subsidence as we think there is, and we can provide a lawyer. The Commission will now have a State fund, and it is our turn now to milk the opportunities offered to us to the full." Whenever there is anything to be got for nothing, the gentlemen in the other House are as keen as men sometimes are at a poor soup kitchen, when they have been starved for a few weeks. It makes me rather doubtful when the hon. and learned Gentleman comes along and, with that invisible soap, says, "Thank God for this Amendment." It makes me, although I have to fall in with the majority, wish I had not to do it.</p>

<p>I beg to move, "That this House doth agree with the Lords in the said Amendment."<br/>
May I briefly remind the House of the Bill as it left us? Before I do that may I say that as yesterday I congratulated the hon. Member for Durham City (Mr. Ritson) upon the moving oration he then made, to-night my congratulations are offered to him for an extremely interesting and amusing one. As the Bill left us, the Commission, when they first exercised their right to grant a lease for coal which is at present unsevered from the surface, had to give public notice that they were going to grant it, and after that the obligation of either making good the damage or paying compensation in the case of subsidence was limited to damage which could not have been avoided by reasonable and proper precautions taken in the design and construction of buildings in order to minimise damage.<br/>
This was a point which the right hon. and gallant Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme (Colonel Wedgwood) and the hon. Member for Stoke (Mr. Ellis Smith) both discussed, and during the Debate the hon. and learned Member for East Bristol (Sir S. Cripps) suggested that as it would be difficult to say what were reasonable and proper precautions it might be better to devise some code of what would be considered to be proper precautions, so that


there should be no trouble when the question arose. It was impossible at that moment to devise any code, but I have made investigations to see what could be done on the lines suggested. We found ourselves under a difficulty from the point of view of housing and Ministry of Health problems. My right hon. Friend the Minister of Health pointed out that local authorities had powers regarding houses granted to them under local by-laws, and that it would not be practicable to insert in this Bill a sort of code of particular rules for houses in areas where subsidence might occur which would override the local by-laws. I think hon. Members will see the great difficulties which would arise.<br/>
The Amendment which has been inserted in the other place deals with a considerable part of the problem, and I will try to explain what it means. It provides that the first time the Commission is going to grant a lease for coal which at present is unsevered from the surface it must give public notice. That is the same condition as before. Then, at any time after that notice has been given, anybody who is proposing to build, whether a local authority or a private individual&#x2014;the "building owner," as he is called&#x2014;is to notify the Commission of his intention to build, and within 14 days of that, if the Commission ask him to do so, he is to make the plans of the building available to the Commission, that is, they can go and look at them. If the Commission ask to have copies supplied they must be supplied. In that way the Commission will know what the proposed building will be and the foundations which it is intended to put in. Then, within a period of 28 days, the Commission may say to the building owner that they think it is desirable, in order to minimise the possibility of damage in the event of subsidence, that he should put in foundations of a certain type. If they make those representations, and if such foundations are put in, then the liability subsequently to pay compensation for damage shall not extend to any damage which could have been avoided if those foundations had been put in as recommended by the Commission.<br/>
The next question is, Who is to know whether the foundations which are put in are foundations such as the Commission wanted. Paragraph (<i>c</i>) of the Amendement gives to the Commission the right

to have the foundations inspected when they are being put in, and if they then think they are not in accordance with what they have recommended they can say to the builder, "You are not putting in foundations in accordance with the specifications we approved." If the building owner disputes that contention the dispute can be arbitrated upon then and there, and that will settle once and for all the question whether the foundations are proper foundations.<br/>
Next the question naturally arises, Who is to pay for all this? If the Commission decides that it will be to their ultimate advantage&#x2014;and they will, no doubt, have to strike a balance of advantages in any particular case&#x2014;they have to pay to the building owner the extra cost of putting in these better foundations. It may be said that that will be expensive for the Commission, but, on the other side of the account, they will limit, if not entirely eliminate, claims which may ultimately be made upon them for damage from subsidence, because they will not be liable for damage which could have been avoided if those foundations had been put in. It will be a question for the Commission to decide whether, in view of those obligations, it is better worth while to spend money when building is taking place on a contribution towards the cost of better foundations than to do nothing and to be liable for compensation afterwards if the foundations which are put in without their having intervened are such that subsidence takes place. They will have to decide for themselves the balance of advantages. It is not mandatory; it is for the Commission to decide what it is best to do.<br/>
There is one other proviso to be taken into account. If the building owner fails to give notice that he intends to build, or if he fails to comply with any request made by the Commission, the obligation to pay compensation or to make good damage, shall be limited merely to the amount of damage which could not have been avoided if he had taken proper precautions. He is, therefore, in a worse position considerably than he would otherwise have been.<br/>
That is the effect of this new code. It is not the whole picture, because there is still another Amendment dealing with it to be considered, but this is the code


proposed and it is an optional code, leaving the Commission, if they think it is to their advantage, to pay for better foundations in the belief that it will save considerable expense later.</p>

<p>I am much obliged to the hon. and gallant Gentleman for his explanation. The real change which has been made in this Clause is to put upon the Commission a burden which they did not bear before. This is one of that group of Clauses which have been dealt with by their Lordships upon the basis that they no longer own the coal but now own the land, which will be their position after the vesting date. They are now busy, in the Clauses and Amendments with which we are dealing, protecting their position as landowners, no longer concerned with the position of the coal. Therefore, they now load everything on to the coalowners and no longer, as they used to do when they were coalowners, avoid all possible liabilities by passing them on to somebody else, and to the persons who worked the coal.<br/>
It is true, as the hon. and gallant Gentleman said, that we made a number of criticisms upon the form of Part II, 6 (2) of the Second Schedule. Some of those matters have been put right by paragraphs (<i>a</i>), (<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>) of Sub-section (3) of the Schedule, as it will now be, especially the matter in paragraph (<i>c</i>) which the hon. and gallant Gentleman mentioned. There will now be a method of determining, at the date when the foundations are put in, whether or not they are satisfactory foundations. When Sub-section (2) of paragraph 6 of the Schedule left this House with the blessing of His Majesty's Government the provision was that no compensation should be paid to any owner of land who built upon the surface of his land with the full knowledge that mining operations were about to start under them, unless he had employed such reasonable and proper precautions in the design and construction of the buildings as to minimise damage in the event of subsidence. The cost of those precautions was to be borne by the owner, he being the person who was, for some reason best known to himself, determined to build on the surface of land where, he knew, there was danger of subsidence. It was, therefore, said quite

logically that if he wanted to build in that way the extra cost of putting in proper foundations, or whatever it might be, should fall upon him.<br/>
After their Lordships have dealt with that proposal it comes back to us in the form that the Commission shall pay, first of all the costs reasonably incurred by the building owner in the production or furnishing of copies of plans and specifications. That is a curious thing to make the Commission pay for. The building owner must have plans and specifications to submit to the local authority. It is only just another item that I can see in the Bill which will be rendered in connection with this matter by the building owner's solicitors. In addition to that, the Commission have to pay the amount of any addition to the expenses incurred by the building owner in constructing the buildings or works, and attributable to giving effect to the Commission's proposals.<br/>
What that means is that if the Commission request or require for the purposes of safety that he shall take what was called in the original Sub-section
<q>reasonable and proper precautions,</q>
the Commission shall pay for it. When this House and His Majesty's Government last parted with this Schedule they both recommended that the Commission should not pay for it. In addition to those things, the Commission have to pay for
<q>any postponement or interruption of the construction thereof consequent upon an allegation on the part of the Commission of a departure from plans and specifications which is determined not to have been well founded,</q>
and any question as to such liability is to be decided by arbitration. We do not see any justification for departing from that part of the Sub-section which laid down that the building owner should pay for the proper precautions to make his building safe, and for loading that cost on to the Commission. Indeed, these successive charges are to be placed upon a Commission who have paid for the royalties on the basis that those charges did not attach. If those charges had attached, the royalty would have been much less in extent than the price paid by the Commission.<br/>
The arbitral committee, when it arrived at the valuation of the royalties, did not value them on the basis of the royalty


owner having to bear these charges and expenses. If they had, it is undoubted that a very considerable sum would have had to be deducted by way of allowances for these expenses from the amount of the royalties, and the global sum would have been a good deal smaller. If that had been done, it might have been fair and reasonable to say to the Commission that they, having paid a smaller sum for the royalties, must, of course, accept the obligations which had been calculated as a part of those obligations in the purchasing of the royalties; but when that has not been done, and when those obligations were not brought into account, it is not fair to the Commission to say afterwards: "You have paid the price for the royalties as if those obligations did not attach, and now we attach those further obligations to the price."<br/>
It means in fact that you are making the Commission pay twice over for the same thing. It is not the viciousness of these actual provisions of which we complain so much as that the surfacer who has got the money for the royalties for his ownership, on the basis that these obligations did not attach to the royalty part of his ownership, is now to get the benefit of those obligations attaching to that royalty part, and so, twice over, to get payment in respect of those same obligations. That is clearly not fair upon the Commission, and it is not right that those owners of the surface and the minerals below should get this benefit in two different ways. That is the result of assessing the royalties on a certain basis, a factual basis, and then trying to impose upon the Commission afterwards further obligations which were not the obligations assumed by the persons who were receiving the royalties at the time.<br/>
We say, therefore, that it is too late to put upon the Commission this burden which, if it ever was to be put upon them&#x2014;I am not now discussing whether it would be fair or not in the circumstances&#x2014;ought to have been imposed notionally before they paid the global sum, but, they having paid the global sum, the only fair thing to do is to say that the Commission shall have no further or greater obligation than the people from whom they purchased the royalties, at the price which was paid.</p>

<p>The President of the Board of Trade will remember that, when we were discussing the global sum, I called his attention to the fact that, while there was that global sum before the House, there was no sum that might be deemed to represent the total cost of the liabilities in operating the coal, and I asked whether, in coming to the agreement as to the global sum, the negotiators had in mind what would be the capital cost of possible liabilities in exploiting the coal. I was told that no estimate at all had been made of that cost, and the facts are now coming to light. A global sum has been agreed upon, but, if the cost of the liabilities imposed upon the Commission when it becomes the owner had been hypothetically assessed, the global sum might have been nothing like what it has now been agreed to pay.<br/>
It would be well to survey the situation. First of all, the Commission is to own the coal and exploit it to the best advantage. What of the hopes of those who advanced the theory that it was well that the coal royalties should be nationalised, and that the result would redound to the benefit of the wages of the miners and the better operation and exploitation of the coal? The Commission will have to pay off a capital sum to meet the burden of purchasing the entire coal royalties; they will have to pay all rates and taxes; and they are further charged, if they have any surplus in hand over their annual requirements, that it shall be used to reduce rents. I protested against that at the time on Clause 21. They have also to face damages incurred through subsidence. What these will amount to, nobody can tell at the moment. And now we have this latest proposal. What the cost of it will be, no one can say; it is an indeterminate sum. Recently, in the Potteries, we have been trying to extend the housing area, and the Ministry of Health has had to make certain concessions to us, at the expense of the taxpayer, because every house we build in that area has to be built on a specially constructed concrete raft. Now, when the miners are hoping that there will be a surplus to diffuse into the wages bill, the Commission will be faced with the new charge.<br/>
The real fact is that the Bill is an enormous hoax. When you attempt to deal with the land question by cutting it up into stratifications, giving the coal to A, keeping the surface for B, and giving to A, B, C, D, E and F the power to charge damages against anyone they meet, the result is as was described in the speech of one of my hon. Friends about everyone in the village charging up damages to the local mine. Nothing will come out of this Bill but disappointment, and the Amendment we are now discussing brings that fact fully to light. There is a whole list of charges that are levied against the Commission, and the Secretary for Mines and the President of the Board of Trade know that there will be no surplus left, after all those charges are met, to provide the fruits which the mining communities have been led to believe would come to them. I see no way out of the impasse. When the coal was in the private hands of the surface owners, there was not the same exactitude as to the provisions for the convenience of the surface owner. I am afraid I can add no counsel of wisdom to the perplexity which has fallen upon the House, and which I anticipated from the beginning. The miners are beginning to see how much they are going to get out of the Bill, or how much the State is going to get out of the Bill; and I hope that it will be one lesson, at least, to show the futility of attempting to deal with the land question in this piecemeal fashion.</p>

<p>I would willingly follow the hon. Member who has just spoken in the speculations into which he invites the House to go, but I will turn to the actual substance of the Amendment. I would remind the hon. and learned Member for East Bristol (Sir S. Cripps), as he reminded me in Committee, that this particular section of this Schedule refers solely to coal which was unworked at the valuation date. When I founded an argument on a wider view than that he properly brought me back to what we were dealing with. I would respectfully remind him and the House that we are dealing solely with coal unworked at the date of valuation, which at some date subsequent to that the Commission intend to work. On the surface, above that coal, there may be buildings of any sort. The

hon. Member who has just spoken reminded us that, as is often the case, on the surface, above that coal, there may be a building estate put up by a local authority for the houses of a great number of small persons.<br/>
What was the situation in the Schedule as it was originally before us in this House? It was that in any future building that was to be done those who were proposing to build were to take what the Schedule calls "reasonable precautions" against future subsidence, without any definition whatever as to what those reasonable precautions were to be. I, among others, pointed out that if the Schedule was left in that way, years after the buildings had been put up, and when the subsidence began to occur, there were bound to be disputes as to whether or not those reasonable precautions had been taken. I criticised this Schedule, saying in effect that it was really laying the ground for litigation years after the buildings were put up, when the subsidence began to occur. Therefore, I supported the proposal which came from hon. Members opposite, that we should have definite proposals in the Schedule as to what the reasonable precautions were to be. We have them in the Schedule now, and the only point on which I gather that the hon. and learned Member for East Bristol really criticises the Schedule is this: An individual or a public authority may choose one of two options&#x2014;either going on on their own and having no right to make the Commission liable for subsidence; or submitting their plans and taking precautions, and thereby being able to claim for subsidence years after if those precautions are not sufficient. The hon. and learned Member considers that the Commission should pay no part of the cost of getting out and submitting those plans and taking those additional precautions. It seems to me not a very great insurance premium to charge the Commission to do this, so that it shall not ultimately be liable to subsidence. If that is the only ground on which the Schedule can be criticised, I suggest that it is a very thin ground indeed; and I hope the House will have no hesitation in accepting this Amendment to the Schedule, which, in my opinion, does really put before the House a workable scheme to avoid a great deal of litigation in the future and to safeguard


all classes of the community from subsidence.</p>

<p>My hon. and learned Friend the Member for East Bristol (Sir S. Cripps) has made our position quite clear in regard to this Amendment, and my hon. Friend the Member for Llanelly (Mr. J. Griffiths) on the previous Amendment stated the seriousness of this new policy with regard to the Commission. I want to support them, and, in addition, ask a few pointed questions of the President of the Board of Trade and the Secretary for Mines, in order to make the position clearer to myself and to the people I represent. Some people tell me that one of my failings is that I am too prepared to take things at their face value, but, knowing something of the political history of this country, and having sat here during the whole of the proceedings in this Debate and heard my hon. Friends, one after another, indicating their suspicion of anything that comes from another place, despite my failing I am bound to feel suspicious of anything they do. My suspicion has been confirmed by a number of hon. Friends sitting round me who, while the Secretary for Mines was speaking, were making statements something to this effect, namely, that this is a typical example of gamekeepers turning poachers.<br/>
It is from that angle that I approach this question. We have to deal with things as they are. I hold fundamental principles, and I have had a training which convinces me that scientific training is the only hope for humanity, and that at some time and somehow it will have to be adopted. In the meantime, as practical men dealing with every-day affairs, and having to get the best out of things as they are within the limits of our opportunities, it behoves us, if we are to represent the people of this country, to get the best out of anything that is before us at any given time. That has been the attitude of the miners in connection with this Bill. The miners know full well that there is only one hope for the industry&#x2014;and sooner or later the nation will have to come to it&#x2014;and that is, the fullest possible nationalisation of the whole of the mining industry and its subsidiaries. The people of this country have not yet been prepared to support us in this policy,

although it is true that they are supporting us more and more in that direction. For the time being we have a Government who are satisfied with this Bill, but even this Bill has been handicapped by another place. Therefore, as practical men representing the men and women living in the localities from which we come, we have to remember that things are not as we would like them to be, and we have to deal with the situation as it is. Therefore, I want to ask a few questions upon this Amendment.<br/>
Am I correct in my understanding of the purpose of the Amendment? These are the three main points which I understand to be the object of the Amendment. First, it is to place a responsibility on the Commission which, as my hon. Friend the Member for Llanelly said, the royalty owners have refused to accept in the past; second, the Commission may inspect plans of proposed alterations that they are prepared to pay for; and, third, the liability shall apply only in those cases where the Commission has been consulted prior to the building being carried out. If I understand the Amendment correctly, how will it be administered. The Lords Amendment on page 14 says:
<q>The Commission shall on the occasion of their first exercising, etc.</q>
Then it goes on to state that an advertisement shall be placed in the London Gazette and in one or more of the newspapers circulating in the locality. Is it right and reasonable that that is all that should take place? Is it not reasonable to request that at least the local authority, representing the interests of the people living in the locality, should be informed by the Secretary for Mines that this may apply to their district? The second point arises on page 15, in paragraph (<i>b</i>), which says:
<q>The Commission may make such proposals as to the materials for and method of construction of the foundations as appear to them to be desirable for minimising damage in the event of subsidence.</q>
I should like to ask a question as to the cost of the precautions to be taken to minimise subsidence. Later on, there is the provision that a person may inspect the foundations to ascertain whether the construction is being carried out on the basis of reasonable precautions being taken. When it comes to a matter of administration, the question of what is


reasonable becomes a matter of opinion, and the matter of opinion is to be determined by arbitration. Some of us have had experience of arbitration, and we know the legal quibbling that constantly takes place where questions are referred to arbitration. On the one hand we shall find that the case will be prepared by well trained legal people. Probably some of the finest legal minds in the country will prepare the case for arbitration on one side, while on the other side poor people, who cannot afford to pay for their case to be submitted to arbitration, will be affected. Therefore, I would ask what will be the attitude of the Secretary for Mines in connection with the question of arbitration. Can he assure us that there will be equal opportunities for submitting the case to arbitration, and that it will not be weighted on one side by great financial interests, while poor people will not have the same opportunity for the preparation of their case? I hope the Secretary for Mines will reply to these pertinent questions so that when this Bill becomes an Act the people in the districts we represent will have on record what their position is.</p>

<p>There are two speeches on which I should like to make a comment. The first is the speech of the hon. and learned Member for Ashford (Mr. Spens) who seemed to look upon this as a very beneficial matter. Hon. Members would have been more convinced if the Lords had been prepared to include in the Amendment a proposal to take a much less sum than the global sum which is recommended. Most hon. Members will appreciate the fact that if what the hon. and learned Member has said had been practised by royalty owners in the past the global sum would have been considerably less. It is rather significant that landlords should suggest that the sum should be substantially larger and at the same time endeavour to place greater obligations on the Commission itself. It is something that they have not practised in the past, it is something in violation of the tenets they have held in the past whenever we have endeavoured to place financial obligations upon them for subsidences which have occurred in mining valleys and elsewhere.<br/>
The other speech upon which I should like to comment is that of the hon. Member

for Burslem (Mr. MacLaren). I should like to tell him that it is not necessary to convince mining Members in this House that the Bill is a bad Measure. The miners fully appreciate the purposes of the Bill. To-day hon. Members and myself had occasion to visit the Minister of Labour and the Chairman of the Unemployment Assistance Board upon the application of the new regulations in South Wales and other parts of the country, and we listened to a statement in which statistics were used showing the enormous reduction in the number of collieries in commission to-day as compared with 1920.</p>

<p>I was commenting on the speech of the hon. Member for Burslem (Mr. MacLaren) and using it as an illustration. The number of pits which are in commission are slightly more than 400 as compared with 600 in 1920. It is pretty obvious that the royalty owners realise that this contraction is likely to continue and that it will inevitably lead to an enormous contraction in royalty payments. We suggest that they have got a very good deal in the global sum which will be paid and, particularly, as they are to draw royalties for a few years to come. The miners are conscious of and appreciate all that. I want my hon. Friend the Member for Burslem to realise that we were conscious of that on the Second Reading and the Third Reading of the Bill. We know that it is really a bad Bill as such, but we are amazed to find that the landowners in the other place, having for centuries drawn from the mining industry enormous sums of money which have had to be paid out of the bone and marrow and heavy casualties of the miners, should have the impertinence to suggest in this Amendment that a responsibility should devolve upon the Commission which they themselves have never been prepared to bear.<br/>
I suggest that there is one reason for this, apart entirely from the financial reasons. They are out to wreck the functions of the Commission; they are out to demonstrate, if possible, that nationalisation cannot work; they are out to cripple the Commission by placing upon it a financial obligation which even the Government were not prepared to permit them


to bear. That is the reason for this Amendment. They want to wreck the whole scheme by making it impossible for the Commission to function properly owing to the financial obligations which they will have to bear as a result of the Amendments that are suggested by the other place. I rose to speak in order to make those comments on the two speeches we have heard on this Amendment, and to show that the time has certainly arrived when the people of this country ought at last to be convinced that the other place simply represents vested interests, and that they are prepared even to violate good public intentions that may by accident come from the present Government in order that their own vested interests may be preserved.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend the Member for Ogmore (Mr. E. J. Williams) said that the other place is a House of vested interests. I do not think there can be very much doubt about that when we look at the Amendments they have made to this Bill. They are the people who, together with their ancestors, have taken out of the mining industry in royalties a sum of not less than &#x00A3;300,000,000. That is the contribution they have extracted from the miners of this country during the last two or three centuries. Now they are asking, in this Amendment, that the Commission shall undertake a responsibility which they themselves have never borne. I do not intend to make a long speech on this matter. I confess that I am tired of looking at these Amendments. I said last night, and I repeat, that I am in very much the same position as my hon. Friend the Member for Leigh (Mr. Tinker). I would have liked to make the Amendments to this Bill a matter of principle in the country. What we have seen in regard to these Amendments, including this one, is that, with a very small number of votes in the other place, they have done their utmost to destroy what little good there might be in this Measure.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Burslem (Mr. MacLaren) rather conveyed the impression that the miners thought they were going to derive very substantial advantages from this Measure. He is entirely wrong. We have recognised the value of this Bill from the beginning. It has had a chequered career. The little

advantages which might have accrued to the miners from it are now being taken away. I wish to ask the Minister a question which I hope he will answer. Has he or any other person made an estimate of the cost that will be involved in transferring this burden to the Commission? We know that damage has been done by subsidence over a long period and on many occasions we have suggested that much of that damage was preventable if proper packing were carried out in the mines. The divisional inspector for South Wales has suggested to the Department every year for the past seven years that mines should be properly packed. Not only subsidences but on occasion explosions could be avoided, if proper care were taken in that way. Only yesterday we considered an Amendment dealing with the right of the Commission to determine methods of working the mines. The other place have taken away that right from the Commission. Then they were acting for the coalowners. In this case they are acting for the landowners. Practically every Amendment made in the other place has been made with the direct object of benefiting either coalowners or landowners.<br/>
It may be that colliery owners will continue to carry on mining as they have done in the past. I do not know what the Royal Commission will do about it, but if mining continues to be carried on as in the past then we shall have the same amount of subsidence and in years to come millions of pounds worth of damage will have been done. If the Commission has to bear the cost it will be so crippled that not only will there be no reduction in the rents and royalties charged, but very likely there will be an increase. That is the danger which underlies this proposition. An hon. Friend of mine beside me suggests that it will be taken out of wages. Of course, that is what is intended. It will be part of the "other costs" which come into calculation and wages will be reduced in proportion to the expenditure incurred in this way. That is why I ask the Minister for an estimate. If he has not an estimate, why does he accept this proposal without knowing the liability involved? This Amendment ought to be resisted. If there is a liability to be borne in respect of subsidence the people who have been responsible in the past and have not carried out mining according to


the best practices, are the people who ought to bear it and not the Commission. This Amendment means that more of the power of the Commission will be taken from it and eventually it will be left without power, without authority, without the financial ability to reduce rents and even though we get nationalisation or socialisation of coal-mining royalties, the mine workers will not be a penny the better. It may be, indeed, that they will have a reduction in their wages as a consequence of this liability being imposed on the Commission.</p>

<p>It is ironical that a proposal of this description should have come from the other place. The Members in another place have, with great care, set out in detail all the things that have to be done by the Commission to protect property against subsidence. Yet these are the very people who have been royalty owners themselves, and who for centuries past, ever since coal was worked in this country, have repudiated every obligation of that kind. Stories were told during the Committee stage of what had happened in Stoke and in Lancashire and in various places and of the efforts which had been made to secure some justice in respect of damage to the property of small owners caused by subsidence. The amount of justice that people got was ridiculously small. Now the Commission is the owner and the previous owners have been paid in full. There has been no reduction in the amount paid to the royalty owners because of this obligation. Having been paid in full, they are going to see that the future owner does the right thing.<br/>
It is ironical, but it is tragic at the same time, because the miners in the long run are the people who will suffer the cost of it. One could have understood this better if the Commission had been given the right to do the things that can be done in order to mitigate subsidence and damage to property, but they have even been refused that. All they have to do in the future is to pay at the behest of those who always refused to pay when they were the owners. The people who have done this are still the owners of the surface. In the past land has been of less value if it was subject to coal being worked below it, but the owners will get full value in the future. They will say to a purchaser, "If subsidence

occurs, the Commission will have to pay you for the damage. If you submit plans to the Commission they will have to pay for that. If they suggest any alteration they will have to pay for everything." If, after all that subsidence occurs, they will have to pay for that also. The land will be worth even more than it was previously. What a glorious bargain the Lords have made for themselves. It is another illustration of the fact that the sooner they are abolished the better.</p>

<p>May I remind the House that what we are discussing is an Amendment? From the speeches that have been made one might think we were discussing something quite different. If we do not accept this Amendment, the Bill will remain as it now is. It will not contain any of the provisions which some Members have adumbrated. We have passed that stage. It is merely an alternative proposition. Is the House prepared to accept the code laid down in the Amendment or does it prefer that we should stick to the Bill as it was before, and that, when the Commission intend to give a lease in an area where coal has previously not been worked, it should give public notice and the obligation to make good or to pay compensation shall be limited to damage which would have been prevented by reasonable and proper precautions?<br/>
The only issue before us is whether that is a better way of doing it than to lay down as this Amendment does a procedure which is not compulsory on the Commission. I would again remind hon. Members of that because they spoke as if we were placing a compulsory burden on them. The Commission need not take this responsibility unless they choose to accept it. They will take a long view of these matters and, if they consider, generally speaking, that it is better to have these foundations put in at their own expense rather than run the risk of subsequent claims, they should be permitted to do so. We are dealing with a far narrower point than those who have heard the discussion might think. Hon. Gentlemen might think it ought to go a good deal further, but that is not the question on which the House has to make up its mind at the moment.<br/>
The hon. Member for Stoke (Mr. E. Smith) asked whether it was enough that


these notices should appear in the London Gazette and the local paper and whether the local authorities should not be informed. These words are exactly as they were in the Clause when it left this House. We then considered that it was sufficient. I think that in practice what the hon. Member has in mind is generally covered, because most local authorities take the London Gazette as that is the normal place in which appear a great many official announcements which must interest them. The hon. Member for Pontypool (Mr. Jenkins) asked whether there was any estimate of the cost of this. There cannot be any estimate because the Commission do not have to pay for these extra precautions. How can anybody say what will be the building developments in an area where coal is not at present being developed, and where at some future date it may be developed? I am sure the hon. Gentleman will see that it is impossible to make an estimate because nobody can tell what action the Commission will take in the circumstances at the time.</p>

<p>I do not think it could be, but anyhow I do not know the answer to that question in the middle of a speech. There was a third question the drift of which I could not quite understand. The hon. Member hoped that if there was a dispute and it had to go to arbitration it would not be too expensive. The only occasion under this Amendment when there is likely to be arbitration is a dispute between the Commission and the builders, whoever they may be, as to whether the foundations are being constructed according to specifications. I should have thought that that was a dispute which could not possibly run into any great expenditure. One obviously could not say what the cost would be, for it would depend on the circumstances of the dispute.</p>

<p>I beg to move, "That this House doth disagree with the Lords in the said Amendment."<br/>
The Amendment says that on the grant of a right to withdraw support from any


land the Commission shall require adequate security for the payment of compensation which may become payable. Of course, it is a completely unworkable proposition, and anyway it is unnecessary because later I shall ask the House to agree to an Amendment dealing with much the same point.</p>

<p>I liked the nice phraseology of the Secretary for Mines: "Of course, it is completely unworkable." Of course, coming from their Lordships' House, it would be. We are getting a choice collection of phrases, starting with the "mischances" of the right hon. Gentleman opposite, and we shall find a very fine list of criticisms of their Lordships from the Government front bench. Of course, we agree that this is entirely unworkable, and we are very glad that the Government are asking the House to disagree. It is a little interesting to notice the selection of the Amendments upon which we are asked to disagree. Here there is just a nice balance between two vested interests that support His Majesty's Government, the royalty owners and the coalowners. This would be a grave incubus upon the coalowners, and this time they have won.</p>

<p>The House ought to appreciate that this Amendment was carried against the Government in the House of Lords. As I understand, it was really put forward at the instance of the Association of Municipal Corporations in the first instance. In 99 cases out of 100 it may be a very practical and workable proposition, with all respect to my hon. and learned Friend and the hon. and gallant Gentleman opposite, to ensure that a private company to whom a lease is given of mines where there is a likelihood of subsidence, shall be compelled to give adequate security for the payment of any compensation likely to become possible as a result of the withdrawal of support. It is all very well to say that that proposal is unworkable. I quite recognise that if the case were one of withdrawal of support from a whole town very large sums of money might be involved, but I do not think that the House should at once disagree with their Lordships on a matter in which their Lordships have

disagreed with the Government, and which insists that private companies shall give security for possible withdrawal of support.<br/>
This Amendment was introduced into the House of Lords under very responsible auspices, the Association of Municipal Corporations, and I think it should be a little further explored before we disagree with their Lordships. If we permit a private company to withdraw support, that company will have no obligation to give security for such withdrawal. It may be that the hon. and gallant Gentleman can give us an absolute security that in some future Amendment some guarantee is given.</p>

<p>I have already said that the matter is largely dealt with in a subsequent Amendment.</p>

<p>The House would be glad if the hon. and gallant Gentleman would be more detailed and give the precise proposal which will be in that later Amendment. If he gives the security which I ask, for the local authorities in particular, I shall be very glad to withdraw my opposition.</p>

<p>I do not think that this matter is limited to the local authorities. I do not know on what representations this Amendment was inserted; it does not really have anything to do with local authorities at all. The suggestion in it is that the Commission should first grant to a colliery undertaking which is going to work the coal a right to withdraw support, and should at that time secure from that undertaking adequate security, I presume in the form of some large cash provision, for any compensation likely to become payable at any time, as a result of their working the coal. The hon. Gentleman may say that it is a practical proposition, but I cannot imagine on what basis the Commission could possibly estimate what would be an adequate security against possible claims for compensation over the whole period of the working of the coal. As I have said, there is another Amendment which deals with the same point, but this Amendment, as the hon. Gentleman has reminded us, was carried against the Government in another place, and I cannot see that we are under any obligation to accept it now.</p>

Paragraph 6 (4) of the Schedule as it left us required undertakings which had

statutory rights for the mining of coal to apply under the working facilities legislation for restrictions on the working of coal required for their undertakings, and no exception was taken to that provision. These words extend the same power of application to the Railway and Canal Commission for that kind of support to what may briefly be described as non-statutory public undertakings. The point was not raised in this House at all, but in another place attention was called to the fact that, particularly in Scotland, there were various small undertakings which were not in possession of full statutory rights, but existed primarily for the supply of gas, electricity, water or hydraulic power. I hope the House will agree with this very reasonable Amendment.</p>

<p>I beg to move, "That this House doth agree with the Lords in the said Amendment."<br/>
This Amendment provides that any person interested in land damaged by the working of coal in the exercise of a right which is vested in the Commission subject to an obligation to pay compensation for damage arising from the working, and


which has been granted by the Commission to a lessee, shall be entitled to enforce against the Commission any liability to pay proper compensation, with the proviso, which is important, that this must not be taken as making invalid any provision which the Commission may make for passing on that responsibility to its lessee. This only concerns existing leases the rights under which as between the present surface owners and the present lessees pass, for the duration of the lease, to the Commission, merely with the substitution of the Commission for the actual coalowner. So they are not affected. This deals with the case of all fresh leases made by the Commission. When the matter was raised before, it was pointed out that sometimes damage occurred and the colliery company had, perhaps, ceased working, disappeared, or gone bankrupt; at any rate, for some reason, the damage could not be recovered; and that was a great hardship to the people who had suffered from the subsidence.<br/>
Another point made by hon. Members was that sometimes it could not be found out who had caused the subsidence, as there were two or three undertakings working in close proximity. In the interests of all likely to suffer damage, this Amendment suggests that in the first instance the right should lie against the Commission, but there is no reason why the Commission should not do exactly what has been normally done in the past&#x2014;that is, pass on the liability to the undertaking&#x2014;and the proviso enables that to happen. There is nothing in the paragraph which renders invalid any provision which the Commission may make with its lessee in order to indemnify the Commission against such claims. To that extent, I think it meets the point that the hon. Member for Llanelly (Mr. J. Griffiths) made earlier on; and it provides, in the second part, that any questions in regard to the existence of obligation to pay compensation or not shall be settled by arbitration. That, again, takes up the point made earlier on, that some difficulties were experienced in pursuing this question owing to the high costs. It is in order to meet those points that I recommend that this Amendment should be agreed to.</p>

<p>It is amazing how His Majesty's Government are discovering

what is fair as regards surface owners. It is now fair that they should have the first right against royalty owners whatever the provisions of the lease. It is a pity they did not discover that 20 years ago. Again, it is a complete alteration of the conditions on which the global sum was paid. It may be a good alteration or a bad alteration, but it is a complete alteration. Again, it is putting into the hands of the surface owner who has sold his coal a better chance of recovering any damage than he would have had in other circumstances. It is, again, in favour of the landowner and against the Commission. It is, again, liable to cripple the Commission in carrying out its work, so far as it has any effect at all. We object to the representatives of the royalty owners coming forward and saying, "This which we refused to do for the last century is really the only fair and proper thing to be done." Directly they have divested themselves of their ownership of the coal and got the cash, they are prepared to load any burdens on the person who has got the coal. It is for that reason that we object strongly to this increase of charge on the Commission.</p>

<p>There is a difference between this Amendment and the former Amendment which the House discussed. On the former Amendment some of my colleagues complained that there was a danger of piling up expenditure against the Commission, so that the Commission might be damaged in their work. They felt during that debate that, after all, there was a little something in it because houses might be damaged. This Amendment does not deal with damage to houses but simply with land. The royalty owners have sold the coal and got the royalty rents, and now, as landowners, they are dealing with the land.</p>

<p>Where are the houses? Will the Secretary for Mines point out in this Amendment where the houses are? There is not a word in the Amendment that deals with houses. It really means that the royalty owners have got paid for the coal, and now they are the landowners they want to be paid for any damage that is done to the land. The royalty owners say that the Government have forced them to accept a price they do not like


for the sale of their coal, and now they intend to do everything they possibly can to ruin the Commission. This is one of the ways to ruin the Commission. I do not believe that for the next 25 years the miners will get any relief from the transference of the royalties from the present royalty owners to the Commission. The way that the Government are accepting these Amendments from another place will cause the expenditure of the Commission to pile up, so that they will have to increase the rents. Bad as is the position of the miners at the present time, the proposals from another place which the Government are accepting will make their position worse than it is at the present time.</p>

<p>I do not know whether the learned Attorney-General has noticed one thing about the Schedule. It might be said generally that that was the case, but in this case&#x2014;page 14 of the Lords Amendments, he will notice that where that is intended, in this Schedule it is specifically stated, where it sets out,
<q>which obligation shall extend to buildings and works on that land</q>
when constructed before a certain date. Therefore, there, land clearly does not include buildings, because it is intended by the definition only to apply to buildings built after a certain date, and would not cover buildings before that date. It is open to doubt as to whether a Clause appearing in the same Schedule using the word "land" will not be held to have the same meaning as land clearly must have in the first part of that Schedule. I suggest that it is by no means certain in this particular text in view of that definition in (<i>b</i>), that land will include works and buildings.</p>

<p>It is no good the Attorney-General telling us that we can accept that assurance from him. He must give us some reasons. Even Law Officers have been wrong in times past. The hon. and learned Member for East Bristol (Sir S. Cripps) has given a very cogent argument, but the Attorney-General says we can accept it from him that that argument is wrong. That is a much bigger answer than we have had before. The policy has been to sit still in the firm conviction that anything they did say would be wrong. Everybody knows that land, ordinarily speaking, includes everything on it, even when it is inserted in the Statute at the instance of gentlemen who are generally only interested in land and not in buildings that people put on the land. In one part of the Schedule "land" is defined to include "buildings and works" and on the next page we get the word "land" put in quite simply. There is grave danger of the court construing that as land without buildings, but the Attorney-General seeks to assure us that that is not so.</p>

<p>I have been amazed at the number of amendments we have accepted which are going to fritter away the revenue of the Commission. One hon. Member pointed out that the Commission can pass subsidence expenses on to the lessee. That is true, but from the lessee they must go straight to the wage earner. Before we vote on this Amendment I should like the House to realise what we are doing. We are taking &#x00A3;66,000,000 of the hard-won earnings of the workers and handing it over to people who have been milking the country for years, and we are doing that in order to get back for the people what already morally belongs to them. I have been racking my brains to find a suitable simile


&#x2014;I do not think hon. Members opposite would accept my statement&#x2014;for what is happening, and the only thing I can think of is the story of the famous pirate Captain Kidd, who lived in the Middle Ages, and who amassed huge wealth by sinking ships at sea. Instead of burying his wealth as he used to do, suppose he had formed a limited liability company and got a monopoly of piracy and handed the right on to his heirs and successors. And suppose that public opinion rose in revolt and said that piracy must stop, would this House solemnly sit down and decide what sum it should pay to buy back the monopoly.</p>

<p>I want to put a point with regard to existing leases which contain a clause that the lessee shall be solely liable for subsidence. I want to ask what happens when that particular lease expires, or when the company which is the lessee is wound up or goes bankrupt, and it is a question of drawing up a new lease to the same company or some other company in respect of the existing mine? Will it be competent for the Commission to draw up a new lease containing the same clause in the lease which existed placing the whole liability for subsidence upon the lessee, exonerating the Commission entirely from all liability, or will the Commission be compelled, when granting a new lease to accept the liability for subsidence? If it is possible for the Commission to insist on the same terms which are now attached to that particular mine continuing in all future leases they are getting precisely what they claim, and are not being asked to undertake any new obligation. If, on the other hand, it is the other way round, if on granting a new lease to a new company, or a new lease to the existing company, they will be compelled to take over the whole liability for subsidence, then they are being asked to take on a burden for which they never bargained.</p>

<p>It is evident from the temper in which they have approached these Amendments, that they have had a savage determination to get their own back on the Greene Committee for not fixing as large a sum as they thought ought to have been fixed. One hears complaints about the method in which the Greene Committee committed the royalty owners to that sum of money. One hears and reads comments and opinions expressed that if the sum was too small, it had to be accepted, and if it was too large, the Government could resist paying it. But they said they had better accept it, as there might be another Government coming into power which would pass legislation paying much less than &#x00A3;66,500,000. They said, "There is a far, far better way&#x2014;let us get it by the Amendments." I want to point out that the landlord who now ceases to be the mineral owner will, by these Amendments, be most handsomely safeguarded and most liberally rewarded.<br/>
A large colliery company in Northumberland has raised this point with the Secretary for Mines, and they have been woefully disappointed. They were under the impression, when the Bill was introduced in the House of Commons, that something would be done to deal with the leases granted by landowners to colliery companies. The expenses that may come against the Commission can be of a very important nature. Let us assume this position. A landowner has leased 36 acres to a colliery company. The company has no houses, but there is a railway line upon which the company runs its coal. That colliery company and another one are amalgamated: the time during which the two companies were separate, and the time during which they


were amalgamated, comes to 62 years; during that time they have paid &#x00A3;411,548 in charges for running their coal over 36 acres&#x2014;</p>

Never mind who pays it&#x2014;it will come from the people who go down into the bowels of the earth day after day to produce the coal.

<p>Yes, and that liability if there were no realisable assets, would fall on the Commission, and I cannot understand why the hon. and gallant Gentleman is circumnavigating round a very simple point. As I am on my feet, may I express my opinion on this Amendment, which is one of a whole series of Amendments every one of which reveals to the House the ignominious capitulation which the Government have made to the peremptory demands and threats coming from another place. It has been said more than once from these Benches that undoubtedly the first preoccupation of the other House was to wreck this Bill, but,

if that could not be done, then to make the work of the Commission the laughing stock of this country. The Amendments that this House has considered this evening present a pitiable spectacle, both of the attitude of this Government and of the noble Lords who have compelled us to consider these demands at this time of night.<br/>
Let us realise how meticulous the other House has been in its attack upon all the details of this Bill. According to this last Amendment, if a piece of land has on it a spring of water that might be of the least public utility or use to an individual, and if in the working of the colliery that water dried up, the Commission would have to pay compensation even for that. It is no good the hon. and gallant Gentleman telling us that in this Amendment we are protecting the Commission. Figures have come from these Benches as to the large number of collieries that have closed down even in South Wales&#x2014;nearly 250 in a very few years&#x2014;and most of them have filed their petition. Then what is the use of tabling an Amendment of this kind, saying that the Commission can transfer its potential liabilities under this Bill to the colliery companies? We know of a number of bankruptcies that have been deliberately and fictitiously staged in order that certain individuals might shed themselves of legal responsibilities that they had assumed. The Noble Lords know the game as well if not better than this House does. We have seen the victims of vicious practices of that kind. We are protesting against this open, blatant, brazen exploitation of the people. Hon. Members do not like this picture of ignominy and shame. This is the greatest hoax that has been perpetrated in this House for a long time. We have got used to some millions of pounds being doled out&#x2014;</p>

<p>The defence of this Amendment by the Secretary for Mines is very quaint, and I am sure he does not take it seriously himself and will not expect us to do so either. It is a common practice in appointing independent chairmen to select members of the legal profession, and at any rate we have the satisfaction of knowing that lawyers act for both sides, for all sorts of sides, according to the views of the client who is briefing them. Therefore, there is quite a good case for the appointment, if possible, of people with legal experience to positions where independent judicial judgment is required, but it seems to me that it is a new

doctrine to assume that this kind of judicial independence will be secured equally by the appointment of a person who has had experience in the management of land or who has had business experience. This Amendment has been inserted in another place obviously for a purpose, and the purpose was not because the Lord Chancellor could not find a competent lawyer to discharge this independent function. That really is nonsense, and the Secretary for Mines must not expect us to take that at all seriously. There is no shortage of competent lawyers to fill the appointment that will be required under this Schedule. What the members of another place wanted was to secure a bias in the direction of the landowner on the part of this Central Valuation Tribunal. If they wanted the typical person who is represented politically by members of their Lordships' House they could not have done much better for themselves than making provision for the appointment of persons who have had experience in the management of land, because 70 or 80 per cent. of them are thoroughly reactionary and conservative in their outlook and therefore good representatives of those who put forward this Amendment in another place. When the Patronage Secretary has finished his customary habit of interrupting we can get on with the business. [<i>Interruption.</i>] It is so, and I am entitled to protest.<br/>
This Amendment was not made for the purpose of preserving the independence of the chairman, but with the object of impairing that independence&#x2014;it was deliberately


done for that purpose. To a less extent, possibly, but to a considerable extent, at any rate, the same observation applies to the proposal that the person appointed shall have business experience. I will give an analogy. Suppose it were a question of determining the qualifications of the chairman of the Industrial Court, to which is referred cases concerning wages, and suppose an Amendment were submitted saying that the selection might be made not only from those experienced in the law but those experienced in the fixing of wages, as officials of trade unions. Nobody could deny that such a person would know a great deal about the relations of employers and employed and the fixing of wages, but precisely because his knowledge and experience had been gained on one side in the industrial battle rather than the other it would be objected that he would have a bias. In the same way we object to this Amendment. It will not extend the field of choice but is calculated to undermine the basis of the independence of the chairman. For these reasons we object to this Amendment, and we must treat with contempt, as no doubt he does himself, the defence made of it by the Secretary for Mines.</p>

<p>Everybody knows that valuations in the mining industry are the most difficult and perhaps the most highly technical form of valuation, and I do not think it is right that the position should be left as the Amendment leaves it. The Bill says that the Chairman shall be a member of the legal profession, and I have no objection to that, but I know that there are persons who are not only trained legally but trained in valuation work, and I think it is highly necessary that the chairman of a valuation board should know something about the technique of valuation. From that point of view I do not think the Amendment helps at all. I am inclined to agree with the speech of the right hon. Member for South Hackney (Mr. H. Morrison), because it has been my experience that gentlemen who have been in the habit of managing land are not altogether, shall I say, up to date in their views on political matters, to say the least of it. I have intervened only to protest that this appointment should not have been kept an entirely legal appointment and should apply to a person of business experience or experience in the

management of land. These questions of valuation are highly technical and involved, and if it is at all possible the Minister should see to it that the chairman of the Valuation Board should be not merely a legal person but one acquainted with the technicalities of the valuation of minerals.</p>

<p>I make no apology for intervening at this late hour, because this Bill affects Scotland arid Scottish interests, and we are entitled to ask the Secretary for Mines or a legal representative of the Government for a further explanation of it. I can speak with particular knowledge of those who, in Scotland, have had something to do with the ownership and management of land. Scottish landlords and those who have had the management of land are, as in England, reactionary individuals who cannot truly represent the nation, and are the type of person that has given rise to the demand for independent chairmen in matters of legislation. They are the reactionary landlords of Scotland.<br/>
I want to know exactly what is meant by this Amendment. For example, the practical intricacies of land management in Scotland are usually carried out by factors; I am sure that the Secretary for Mines will not attempt to tell us that the Lords desire that type of person to be the independent chairman of the Valuation Board. They really mean the landlords of this country, and they are giving them facilities not only to be compensated by the Commission throughout this Bill, but facilities to act as independent chairmen of the valuation boards that will affect to a very great extent conditions in the mining industry.<br/>
With regard to business experience, I was immediately struck by the point&#x2014;although I do not think that their Lordships meant it&#x2014;that we could have, under that qualification, as chairmen of valuation boards, either the Cameron of Lochiel of the Highlands, or Sir Harry Lauder, because of their business experience. The Secretary for Mines should recognise that this provision does not deal with the matter as it should be dealt with. I would rather have the Clause as it stands, providing for the appointment of an independent person, being a member of the legal profession, and definitely restricting the chairmanship


to that particular profession. While the legal profession has many faults, and while there are many black sheep in it who fail to give us proper interpretations of certain Clauses in the Bill, generally speaking, I recognise that the legal profession is an honourable profession. [Hon. Members: "Hear, hear."] I grant that to the legal profession. But would hon. Members say "Hear, hear" if I said that the landlords of this country were an honourable section of the community? Would they say "Hear, hear" if I said that the business people of this country were an honourable section of the community? We might have a Hatry or some person of that description, with great business experience, as chairman of such a Valuation Board.<br/>
If I were the Whip of this party, whipping up the mining Members, I would tell them to carry on this discussion until we had an assurance from the Minister that this whole question would be reconsidered. Undoubtedly this Amendment has been inserted by the other House for the purpose of widening the scope of the chairmanship of the Valuation Board, so that certain interests may be represented. The Secretary for Mines and the President of the Board of Trade know that perfectly well, and, if they could stand up and divest themselves of their party obligations, they would say, "This is a bad Amendment; it is not the kind of Amendment that I as Minister for Mines or President of the Board of Trade would desire." It is an Amendment that restricts the work, the capabilities and the efficiency of these boards, and can bring all kinds of vested interests into the chairmanship of these boards. It should be repudiated by Members on all sides of the House.</p>

<p>One point has not been stressed in favour of leaving the Bill as it is. While I am not prepared to offer the same eulogies as the last speaker with regard to the legal profession, we must admit that at least the legal profession are trained to understand the laws of evidence and to weigh the value of evidence. That gives them their only claim to a position of this kind, and I hope that the Bill will be passed in the form in which it now stands.</p>

Members behind him quite appreciate, that there is only one Board with which we are here concerned, namely, the Central Valuation Board. It has nothing to do with the regional boards. I am not going to discuss what the Board has to do; this is merely a question of who shall be the chairman. As the Bill left us, it was decided that he chairman should be an independent legal person, and in the other House an Amendment was inserted which is merely an alternative. There is nothing to prevent an independent legal chairman being appointed. But, supposing that for some reason a completely suitable legal person could not be found with the full necessary qualifications, as is quite possible&#x2014;an hon. Member opposite said he thought it ought to be a landlord&#x2014;then, since the appointment has to be made very soon after the passing of the Bill, it is desirable that it should be open to appoint someone who is equally independent but is not a legal person. There is no suggestion that:
<q>a person who has had experience in the management of land or with business experience</q>
may not be a legal person. This Board's functions are very narrow. They have to divide the country up into regions and to draw up rules of valuation which, if a further Amendment is accepted, will come up for approval in this House. It is a comparatively small function they have to perform, and it is just in case an independent legal person with just the qualifications required cannot be found, so that the whole work may not be held up, that the Amendment is worded in this way.</p>

<p>This is, if I may say so, the most fatuous explanation I have ever heard. One man is to be appointed. In the City of London there are 2,500 solicitors, apart altogether from barristers. Out of the City of London alone, is it suggested that it would not be possible to find a chairman of the Central Valuation Board? Then there are the other big cities. There are tens of thousands of people available, and nobody will believe the explanation put forward by the Minister. The fact that he has put it forward shows that the real explanation is too disgraceful for him to suggest.</p>

<p>Only a little examination is needed to show how absurd that the Government's case is. Between the Bill leaving this House and coming back with its lordly improvements, somebody has discovered that out of all the lawyers in England there may not be one who is fit to act as chairman of the Central Valuation Board. Therefore, words are proposed which say not that in the event of no lawyer being <i>compos mentis</i> somebody shall be appointed who is <i>compos mentis</i>, but that somebody who has had experience of land management, and will be partial as a judge, shall be appointed.</p>

<p>What sides are there on the Central Valuation Board?</p>

<p>The President solemnly asks what sides there are on the Central Valuation Board. There is somebody who wants to have more than he ought to have, and somebody else who wants to pay less than he ought to pay. The other qualification is business experience. It has been often asked why should a person who spends his whole life preferring his private advantage to the public advantage be considered a suitable person to deal with questions of public advantage. But the matter does not stop there. The independent person who has had experience in the management of land would be very likely to be a person suitable to be recommended by the president of the Chartered Surveyors' Institution.</p>

<p>You must not ask the president of the Chartered Surveyors' Institution. If you want to find
<q>a person who has had experience in the management of land or with business experience,</q>
you ask the Lord Chancellor, and later, when you want to appoint other members of the Board, you are to ask the president of the Chartered Surveyors' Institution. This is to go out to the country as the product of the united wisdom of the House of Lords. Representatives of the Government do not get up and produce a reason for this. They do not produce one because there is not one.</p>

<p>In view of the alteration which is now proposed in the wording of this Clause, is there any person now in mind to be appointed? Those of us who recollect the incident about Sir Ernest Gowers, when he was appointed under the Act of 1930, are entitled to inquire whether there is some person who is now being considered for this post who does not possess the qualification that was requisite when the Bill originally left this House.</p>

I can say that there is no truth whatever in the innuendo of the hon. Gentleman that we are already considering, for some disgraceful reason, the appointment of somebody who otherwise, before this Amendment, could not be appointed.</p>

<p>The only thing I am afraid about in connection with this Amendment is that it will give the other House an opportunity of completely hanging up the whole proceedings. They only have to refuse to approve these draft rules and everything stops. This is a provision by which there has to be a positive resolution of both Houses before the rules can operate. From what we have seen of the other House with regard to this Bill, it seems to me that it is quite wrong that the people who have opposed everything in this Bill should be able to say, "Now we have a simple way of

doing it. We will refuse to approve the rules of the Central Valuation Board," and the complete Bill is finished. I should like to know from the right hon. Gentleman whether he has considered, in view, of the complete lack of control that the Government have over their Lordships' House on matters where their Lordships are interested for themselves and nothing else, and what would happen if their Lordships refused to pass these draft rules by a positive resolution. I should also like to know whether he is satisfied that no such circumstances can arise, because, if not, then this Bill would be finished if such circumstances did arise.</p>

<p>In spite of the mishaps and the slings and arrows of fortune, I still do not despair of a Government majority in another place. A great many people in another place, quite apart from any effect on their own pockets, have felt that this is a question of principle, a principle with which hon. Members opposite may disagree and with which I disagree, but a principle which they hold as strongly as hon. Members and I hold our principles.

This is simply a drafting point. As I think I explained when the Bill was in Committee, this Sub-section deals with payments on account and provides that, if a payment is made on account, the person who gets it is debited with 3 per cent. interest, which is subsequently deducted from the compensation. It was desired to provide that no money should actually pass, because the interest would be taken out of the compensation he gets. It was desired to provide that for Income Tax purposes those payments should be deemed to have been made on the anniversary of the day when payment on account is made, but the paragraph as originally drafted says that interest shall be deemed, for all purposes, including purposes of Income Tax, to be paid on those days. It is only for Income Tax purposes that it is necessary or desired, and the words "for all purposes" might raise questions of complication as between life tenants and remaindermen. For those reasons it is better to restrict it to the purposes for which it was intended. This explanation covers the present Amendment and the following one.</p>

These words arc necessary to make clear what was always intended in this paragraph, namely, that this income, being deducted, and coming off the amount of compensation which subsequently will be obtained, should be entitled to be deducted in the way that interest when paid in the ordinary way is deducted. The necessity for making it clear arises out of a recent decision of

the House of Lords dealing with the somewhat different circumstances of a banking overdraft where interest went on mounting up, and whether it would or would not be paid in the end was doubtful. In view of that decision, it is desirable to make clear what was always the intention of the paragraph. In this case the interest is bound to be paid, in that it will be deducted from the compensation received.</p>

<p>I beg to move, "That this House doth agree with the Lords in the said Amendment."<br/>
This is rather a lengthy Amendment. It arises from certain suggestions and representations made when the Bill was in Committee, and it was then suggested that the provisions of the paragraph&#x2014;paragraph 20 on page 73, as it then was &#x2014;were not sufficiently specific in describing how compensation was to be apportioned as between the life tenant and the remainderman or between mortgagor and mortgagee in cases where those persons with those rights had interests in the compensation sums. This Amendment deals with both cases where the interest vesting in the Commission is subject to a settlement. Paragraph 2 provides guidance for the trustees, and gives them power to make an apportionment on the lines there laid down, and it also gives power to a beneficiary to apply to the court, if any beneficiary so desires. Subparagraph (3) deals with the case of mortgage. Sub-paragraph (4) deals with the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, and


really reproduces the provisions applicable to them as they were in the original Bill. Sub-paragraph (5) is an investment Clause giving fairly wide powers of investment in respect of compensation money. It is not unreasonable that there should be a wider latitude than the ordinary latitude given to trustees for investing proceeds of the compensation. Sub-paragraph (6) is a general provision to provide for any cases which may not be specifically covered otherwise.</p>

<p>I beg to move: "That this House doth disagree with the Lords in the said Amendment."<br/>
There is some difference as to what this Amendment actually means. I think that perhaps it is my fault, my obstinacy. I am advised that its actual meaning is that the Commission shall pay the cost and expense which are incurred by somebody in prosecuting a claim for compensation in respect of damage from subsidence, which is successful. That, on the whole, is the view which my advisers take of it. If that is the meaning of the Amendment, I can say that it is unnecessary, because I am also advised that, anyhow, the compensation awarded will include the proper cost of prosecuting the claim. I, perhaps with some temerity, have been trying to differ from that, and to think that the words "to which he may be entitled" extend this rather further, and would in fact compel the Commission to pay the costs and expenses even if the claim to compensation was unsuccessful. That is clearly something which no one could contemplate. Whichever meaning is to be attributed to this particular Amendment,

it need not, I think, worry us very much, because the noble Lord who moved it in another place made it quite clear during the course of his speech that he meant something quite different from either of these things.</p>

<p>Clearly, this House ought not to shelter itself merely behind some misunderstanding in drafting, but, if there is a serious grievance behind the actual intention of the Amendment, we ought to be prepared to deal with it. The meaning of the Amendment as explained by the noble Lord was that at present, when the landlord is also the mineral owner, he is probably employing a land agent who looks after the surface and a mineral agent who looks after the working of the coal. The mineral agent is able to tell the land agent of the stages which are being worked or which have been reached in the working of coal, putting the land agent, therefore, on his guard as to the possibilities of subsidences on the surface. Now it is claimed that, when the coal is severed from the land and taken over by the Commission, there will no longer be a mineral agent employed by the landowner, but only a land agent, who will be unable himself to judge when any of the workings are likely to be dangerous to the land above; and that there will have to be employed what was described, I think, as a watchman to keep a watch on the surface in case of any sign of subsidence. It was further argued that it was only right that the Commission should be called upon to pay these expenses.</p>

<p>Further on the point of Order. This question was raised because of a Ruling given yesterday&#x2014;when you, Sir, were not in the Chair&#x2014;by your Deputy, against an hon.

<p>If I may now continue with my paraphrase of paraphrases, I should like to take up the threads of the rather complicated argument I had embarked on, though perhaps it may not be easy. I come now to the argument which I have heard advanced in favour of a claim of this kind. It is in effect that the cost of this man, who has been referred to as a watchman, would be taken into account in these management costs which were deducted before arriving at the &#x00A3;4,430,000 on which finally the price was decided. With regard to the argument as to the watchman, I would remind hon. Members that there are a great many occasions" after all, when the land is separated from the coal, and I should be prepared to wager, if it were in Order to do such a thing, that in not one single instance has it ever been known for the owner of the surface to employ specially a man to do a job of that kind. If he wants a man to watch to see if there is any danger of subsidence, he tells his landlord to watch it, and does not do anything more.<br/>
With regard to the question whether this is a cost which was included in the costs which had been deducted, hon. Members will recollect that the cost deducted was based upon the allowance made in respect of Income Tax. I have made inquiries from the appropriate quarter, and am informed that, as for the purpose of Income Tax these claims for compensation are treated as capital returns and not as income, and, therefore, do not come into the Income Tax returns at all; so that any costs incurred in prosecuting these claims would not be allowed to be set off in the Income Tax return. For these reasons I ask the House to disagree with the Lords Amendment.</p>

As the Bill left us, it said that the arbitrator should be selected by the Board of Trade. During our debates the hon. and learned Member for Ashford (Mr. Spens) was very anxious that the person who should nominate this arbitrator should be the President of the Law Society. We did not consider that would be suitable, and the other House has sent down, in this Amendment, the suggestion that the Lord Chancellor should be the person who appoints the arbitrator. I see no reason why that should be resisted in this case.</p>

<p>This is not a very important point, perhaps, but I do not see any reason why we should give way to the House of Lords in regard to it. It is a matter of the settlement of the standard amount of rent. It is not a question of law, but of valuation, and surely the Board of Trade, who are the customary people to deal with mining matters in this country are the more suitable body to name the arbitrator to settle the standard amount of rent. The Lord Chancellor, poor fellow, as we have heard, cannot find one by going to the Central Valuation Board. It is hard luck to put on him the onus of finding an arbitrator. The Board of Trade and the Secretary for Mines would far better be able than the Lord Chancellor to select a suitable person for this purpose. It is not as if there were any legal point to be settled, and I suggest that under this Clause, as the hon and learned Member for Ashford (Mr. Spens) says he agrees with me&#x2014;</p>

This Amendment is simply the necessary paragraph to enable the provision of that Section to be applied to the problem when it arises under the consolidation scheme, which under the old

We are now on that part of the Bill which deals with committees of investigation which investigate complaints. It was considered in another place that it might be desirable to increase, possibly in some areas&#x2014;not in all areas&#x2014;the committees of investigation. At present it is laid down that there should be one for every district. Hon. Members know that the Midlands is a very large district and there might be several complaints.

The House may recollect that under the Act of 1930, Section 5, the committee of investigation may require such returns and accounts as they think relevant to the investigation. The committee can call upon the colliery interests for their accounts and figures. On the other hand, they have no power to ask those who complain to give the figures which might justify, in the view of the committee, their case. In certain cases we have had an expression of grievance on the part of the coal side that they have to give all this information to the committee, and that the people who complain are not asked questions. I think, on the whole, it is a reasonable proposition.</p>

<p>This seems to me a very dangerous Amendment. I can understand the point which the hon. Member made, but, unfortunately, the words of this Amendment are very wide, and are likely gravely to embarrass a complainant. The words do not say that they are to be his


returns and accounts. Suppose he makes a complaint regarding a particular quality or class of coal, he may be asked for details of that complaint by the committee, who may say that unless he furnishes these proposals, they will not go on with the complaint. That may put the complainant in the difficult position of being refused a hearing unless he complies with the request of the committee to furnish accounts and other information, which he might be wholly unable to obtain. This is a very complicated matter, and he may not be able to give particulars until after discovery, and the committee may say that they will not continue with the investigation until after they obtained particulars which might, in fact, defeat the complaint. It would be possible to attain the object by using other words, but the words used here are far too wide to cover the point which the hon. Member has in mind. The danger is that the complainant will be asked to give information as regards his complaint which he will not be able to do, and then the committee will be able to say that,</p>

<p>I am sorry to disagree with the hon. and learned Gentleman in this matter. I think the committees of investigation exist to be a protection to the consumer, and under the Bill the chairman is a legal chairman, and you have on the committee representatives of both sides of the industry. The whole function is to protect the complainant, and it seems to me rather farfetched that the committee should have the duty to refuse to hear a case by demanding information which <i>exhypothesi</i> the complainant could not provide.</p>

<p>Lords Amendment: In page 90, line 44, at the end, insert:
<q>or where the appointment is of the chairman of a district committee of investigation for a district in Scotland, after consultation with the Lord Advocate.</q></p>

<p>I beg to move, "That this House doth agree with the Lords in the said Amendment."<br/>
This is really formal. The reason is that the chairman is appointed after consultation with the Lord Chancellor, and it appears in the case of Scotland more proper that the Lord Advocate should be consulted.</p>

<p>I should like to warn the hon. and gallant Gentleman that this question is one on which it would delight me very much to make a speech for about an hour and a half on the subject of Scottish self-government. However, I will spare hon. Members that calamity. I am glad that in another place they recognize the right and wisdom of the Scottish people and the Scottish representatives to elect their own particular chairmen of district committees, and as this will probably be the last word I shall speak on this Bill, may I say that</p>

<p>I feel this is a decided improvement. I know that the chief difficulties of the Commission and these committees will be the lack of finance, because of the operation of the Bill as coming from another place, and I believe that what has happened in the past can happen in the future. If in order to save this Bill the Lord Advocate and his appointee have to put their heads together, they will establish, perhaps, a flag day in Scotland to raise the finance to save the Bill from the fate that the other place and the Government have brought upon it.</p>

<p>I understand there is something rather mystic about the hour of half-past one as far as the Bill is concerned, and I therefore propose, if I may, to detain the House until that time arrives. This Amendment is putting into the hands of the Lord Advocate the appointment of the chairman of a district committee of investigation for a district in Scotland. The similar appointment in Great Britain is to be made by the Lord Chancellor, and, of course, the position of the Lord Chancellor with regard to this country and the Lord Advocate as regards Scotland are very different positions. And one rather wonders why the appointment in Scotland


is not given to someone in a position more equal to that of the Lord Chancellor in this country. On other occasions in the course of the Bill where an appointment has been made by the Lord Chancellor in this country, it has been made by the Senior Judge of the Court of Session in Scotland, and one would have thought that a more true analogy of the position of the Lord Chancellor as head of the judiciary in Great Britain. The Lord Advocate, although he occupies a very high office is only comparable with the Attorney-General.<br/>
I cannot imagine anybody suggesting that the Attorney-General should appoint the chairman of a district committee under this Bill, and I am quite sure that if anybody had, it would have been at once said by those on the other side, "How dangerous if you had a Labour Attorney-General. Think of the terrible people he must appoint, so protect yourselves for someone who must be appointed if Labour were elevated to office." The same argument would apply as regards the Lord Advocate, because he would be in much the same position as the Attorney-General. Those are the observations which I desire to lay before the House on this very important subject as a constitutional problem, but we feel that on the whole it will perhaps be satisfactory to save the House, at the hour we have now reached, for dividing.</p>
