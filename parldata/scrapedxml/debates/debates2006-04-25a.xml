	<p pid="a.483.0/1">In its statement of <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-29">29 March</phrase> the Security Council set out what Iran must do to meet the requirements of the board of governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency, including the suspension of all enrichment, reprocessing and related activities. However, on <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-11">11 April</phrase> President Ahmadinejad of Iran announced that Iran had enriched uranium and would expand its centrifuge cascades. The IAEA director general will report again in a couple of days, on <phrase class="date" code="">28 April</phrase>, and the Security Council will then consider the way ahead.</p>
	<p pid="a.483.0/2">The issue is not whether Iran has a right to the use of civil nuclear power&mdash;it does&mdash;but whether it is misusing its nuclear programme to create a nuclear weapons capability, to which it has no right whatever. Iran needs to understand that its increasingly belligerent stance serves only to isolate it further and to stiffen the resolve of the international community. Statements like that of President Ahmadinejad yesterday describing the freely elected and democratic Government of Israel as a &quot;fake regime&quot; which</p>
	<p pid="a.483.0/3" class="indent">&quot;cannot logically continue to live&quot;</p>

	<p pid="a.484.0/1">We have not made a final decision about the demands that we make to Russia. It is clear that Russia has co-operated well, particularly recently, in arriving at agreed positions in respect of Iran, after many months of abstaining on resolutions in the board of governors. At the crucial board of governors meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-04">4 February</phrase>, Russia and China voted to report the matter to the Security Council. They also supported the presidency's statement in the Security Council on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-29">29 March</phrase>. If we are to continue with effective pressure on Iran, we must have Russia and China with us, but it must be tough pressure as well. So far we are achieving that.</p>

	<p pid="a.485.4/1">No one is talking about that. My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister made it clear in this House last Wednesday that, in relation to military options, including nuclear weapons,</p>
	<p pid="a.485.4/2" class="indent">&quot;nobody is talking about these things.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-19">19 April 2006</phrase>; Vol. 445, c. 118.]</p>
	<p pid="a.485.4/3">That is what he told this House and that is the truth. We are seeking to resolve this matter by diplomatic means, including&mdash;yes, maybe&mdash;the pressure of sanctions under article 41. No purpose is served by trying to stir up differences within the international community where none, in practice, exists. Every member of the permanent five of the Security Council and the board of governors of the IAEA is committed to the path that France, Germany and the United Kingdom originally set out on three years ago and on which we have now been joined very actively by the other permanent members of the Security Council.</p>
	<p pid="a.485.4/4">The hon. Gentleman asked about security guarantees. There were proposals for helping Iran with a greater sense of security in the document that the E3 put forward to the Iranians in early August last year. Tragically, President Ahmadinejad decided to reject that document even before he had seen it, which rather puts a bit of iron into the soul when it comes to dealing with the Iranians. No one is threatening Iran. No other country in the world is threatening to wipe Iran off the face of the map, but Iran has chosen to challenge the fundamental security of Israel. If Iran came to the table and complied with its obligations under the non-proliferation treaty, then normalisation of relations in respect of trade, culture, travel and everything else, including security, could quickly be agreed, but Iran shows no sign of wanting to go down that path just at the moment.</p>

	<p pid="a.487.0/1">On the first point, I have just used the Prime Minister's language to the House last week when he was asked about military options, &quot;including nuclear weapons&quot;, and he said that</p>
	<p pid="a.487.0/2" class="indent">&quot;nobody is talking about these things&quot;.&mdash;[<i>Official Report,</i> <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-19">19 April 2006</phrase>; Vol. 445, c. 118.]</p>
	<p pid="a.487.0/3">We all know the formal position of the United States on the matter, but it has fully backed the position of the United Kingdom, the other members of the E3 and Russia and China in trying to resolve the problem by peaceful and diplomatic means.</p>
	<p pid="a.487.0/4">The right hon. Gentleman asked whether I was confident that the process would work. I believe that it is the best available process to achieve a satisfactory solution to a difficult problem. I cannot say with certainty what will happen&mdash;none of us can&mdash;but I defy any hon. Member to offer a better route. However, it is clear that the matter will be resolved only if the international community can show strength through unity and determination. That requires constant consultation, especially with Russia and China, which, early on, were reluctant about our stance but have increasingly toughened their position and joined us.</p>

	<p pid="a.489.4/1">May I say how grateful I am to my hon. Friend, and to other colleagues on both sides of the House, for the welcome that they gave the Secretary of State? Inevitably, some of the coverage dealt with the demonstrations, which simply illustrates that this, like America, is a free country. The Secretary of State kept saying that she was fully able to take those things in her stride. She was also able to see Liverpool and the centre of the world, Blackburn&mdash;<i>[Laughter.]</i> I take that as approbation, Mr. Speaker. She was able to see those places in all their glory. We talked about many things, including the connections between Liverpool and the southern states of the United States, from which she comes. Of course, we also talked about Hamas. A further meeting of the Quartet will take place on <phrase class="date" code="">9 May</phrase> to discuss further the stance that we should take to get Hamas to understand that, if it accepts the democratic principle, it must abide by the responsibilities that go with it. In this case, those include the three principles of the recognition of the reality of Israel, acceptance of the international agreements entered into by the Palestinian Authority in the past and an end to all violence, which includes&mdash;self-evidently&mdash;plotting the assassinations of the Jordanian royal family.</p>

	<p pid="a.499.3/1">On a completely different point of order, Mr. Speaker. Last Thursday, as I am sure you are aware, the shadow Leader of the House said that the Prime Minister misled the House. It transpires that the Prime Minister was absolutely right when he said that</p>

	<p pid="a.499.3/3">The point on which I seek your guidance, Mr. Speaker, is that in the past you were robust when Members used the phrase &quot;misled the House&quot;.

	<p pid="a.516.1/1">I think that the hon. Gentleman is mistaken. Certainly the housing associations in my part of the country&mdash;including Banbury Homes, which is part of Shaftesbury Housing, and Charter Community Housing&mdash;have good tenant involvement. Only the other day, they organised an open advice day for local tenants at the Spiceball centre in Banbury, working with other agencies, including the district council, to explain such matters as housing benefit. I thought that that was a very good initiative, and that I believe tenants of both Banbury Homes and Charter Community Housing are very satisfied with their landlords. After all, the tenants had to vote, by a majority, for the large-scale voluntary transfers.</p>
	<p pid="a.516.1/2">What concerns me is where the new social housing is to come from. The Housing Corporation is concerned about its members, committees, sub-committees and employees. My concern is this. When money is allocated through the regional housing boards, designated growth areas such as Milton Keynes and the Thames Gateway do extremely well, but shire districts are literally white on the map: they receive no money from the Housing Corporation. The Minister suggested that Banbury Homes and Charter Community Housing should apply to the regional housing boards, but the trouble is that those associations are below the size of those that the Housing Corporation appears to be funding. The Minister looks quizzical, but the corporation seems to have an unwritten policy of funding only certain areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.516.1/3"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1858" name="Michael Gove">My hon. Friend the Member for Surrey Heath (Michael Gove)</phrase> rightly referred to new development. Banbury and Bicester, in my constituency, are probably two of the fastest-growing towns in the country, and a great deal of new development is going ahead. The difficulty lies in the definition of affordable housing. Developers have sold a proportion of their housing at below market value for the first time, so for the first time it is affordable housing because someone buys it at below market value; but it is not affordable housing thereafter. We are not seeing new social housing being introduced as part of the planning process for new development.</p>
	<p pid="a.516.1/4">Again, the Minister looks quizzical. Let me challenge her, as Minister for Housing and Planning. We have a huge housing development, which she has just decided not to call in, at Bankside/Bodicote. I shall be interested to see how much new social housing comes to that development as a consequence of the planning system. I suspect that very little will do so. As a result of all that, working families on low incomes with children are finding it extremely difficult to gain access to secure housing.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-04-25a.517.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1915" speakername="Peter Bone" colnum="517"  time="016:37:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060425/debtext/60425-10.htm#60425-10_spnew2">
	<p pid="a.517.1/1">I begin by drawing the House's attention to my entry in the Register of Members' Interests, and to the fact that I am an unremunerated member of Rockingham Forest housing association. Housing associations play an extremely important role in our society. They provide housing for some of the most vulnerable people, and have grown in importance year by year. The Housing Corporation, which is the Government's governing body of registered social landlords and housing associations, regulates and funds RSLs.</p>
	<p pid="a.517.1/2">Housing associations were created some 42 years ago, in 1964. Since that time, the Housing Corporation has funded almost 1 million new homes, and it has helped thousands of homeless people and others living in poor housing conditions. It regulates some 2,000 housing associations across the country, which, in turn, manage more than 2 million homes. It also administers the national affordable housing programme to build and renovate homes, in which it will have invested &pound;3.3 billion by the time it ends. By no means, therefore, can the Housing Corporation and housing associations be considered insignificant; they play a crucial role in our society.</p>
	<p pid="a.517.1/3">The Government claim that the Bill merely tidies what everyone already accepts as the current situation, but I have a number of concerns. Indeed, I am not entirely sure that I could support the Bill if it were pushed to a vote tonight. The Housing Act 1964 gives no indication whatsoever that board members should be allowed to delegate their responsibilities in respect of disposals to sub-committees and officers. All the work relating to disposals is performed by housing associations. None of it is done by the Housing Corporation, which simply rubber-stamps applications from housing associations, of which there are only some 100 a year.</p>
	<p pid="a.517.1/4">The Housing Corporation's board of directors comprises 15 members, who take home more than &pound;250,000 a year, plus pensions. Board members are required to work five days a month, on average&mdash;which is at least one day a week&mdash;and the chairman, who is paid more than &pound;50,000 a year, is asked to work two days a week.</p>
	<p pid="a.517.1/5">The 1964 Act requires the board to approve disposals; why are we being asked to change that arrangement through retrospective legislation? Anyone who looked at the original Act would conclude that the board must consider disposals. The directors are not underpaid and it is not as though they do not have the time to do the job. Although they meet only once a week, the board meetings are, I understand, very short. The Housing Corporation is not doing any of the work and has never refused a disposal from a housing association, so perhaps Parliament was correct originally and we should not pass retrospective legislation when there is no indication that Parliament wanted that delegation.</p>
	<p pid="a.517.1/6">I understand the concerns that have been expressed, especially by lawyers, about charges, which are regarded as disposals under the Act, but section 9 of the 1964 Act provides for a general consent. The general waiver, as proposed only on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-17">17 March</phrase> by the Housing Corporation, would remove the need for retrospective legislation. That is not new, because that general consent has been used in the past. I am therefore very concerned about whether we need retrospective legislation, and I hope that the Committee will consider that issue in detail.</p>
	<p pid="a.517.1/7">I had expected that the Government would suggest that the omission was just a drafting error and that this was an ultra vires matter that should have been in the original Bill. I could understand that, because since I have been an MP I have seen numerous examples of bad drafting, which have to be corrected. I sit on the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments and each week we have four, five or six statutory instruments that have defective drafting and have to go back to be changed.</p>

	<p pid="a.519.2/1">If the hon. Gentleman is suggesting that if we had longer time to scrutinise the Bill we would not pick up such errors, I disagree. We should have more time to debate Bills and make proper decisions.</p>
	<p pid="a.519.2/2">Another question is whether the House should debate unnecessary Bills. All Bills that come before us should be relevant and take all necessary objectives into account, but consideration of this Bill should be postponed. The fear of retrospective problems could be removed by the method of general consent, and in the future it will be quite acceptable for the board of directors to meet once a month to decide the matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.519.2/3">Why is this Bill being brought forward now? On <phrase class="date" code="">19 May</phrase>, the consultation on the proposal to merge the Housing Corporation and English Partnerships will end. Given that that process is so near to conclusion, why did the Government not wait until the summer, when they could have brought before the House a full Bill covering all the relevant issues?</p>
	<p pid="a.519.2/4">What are we talking about with this Bill? A picture has been built up that the poor, underpaid directors of the Housing Corporation have a massive amount of work, but it seems to me that they have to deal with only 100 bits of paper a year. Anyway, they already meet five times a month, on average. I do not think that there is much of a problem, and in any case these matters can be handled retrospectively.</p>
	<p pid="a.519.2/5">However, another question arises: why on earth does the Housing Corporation bother to approve disposals? It never rejects any, and all the work is done by the housing associations. The Bill would do better to remove the necessity for the Housing Corporation to approve individual disposals, while retaining its power to regulate housing associations.</p>
	<p pid="a.519.2/6">This may be the wrong Bill at the wrong time, and I hope that substantial numbers of improving amendments are tabled in Committee. The Bill could be changed to take account of the performance and effectiveness of housing associations. For example, an index that has just been published shows that seven of the 10 most efficient housing associations deal with fewer than 1,000 properties. I have to declare an interest, in that Rockingham Forest is the 18th most efficient housing association in the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.519.2/7">I fear that we may be wasting time today debating a Bill whose introduction could have been deferred, and whose contents could have been presented in a better format. I hope that the Bill will be looked at carefully in Committee.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-04-25a.528.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1610" speakername="Greg Hands" colnum="528"  time="017:10:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060425/debtext/60425-13.htm#60425-13_spnew1">
	<p pid="a.528.1/1">The hon. Lady makes a good and valid point, but my experience in Hammersmith and Fulham does not bear out her argument about the number of people who complain about their RSL compared with the number who make an approach about a private landlord.</p>
	<p pid="a.528.1/2">The Bill should include measures to improve accountability, not just in the Housing Corporation but in local housing associations. Tenant participation is still low in many RSLs. Tenants associations are packed with placemen who agree with the political direction of the borough in question, or are filled with people deemed politically acceptable to the individuals in charge. We need to strengthen tenants' rights and their participation in housing associations. Housing association tenants are the poor cousins when it comes to tenant power, and that must change.</p>
	<p pid="a.528.1/3">Another matter over which tenants lack control, and which may be affected by the Bill, is the speed of escalating rent rises, especially in London. It is shame that none of the measures in the Bill will do anything to control housing association rent rises under Labour or make them easier to challenge. The Minister may guffaw, but I am about to challenge him by citing one of his allies. The central Government formula introduced by Labour in 2001 allows housing associations to raise rents according to a formula of the retail price index plus 0.5 per cent plus &pound;2 a week&mdash;we were told that that was &quot;rent restructuring&quot;. In practice, most housing associations have levied the maximum allowable annual increase. The Minister does not have to take my word for it&mdash;I urge him to listen to the words of my Labour predecessor in Hammersmith and Fulham, who told the House on <phrase class="date" code="2001-12-05">5 December 2001</phrase> at column 134WH:</p>
	<p pid="a.528.1/4" class="indent">&quot;In my borough, the Government proposals will lead to higher rent increases in the next 10 years than in the past decade&mdash;I remind my hon. Friend that the majority of that was spent under a Conservative Administration&mdash;despite the fact that we have proved that London rent increases have been well above average during that time. The average rent increase in Hammersmith and Fulham over the past 10 years was 23.2 per cent., compared with the projection based on the current proposals&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.528.1/5">those proposals were for rent restructuring&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.528.1/6" class="indent">&quot;of 29.5 per cent. over the next decade.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.528.1/7">He went on to say:</p>
	<p pid="a.528.1/8" class="indent">&quot;That will apply particularly to one and two-&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report, Westminster Hall</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2001-12-05">5 December 2001</phrase>; Vol. 376, c. 133&ndash;4 WH.]</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-04-25a.534.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1765" speakername="Jim Fitzpatrick" colnum="534"  time="017:35:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060425/debtext/60425-15.htm#60425-15_spnew1">
	<p pid="a.534.1/1">I think that I shall disappoint the hon. Gentleman when I say no. I know that several of his colleagues asked why the Bill was not broader and why other items were not included. The measure deals with a specific problem, which was believed to be urgent and pressing, and it was therefore appropriate to tackle it as expeditiously as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.534.1/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1487" name="Tom Brake">The hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Tom Brake)</phrase> asked on behalf the Liberal Democrats whether other non-departmental public bodies were caught in the same dilemma as the Housing Corporation. We have studied the situation, and we are not aware of any other bodies for which such retrospective legislation is required. As my hon. Friend the Minister for Housing and Planning said earlier, other bodies of a similar nature to the Housing Corporation already have, or subsequently had, a power of delegation. We perceive the Housing Corporation's situation to be a specific anomaly.</p>
	<p pid="a.534.1/3">The hon. Gentleman also asked about the impact of rejecting the Bill, which is a consideration that has tasked those who have had a chance to consider it in depth. To reject the Bill would be to cast doubt on the validity of several classes of statutory decision already taken by the Housing Corporation, most notably the consent to dispose of land under section 9 of the Housing Act 1996. Lenders have expressed considerable concern about the lack of certainty over such decisions, and they could decide to take remedial action if the situation persisted, including re-pricing loans, preventing the drawing down of existing funds, or not taking forward new business. Clearly, that would have serious consequences, such as damaging the financial viability of registered social landlords or preventing new developments from going ahead. The Bill is designed to ensure a continued flow of private finance to the RSL sector, and to ensure that RSLs are financially viable and that tenants are protected.</p>
	<p pid="a.534.1/4"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1915" name="Peter Bone">The hon. Member for Wellingborough (Mr. Bone)</phrase> asked about general consents given under section 9 of the Housing Act 1996. Our view is that section 9 deals only with general consents for the disposal of land. There are also uncertainties about other matters, however, including the registration of RSLs and the consent to rule changes of RSLs. We need to resolve all those issues, not just those relating to section 9, which is why we did not think that it was an appropriate vehicle for dealing with this matter. The hon. Member for Surrey Heath specifically mentioned that point.</p>
	<p pid="a.534.1/5">The hon. Member for Wellingborough also asked about the original legislation, suggesting that the board make these decisions itself, as well as about the pay of the Housing Corporation's directors. The directors' pay is in line with that of other bodies of this nature, including English Partnerships. When the Housing Corporation was established, its role and functions were very different. Today, it makes such a large number of statutory decisions that it has become administratively inefficient, and it would be a bad use of the board's time for it to take every statutory decision required of it in modern times. When the Housing Corporation was set up, powers of delegation were more readily implied. There was no intention in the Housing Act 1964 that the board should spend all its time on what could be low-level&mdash;albeit statutory&mdash;decisions, and the Housing Corporation now makes thousands of decisions every year.</p>
	<p pid="a.534.1/6">The hon. Gentleman also asked about ensuring that we had adequate time to debate this issue. We do have more time now, should he wish to catch the Speaker's eye, although I do not think that that is necessarily the case. We have clearly had adequate time to deal with this matter today, and I am confident that the usual channels will ensure, as they always do, that we have a decent number of sittings in which to scrutinise the Bill in Committee.</p>
	<p pid="a.534.1/7"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1382" name="Tony Baldry">The hon. Member for Banbury (Tony Baldry)</phrase> raised serious questions about his own patch. They related to transfers, of which there have been three from Cherwell district council since 1995. I have to say to him that there has been a 36 per cent. increase in regional housing funding between 2004 and the allocations up to 2008. He raised serious concerns about the success of the negotiations between the local authority and the developers, and about the lack of adequate provision in respect of new developments. If I may be so bold, I should like to suggest that, were the officers of his local authority to seek assistance from the officials at the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, we would be very happy to have a dialogue with them to ensure that they are well prepared to get the best possible deal on future developments. If the hon. Gentleman wished to write to my hon. Friend the Minister for Housing and Planning about this, I am sure that she would be only too happy to deal with the points that he has raised in more depth, although they were perhaps slightly outside the scope of the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.534.1/8"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1917" name="Grant Shapps">The hon. Member for Welwyn Hatfield (Grant Shapps)</phrase> asked about delegation to members, sub-committees and employees, and whether that was too broad a power. We are advised that that is a typical power of delegation for a body of this nature, and for other organisations and public bodies such as the Commission for Social Care Inspection, the Commission for Healthcare Audit and Inspection and the Audit Commission itself. Such powers are necessary for the Housing Corporation to operate efficiently and effectively, and are similar to those for similar organisations.</p>
