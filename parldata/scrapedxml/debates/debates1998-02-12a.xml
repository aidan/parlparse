<p>Since last summer, four Asian countries have agreed International Monetary Fund programmes under the IMF' s emergency financing mechanism, all with United Kingdom support. They are the Philippines, Thailand, Indonesia and Korea. Britain is also one of 13 bilateral contributors to Korea, with a potential contribution of &#x0024;1.25 billion; no contribution has yet been disbursed.

<p>I am sure that the Chancellor of the Exchequer is aware of the terrible consequences for the poorest people in that region of last year's collapse of the financial institutions, of the terrifying poverty that many people there are facing and of the expulsion of many migrant workers. Malaysia, for example, is expelling almost 1 million people, and 20 million people in Indonesia are trying to survive on less than &#x0024;1 a day. Will he assure the House that, in all the considerations of the IMF package, there will be an attempt to stop countries throwing migrant workers out, into even greater poverty in the countries that they have come from, and that the money will be used to support the poorest people in every one of those countries&#x2014;rather than to bail out the financial institutions that got those countries into a mess in the first place, often decamping with large profits to safer havens elsewhere?</p>

<p>I can tell my hon. Friend two things. First, we are concerned about the social difficulties that have been caused by the problems in those countries. It is important that there is openness in the fiscal policies pursued by those countries. I am glad to say that some of the expensive programmes being pursued by some of the Governments have been cancelled. Secondly, we are following action in the area by the World bank, which is disbursing &#x0024;16 billion. I shall meet the World bank governor soon to discuss those

issues. We are as concerned as he is that the social difficulties caused by the rescue programmes are minimised as much as possible.</p>

<p>Does the Chancellor of the Exchequer agree with his friends in the Trades Union Congress that unemployment will start to rise before the end of this year, and that that has little to do with the crisis in Asia but is primarily to do with his policies of high interest rates, an excessive exchange rate and over-tight fiscal policy? Will he give the House an assurance that he will not further tighten taxation policies in the Budget?</p>

<p>The right hon. Gentleman is stretching his question far beyond the issue of what the Government are doing on the IMF. However, I shall answer him directly. He is saying, first, that fiscal policy is too tight. A few months ago, he was saying that it was too lax. The Conservative party had better make up its mind where it stands on the issues. Is it in favour of lower interest rates, the same interest rates or higher interest rates? Is it in favour of higher public spending or lower public spending? The Conservative party really must make up its mind on those issues.</p>

<p>Is the Chancellor aware of the widespread concern that the IMF, the World bank and, in future, the multilateral agreement on investment will be giving advice to developing countries that is more in the interests of the multilateral companies that might wish to invest in those countries than in the interests of the countries themselves? Will he use his influence to support the new direction, which we begin to see in the World bank, of considering not only openness to world financial markets but the social impact of changes?</p>

<p>Yes, on the last point, we shall follow the social reform policies that are being examined by the World bank. Three issues arise from what has been happening in the Asian countries. First, there is a desperate need for banking reform in those countries to avoid the exposures that caused so many problems in the past few months. Secondly, there is a desperate need for openness in monetary and fiscal policy so that people know exactly where they stand. Some of the recent events could have been avoided had the IMF adopted a code of monetary and fiscal policy, as we have suggested. Thirdly, the IMF will have to look at its own practices and the lessons to be learnt. The G7 and the meeting of the Association of South-East Asian Nations in London will provide a chance to examine all the issues. The lessons will have to be learnt.</p>

<p>There have been preliminary discussions in ECOFIN about aspects of tax harmonisation. The Government's view is that direct taxation is primarily a matter for national Governments. Decisions on European

<p>In the course of the discussions, will my right hon.

<p>I am not sure whether the discussions to which I referred will have a direct bearing on the matters that my hon. Friend raises but, as he knows, the North sea oil industry is of immense importance to the United Kingdom, particularly the north-east of England and the north-east of Scotland. The ECOFIN discussions are geared primarily at establishing a code of conduct on business taxation so that Britain and British businesses are not exposed to unfair competition by action in other parts of Europe.</p>

<p>Without arguing for uniform tax rates, will the Minister bear in mind the distorting effect of wide differences between tax rates on businesses and the economy?

<p>As the right hon. Gentleman knows, in the Budget and in the pre-Budget report, my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced a major reduction in corporation tax, which will be beneficial to the United Kingdom. That is an example of the fair competition that we want to enhance. The code of conduct is geared to stopping unfair competition, whereby member states may be tempted to shelter some niche market in an unfair way. However, I am sure that the right hon. Gentleman will agree that the measures announced by my right hon. Friend last year, which mean that we have one of the lowest corporation tax rates of any of our major competitors anywhere in the world, will be immensely beneficial to the United Kingdom, in respect of investment from here and inward investment.</p>

<p>Yes, indeed; my hon. Friend is right. We inherited a situation in which nearly 400,000 adult men and women had been unemployed for more than a year and nearly 250,000 had been unemployed for more than two years. Whereas the long-term unemployed make up only 10 per cent. of the unemployed in the United States, they make up nearly 40 per cent. in Britain. That is why, in addition to giving every young person the chance of a job or training from April in our nationwide strategy for the new deal, from July we shall be offering the &#x00A3;75-a-week subsidy to employers to take on men and women who have been unemployed for more than two years. We shall also announce soon other measures to help the long-term unemployed. I believe that that is right, for both adults and the young.</p>

<p>I welcome the &#x00A3;300 million that is to be spent on child care, which represents the first peacetime Government commitment to a comprehensive child care policy. Will my right hon. Friend consider using receipts from the windfall levy to fund pre-school provision as well, as lack of access to that is emerging as one of the barriers for mothers who want to work?</p>

<p>My hon. Friend is absolutely right. One of the scandals that we inherited was the absence of a national child care strategy. There are three elements to our strategy. First, we must make child care accessible, which is why the windfall tax, along with funds from the new opportunities lottery fund, is contributing to an increase in the number of child care places. We believe that there can be 30,000 after-school clubs and a million places after five years, and we are considering other ways in which to increase the number of places.<br/>
Secondly, the windfall tax is also contributing to the training of child carers. We believe that, over time, 50,000 new child carers can be trained partly using moneys from the windfall levy&#x2014;about &#x00A3;100 million. Thirdly, in making


child care more accessible, we are examining the child care disregard. We have already dedicated &#x00A3;50 million from the windfall tax towards improving child care disregard, so that people can afford child care. We know that we shall have to do more, and we shall do more.</p>

<p>The Inland Revenue press release issued on 22 December invited comments on the proposals to withdraw the cash basis practices available to professional businesses, not just to lawyers.

<p>I am obliged to the Chancellor for that response. It seems grossly unfair to expect banisters to pay income tax on fees delivered when typically they will not be paid for several years&#x2014;many years if they are dealing with Government Departments.

<p>I understand the hon. Gentleman's comments.

The Government pay out &#x00A3;1.7 billion a year in legal fees. Some 80 per cent. of civil legal aid and 90 per cent. of criminal legal aid is paid within the year. The new proposals will allow a period during which they can be implemented with the sensitivity that I am talking about.</p>

<p>Does not the Chancellor's answer show that the proposal was ill thought through? Is that not symptomatic of the Government's taxation policies?

<p>My hon. Friend makes a good point. No one should doubt our intention that all the major pension companies, all the independent financial advisers and others who were involved should clear the problem up as quickly as possible. That is good for the industry and for the public. My hon. Friend may be interested to know that the Personal Investment Authority listens closely to what practitioners have to say, as will the Financial Services Authority, because such advice can be very helpful.

<p>The hon. Gentleman belongs to a party that wants independence in Europe, which would mean Europewide interest rates, never mind just for the United Kingdom. The important point is that, unless we get stability and an end to the boom and bust that has so characterised the British economy, difficulties will continue to face businesses in Scotland and elsewhere. The Government are determined to get inflation out of the system and to create a stable platform on which businesses can build. Unless we take that long-term view, we shall return to the days&#x2014;not so very long ago&#x2014;of high inflation, which destroys businesses and badly affects mortgage payers and savers.

<p>I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his support on those matters. He is right; it is not only a question of the nationalists' policy on taxation, spending and everything else. Nationalists will remember that their parliamentary leader, at the end of the last Parliament, said that an independent Scottish currency would shadow the pound sterling, which makes nonsense of the question asked by the hon.

<p>Stability is essential for the long-term good of this country. As the hon.

<p>In addition to the cut in VAT, other measures relating to the gas levy and the winter fuel payments paid by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor mean that pensioners are between &#x00A3;100 and &#x00A3;130 better off per year. All one can say about the Conservative party is that when in government it managed to introduce 22 tax increases. The only tax reduction was that introduced as a result of the actions of the Labour party in opposition and the Liberal Democrats, who fought against the Conservative Government increasing VAT on fuel to 17.5 per cent. What we need to know this afternoon is whether the Opposition are in favour of increasing it again to 17.5 per cent.&#x2014;yes or no?</p>

<p>I draw the Paymaster General's attention to the fact that, in the controlled spending targets for public sector housing this year, there is a &#x00A3;200 million reduction, which knocks out the &#x00A3;200 million made available under the Local Government Finance (Supplementary Credit Approvals) Act 1997. That is not the release of capital receipts; it means that local authorities will be allowed to borrow money against the value of the capital receipts. Furthermore, the hon.

<p>We welcome the hon. Gentleman's agreement with our policies. The &#x00A3;200 million this year is a separate issue. Why does he not focus on the &#x00A3;700 million that will be genuinely additional next year?

<p>Will my hon. Friend ensure that social housing receives its fair share of resources over the next few years?

<p>I entirely agree with my hon. Friend.

<p>The changes that we have made to the corporation tax regime will greatly help industry. The tax system will no longer be the determining factor as to whether profits are retained or distributed&#x2014;that is properly a matter for managers.

<p>My hon. Friend is correct: we want industry not just to invest in its own development but to co-operate with educational institutions.

<p>The compulsory transfer of resources from women to men is not proposed in any of the detail that has been examined by the Treasury. The existing system of family credit, for which the Conservative party was responsible, has only a 69 per cent. take-up; 645,000

<p>It is a symbol of what the Conservative party was about in government that it took care to deal with the disincentives for people on high tax rates, but left people with high marginal tax rates if they were low paid.

Will he also confirm that the amount raised already is more than the &#x00A3;2.2 billion that the Liberal Democrats would have raised through their 1p in the pound on income tax?</p>

<p>My hon. Friend is correct. Now that we have the money, we can ensure that we spend it wisely. We note that the Opposition agreed with the ends, but would have denied us the means. I am pleased to tell the House that the pathfinder programmes are doing extremely well and the whole country is looking forward to the overall national deal beginning on 4 April.</p>

<p>It is an odd question. I heard it earlier&#x2014;[HON. MEMBERS: "Well, answer."] Exactly, I will. We have not begun the national programme for welfare to work. It does not begin on a national level until 4 April, so how can anybody ask us to show results now? That programme will yield results. The Opposition should have implemented such a programme when in government instead of letting youth unemployment build up. Instead of scoffing and trying to point ridicule at a sincere programme to deliver the goods, Conservative Members should be out in their constituencies, as we are, trying to make the programme a success.</p>

<p>I thank the Leader of the House for her statement and for giving us the provisional business for the week after next, which is always helpful to the House. We welcome the debate on Iraq. As I said last week, it is also very helpful to have debates on Select Committee reports.<br/>
Following the Prime Minister's answer yesterday, which was a rare event in itself, will the Leader of the House now arrange for an early clarification to the House of the Government's position on the impact of the Human Rights Bill on religious freedom in this country? Will she confirm that the Government's view on this matter is not the same as that of the Lord Chancellor, who, like his self-nominated predecessor, Cardinal Wolsey, seems likely to run into trouble with the Church? We know how that ended.<br/>
Are we right to assume that there will be a special guest appearance in the Chamber of the Minister without Portfolio next week, to enable him to explain to the House what he expects to be the contents of the dome, before he embarks on the glitzy press launch that he has already planned for 24 February? It would be nice for the House to know first.<br/>
Does the right hon. Lady plan to have the Secretary of State for Social Security come to the House to give further details of her benefits integrity project? Next Wednesday's debate may give an opportunity for that. The bare bones of the project were laid out in a written answer last Monday, but, given the Government's customary disregard for parliamentary procedure&#x2014;I am sorry to have to say that&#x2014;the media and, I think, a hand-picked audience in Middlesbrough may be more knowledgeable than the House about the Secretary of State's plans.<br/>
How would the right hon. Lady describe the details of the tax changes for women that were mentioned in <i>The Times and The Daily Telegraph</i> today? Would she describe them as a leak, as a briefing or pure speculation?<br/>
Will the right hon. Lady arrange for the Minister of Agriculture to come to the House and explain why on Tuesday night he was to be seen lolling about in the Smoking Room instead of being in the Chamber defending his ban on beef on the bone? The Government have a profound contempt for Parliament, but the Minister of Agriculture, even by his Government's standards, showed on Tuesday that power has gone to his head. His utter disregard for his responsibilities will not have gone unnoticed either by farmers or by consumers.</p>

<p>Several of the questions asked by the right hon. Member for South-West Norfolk (Mrs. Shephard) have already been answered by


Ministers today or by the Prime Minister yesterday. I shall comment on whether some of the issues she mentioned are suitable for debate next week.<br/>
Yesterday, the Prime Minister said that he would consider the issue of religious freedom, which was raised by the right hon. Member for South-West Surrey (Mrs. Bottomley). It would be unreasonable to expect me to say anything further just 24 hours later.<br/>
The Minister without Portfolio will answer questions on Monday. He does not select the questions to be asked, so who gets a chance to ask him questions will depend on who catches Madam Speaker's eye. I am sure that his answers will be of their usual high quality.<br/>
I am sure that the right hon. Member for South-West Norfolk accepts that we should ensure that claimants receive the right benefit, and that as the money comes from public funds, benefits are paid only to those who are entitled to them. The benefits integrity project is sensible, and I am surprised that any hon. Member would criticise it.<br/>
The right hon. Lady asked me to speculate about possible tax changes for women in the Budget. That matter was dealt with by my right hon. Friends during Treasury questions, and I do not think that anything should be said before the Budget.<br/>
On the last matter that the right hon. Lady raised, I am glad that my right hon. Friend the Minister of Agriculture has so much confidence in his junior Ministers.</p>

<p>It has been decided not to extend the waiting period for entitlement to jobseeker's allowance from three to seven days. May we have a debate about tackling another gap: the pensions gap? People who are entitled to pensions often have to wait six days before they receive them.</p>

<p>I know that this is an issue in which my hon. Friend has taken an interest. There is a long-standing arrangement for entitlement to benefits and pensions. I do not think that this matter can be equated with the changes that were proposed for jobseeker's allowance, and I am afraid that I see no prospect of an early debate on it.</p>

<p>May I thank the Leader of the House for her helpful response to our request for a debate on the Government's proposed changes in the jobseeker's allowance? We referred to those changes in our early-day motion 689.<br/>
<i>[That an Humble Address be presented to Her Majesty, praying that the Jobseeker's Allowance (Amendment) Regulations 1998, (S.I., 1998, No. 71), dated 15th January 1998, a copy of which was laid before this House on 23rd January, be annulled.]</i><br/>
The right hon. Lady has now withdrawn the order, and we regard that as a satisfactory response. While I am on a winning streak, may I express our view that consideration of the Human Rights Bill would be much more effective if the general principle were tackled in a Committee of the whole House, and the detail were scrutinised in Standing Committee?</p>

<p>I have nothing to add to what I said about jobseekers, except that the Government's approach was very reasonable, given that the changes were not due to

come into force for two years, and given that a full-scale examination of welfare reform was to take place in the interim. It would have been silly to anticipate the outcome of that.<br/>
I know that there are differing views in different parties in the House about the way in which the Human Rights Bill should be handled. Some believe that splitting consideration of significant legislation often benefits the House, enabling hon. Members to scrutinise it properly and to achieve the right balance between decisions made on the Floor of the House and decisions made in Committee. No final decision has been made, but we are listening to representations.</p>

<p>I congratulate my right hon. Friend on arranging a debate on Iraq for next Tuesday. I am particularly pleased that the motion will be amendable, so that hon. Members can express different views and, if necessary, vote in support of those views.<br/>

<p>I am glad that my hon. Friend appreciates the fact that we are to have a debate on Iraq. I think that members of all parties will agree with him. The debate will indeed provide an opportunity for different views to be expressed, although I think that the overall view of the House is very clear. My hon. Friend is right to point out that the motion will be amendable, and that a vote on it is possible.<br/>

<p>The right hon. Lady may be aware that, on every occasion that the Government have been asked about their intentions on the Mental Health Act 1983, they have denied intending to have a review. There has been a series of briefs, leaks, spins and denials, but the House has never been given information on the Act.<br/>
Yet again today, the BBC was informed that the Government were about to announce a review. It is becoming extremely tedious for Members that information is always given to the media before it is given to the House. I would strongly welcome a review of the Act&#x2014;I think that the pendulum has swung too far&#x2014;but I should be most grateful if the right hon.

<p>I must first say to the right hon. Lady that no one has been informed of any intentions on this matter. If a document that has not been agreed by Ministers is leaked, it is difficult to present that as a deliberate leak by the Government. However, I am glad that she would welcome a review in this sector. During the term of the previous Government, many people said that change should be made because&#x2014;as she now acknowledges&#x2014;the pendulum had swung too far. It is an important issue.

Is she aware of the real concerns that exist about the conduct within social services departments in Labour-controlled local authorities&#x2014;particularly Hackney, but now Hillingdon&#x2014;as evidenced by early day motion 777?<br/>
<i>[That this House notes with deep concern the thorough report of the Social Services Inspectorate into the Social Services Department of Labour-controlled Hillingdon Borough Council which is highly critical of the failure of the Department to ensure the implementation of child protection regulations thereby putting children in care greatly at risk leading in two disturbing cases to unacceptable levels of abuse; further notes that the Chairman of the Social Services Committee has resigned from Hillingdon Borough Council; and urges the Council as a whole to take responsibility for the Department's culture of chaos and helplessness and to initiate immediate remedial action within the Department.]</i><br/>
The motion is signed by my hon. Friend the Member for Uxbridge (Mr. Randall), other London Members and me. Serious scandals involving the care of children have occurred which ought to come before the House.</p>

<p>Before Tuesday's debate or, better still, before my Adjournment debate tomorrow on the military situation in Iraq, could two documents be put in the Library? The first is an assessment by the Foreign Office of the situation between Iran and Iraq, which is mentioned on page 1 of <i>The Times</i> today.<br/>
Secondly, could there be a Ministry of Defence document outlining its sources of information and the validity of those sources, in the light of the fact that, in 1990&#x2013;91, emotional appeals concerning babies that supposedly had been thrown out of incubators were made in the United States by a supposed nurse from a hospital in Kuwait? She turned out some months later to be the daughter of the Kuwaiti ambassador in Washington and had nothing whatever to do with the hospital. Sources of information become very suspect in these fraught situations.</p>

A debate would allow us also to expose the divisions among Conservative Members on whether they still believe that class size does not matter, or whether the view being adopted by some Conservative Members&#x2014;that our approach is better&#x2014;is now their official line.

No measure that the Government have taken since 1 May has been more mocked by my constituents. In local newspapers, it is openly stated that butchers are


offering beef on the bone. The regulations are unenforceable, and, in the debate, it was revealed that the Prime Minister himself was actively involved in the final decision. Will he or his Agriculture Minister come to the House to make a statement?</p>

<p>Within the next two weeks, it is reasonable to expect that the Deputy Prime Minister will make a statement in the House on the channel tunnel high-speed rail link. Will the Leader of the House use her good offices to draw to his attention my amendment to early-day motion 770?<br/>
<i>[That this House expresses concern over the announcement by London and Continental Railways that it is unable to fulfil its contract to build the Channel Tunnel Rail Link without further subsidy; welcomes the Deputy Prime Minister's preparedness to discuss any revised proposal from London and Continental Railways, his commitment to the House that Eurostar services will operate as normal, and his assurance of his wish to see the completion of the high speed rail link; believes that the agreed route through Kent to stations at Ebbsfleet, Stratford and St. Pancras, which was fully debated and scrutinised by Parliament, is environmentally designed and essential to the economic and social regeneration of East London and the Thames Gateway area which covers some of the most deprived communities in the United Kingdom; and furthermore believes that the sustainable transport improvements associated with the rail link, will, in addition to benefiting commuters, improve the mobility and employment prospects for residents in these areas and is equally essential for facilitating improved communications to mainland Europe for all the regions of England and Wales and via the West Coast Main Line to Scotland.]</i>
My amendment draws attention to the great plight of some of those operating medium and small businesses in Kent, in my constituency of Thurrock and elsewhere in Essex, who&#x2014;as we speak&#x2014;are losing their businesses because of London and Continental's failure to agree reasonable terms and time scales for the purchase of properties. Jobs are being lost and family businesses are being destroyed because of that enormous hiatus and a scheme that is absurd as it stands. I make a plea to the Deputy Prime Minister to ensure that, whatever else happens, those businesses will not be allowed to founder because they are victims of the hiatus in constructing the route.</p>

<speech hansard_id="1232622" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1998-02-12a.567.0" hansard_membership_id="418" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/10" speakername="Mr. Ancram" colnum="567" time="16:11:00">
<p>I shall begin by speaking to amendments Nos. 294 and 295, to clear them out of the way. The former, to leave out clause 61(6), is a probing amendment. I am interested in the provision in the clause, and it would be useful to ascertain the manner and circumstances in which it is envisaged that such a provision will operate. That would demonstrate to the Committee the balance of what is proposed in the clause. I hope that the Minister will be able to help us on that.<br/>
Amendment No. 295, in simple terms, requires the Secretary of State to consult before he makes payments into the fund. I am always told in the House that Secretaries of State do consult. However, when I try to take a consultation clause out of any Bill, I am told that if I do so, the Secretary of State will not consult. Therefore, I have yet to be convinced that the absence of a consultation requirement forces, or allows, a Secretary of State to consult.<br/>
In this case, that is important. As the provision stands, the Secretary of State is required to consult no one but himself and, obviously, to obtain the consent of Parliament. When he comes to a decision on payments to be made, he should consult the Scottish Parliament, which will certainly have a view as to the level of the payments, as well as other interested parties in Scotland. They may include business groups, trade unions and many others with views on the resourcing requirements. Those interested groups should form part of the process by which the Secretary of State makes his determination.<br/>
It is surprising that amendment No. 292 should be necessary. It is a simple amendment that would insert the requirement that a payment shall be made
<q>at least once in every financial year".</q>
The Minister may say that there will be an annual payment, but that is not specified in the Bill. The amendment would insert a simple and innocuous provision. I hope that adding the words "at least" might make it even more attractive to the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion), who is sitting at the back. He might want to press the Minister to support the amendment.<br/>
The main amendments are Nos. 309 and 293. I argue for them with the utmost seriousness. Amendment No. 309 would introduce a general and deliberately non-formulaic point of reference for the funding of the Scottish Parliament. The Bill sets out no basis for that. I shall explain later why I am not seeking a formula. Amendment No. 293 would strengthen that by requiring

the Secretary of State to certify to the House of Commons, whose consent he will have had to gain to make the payment, that the provision was the basis of the payment.<br/>
The clause is one of the central elements of the Bill. The project, if I can still call it that, was sold to the Scottish people on the basis that financial provision from the United Kingdom would not change. We have heard that time and again during the referendum campaign and since. That claim was made in the White Paper and has been repeated many times since by the Secretary of State.<br/>
We are talking about the future funding and well-being of Scotland. No other source of funding is made available in the Bill, apart from the &#x00A3;450 million that can be raised by adjusting the standard rate of income tax. We may test that when we come to debate taxation. It is not good enough to leave the issue hanging in the air.<br/>
I am surprised that the Bill gives no statutory formulation of the Government's assurances. Instead, clause 61(2) says:
<q>The Secretary of State shall from time to time make payments into the Fund out of money provided by Parliament of such amounts as he may determine.</q>
There is no definition of what "time to time" means. I am sure that the Minister will tell us what he intends, but good intentions in statute are not enough. The phrase could mean anything from several times a year to once every 10 years or beyond.<br/>
There is no description of the amounts that will be paid, or any indication of what they are likely to be. There are no criteria for calculating the amounts. Assurances do not answer those points.<br/>
Surprisingly, there is also no identification of which Secretary of State the provision applies to. I know that that is not specified anywhere in the Bill, but in this case I imagine that the reference is to the Secretary of State for Scotland, if that office continues after the Scottish Parliament comes into being. However, it could be any Secretary of State in the Westminster Government. The determination of the amount is left to the discretion of the Secretary of State and is not bound around in any way. Nowhere is it specified whether the payment will be annual or what it will relate to, and there is no assurance that it will not be entirely at the whim of the Westminster Government of the day.<br/>
We shall be told that such details are not usually put in Bills, but they have not needed to be before. I agree that detailed formulas should not be included in legislation because circumstances and definitions might change. Formula by primary legislation is an inflexible tool, but that does not mean that there should be no criteria in the Bill at all. That is why our amendment advances a basis in the most general terms.<br/>
We shall be told that what has gone before will continue and that nothing has changed. That has been the tenor of the comments of the Minister for Home Affairs and Devolution and the Secretary of State for a long time; but a lot will have changed. This is no longer about making financial arrangements and provisions between Ministers and Departments in the same Government; it is about doing so between two different Administrations and sets of politicians, who sometimes might not see eye to eye. There is a substantial difference from what happens now.<br/>
We might be told&#x2014;I suspect that we shall, because we were told it in respect of a similar provision in the Government of Wales Bill&#x2014;that everything will be


agreed in concordats. The more I look at concordats, the more concerned I become. They appear to be becoming a tool of domestic government, although as far as I know, their existence and future have never been debated or agreed anywhere in Parliament. Until I heard about them in this context, I had thought that they were part of the diplomatic mechanisms of the Foreign Office or of papal intromissions from the Vatican. We are now told that they are to become part of our procedures.</p>

<p>Is the right hon. Gentleman sure that he is right to lay such emphasis on the problem of different parties? The pressures from politicians in two different institutions, albeit that they are nominally from the same party, might be very great. Such pressures would put a strain on the concordat.</p>
</speech>
<speech hansard_id="1232624" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1998-02-12a.569.1" hansard_membership_id="418" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/10" speakername="Mr. Ancram" colnum="569" time="16:11:00">
<p>I shall come to that. Concordats might not matter in instances of little political or economic significance such as cultural or sporting affairs. Indeed, they might be an appropriate way to proceed. In this instance, we are talking not about insignificant matters but about an issue of the greatest importance to the future well-being of the people of Scotland and of the United Kingdom as a whole.<br/>
Up to now, my gut reaction has been to condemn concordats as not worth the paper they are written on. Nothing has happened to make me change my mind, but because of the regularity of their appearance in our debates, we must examine them more closely. I start with much scepticism, because when I questioned the Secretary of State's Welsh colleagues, who were purveying the same fare, I got some interesting if disconcerting answers. We are told that concordats, which by their nature must be negotiated and agreed with the Scottish Parliament or Welsh assembly, are already being discussed and drafted. Is that the case in Scotland, too? If so, we are being given reassurances on the basis of concordats or agreements that are being reached by members of this Administration but which will have to be operated and endorsed by the Administration of a Scottish Parliament and of this Parliament. Those two situations could be very different, as the hon. Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) pointed out. In competitive language, that might politely be described as taking a flier; in more down-to-earth terminology, it is a false prospectus.<br/>
Nevertheless, we are asked to risk Scotland's future financial provision on so-called concordats or informal agreements; we need to dig a little deeper. Who will the concordats or agreements be between: the Westminster Parliament and the Scottish Parliament, or the First Minister or Executive of the Scottish Parliament and the Westminster Government? There is a substantial difference in how things might operate. Will they be laid before the respective Parliaments and ratified or remain as private agreements? Will they be enforceable? That is of great importance to the people of Scotland if they are being asked to rely for their funding on them. If so, how and in what jurisdiction? What protection will there be against unilateral breaching of them? What long-term guarantee can they provide to the people of Scotland that the Government's firm undertakings as to the assured nature of their future funding arrangements will be realised?<br/>
Those are all crucial questions and on the answer to them hangs the future financial security of a devolved Scotland. It would be one thing to have a binding contract to underpin Barnett and the historic costs and needs base on which it operates; it would be the same if there was some firm parliamentary ratification and endorsement of the agreement, which had the force of law in both parts of the United Kingdom; but it would be something frighteningly different if the agreement or concordat was nothing more than a private agreement between Governments, with nothing to give it legal or parliamentary status. It would be unilaterally breachable and, as I said earlier, it would not be worth the paper it was written on.<br/>
There is a more sinister aspect. Opposition Members and Back Benchers on both sides of the House often complain when provision is made in legislation for a plethora of secondary legislation. We all know the arguments&#x2014;we say that it is time-limited and unamendable, and describe it as the heavy hand of the Executive being brought to bear on parliamentary procedure&#x2014;but at least it forms part of the parliamentary process. Concordats, on the other hand, avoid Parliament, and if they have effect&#x2014;I have already expressed doubt about that&#x2014;it will be effect without benefit of Parliament. They will be the Executive bypassing Parliament, which will be the first step on a road to sideline Parliament altogether. If we allow concordats to develop in that way and to be slipped into the Scottish and Welsh legislation by sleight of hand, we may well come to regret that we have allowed a process to develop that is no longer subject to scrutiny by the House.<br/>
We all rather casually refer to this debate as the debate on the Barnett formula, but, on closer examination, it is not. Barnett is not, as is sometimes thought, the whole mechanism for determining levels of spending in Scotland; it is only the determinant of changes to the total. To use a drinking analogy: it is not the beer, but the head on the beer. We must be careful to take that into account. Barnett does not affect the baseline provision; it provides that, where comparable, changes to programmes in England result in equivalent changes in the budget of Scotland, calculated on the basis of population shares.<br/>
When in government, we operated both Barnett and the block, occasionally generously, but generally accepting that the two elements reflected the level of need. Since the referendum, and as we warned during the referendum campaign, the principle and practice of the Barnett formula and the whole basis of funding within the component parts of the United Kingdom have come into question. It is interesting that, to a large extent, those questions have come not from my right hon. and hon. Friends and Conservatives in the country, but from Labour sources. We have heard from Labour Members of Parliament demands from the north-east for the formula to be reviewed, because, in the light of devolution, they feel that they are unfairly treated by the way in which the formula operates. The Select Committee on the Treasury called for a needs assessment, to show whether Barnett remained the best way of allocating increases. Lord Barnett himself argued before the Committee that there was a case for a review of the formula.<br/>
The fact is that devolution has rubbed the lamp, and the genie of questioning needs has been let out. It will not be easily put back into the lamp, despite the Treasury's bold attempt to do so in its document published on


8 December, because all that it said was that the formula would continue, but would be amended to meet the requirements of devolution. It went on to say that there would be a future annual update of Barnett to take account of mid-year population estimates. I noted with interest that that was to start in 1999&#x2013;2000, which I calculate is safely after the first assembly elections are out of the way.</p>

<p>The right hon. Gentleman has forgotten to give credit to those who love the Bill most&#x2014;the Liberal Democrat party. It was the hon. and learned Member for North-East Fife (Mr. Campbell) who, on 20 December, coined the phrase&#x2014;he may have used it before:
<q>the ever-escalating size of the block demanded from Westminster".</q>

<p>I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for reminding the Committee of the words of the hon. and learned Member for North-East Fife (Mr. Campbell). I think that what the hon. and learned Gentleman said is correct. However, he was talking about the block as a whole. As I said earlier, two elements are involved&#x2014;the Barnett formula, which adjusts the top of the block in terms of comparable changes, and the block itself.<br/>
We were told in the publication, "A guide to the Scotland Bill" that the formula is regarded as an "administrative arrangement". It will not be prescribed in legislation. It is only an administrative formula, nothing lasting, and certainly nothing in enforceable form, let alone in tablets of stone. That is why I am concerned that the issue should not be left hanging as it is according to the present provisions of the Bill.<br/>
At paragraph 12 of its report, the Treasury Committee said:
<q>all Governments would subscribe to the fact that spending should broadly reflect need.</q>
We suddenly find that certain questions are being asked about that. The Government will have to face up to the fact that most of those questions will be asked by Labour Members and that they will be about not just the Barnett formula, but the basis of the core block. In the end, I believe that we would all agree that where one has such blocks within a state, as is the United Kingdom, those blocks must broadly reflect need.</p>

<p>The right hon. Gentleman is laying great emphasis on the report of the Treasury Committee into the Bartlett formula. I am a new Member, and I am not familiar with the frequency with which individual members of a Select Committee find it necessary to dissociate themselves from their Committee's report, but the hon. Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce) found it necessary to do so. He made that decision because he considered that the Treasury Committee report was unrepresentative of the subject that had been originally tackled by it. Much store has been put on a document that does not have a great deal of credibility.</p>

<p>I hope that I am not putting store on it, but certain questions are now being asked. When we consider how the core block will be calculated in the future, we must note that it will not be calculated

according to the Barnett formula, which is the assurance given, because there is nothing in the Bill to say how that core block will be calculated.<br/>
The fairest way in which such blocks can be calculated&#x2014;I suspect that it was the basis of the core block in the first place&#x2014;is by making some reference to relevant need. We have tabled our amendment because the Bill is silent about the calculation.<br/>
If someone came to me and asked whether it would be wise to sell his birthright on the basis of an assurance that could not be written in contract&#x2014;which is what is essentially provided for in the Bill&#x2014;I should have to advise that person that it would be distinctly unwise to do so. All that we are trying to do is to use the Bill as the contract between the Scottish people and Westminster so that something more concrete is offered than a bland assurance that cannot be put in statute.</p>

<p>Does the right hon. Gentleman recall that, in June 1995, when he was in government, the then Secretary of State for Scotland, now his noble Friend Lord Lang, was asked in the Select Committee on Scottish Affairs about the need to reappraise the formula used to calculate the block, to guarantee its fairness? He said:
<q>I do not see the need for it at the moment because I am confident that expenditure per head reflects fairly well the relative differences between Scotland and the United Kingdom.</q>
What, if anything, does the right hon. Gentleman believe has changed with regard to the relative need of Scotland and the United Kingdom since the former Secretary of State, who obviously had all the inside information, was able to provide such an answer to the Scottish Affairs Committee?</p>

<p>I am not saying that anything has changed, but if that is correct, let us make sure that that fact is used as a basis in the legislation for making the necessary calculations. That is the only purpose of the amendment.<br/>
At the moment, after the Bill has been passed, the hon. and learned Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Wallace) could cite that quotation until he was blue in the face, but if a Government did not want to follow that particular formula, they could say that they were not required to do so by the legislation. We believe that there should be some reference to precisely what the hon. and learned Gentleman has quoted from my noble Friend Lord Lang, in 1995. On that basis, I should have thought that he would want to support the amendment, and I look forward to seeing him doing so when we conclude the debate.<br/>
It is important to ask the Government whether they intend to reformulate Barnett, as Lord Barnett has proposed. I know that they will make reformulations on the population basis, but is there an intention to go further than that? The comprehensive spending review that the Government are carrying out is not a needs-based assessment, but it will provide indications of need in various areas. Alongside that, do they intend to examine the relative needs in the United Kingdom? I noticed in note 12 of the Treasury note of 8 December on the Barnett formula that that was not ruled out as a prospect. It was said there that that could be carried out only in consultation with the Scottish Parliament. Will that be considered in the longer term?<br/>
Do not those questions underline the fact that the Bill is so silent? It offers no comfort, reassurance or stability&#x2014;just the transient whim of a Westminster Government and the Secretary of State of the time. Our amendment deliberately does not prescribe, but it provides a hook of reassurance and comfort for people in Scotland that the Westminster Government must have regard to the relative needs of Scotland within the United Kingdom. It creates a discipline that does not currently exist.<br/>
Given the assurances that we received during the debates in the autumn, I find it astounding that the Bill leaves Scotland hanging out to dry. Scotland is fobbed off with talk of unenforceable agreements. It is asked to put its faith in all things being perfect in a perfect world. I hope that Scottish Members are too canny to be bought so easily. The Conservative Opposition will not be bought by bland assurances. I ask the Committee to support the amendments, for the reasons that I have given.</p>

<p>Lord Barnett&#x2014;Joel Barnett as he then was&#x2014;was one of my closest friends over 30 years in the House of Commons, when he was the right hon. Member for Heywood and Royton. It must be put on record that it never occurred to Lord Barnett that the so-called Barnett formula to which he gave his name would have any kind of permanency. It was an ephemeral and convenient formula, but no one would have been more astonished than he to have thought that it would be a lasting formula into eternity.<br/>
I want to ask, as is my wont, some fairly concise questions. First, what additional taxes can be raised by the Parliament, over and above the specified income tax power, in circumstances in which the Treasury restricts the amount of additional revenue available to the Scottish Parliament as a result of possible future changes to the UK tax structure? There is a lack of clarity on that point. Unless those matters are clarified before the Bill becomes law, businesses and individual taxpayers will be condemned to perpetual uncertainty.<br/>
My second question goes back to the civil service. I will be excused if it refers to clause 47, but it particularly refers to any discussions that may take place in relation to tax. I find it hard to see how continued membership of the home civil service will work, when it comes to civil servants arguing about money. Does the United Kingdom head of the service&#x2014;at present Sir Richard Wilson&#x2014;have the right of recommendation or any other say in senior appointments? Is there still to be a right of approach to him? Are terms and conditions of service still to be Whitehall-controlled? Depending on the answer to those questions, we can get some idea of how the delicate and doubtless sometimes fraught negotiations on money will take place.<br/>
My third question goes back to the reference by the hon. and learned Member for North-East Fife (Mr. Campbell) to
<q>the ever-escalating size of the block demanded from Westminster".</q>
There will be such demands, because expectations have been aroused in Scotland. They will not be fulfilled by new laws, let alone speeches in Holyrood. Our constituents' expectations will be fulfilled by the provision of money. Therefore, heaven help the Members of the Scottish Parliament if they cannot deliver on some

of the expectations that have been aroused. They will ask for more and mor&#x2014;I would be part of that chorus if I were elected a Member of the Scottish Parliament. Members from all parties will be part of the chorus; they will have no other choice. That is what they are for: their purpose is supposedly to improve the lot&#x2014;the health, education and housing&#x2014;of the Scottish people. That can be achieved only through money.<br/>
So we come to the nub of the argument. The question is: how long can Members of Parliament who represent English constituencies be expected to vote 24.3 per cent. or 19 per cent.&#x2014;as some say it is now&#x2014;more identifiable public expenditure per capita to a part of the United Kingdom where they have no control over the money? That flies in the face of all the laws of human nature, and certainly against the laws of political nature. Do not pretend that those negotiations can be settled by some sort of concordat. There is no chance of achieving amiable solutions&#x2014;it does not work like that. There will be hard bargaining.<br/>
Therefore, it is imperative to establish clarity as to how the formula will work. It is true that, throughout the referendum campaign, it was said as a matter of course that the Barnett formula would continue to apply into the foreseeable future. I wonder how many weeks it will be&#x2014;and it will be weeks rather than months&#x2014;before tensions surface. When Holyrood is set up, Members of the Scottish Parliament will realise that many goodies&#x2014;improved health, housing and education and more resources for local government&#x2014;are expected of them. However, they will then find that they cannot produce them. This is a vital discussion, and I hope that the Minister will address those very important matters.</p>

<p>I follow the general drift of the speech by the hon. Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell). I must confess that, when I was Chief Secretary from 1985 to 1987, I had my doubts as to whether the Barnett formula would constitute a fair way of settling future expenditure issues in Scotland. Like the hon. Gentleman, I note that Lord Barnett now questions whether it is right to use the formula in that context. My right hon. Friend the Member for Devizes (Mr. Ancram) was entirely right when he described how it operated: we took the Scottish block as a block and, when the negotiations had been completed with the equivalent English Departments, the formula was applied automatically to add to the Scottish block.<br/>
That may have been right for the 1970s, but several questions now arise for the 1990s and beyond. The first is whether the formula will assess Scotland's needs properly. I have grave doubts about that. I believe that the need in many regions of England is as great, if not greater, than in Scotland in light of the growth and development of the Scottish economy. Above and beyond that is the question as to whether it is right to take as the base a block that was settled in the 1970s when conditions were very different.<br/>
Although I appreciated the convenience of using the Barnett formula in complex public expenditure negotiations, I always wondered whether it was a fair way of approaching the matter. The Labour Government have initiated a new fundamental expenditure review. Such a review should look at the needs and demands of all Departments, assess whether the current expenditure levels are correct, and then make adjustments. If we


cannot do that to the full Scottish block, we will not achieve a proper fundamental expenditure review for Scotland.<br/>
Let us take roads expenditure, for example. The present Government are decimating roads expenditure in England. However, let us suppose that they decided, like the previous Government, to spend more on roads in line with the needs in particular English regions. It is well known to people who travel frequently around the United Kingdom that the roads in Scotland are very much better than those in England. <i>[Interruption.]</i> I have travelled around the whole of the United Kingdom and I would love to take Scottish Members to several parts of England where it can take hours to travel six miles. I know many Scots who say that the biggest bottlenecks for the Scottish haulage industry are the M6, the M1 and the M25. I am happy to argue that point for ever because the road system in Scotland is unquestionably better than that in many parts of England.</p>

<p>Will the right hon. Gentleman confirm whether he is talking about traffic conditions in England compared with Scotland or the physical state of the roads?</p>

<p>I am talking about both. I well recall the time that I addressed 200 business men at a business breakfast in Aberdeen. In his introduction, the chairman said that those business men were very glad that I was there, as the Secretary of State for Transport, because it gave them a chance to complain about the state of the roads from Aberdeen to the south of England. The chairman castigated me on the ground that a small number of miles of single-carriageway roads remained between Aberdeen and Paris. I told him that he could promote Aberdeen by highlighting the fact that the roads communications between Paris and Aberdeen were very much better than those in many parts of England, which did not have dual carriageways. There is no doubt that the roads are better in Scotland, but I could use any example. I must come to my point, which has a general application.<br/>
When decisions were taken in England to expand substantially the roads programme or any other aspect of departmental expenditure and the conditions were entirely different in Scotland, things would have been different if the Chief Secretary had had the freedom to examine underneath the Scottish budget and point out the relevant differences between roads expenditure in England and Scotland. We could then have argued for that part of the block to be scaled down. There are problems with the block. I suspect that, if there were no prospect of a Scottish Parliament and the current Chief Secretary undertook the fundamental expenditure review properly, he would have to go underneath the Scottish block to examine such issues.<br/>
In my day, we talked about zero-based budgeting, which meant that we looked at every aspect of budgeting and then started from scratch. It was never possible to begin to do that with the Scottish block because we could not even look at it. The Barnett formula applied automatically on top of that. I do not think that the present situation is ideal or even satisfactory. I believe that the Barnett formula is out of date and should be re-examined. I agree entirely that the Scottish block should be distributed more on the basis of need according to a proper calculation.<br/>
That is the position that I start from: I do not believe that the Barnett formula will provide the correct basis for allocating funding to the Scottish Parliament from the United Kingdom Budget in the years ahead. Like the hon. Member for Linlithgow, I can go even further. There can be no doubt that, even if the same party is in power in Westminster and in Edinburgh, that will be one of the biggest sources of future friction. People will demand to know that the allocation has been calculated fairly on the basis of need. I shall leave aside the points that we will come to later regarding the Public Accounts Committee. There will be great political tension.<br/>
My right hon. Friend the Member for Devizes is correct when he says that it is not only the Opposition party in Westminster that will query the formula&#x2014;many Labour Members, if there is a Labour Government, will draw attention to the disparities to which I refer.<br/>
The distribution must be based on a fair assessment of needs. If it is not, and different political parties are in power in Westminster and Edinburgh, the tensions will increase. We will have to move to a system which it is transparently obvious to everyone is based on a fair assessment of need and is properly audited. At the moment, we are long way from achieving that.</p>

<p>Who will undertake the assessment of needs? In a unified civil service there would be the difficulty of divided loyalties, some civil servants being loyal to the Scottish First Minister. We come back to my question about the home civil service. Does the right hon. Gentleman, with his experience as Chief Secretary to the Treasury&#x2014;I used to ask the right hon. Gentleman many hostile questions when he was a member of the Treasury Bench&#x2014;have any comment on the home civil service problem?</p>

<p>I do not. Nor do I recall all that many hostile questions. Such issues&#x2014;leaving aside the question of the block&#x2014;were resolved within a unified Cabinet, reporting to the House and based on a majority party in government. I do not recall the kind of issues that the hon. Gentleman is talking about arising. Of course there were disputes between Ministers with the relevant Departments arguing their case, but I do not think that that is quite what the hon. Gentleman has in mind.<br/>
In the new situation, with the Scottish Parliament, given that there will be endless pressures on public expenditure&#x2014;the hon. Gentleman is right about that&#x2014;and all sorts of problems being raised by hon. Members here, from their own English regions, we must find a system for the allocation of the budget that both Parliaments consider to be fair. In addition, it should be audited by those in the Westminster Parliament who, at the end of the day, are fundamentally agreeing the sum of money that goes to the Scottish Parliament.<br/>
That is a difficult issue and will give rise to great tension. But it is clear that, at present, we do not know how the matter will proceed. If it is to be on the basis of the Barnett formula, that will be questioned and will have to be changed. Somehow or other, if we are not to have precisely the sort of difficulties that the hon. Member for Linlithgow raised, how the allocation is made must be much more transparent. I have been worrying about that for some time, so I am grateful to be able to make this short contribution today. I can imagine a lot of analysis


being done in my constituency and, once there is a separate Scottish Parliament and English Members cannot vote or speak on issues concerning the Scottish Parliament, this matter will be raised time and again.</p>

<p>Like many hon. Members, I respect the right hon. Gentleman's long experience in the House. He said that he had been reflecting on the matter for some time, but has he been reflecting on it for the past 20 years? The key question is: why is the right hon. Gentleman raising the matter now in terms of the devolution settlement? We have had 20 years of Conservative government and the system seemed to work well. Comments throughout the ages could be quoted. The right hon. Gentleman held a pivotal position in that Government, in the Treasury.</p>

<p>I gave away my position in my opening remarks. When I was Chief Secretary, I queried the Barnett formula, although not on the Floor of the House, for obvious reasons. However, I worried about the Barnett formula even then. As I have said, it is interesting that Lord Barnett himself now feels that the basis of the allocation needs to be updated and reviewed.<br/>
It is the introduction of the Scottish Parliament that adds a different dimension and tension to this, and that is why the matter should be considered openly and transparently so that we know on what basis the allocation will be made.</p>

<p>Yet again, Lord Barnett's own querying of the formula has been brought into play. But does the right hon. Gentleman accept that Lord Barnett said that national income per head in Scotland compared with the rest of the United Kingdom was such that he questioned the justification for keeping the present formula? As someone who has had to apply the formula, does the right hon. Gentleman accept that national income per head has nothing to do with the formula, and basically, Lord Barnett forgot what he set up?</p>

<p>That is probably correct in that the formula was based on other things, but Lord Barnett is right in his general point. The principle of the formula was established in the 1970s and, since then, there has been a substantial change in the relative position of the Scottish economy and the levels of income per head of many Scots compared with a number of English regions. There have been substantial improvements. I argue that, as a result of having a block grant, which at that time was favourable to Scotland, plus the Barnett formula ever since, there has been much higher public expenditure per head in Scotland than in England. That, too, has made a difference to the position in Scotland. Therefore, not just the formula but the size of the grant in the 1970s needs to be reassessed. That is why I say that the assessment should be made on the basis of need. We shall have to consider the allocation to Scotland based on need as a whole, not just the Barnett formula, in the years ahead.</p>

<p>The right hon. Gentleman referred to per capita expenditure in Scotland. There is understandable concern in many quarters, as has been quoted in various

submissions to the House and to the Select Committee on the Treasury, that to carry out such a needs analysis one must consider both sides of the equation, examining some of the expenditure that is defined as unidentified expenditure in the United Kingdom which is often channelled into one part of the United Kingdom&#x2014;the area around the House and the south-east of England. To get to the nub of the distribution of public expenditure, it must be a transparent exercise to consider expenditure in Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>I would not disagree with that. That must be considered not only as between England and Scotland, but as between the various English regions. That is where many of the pressures will come from. The English regions will feel themselves disadvantaged. We have already seen examples of that in the House. We must also consider individual departmental expenditure, not just the block as a whole.<br/>
That will be one of the crucial areas where we will need changes and greater transparency in future if we are to avoid immense friction. I am still not clear how the Government intend to move ahead during the next few years in deciding the block grant that goes to the Scottish Parliament, and I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say about that.<br/>
However, future Governments will not feel bound by anything this Government do, hence another area of friction and another reason why we need to think carefully about how, rather more transparently and based on need, these allocations are made.</p>

<p>I sat up and began to take notice when the right hon. Member for South Norfolk (Mr. MacGregor) began his remarks by saying that he was a former Chief Secretary to the Treasury. I thought that surely his contribution would be worth listening to and taking note of. Then he made the ludicrous statement that the road system in Scotland is infinitely superior to that in England. On occasion, I have driven from Scotland to England using both road systems. One knows that one is leaving Scotland and entering England when one leaves the dual carriageway behind and joins a three-lane motorway. That is how we recognise that we are in England. We see little of three-lane motorways in Scotland. Unfortunately, at that point, the right hon. Gentleman lost me, and I suspect, many others listening to the debate.<br/>

<p>Both the hon.

<p>The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. Ten years ago the Tory Government set out to put central barriers on the A90 between Dundee and Perth. They said that the work would be completed within 10 years, but it has still not been completed because money has not been spent on roads in Scotland to anything like the extent that it has been spent in England.<br/>
I want to agree with something that the Conservative party said in this debate, which is what I have been trying to get to for the last few minutes. I agree with what the right hon. Member for Devizes (Mr. Ancram) suggested in amendment No. 292. The Bill says:
<q>The Secretary of State shall from time to time make payments into the</q>
Consolidated Fund, and the amendment seeks to add the words:
<q>and at least once in every financial year".</q>
I hope that it would be at least once in every financial year. If my hon. Friend the Minister confirms that "from time to time" means that the Scottish fund gets two &#x00A3;14 billion lots in a single year, I shall certainly settle for that and would not oppose my hon. Friend if he chose to accept the amendment.<br/>
My purpose in speaking in this debate is to support my amendment (a), to amendment No. 112 tabled by the Liberal Democrats. They have not yet had the chance to

discuss their amendment, which seeks to preserve the Barnett formula. My amendment seeks to honour the commitment that the Labour party made within the Scottish Constitutional Convention that any review of the Barnett formula will be a joint review conducted by the Westminster and Scottish Parliaments.<br/>
The final document of the Scottish Constitutional Convention entitled "Scotland's Parliament, Scotland's Right" was agreed to by all members of the convention. Under the heading, "Secure and Stable Finances" on page 27, it says:
<q>We recognise that any formula will need to be jointly reviewed from time to time.</q>
I hope that when my hon. Friend the Minister replies to this debate he will make it clear that any future review of the funding mechanism for a Scottish Parliament will be conducted jointly between the Westminster and Scottish Parliaments, not purely by the Westminster Parliament and then imposed on the Scottish Parliament.</p>

<p>I am grateful to the hon. and learned Gentleman for saying that. Actually, I tabled the amendment on the advice of one of the Clerks, so he should take the credit for it. I provided the purpose of the amendment and he framed it for me.<br/>
What lies behind this debate is the perception, particularly among Conservative Members, that Scotland gets an unfair share of public expenditure. We must tackle that argument head on. The right hon. Member for Devizes said that the Barnett formula is really the head on the beer. He is absolutely right, because it can work only at the margin of public expenditure in Scotland. It is a way of allocating increases in identifiable public expenditure; it does not affect the core budget.<br/>
The Barnett formula is designed to ensure that Scotland gets less public expenditure in the future. The only reason that it does not work to that effect is that Scotland is losing its population. Had Scotland maintained or increased its population, it would have received less of the share of public expenditure year on year. The Barnett formula is therefore designed to meet what many of its English critics now say.<br/>
Under the Barnett formula, Scotland receives 10.66 per cent. of any increase in departmental spending in the UK, whereas Wales gets 6.2 per cent., Northern Ireland 2.9 per cent. and England 80 per cent. If England thinks that Scotland is getting more than its fair share under the Barnett formula, I would be happy to exchange our 10.66 per cent. of the increase in spending for its 80 per cent. When one looks at the figures in the stark, cold light of day, one realises that England is getting a very fair deal under the Barnett formula, and Conservative Members should stop complaining about it.<br/>
The real purpose of amendment No. 309 is to complain that no mechanism in the Bill relates public spending to relative need, not only in Scotland but in the rest of the UK. The Opposition want such a mechanism in the Bill because they believe that Scotland receives an unfair share of public expenditure. The right hon. Member for Devizes referred to the Treasury Select Committee report, which implied that Scotland receives an unfair share of


public expenditure within the UK. I warn him that if the Treasury Select Committee report continues to be used to batter the Scottish Parliament proposals, I shall suggest that the Scottish Affairs Select Committee, of which I am a member, conducts its own inquiry into relative spending between Scotland and the rest of the UK. I suspect that we would come up with a very different report from that of the Treasury Select Committee.</p>

<p>Is not the hon. Gentleman prepared to concede that the Treasury Select Committee is dominated by Labour Members, that Lord Barnett is a Labour peer and that the cries of, "Oh, this is unfair to England" come from Labour Members from northern England? Will he acknowledge that Labour Members, not Opposition Members, are raising the issue?</p>

<p>Yes, certain Labour Members have been making that complaint, but neither the Labour Government, to their credit, nor the vast majority of Labour Members who support the Government, are raising the issue. Scottish Members of Parliament are certainly not raising it. Indeed, the only Scottish Member on the Treasury Select Committee dissociated himself from the tone of the report and from its findings&#x2014;and he is not a Labour Member.<br/>
If we are to have such a mechanism, it should look not only at identifiable public expenditure in Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom but at all public expenditure. The Barnett formula does not deal with spending on agriculture, social security, defence or public administration. The &#x00A3;200 million building being constructed across the road is not included in the formula that compares public spending in Scotland with that in the rest of the UK. We could build four Scottish Parliaments for the price of that block of offices, yet people complain that the Scottish Parliament is wasting money in constructing a new building. It is a ridiculous argument that I hear from Opposition Members.<br/>
If we take into consideration all public spending, a different ratio appears, particularly between the south-east of England and the rest of the United Kingdom, including Scotland. If that is the kind of review that the Conservative party wants, I should be happy to support it.<br/>
This Saturday sees the establishment of a constitutional convention for the north. The cross-party campaign for a northern assembly is setting up its own constitutional convention along the lines of the Scottish Constitutional Convention, and I hope that it will lead to the same successful conclusion. Campaign members have suggested working with Members of Parliament to expose the notorious hidden subsidies to the south-east of England, such as the uneven allocation of defence contracts to the south-east of England, which goes on all the time. Conservative Members never say that that should be looked into. Another example is the uneven gain from income tax. For the past 18 years, very rich people, the majority of whom live in the south, have enjoyed massive income tax cuts handed out to them by the Government. Those hidden subsidies should be debated, but they rarely are.<br/>
I remind hon. Members that, when the Barnett formula was set up, it was meant as a fix to avoid the rows that took place every year within the Cabinet between the

Secretary of State for Scotland and all his colleagues about the spending share that Scotland should get within the Budget. Those rows take place in Cabinet behind closed doors between members of the same party, all of whom were appointed by the same Prime Minister and therefore loyal to that Prime Minister.<br/>
Conservative Members may want an annual, open, public and bitter row between the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh and the Westminster Parliament about Scotland's share of public expenditure, but that would create constant friction between the two Parliaments, and would lead to the Scottish Parliament being distanced from the rest of the United Kingdom. The crazy mechanism that they are trying to establish would achieve the very end that they claim they do not want.</p>

<p>Let us accept for a moment the hon. Gentleman's argument that the formula was designed to eliminate such annual squabbles. Does he concede that the establishment of the Scottish Parliament has opened up this issue? It is surely not only legitimate but essential that all of us, north and south of the border, face the issue squarely in the context of the Scottish Parliament and try to produce a new and proper financial basis. Perhaps we should have another formula to eliminate annual squabbles; we cannot assume that the Barnett formula will continue unchanged after the establishment of a Scottish Parliament.</p>

<p>No one is assuming anything. We are dealing with the immediate aftermath of a Scottish Parliament coming into power in 2000. It is not sensible for the Scottish Parliament to be locked into conflict with the Westminster Parliament over its share of the Scottish Office block grant before it has a chance to get its feet under the table and start providing the services for which it is responsible. We are trying to get the Parliament up and running.<br/>
In due course, both Parliaments may come to the conclusion that they should review the allocation of public expenditure between Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom and within Scotland. It should be a joint review, which is the purpose of my amendment. It should also examine all public spending and all subsidies to every corner of the United Kingdom, not just identifiable public expenditure. I do not hear Opposition Members making such points.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman will not be pleased to hear that I agree with his general argument about the inherent conflict in the Bill. He said that the conflict will continue to get worse.

<p>Nothing in this world is inevitable: I have discovered that after living in it for a very long time. Of course, there will be conflict if the Westminster Parliament tries to take money away from Scotland. If Westminster takes the attitude that Scotland should be punished for having its own Parliament and should have a smaller share of public expenditure, it will pull Scotland down the separatist path. Luckily, the Government do not have that attitude towards Scotland or towards public


expenditure. I have every confidence that under a Labour Government we will have increased public spending in Scotland. I say that with gusto and enthusiasm.</p>

<p>That is 1:0 to the right hon. Gentleman; it is a fair point.<br/>
When additional expenditure for the health service was announced in October last year, we discovered that the increase for England was not matched by a Barnett formula 10.66 per cent. increase for Scotland. Mid-term increases in expenditure for England do not necessarily trigger off an equivalent increase for Scotland. So the formula is not always strictly applied.<br/>
The debate is useful, because it was inevitable that this issue would be raised. I am glad that the comments of the right hon. Member for Devizes (Mr. Ancram) when introducing his amendments were more rational and conciliatory than were the utterings of his party in the period up to the election. It is not right for the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Mr. Forth) to say that devolution has brought this issue to the fore. Under the Conservative Government, plenty of Tory Back Benchers whinged about the amount of money spent in Scotland, and that was not in a devolutionary context, because the Tories were opposed to devolution.<br/>
5.15 pm<br/>
I found the Conservative party's attitude in the run-up to the election, during the election campaign, and at times during the referendum campaign, distasteful. The Conservative party behaved like the school bully saying, "If you vote for a Scottish Parliament, we will take some of your money away." That was not a particularly helpful approach from a party that prides itself on its commitment to the Union. Surely, it recognises the principle of equalisation not just for Scotland but for all parts of the Union.<br/>
I take the point made by the hon. Member for North Essex (Mr. Jenkin). Perhaps the A11 and A12 roads in East Anglia are not particularly good: I do not know, because I have not driven on them for a long time. That perhaps says more about differential spending within England than it does about spending in one part of England compared with Scotland. Expenditure on roads also varies greatly in different parts of Scotland. Local government settlements, which account for a substantial part of public expenditure, show vast differences in England. Under the previous Government, spending per head in Westminster or Wandsworth was massively greater than spending in many places in the north of England. If they were trying to apply the principle of equalisation, they did not succeed.<br/>
It is important to emphasise the substantial variations in expenditure within England. It is not always fair or accurate to give an overall picture of spending in England compared with spending in Scotland.</p>

<p>May I say that I was in no position to bully anyone? There was no bullying. The issue was put in the form of the Bury, North question, which is very serious. Given the new circumstances, how can my hon. Friend the Member for Bury, North (Mr. Chaytor), in that not over-rich Lancashire constituency, justify to his voters for eternity&#x2014;because that is what we are talking about&#x2014;the fact that Scotland gets more public expenditure per head than England? In candour, we must at least face up to that issue.</p>

<p>I would never accuse the hon. Gentleman of bullying: that is not his approach. He fairly posed the question, but some Conservative voices were raised that were much more threatening and hectoring. The previous Secretary of State for Scotland used regularly to raise the spectre of what would happen after devolution.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman asked how I would explain the position to the hon. Member for Bury, North (Mr. Chaytor). Let me refer perhaps not to Bury but to Barnsley. In the last financial year, the local government settlement was &#x00A3;1,244 per head for Tower Hamlets, &#x00A3;864 per head for Westminster, and &#x00A3;368 per head for Barnsley. That is a greater differential in spending per head than the differential between Scotland and England.<br/>
When making an accurate and fair assessment of spending per head in Scotland compared with England, we should take account of the huge geographical differences between Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom. <i>[Interruption.]</i> The right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst groans, but he cannot run away from the fact that Scotland contains 59 per cent. of the surface area of the United Kingdom and has 10.6 per cent. of the population. <i>[Interruption.]</i> The right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst is making sedentary remarks in a very childish way. He must know that it is more expensive to build a mile of road in the highlands than to build a mile of road in Kent, and that a mile of road in the highlands will inevitably serve fewer people.<br/>
Moreover&#x2014;regrettably&#x2014;people's health is worse in Scotland than in the rest of the United Kingdom. There are more long-term problems such as heart disease and cancer in Scotland than in England. There are far more pupils in state schools than there are in England, and a higher post-16 staying-on rate. There is less take-up of


private provision, and transport costs are higher. A police car belonging to, for example, the Northern constabulary must travel many more miles to cover its patch than the equivalent in parts of England. All those factors must be taken into account, but there is more to it than that.</p>

<p>There is another aspect of the argument, which the hon. and learned Gentleman may come on to. I am talking about the way in which money is spent in the rest of the United Kingdom, and the fact that Scotland does not receive its fair share&#x2014;especially in relation to some of the substantial write-offs that followed water privatisation in England and Wales.</p>

<p>There is also consumer expenditure on defence contracts in the south of England, and mortgage interest tax relief benefits England more than Scotland.<br/>
The so-called excess has been calculated at about &#x00A3;3.7 billion, but that does not take into account the fact that spending on such matters as agriculture and social security is demand led: the money will be spent, regardless of where the people are. In fact, Scotland has a larger agricultural population than England. I believe that it has been estimated that one of the main contributors to the difference in expenditure per capita between now and the late 1970s, when the Barnett formula was agreed, is the increase in agricultural expenditure, some of which has been European Union driven.<br/>
Scotland also has higher local taxation. The average band D council tax in Scotland is &#x00A3;783 in the current financial year, compared with &#x00A3;689 in England. Once we have taken demand-led expenditure and higher local taxation into account, the difference drops from &#x00A3;3.7 billion to &#x00A3;2.7 billion&#x2014;about &#x00A3;1.45 per person per day. When we take account of Scotland's greater demand for health services, and its related greater demand for social services, the figure falls to &#x00A3;1.9 billion. If that were distributed among everyone else in the United Kingdom, there would be an extra 10p per person per day. That, I think, is a relatively small amount to take account of all the factors, such as geography and weather, that I mentioned earlier.<br/>
As I said when I read a quotation to the right hon. Member for Devizes, as recently as June 1995 the former Secretary of State for Scotland&#x2014;now Lord Lang&#x2014;thought that the funding formula was pretty fair. I do not think that much has changed since then in terms of relative need. The right hon. Member for South Norfolk (Mr. MacGregor) said that when he was Chief Secretary to the Treasury he had his doubts, but his doubts never prevailed. I suspect that the majority of Cabinet Ministers thought that the formula was fair; if they had not, they would surely have done something about it, but the same arrangement obtained year after year.<br/>
The right hon. Member for Devizes asked us to back his amendment, but it does not take matters much further than the Government's proposals. It states that the Government should take need into account, but not that they should do anything about it. Nevertheless, the right hon. Gentleman has a point. I fear&#x2014;and our amendment addresses this&#x2014;that, as it stands, the Bill will leave a blank cheque. It could be a cheque for only a fiver: the clause refers to a sum that the Secretary of State
<q>may from time to time determine".</q>

The Minister owes it to us to explain why the proposal is couched in such open terms. There is neither a basis for the original funding formula, nor a basis for any annual variation of it. Our amendment improves on that of the right hon. Member for Devizes by taking the existing grant formula&#x2014;which already embodies the consideration of need that Lord Lang recently found acceptable&#x2014;and applies the Barnett formula to it, on an annual basis. If the amendment were accepted, the Bill would establish the way in which the Scottish Parliament should be funded.<br/>
We think that any change in the population formula should not be made on an annual basis&#x2014;on the basis of figures that, at best, can be described as guesstimates&#x2014;but should follow the census that takes place once every five years. That would provide accurate material on the basis of which to change the formula. In new clause 12, we propose a joint review of the funding formula involving the Scottish Parliament and the House of Commons, to be
<q>completed for implementation in the tenth year following the establishment of the Parliament".</q></p>

<p>I think that the new clause was tabled before those debates took place; at any rate, it was quite separate from them. It can, in fact, be directly attributed to the passage from the Scottish Constitutional Convention agreement which was quoted by the hon. Member for Dundee, East. It accepts that the present block grant, the Barnett formula and the tax-varying powers that we shall discuss another day provide a secure and stable basis for the Parliament. That was certainly the arrangement struck between us in the constitutional convention. The convention said:
<q>We recognise that any formula will need to be jointly reviewed from time to time. In time such discussions will undoubtedly lead to a greater transparency in, and understanding of, the economic situation across the different parts of the United Kingdom.</q>
I think that I am supported on that.<br/>
We propose that more revenue should come from the tax that is raised in Scotland. We believe that a Treasury grant will still be needed, but if more can be seen to be coining from Scotland itself, so much the better. That, I believe, will lead to transparency and to more accountability. If the Scottish Parliament is to receive a share of the revenue, it will have an incentive to introduce policies in relation to its economic and industrial powers that will increase buoyancy in the Scottish economy. If the amount is to be shared, the United Kingdom Treasury will also benefit. I think that that will lead to a better rapport between Westminster and the Scottish Parliament.<br/>
In its publication "Scotland's Parliament", the constitution unit says:
<q>Tax sharing could well come to play a larger part in the financial arrangements if devolution is established throughout the UK. But that is not the case now, and nor is there sufficient confidence yet in the reliability of the figures for tax yields in the territories and


regions to allow it to deliver the benefits in 'fiscal psychology' described. Nevertheless the option of incorporating some element of tax sharing in the financial settlement should be kept open for the future.</q>
We are saying that it should be recognised that, at some stage in the future, a reassessment will be needed. If we move further towards a federal solution, as I think we inevitably will, we shall need some kind of federal exchequer board&#x2014;a far more transparent mechanism, of the sort that exists in countries where a federal settlement has been reached. This will not necessarily be the last word, but, as things currently stand, it is a good starting point for the Scottish Parliament. Our worry is that nothing in the Bill reflects either the Government's commitment in the White Paper or the commitment in the constitutional convention agreement. I do not accuse the Government of wanting to back off or of bad faith, but, as I asked in a debate on Tuesday: how will these powers stand when they are being exercised by an opponent? There is too much flexibility and opportunity for someone with a much more malevolent will towards the Scottish Parliament to create conflict and tension. Therefore, I hope that tight parameters that will ensure that money is delivered to the Scottish Parliament can be introduced into the Bill.</p>

<p>During the debates in the Scottish Constitutional Convention, I argued for complete fiscal autonomy for the Scottish Parliament, whereby a Scottish Treasury, accountable to the Parliament, would be responsible for the raising of all revenue within Scotland and for paying a certain amount to the United Kingdom Treasury for shared services such as defence and overseas representation. However, I accept that I lost that argument in the convention.<br/>
5.30 pm<br/>
The White Paper proposal, which was put to the people of Scotland in the referendum, is for the Scottish Parliament to be financed by means of a block grant and of the limited power of raising, or lowering, the basic rate of income tax by up to 3p in the pound. The size of the block grant will presumably be affected by the Barnett formula, which has been around for a long time, as has its author. I recently spoke to Joel&#x2014;now Lord&#x2014;Barnett across the road in the gym. I assure the Committee that the good Lord is in good shape, but some concern has been expressed as to whether the Barnett formula is as robust as its maker. The Treasury Committee recently had some things to say about it.<br/>
We have to remember that there is no mention of the Barnett formula in the Bill. In fact, there is no specific mention of the formula in any statute and, unless the Liberal Democrat amendment or amendment (a) in my name and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) is accepted, that will remain the case.<br/>
The Select Committee said:
<q>The Committee was disappointed that no Government studies have been made in relation to the appropriateness of the Barnett Formula and how it relates to needs &#x2026; it is time to bring the needs assessment up to date".</q>
The last official needs assessment was made about two decades ago in an interdepartmental study led by the Treasury. The exercise examined the six main services that were, at that time, to be devolved to the proposed Scottish assembly and Welsh assembly. As a matter of

interest, those services were health and personal social services, education, excluding universities, housing, other environmental services, roads and transport, excluding the railways, and law and order and protection services, excluding the police.<br/>
The people conducting the study used a large range of "objective factors", including the age distribution of the population, the length of roads, recorded crimes and the number of substandard dwellings, to estimate the cost of providing equivalent service levels in Scotland; they did the same exercise for Wales and Northern Ireland. The overall result was that per capita spending in Scotland would need to be some 16 per cent. higher than in England to provide comparable service levels.<br/>
Since then, the definition of public expenditure has evolved considerably and it is difficult to apply those conclusions to the current situation. According to recent reports, per capita spending in some regions of England is considerably higher than that in Scotland. However, do the Government have any plans to update the needs assessment and/or the Barnett formula? If there is any review of the Barnett formula&#x2014;and I think that Lord Barnett has said that it is not going to survive for ever&#x2014;it should be a matter for the Scottish Parliament as well as for this Parliament: it should be a matter for negotiation between the Scottish Executive and the UK Government.<br/>
That is what amendment (a) tries to ensure. If there is failure to reach agreement, the Scottish Parliament may demand and achieve the sort of fiscal autonomy that I argued for in the Scottish Constitutional Convention.</p>

<p>The financing of the Scottish Parliament is obviously a controversial issue; we have had some controversy already tonight. The hon. and learned Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Wallace) referred to the Scottish Constitutional Convention proposal on assigned revenues. That proposal was formulated in the early days of the convention and goes some way towards the proposals on fiscal autonomy that form the heart of amendments Nos. 77 and 78.<br/>
I listened with interest to the hon. Member for Falkirk, West (Mr. Canavan), who made a rational case for fiscal autonomy, which would be in the interests of achieving clarity in the public finances not only of Scotland, but of the UK; fiscal autonomy would address some of the issues about transparency that were raised by the right hon. Member for South Norfolk (Mr. MacGregor). Unless there is a stable solution in the Bill, the issues that we have been discussing will come back time and again.<br/>
I concede that, in this debate, the comments of Conservative Members about funding have been more measured; they could not be less measured than the comments of the hon. Member for Billericay (Mrs. Gorman), who has been saying some pretty outrageous things about Scottish public finances in the past few weeks. In the run-up to various elections in recent years, comments have been made about subsidy junkies in Scotland and the Scottish community being heavily subsidised by the rest of the UK. As I have listened to this debate, I have been intrigued by the fact that more and more of those myths are beginning to be tackled by not only people who represent the politics that I support, but Labour and Liberal Democrat Members. They are prepared to challenge some of those myths, which have been presented as the holy grail.<br/>
Government expenditure and revenue estimates have also been used to examine the public finances of Scotland. Those estimates are produced annually now and were first introduced as a party political exercise by the former Secretary of State for Scotland, now Lord Lang. Their original purpose was to try to use the Scottish Office and its instruments to show how subsidised Scotland was; it was the most curious piece of political suicide one could find. Those figures are now in the public domain annually.<br/>
Some of the details have been rehearsed in the past. The most recent assessment by the Scottish Office suggested a headline deficit for Scotland of more than &#x00A3;7 billion. As with all such analyses, it conveniently ignores the fact that the statistics include a certain share of the general United Kingdom deficit, foisted on Scotland not by decisions by Ministers in Scotland but by the incompetence of various Chancellors of the Exchequer in the past. Additional factors missed from the statistics are the share of oil and privatisation proceeds to which Scotland would undoubtedly be entitled.<br/>
The hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) referred to the assessment of income tax; other aspects of the statistics question whether the lack of transparency in the debate allows us to get to the truth of the public finances of Scotland. That must surely be the basis on which any long-term judgments are made. In that respect, I can comprehend the amendment tabled by the right hon. Member for Devizes (Mr. Ancram), but I do not understand how far forward it takes us. It assesses the issue of need&#x2014;which we all acknowledge should drive the analysis&#x2014;but puts no solution in place.<br/>
We have had extensive contributions about the Barnett formula. I do not intend to rehearse the issues; nor do I intend to claim any intimate understanding of the origins of Lord Barnett's formula, the intimacies of the Cabinet's discussions or Lord Barnett's current thinking on the issue. I wish to quote from a submission made to the Treasury Select Committee by Professor Arthur Midwinter of the university of Strathclyde. I see an expression on the Secretary of State's face&#x2014;I am not sure what it means.</p>

<q>In the UK context, the sums available for redistribution through any attempt to reduce the Scottish 'excess over needs' as calculated by HM Treasury would be small.</q>
That is a piece of informed analysis which it would be wise for the Committee to remember.<br/>
The debate on public finances has to be driven by transparency; that is the why we tabled amendments Nos. 77 and 78. We want the Scottish Parliament to be accountable and responsible for the raising and spending of public finances. No Member of this House could desire anything other than that. However, the Scottish Parliament is being established with very limited flexibility and responsibility. Local authorities in Scotland, by and large, have the power to raise about 15 per cent. of their revenue, whereas the Scottish Parliament will have some degree of discretion in relation to the raising of only 3 per cent. of its revenue. To me, that puts in context the limitations applied by the Government in the Bill.<br/>
5.45 pm<br/>
A system of financial autonomy for the Scottish Parliament would operate in a simple way, and the hon. Member for Falkirk, West referred to that. Revenues raised in Scotland would be placed under the control of the Scottish Parliament. The last estimate by me and my colleagues of the total revenues raised in Scotland was something like &#x00A3;28 billion in the fiscal year 1996&#x2013;97. The Scottish Parliament would thereafter be responsible for meeting the costs and agreeing the expenditure of public services within its responsibilities in Scotland, and then for agreeing with Westminster to pay a sum of money in relation to the exercise of reserved powers.</p>

<p>That is a clear explanation from my hon. Friend and a welcome intervention in the debate.<br/>
In relation to financial autonomy, the Scottish Parliament would be responsible for paying to Westminster a sum in relation to the reserved powers and the services provided under the reserved powers to Scotland. The result of all this would be to force transparency on the Scottish and Westminster Parliaments&#x2014;which is where transparency is sadly lacking. Our amendments would advance the debate in a way that the Conservative amendments would not.<br/>
Let us consider, as the hon. Member for Dundee, East did, some aspects of hidden public expenditure in south-east England, which contradict the contention that Scotland somehow benefits from formidable additional per capita public expenditure. The millennium dome, for example, will cost more than &#x00A3;700 million; the Jubilee line extension will cost &#x00A3;2.1 billion; the British library has cost &#x00A3;511 million; and the Heathrow to Paddington rail link will cost &#x00A3;440 million. Consider those enormous capital projects in the heart of London and the south-east of England against the background of our debate on financing Scotland.<br/>
Our amendments would enable the Scottish Parliament to engage Westminster in a debate on paying for reserved powers and on the amount of resources that will truly be allocated to Scotland. Transparency would undoubtedly benefit if our amendments were made.<br/>
The hon. Members for Dundee, East and for Falkirk, West have tabled amendment (a) to amendment No. 112, which would require the Scottish Parliament and the Westminster Parliament to undertake a joint review of Barnett, if that is the future mechanism of financing the

Scottish Parliament. Their amendment would deal with the concern&#x2014;which I suggested to the hon. and learned Member for Orkney and Shetland&#x2014;that the dice that are loaded in favour of Westminster in deciding many financial issues will simply be entrenched in the legislation.<br/>
There is a very strong case for financial autonomy, to give responsibility and accountability to the Scottish Parliament. I hope that the Minister will have something positive to say about the strong arguments that have been made by hon. Members on both sides of the Committee in favour of financial autonomy, not only in this debate but on many occasions.</p>

<p>I began listening to this fascinating debate feeling somewhat depressed, but I have cheered up considerably. I felt depressed because&#x2014;although such debates are, perhaps inevitably, dominated by hon. Members from north of the border&#x2014;those who will undoubtedly study the debate will be in danger of getting an entirely wrong slant on the issue.<br/>
To set the matter in context, I repeat what I said in an earlier intervention: the tragedy is surely that, for as long as any of us can remember, the issue has only rarely before broken the surface in the United Kingdom. Although we can disagree about or debate the amounts of the transfers or differentials north and south of the border&#x2014;there is little doubt that they exist&#x2014;the people of England have largely been content for that to happen because the issue has not been raised and thrust in their face.<br/>
Now, with the referendum and legislation to establish a Scottish Parliament, the issue has had to be confronted. Surely we cannot have the possibility of a Scottish Parliament, with all that means, grafted on to long-standing financial arrangements that have gone unchallenged&#x2014;because they were seen to be a part of a United Kingdom dispensation with which all the people of the United Kingdom were broadly content.</p>

<p>The right hon. Gentleman, probably unintentionally, is misleading the Committee. In the previous Parliament, the convention of using the Barnett formula was seriously challenged by the Conservative party. Michael Forsyth. the then Secretary of State for Scotland, publicly said that the Barnett formula would be changed over his dead body&#x2014;which is now politically dead. The Conservative Government and the Conservative party challenged the Barnett formula, and the Scottish Conservatives defended it.</p>

<p>I must bow to the hon. Gentleman's superior knowledge of what happened inside the Conservative Government. I seem to recall that I spent about nine years in that Government&#x2014;albeit in the foothills and in a very humble role&#x2014;but I do not recall a debate on the formula, which I wish had been held and resolved in the way that I should have preferred. However, perhaps that is history; we are now, properly, faced with a debate on allocating funds in the United Kingdom in the context of an imminent Scottish Parliament. That debate is being held against the background of the generally acknowledged fact that there is a difference in the moneys available from the Exchequer to people in Scotland and to people in England.<br/>
The common ground that has emerged in this very encouraging debate is on transparency. The hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) and the hon. and learned Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Wallace) have argued&#x2014;I agree with them&#x2014;that it is essential that we have a much better understanding of the origins and expenditure of funds in the United Kingdom, so that, regardless of what we decide to do in the future, our decisions will be based on an appreciation of, and broad agreement on, what is happening.<br/>
I support the belief expressed in the debate by hon. Members that the calculation should not necessarily be based on the rather narrow Barnett formulation but should be as wide as possible, and include matters such as agriculture and social security. I have no fear of that happening. As a London Member, I am very conscious that, for example, unemployment in London is now, regrettably, considerably higher than it is in Scotland. Therefore, the impression made in the debate of a deprived and exploited Scotland, which so desperately requires all that extra money, must be balanced with other realities.<br/>
I could make some very interesting comparisons between Greater London and Scotland&#x2014;which have broadly similar populations&#x2014;and between, for example, their expenditure and generation of tax revenues. You, Mr. Lord, and the Committee will be pleased to hear that I will not go into them now. The hon. Member for North Tayside (Mr. Swinney), however, mentioned capital projects. We all have thoughts one way or the other on those, but they are a reality and should also be factored into our analysis. Those matters form the context of the debate.<br/>
My spirits have been raised because of the concept of financial autonomy that was mentioned by the hon. Member for Falkirk, West (Mr. Canavan) and repeated by other hon. Members. If I properly understand the idea, I think that it is very attractive and may well form the basis of the way forward, and that it would receive surprisingly broad agreement. If the hon. Gentleman is proposing that a Scotland with its own Parliament, with all that that means in political and decision-making autonomy, is prepared to countenance raising and being responsible for spending its own revenues within the Scottish context, I welcome the proposal. It would be a very significant step forward.<br/>
I made a modest speech in our recent debate on an English Parliament&#x2014;a matter on which I think that I can extend a hand of friendship to the Liberal Democrats. I believe that the debate that has been initiated on the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh assembly will inevitably have to be extended to resolving representation also in England, perhaps in a federal context.<br/>
I draw into the debate on an English Parliament and the developing constitutional arrangements&#x2014;I am now very much availing myself of your generosity, Mr. Lord&#x2014;the issue of what we should do with the other place. Although I will not say any more about that, because that is not what the Committee is considering, I believe that all those issues should be combined. The difficulty is that, until now, we have been asked to consider only purely and very narrowly the constitutional implications of a Scottish Parliament, without considering the other implications.</p>

<p>I must admit that my thinking on the matter is not fully developed, although the hon. Gentleman, as ever, raises an extremely important issue.<br/>
If we are to contemplate a federal approach&#x2014;and we are discussing the establishment of regional Parliaments within a United Kingdom federal context&#x2014;I assume that we will look to either the German or the United States model, where some revenues are raised for federal purposes and allocated to that, and others are raised within different areas and allocated to expenditure on that basis. That would be my starting point, and I assume that it is the basis on which we would seek to proceed. It would fit in well with what I understand to be the proposal by the hon. Member for Falkirk, West for what he described as financial autonomy.<br/>
I have described the basis of a way forward that would make the people of England feel much more content with the way in which matters are developing. I fear that, at present, there is a risk that when the people of England realise fully what is happening, and when the issue becomes more developed in their minds, there may be what could be described as an English backlash with English people saying, "Hold on a moment&#x2014;the Scots seem to be getting everything their own way. They are getting a Parliament and the continuation of existing financial arrangements. Where do the English come into it?" I am trying to use the debate to move the argument forward in a more structured and positive way, broadening it out so that we can address the wider constitutional and financial contexts.<br/>
It would appear from what has been said today that that is more possible than ever it seemed in the past. That is why I feel more positive than I did just an hour or two ago. Obviously, I will support the amendments in the name of my right hon. Friend the Member for Devizes


(Mr. Ancram) and I hope that we will move the debate forward in that context. I hope that, having listened to the positive speeches that have been made, the Minister will respond in like terms and see whether he and the Government can find ways forward that will allow us to stay together on the issue and make progress without the dissent that otherwise might arise.</p>

<p>I do not understand how any hon. Member on either side of the Committee can object to the insertion into clause 61 of the words:
<q>having first taken into account the needs of Scotland in relation to the needs of the United Kingdom as a whole".</q>
It must be one of the most benign amendments ever proposed.<br/>
Throughout the debate on the Bill and previous debates on devolution during the past several months, the Government have assured us that devolution, the effect of the Bill and the formation of the new Scottish Parliament will benefit the entire United Kingdom. They have said that repeatedly, so why are they resisting the amendment, which clearly and simply states what they have suggested is already inherent in the proposed system of devolution&#x2014;to take into consideration the needs of the United Kingdom as a whole?<br/>
Either the Bill and its consequences are good for the United Kingdom as a whole, in which case the amendment must be acceptable, or they are not, in which case the Government have been misleading those of us who represent parts of the United Kingdom other than Scotland.<br/>
I was not in favour of the Bill in the first place. Nor was I in favour of devolution. I was not in favour of a Scottish Parliament being founded in Edinburgh, but, as the Scottish people have spoken through last summer's referendum, I accept&#x2014;as we all do&#x2014;that what happens in the House must reflect the will of the people. I want the new Parliament to work. Perhaps it is special pleading&#x2014;I do not want my constituents in Essex set apart from my friends and family in Scotland. I do not want the House to pass legislation that creates inherent conflicts between different parts of our United Kingdom.<br/>
However, the fact is that the proposed system of devolution will not work unless the inherent conflicts are at least reduced&#x2014;if they cannot be obliterated. I do not believe that that is possible, but at least we can work in a sensible way to try to reduce the conflicts.<br/>

<p>Just for the sake of my own record, the hon. Lady has obviously misunderstood me, as I certainly do not agree with what she has just said. I was arguing

<p>I appreciate that the hon. Gentleman wants to protect his reputation from my agreeing with him, but I was not saying that. I was saying that if the Committee is acting in the best interests of the entire United Kingdom, no one can possibly object to the amendment.<br/>
The hon. Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) will be less concerned by the fact that I agree with him. He said quite clearly that when the two Parliaments are up and running and try to decide the annual allocation of taxpayers' money, there will be no chance of their reaching an amiable solution. Of course that must be correct. We know already that Government Departments do not reach amiable solutions, even though they are headed by Secretaries of State who are all colleagues in the Cabinet. They do not reach amiable solutions; they spend weeks arguing about which Department should have the greater part of the available public spending. As that is already inherent in the system, how much more will it be the case between the Parliament here in Westminster and the Parliament in Edinburgh?<br/>
We have already referred to the report issued by the Treasury Select Committee after it discussed the Barnett formula. It stated:
<q>There may be good reasons why this formula should continue to be used in the future as it has for the last 20 years, but it is an argument that cannot finally be settled until it is clear that total expenditure, not just the increase, is still being allocated according to relative need. It is important that there should be maximum possible agreement on this in all parts of the UK.</q>
As almost everyone agrees with that, why are the Government resisting an amendment which would simply require the needs of Scotland to be considered in relation to the needs of the United Kingdom as a whole?<br/>
As a Member of Parliament, I consider myself a representative of the United Kingdom as a whole. Whatever our allegiances to Scotland, to Essex or to anywhere else, we should all act in the best interests of the United Kingdom as a whole. The dangers of not doing so are considerable.<br/>
The Government have said time and again that devolution will safeguard and strengthen the Union. They have used that argument against the Scottish National party Members, who do not want the United Kingdom as a whole to be strengthened. That is fair enough; it is the position on which they were elected. However, the rest of us were elected to safeguard the United Kingdom.<br/>
As the Government say that devolution will strengthen and safeguard the Union, they must believe that an amendment that would require the Secretary of State to consider the needs of the whole of the United Kingdom can only be right. By rejecting the amendment, they risk creating the conflicts that the hon. Members for Linlithgow and for Dundee, East so eloquently outlined. As the Government are taking no action today to iron out some of those conflicts, the danger is that the proposed system of devolution will not work and the conflicts that are inherent from the start will increase.<br/>
If the system does not work, we shall slide further down the slippery slope to self-government for Scotland. Neither I nor other Conservative Members want that to


happen. If the Government do not want it to happen, they can have no reason for rejecting an amendment which would be in the best interests of the United Kingdom as a whole. If they want to protect the Union, they cannot argue against the amendment.</p>

<p>I shall reflect briefly on what I regard as the inadequacy of the debate. I wanted to explore some of the ideas of the hon. Members for Falkirk, West (Mr. Canavan) and for North Tayside (Mr. Swinney), but we are precluded from doing so by the limitations imposed by the pre-legislative referendum that both hon. Members supported. The Scottish people were told that financial autonomy was not on offer, so it would be improper to introduce it&#x2014;although amendments Nos. 77 and 78 represent a manful attempt to do so.<br/>
I refer briefly to amendments Nos. 304, 291, 309 and 293. I support the view of my hon. Friend the Member for Epping Forest (Mrs. Laing) that these are elementary questions, although I intend to take rather less time in saying so. I disagree with her in one small respect&#x2014;her belief that, as Members of Parliament, we should be ambassadors. Our role is not as ambassadors. If she were to refer to Edmund Burke, she would realise that the House of Commons is a deliberative assembly, and not a mere congress of ambassadors.<br/>
It is outrageous to be told by the hon. Member for Falkirk, West that the question of financial autonomy was settled by the Scottish Constitutional Convention. That is an insult to my constituents, who were not involved in that process at all.<br/>
The clause states:
<q>The Secretary of State shall from time to time make payments</q>
of such amounts as he may determine. That is ridiculous. Given that we are creating a democratically elected institution which will be responsible for disbursing funds, it is vital that we accept amendments Nos. 292 and 295, which would ensure that such payments were made at least once a year and that the Secretary of State could not unilaterally, without reference to the Scottish Parliament, change the amounts to be paid.</p>

<p>In a unitary state&#x2014;as the United Kingdom has been until now&#x2014;it is inevitable that some areas will be winners and some will be losers in the distribution of resources. Most hon. Members will accept that. They can look across the Chamber and see other hon. Members whose constituencies perhaps receive a different deal, but who have been elected to the House on an equal basis.<br/>
The Bill will change the relationships within the United Kingdom; it would have little point if it did not. However, it is silent on the question of money. It presumes that the Barnett formula will continue to apply in some fossilised form. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Devizes (Mr. Ancram) said, we cannot debate devolution without debating resources. Money will be an issue in Scotland and, as time goes by, in England.<br/>
From what I have heard in the Committee's consideration of this Bill and of the Government of Wales Bill, I believe that expectations of what the new

constitutional arrangements will bring are unrealistically high. All hon. Members have their favourite cause, believe that there is a pot of gold or have a shopping list but, as the Bill stands, they will be let down.<br/>
Money is a critical question. In the years to come, it will be a major subject of debate, and perhaps disagreement, between parts of the United Kingdom. It is not unreasonable to require, as amendment No. 304 would, the Government to use a needs-based formula. No one is presuming an outcome from such a formula.<br/>
I am sure that it will be recognised that, as the hon. and learned Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Wallace) said, many of the communities north of the border, especially in the far north and in the central belt, have real needs. We must deal with the matter of money. The Bill is silent about it, but I believe that we shall have to debate it for many years to come.<br/>
Another critical point will be the relationship between Westminster and the Scottish Parliament. We have heard much about concordats but, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Devizes said, we do not know whether they will be between Westminster and the Scottish Parliament or between the Government and the Scottish Executive, whether they will be public or private, or whether the House of Commons will debate them. To make any constitutional arrangement work&#x2014;we do not want disagreement&#x2014;the worst case scenario has to be tested, but I do not believe that the Bill does that in terms of the relationships within the United Kingdom.<br/>
Money will be critical. There are high expectations north of the border. As we shall debate later, the Parliament will be limited to raising income tax by 3p in the pound, which may raise &#x00A3;400 million or &#x00A3;450 million. Local government will be affected, as it is a major area of expenditure, and there may be a great temptation to top-slice. Under the Bill, the levying of business rates will be wholly within the competence of the Scottish Parliament.<br/>
I do not believe that the arrangements under the Bill would provide a sound basis for the future. There will be great disagreement north of the border, particularly as local government is squeezed, and there will be debates in this Chamber between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland over the way in which resources are farmed out. It is critical to debate these matters and I wish that the Government would tackle them now. If they are not dealt with now, they will come back throughout this and future Parliaments.<br/>
In the past, it would often have been best if we had reformed local government&#x2014;I know that we are talking of a different animal today&#x2014;and local government finance at the same time. All previous Governments have tried to avoid doing so, which has caused great difficulties. The Bill sets up a new constitution and, if we do not tackle the questions of money, needs and grants, they will be a running sore for many years to come.</p>

<p>It is abundantly clear from the range of amendments tabled that, irrespective of which positions parties or hon. Members have adopted, there is anxiety over the way in which the Bill will operate in practice. Clearly, the matter can be approached in a number of different ways. For once, the way proposed by the Scottish National party has a


certain logic, albeit that if it were introduced, it would effectively mean financial separation and it would cause a ratchet of further problems.<br/>
As a Unionist, I believe that we stand and fall together financially. I have always supported the notion that those parts of the United Kingdom that need more financial support should receive it. It really does not matter a bean whether that is the north of Scotland or Wales. As I see myself as a citizen of the United Kingdom, it is right and proper that that should be done.<br/>
The difficulty with the Government's approach is that they are burying their head in the sand in terms of the changes that will come about when the Scottish Parliament is set up and in terms of the aging of the Barnett formula in any event. Irrespective of whether a Scottish Parliament is set up, in years to come, that formula is bound to come in for further scrutiny in view of the way in which the United Kingdom is developing.<br/>
The amendment simply asserts the principle that all funding should take place on the basis of considering need throughout the United Kingdom. If the relationship between the Scottish Parliament and the Parliament here is to work&#x2014;it has been my intention to further that relationship during this debate, whatever my anxieties about whether it can be made to work&#x2014;it will have to set out on the basic premise that on each occasion in the coming funding year, the needs of the United Kingdom as a whole will have to be considered. The idea that that is a device by which Scotland is to be hammered over its financial settlement seems wrong.</p>

<p>That is a good question. The matter will have to be considered by the Secretary of State and the Government at Westminster in co-operation with Scottish Ministers. Co-operation is implied. As the hon. Gentleman has said on so many occasions, this Bill depends entirely on good will and co-operation. Our anxiety about the legislation, which I know he shares, is that although co-operation and good will are delightful abstracts, in practice, they are often absent. The success of our constitution hitherto has been that it has never catered too much to good will, but it has catered to the realities of power in its distribution.</p>

<p>I see the logic of the hon. Gentleman's position, but if we want to avoid that conflict either we should all accept the Barnett formula, as the two Front-Bench spokesmen have done, or we should accept the argument for fiscal autonomy put forward by the Scottish National party. The hon. Gentleman's argument will not resolve tensions. As soon as the issue is decided&#x2014;whoever decides it&#x2014;it will cause argument.</p>

<p>Perhaps I expressed myself badly. If the Barnett formula is providing adequately for needs, let it continue. However, every time we discuss how much money should go to the block grant to Scotland, we should take into account the needs of Scotland in relation to those of the United Kingdom as a whole. We cannot get away from the principle, so it would be wise to restate it in the Bill. It might not help, but it would at least be a step in the right direction to set out what should be considered as the years go by.<br/>
The idea that there will not be discussion between Scottish Ministers and Westminster about funding seems unrealistic. Clearly, it is desirable that that should happen, as I am sure the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan (Mr. Salmond) would agree, even if he would prefer a system of fiscal autonomy.<br/>
If we are not to have fiscal autonomy, I endorse the amendment. At least it goes some way to spelling out the principles on which people should approach the problem as they will come across it year in and year out.</p>

<p>We have heard some thoughtful and good contributions from both sides of the Committee but, in characteristically robust fashion, the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Mr. Forth) interjected the question of the English backlash. That may be some people's perception, but it is no context for a mature Parliament to discuss a major constitutional change. If we end up with a Scotland-England debate, we shall all lose out. For the benefit of the Committee, we should approach all these issues as most hon. Members have done. Let us not recreate a situation in which, perceived or real, an anti-English or anti-Scottish backlash is being fomented in the Committee. That simply is not useful.</p>

<p>Hon. Members on both sides who have attended have contributed and that is important.<br/>
The amendments focus on the funding arrangements for the Scottish Parliament. They break down into five groups, which I will consider in turn. The first group comprises amendments Nos. 309, 293, 295 and 86 and is concerned with relating the size of grant that Scotland gets from the UK Government to the country's needs.<br/>
The argument of the right hon. Member for Devizes (Mr. Ancram) seems to be that only by linking the grant to need will some kind of protection be offered which will prevent the future erosion of Scotland's level of funding. Amendments Nos. 309 and 86 would make it a statutory obligation for the amount of grant paid over by the UK Government to the Scottish Consolidated Fund to be based on Scotland's needs relative to the rest of the UK. I have no argument with that principle. However, the amendments are unnecessary because in practice, under the long-standing system of public expenditure distribution that operates throughout the UK, resources are already allocated on the basis of relative need. That principle applies not only to money allocated to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, but across the whole spectrum of public spending. We have no plans to depart from that fundamental public expenditure principle.<br/>
It follows that amendment No. 293, which would place an obligation on the Secretary of State to report to the House that the grant that he was proposing to make was based on relative need, is also unnecessary. Furthermore, the House will already have had the opportunity to consider the level of any proposed grant in the context of its scrutiny of the annual estimates.<br/>
Amendment No. 295, which would impose on the Secretary of State an obligation to consult the Scottish Parliament and various bodies before deciding the amount of grant, is also unnecessary and inappropriate. The grant figure will be derived from the assigned budget, which will in turn be calculated in accordance with the block and formula rules. Those will have been published and so the process will be both public and essentially mechanistic. It is precisely to minimise the need for potentially controversial annual negotiations that we have decided to continue with the block and formula arrangements. A requirement to consult at this stage in the process would be at odds with that general approach, although I would fully expect the Scottish Parliament to consult widely about its proposals for allocating the resources available to it.<br/>
The second group, amendments Nos. 77 and 78, would change the funding arrangement for the Scottish Parliament and Scottish Administration from one based on current arrangements and involving payment of grant by the UK Government into the Scottish Consolidated Fund to one based on assigned revenues. These amendments propose that Scottish Ministers should be responsible for making payments from the assigned revenues to central Government for provision of services in Scotland relating to reserved matters. A system based on these amendments would involve a significant move away from one of the main principles underlying public finance in the United Kingdom&#x2014;that Government expenditure should be based not on where taxes are raised, but on where the demand for services is.<br/>
Another reason for opposing amendments Nos. 77 and 78 is that, based on the figures for 1995&#x2013;96&#x2014;the latest year for which data are available&#x2014;they would result in Scotland receiving substantially less than under the existing system. Such a settlement would be unfair, because it would not properly reflect Scotland's relative needs. Given the scale of the discrepancy, I do not foresee the situation changing significantly. To ensure the level of funding needed for the provision of services in Scotland, a system would be required to top up Exchequer revenues with a grant from the Westminster Parliament. That would be a retrograde step in comparison with the arrangements proposed in the Bill, introducing complication and uncertainty, and moving away from a tried and tested system. It would be the worst of all worlds.<br/>
6.30 pm<br/>
The third group of amendments in this selection is amendments Nos. 111 and 112&#x2014;with amendment (a)&#x2014;and new clause 12. They would give statutory effect to the Barnett formula and make provision for its review. I fully appreciate the sentiment that lies behind the amendments, so I shall not point out their weaknesses. However, they are misdirected in principle. I hope that I can persuade those who have tabled them not to press them. The aim is to reinforce the Government's commitment to continuing with essentially the same funding arrangements for the Scottish Parliament and Administration as currently apply to the funding of the functions of the Secretary of State for Scotland.<br/>
The funding arrangements proposed in the White Paper are intended as a continuation of the existing administrative arrangements, which have served successive Governments well for almost 20 years. As I have said, we are committed to publishing the detailed rules that will continue to govern the allocation of resources to the Scottish Consolidated Fund. We have already published the principles underlying those rules. Any Government wanting to change the rules will have to do so openly and justify their position. We shall publish the rules.</p>

<p>As I said in my speech, I do not question the good faith of this Government. Does the Minister accept that a key test is how such provisions might be exercised by a Government less well disposed to the success of a Scottish Parliament? He says that they would have to publish details of any changes and take the political flak. Amendment No. 112 would involve the Scottish Parliament before any change was made. Why does he not insert some parameters that would prevent a Government with less commitment to a Scottish Parliament from having a blank cheque?</p>

<p>We have seen different Governments over the past 20 years with different views about the allocation of the block and the formula. We feel that the current arrangement will endure. We hope that it is in the best interests of the Scottish Executive and the Westminster Government to come to sensible agreements. It is an enduring and successful arrangement that has worked for 20 years. It offers the best prospects for moving forward.</p>

<p>Before my hon. Friend leaves the issue of sensible arrangements, may I return to a question that I have asked previously? I find it hard to understand how continued membership of the home civil service would work. Will the head of the United Kingdom civil service, Sir Richard Wilson, have the right of recommendation, or any other say, in senior appointments? Is there still to be a right of approach to him? Are the terms and conditions of service still to be Whitehall-controlled? I know that those questions relate partly to clause 47, but in Treasury negotiations, they are of central importance.</p>

<speech hansard_id="1232717" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1998-02-12a.602.3" hansard_membership_id="126" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/395" speakername="Mr. McLeish" colnum="602" time="18:15:00">
<p>My hon. Friend may recall that when the issue was raised previously, I said that I would write to him. The central issue is that there will be a unified civil service. The current situation will endure into the new settlement.<br/>
An administrative arrangement offers significant advantages over statutory provision, particularly in flexibility and adaptability. Those advantages significantly outweigh any theoretical protection that might be provided by giving statutory backing to the Barnett formula or any other aspects of the Scottish Parliament's funding arrangements.<br/>
I offer my hon. Friends the Members for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) and for Falkirk, West (Mr. Canavan), who tabled amendment (a) to amendment No. 112, the assurance that, as we said in the White Paper, any review of the funding arrangements would need the full involvement of the Scottish Executive and the United Kingdom Government. We are committed to a fair, acceptable, efficient and effective system for funding the


Scottish Parliament. We have made it clear that the Barnett formula is to continue, subject to annual updates to reflect shifts in relative populations&#x2014;an appropriate arrangement given that the Barnett formula is population based. Population estimates are produced annually.<br/>
On a more technical level, amendment No. 292&#x2014;which constitutes the fourth group of amendments&#x2014;appears to be aimed at imposing a timetable on the payment of grant by the Secretary of State. It seems reasonable, but it is unnecessary. The detailed arrangements on the timing of payments into the fund by the Secretary of State out of money provided by Parliament will be for agreement between the Secretary of State and Scottish Ministers. There is no need for prescription in the Bill. I hope that the right hon. Member for Devizes will not press the amendment.</p>

<p>I am grateful to the Minister for giving way. I know that he is rushing through his speech to finish in time. He is talking about agreement. I asked him several questions about concordats and agreements. Will the agreement that he is talking about be subject to concordat? Will he answer some of my questions about concordats? This is an important issue.</p>

<p>The grant will not be covered by any concordat. We believe that the principles and the rules surrounding Barnett will be sufficient. We want to ensure that any concordats&#x2014;I am going wide of the issue&#x2014;are non-statutory and as public as possible. Such arrangements will be between the Scottish Executive and the UK Government, when the Scottish Executive is established.<br/>
The final amendment&#x2014;No. 294&#x2014;is difficult to fathom. It would strike out subsection (6), which requires Scottish Ministers to make payments to the Secretary of State in respect of certain receipts. It should be resisted.<br/>
I suggest that the lead amendment should be withdrawn and that the others should not be pressed. If not, I ask the Committee to vote them down.</p>

<p>We have had an important and far-reaching debate on an important and far-reaching subject. I welcome the fact that so many hon. Members have spoken. I found the Minister's answers disappointing. I said that amendment No. 294 was probing, tabled so that he could explain a provision that I did not understand. He said that he found the amendment difficult to understand. I hope that we can return to that, because it is important.<br/>
My right hon.Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Mr. Forth) was right to try to set the issue in a broader context. One of the difficulties that we have on constitutional reform is that the Government are approaching it piecemeal. I agree with my right hon. Friend that we should have a more comprehensive approach.<br/>
I am also grateful to my hon. Friends the Members for Epping Forest (Mrs. Laing), for New Forest, West (Mr. Swayne), for Poole (Mr. Syms) and for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve). They strongly supported our amendment and reinforced my initial arguments. Our amendment is constructive. The principle was accepted by almost everyone who spoke except the Minister. I am

disappointed that, once again, his reaction to a constructive amendment was resist, resist, resist because it looks weak to do otherwise. I had hoped that such a constructive amendment would be given greater consideration&#x2014;if only a promise by the Minister to go away and look at it and perhaps come back with an alternative. I am sorry that he did not.<br/>
It is depressing that so few Scottish Labour Members felt that the issue was of sufficient importance to attend the debate. One or two faithful Scottish Labour Members have been present, but the majority of them were nowhere to be seen. The issue will affect all their constituents.</p>

<p>If there were Scottish Tories, they would have contributed to the debate. They would know that their constituents' prosperity depended on the issue. We have learnt from the empty Labour Benches what Scottish Labour Members think about the future funding of their constituencies. Labour Members from the north-east were not even seen. I suspect that the Whips were working hard to keep them away in case they embarrassed the Minister.<br/>
The Minister's argument is difficult to accept. He says that the current administrative arrangements have worked well for the past 20 years, so we should keep them in place. It is not as if things were not changing. The Secretary of State tells us that the whole devolutionary project is historic, fundamental and exciting, yet the Minister says that we need not put anything into the Bill because nothing will have changed. A lot will have changed. The main thing will be that instead of a partnership within the United Kingdom, under one unitary Government whose members can get together and share problems and the resources to solve them, we shall have two separate Administrations who will not necessarily see eye to eye. That situation is totally different from the present one and the Minister has failed to address that.<br/>
The Minister said that we should not move away from a tried and tested system, but we are moving away from a tried and tested constitutional system in the Bill by setting up a Scottish Parliament. Nothing on the financial side recognises that fact. Listening to him, I found no comfort on the points that I raised.<br/>
The hon. and learned Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Wallace) underlined my case when he said that Scotland has special needs. If it does, let us have a needs relationship built into the statute so that it can be tested year on year to ensure that funds and resources are fairly produced. My right hon. Friend the Member for South Norfolk (Mr. MacGregor), with his enormous experience, was right. We are looking for a fair, transparent system which will avoid constant friction between a Scottish Parliament and the Westminster Parliament. That is the key to what we are discussing.<br/>
I do not expect the Scottish National party to join us in the Lobby tonight. It will not support any amendment likely to make the Scottish Parliament work. The nationalists want it to fail because that is how they can achieve their ultimate goal of an independent Scotland. If the amendment is constructive, they will not be with us.<br/>
If we wanted proof of future confrontations, we had only to listen to the speech of the hon. Member for


Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion). He gave us an example, if we needed one, of what matters will be like unless something more is written into the Bill. He abused English Members; he was rude about them and insulted them. He told us that we did not understand Scotland. We heard the authentic voice of the confrontation that is going to come unless some safeguard is built into the Bill. I have heard nothing to justify withdrawing the amendment. On that basis, I ask my hon. Friends to support it.</p>

<p>Amendment Nos. 81 and 83, which I have also tabled, could be called the reduction of girning amendments, although I do not know whether that is a parliamentary term.<br/>
The reality is that in 1999, when my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland goes off to Holyrood, accompanied by the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan (Mr. Salmond), they and the Ministers at Holyrood, indeed every Member of the Holyrood Parliament, will soon come to regard the main function of those of us, their former colleagues, who are left at Westminster, to be to pursue one purpose above all others. In their eyes, that purpose will inevitably be to get more lolly, more money, from the Treasury. In the eyes of all Holyrood Members of Parliament, any other function that those of us who are left here may have will be minuscule compared with that one basic task. That is the reality of the matter.</p>

<p>I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will concede that I would have another task in mind that went beyond getting more lolly, as he put it, out of the Treasury. From his remarks, I assume that he does not

intend to stand for the Holyrood Parliament. The <i>Linlithgowshire Journal and Gazette</i> asked me about his intentions just last week and I was unable to answer that question. Can he confirm that he will not be a candidate for the Scottish Parliament?</p>
</speech>
<speech hansard_id="1232741" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1998-02-12a.614.0" hansard_membership_id="3080" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/152" speakername="Mr. Dalyell" colnum="614" time="18:15:00">
<p>The <i>Linlithgowshire Journal and Gazette</i> has been told 15 times that there is no question of that. In the first place, no one is going to select me, so there is a certain finality about that.<br/>
The serious point about the amendments is that they represent an attempt&#x2014;frankly, Sir Alan, I admit to you that it is a futile attempt&#x2014;to limit the consequences of girning. In case there is any difficulty about that word, it means to complain, complain and complain. That will be our function. A difficult and potentially dangerous and divisive situation could be created when one has a block of people whose function above all others is to complain and ask for more and more and more&#x2014;a begging bowl in excelsis.<br/>
I note that the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan, who is the leader of the Scottish National party, is smiling. He is in the position of the cat that swallowed the cream; I am in the position of the skunk that failed at the garden party.<br/>
The probing amendments have been tabled to ask what will be done about the unsatisfactory situation that could create a division, according to which those Scottish Members of Parliament who are left at Westminster will be expected to get money and play a reduced part at this Parliament. That will be a difficult situation. If they do not get that money, they will be blamed for everything that goes wrong. It is in the nature of politicians that we do not like to blame ourselves&#x2014;rather we find someone else, a scapegoat. In this case, the scapegoat will certainly be the ineffective Westminster Members who fail to produce the money with which Holyrood Members of Parliament can build roads, repair schools, build houses and fund local authorities. In that, there is a difficult, divisive situation.<br/>
I promised that I would be succinct, and so I shall be. I shall leave it at that.</p>

<p>I shall speak to amendments Nos. 296 and 297. Amendment No. 296 is purely a probing amendment. By seeking to delete subsection (2)(b), we want to find out what expenditure would be covered by this provision that is not included in subsection (2)(a). Can the Minister give us specific examples?<br/>
The main purpose of the amendments is to deal with what the hon. Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) described as the wedge clause. We have said time and again that expenditure would be the wedge that the nationalists would try to drive into the Scottish Parliament to divide Edinburgh from London. As soon as we started to debate the clause, the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan (Mr. Salmond) told us that that is exactly what they intended to do, and that they had a further objective&#x2014;to divide the Scottish Parliament entirely from the United Kingdom. I know that hon. Members on the Government Benches do not want that, so I hope that the Minister will pay serious attention to the concept behind the amendment.</p>

<p>Surely the hon. Gentleman is not telling the Committee that that is a blinding revelation to him about the Scottish National party's aims and objectives. It is the first item on every SNP membership card. I cannot believe that the hon. Gentleman became aware of it only this evening.</p>
</speech>
<speech hansard_id="1232745" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1998-02-12a.615.1" hansard_membership_id="4251" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/213" speakername="Dr. Fox" colnum="615" time="19:15:00">
<p>No, I have always been perfectly aware of that, but during the referendum, when voters in Scotland saw the hon. Gentleman on the platform with the Secretary of State supporting his White Paper, which stood for devolution within the Union, a few of them might have thought that he was being, at best, a little disingenuous in campaigning for that, when he obviously had something utterly different in mind. Although he had made that explicit beforehand, I wonder how many voters were caught on the hop.<br/>
The concept of a balanced budget is important. It is a discipline that should be brought into a Scottish Parliament from the outset. We all understand the concept from our own lives, even if we do not always manage to achieve a balanced budget, as we realise when the credit card bills come in. The Government make great play of the attempt to get back to budget balance, and all western Governments are trying to achieve it, to make sure that debt is not piled up and passed on to subsequent generations. The Government are making great progress with that, thanks to the healthy revenues from taxation that they are receiving as a result of the successful economic policies that they inherited from the Conservatives.<br/>
As we have argued on many occasions, we want to minimise the potential points of friction when the Parliament is set up. The Secretary of State has said repeatedly in Committee that we must consider the worst case scenario. We must prepare ourselves in advance for the tactics that will be employed by those who will seek to break up the Union by using the expenditure wedge.<br/>
In the 1980s, we saw Militant Tendency members from the pre-Thatcher unreformed Labour party setting illegal budgets in Liverpool, Bristol and other places, which they knew that they could never finance, and expecting central Government to bail them out, as a way of creating friction between local and central Government. They left huge debts behind. There are councils in the United Kingdom that have bigger debts than some small third-world countries.<br/>
Can the Committee imagine how much more dangerous such friction would be with a nationalist complexion? London would be blamed for the financial shortcomings of an Edinburgh Parliament. Some of those who stand for the Parliament will make promises that they know cannot be fulfilled within the expenditure limits that the Government have set themselves, and which they will surely therefore set a Scottish Parliament. When those objectives cannot be realised and disillusionment sets in, the politicians in the Edinburgh Parliament will not get the blame. As the hon. Member for Linlithgow said, politicians seldom blame themselves&#x2014;in the six years that I have been in the House, I do not remember once hearing a politician blaming himself for anything.<br/>
People in Scotland will not blame the actions of the Edinburgh Parliament. They will blame this House. It will be London's fault. The tight purse-strings being held by

this place will be blamed for the problems that fall on the Scottish Parliament. That is the wedge that will be used to destroy the United Kingdom. We cannot rule out that situation entirely, but we can build into the Bill the concept of budget balance, as amendment No. 297 sets out.<br/>
Budget balance is a good discipline, which the Government try to apply to themselves. It will be easier to achieve, because some of the functions that tend to run away with public expenditure will not be the responsibility of the Scottish Parliament. It will mean that debt is not passed on to future Parliaments and future generations.<br/>
I urge the Minister to take seriously the threat that is posed. He heard the leader of the Scottish nationalists say that they have a further objective. I urge the Minister not to give them that opportunity.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman is advancing a strange argument. He is arguing for local government prudence and balancing budgets. May I point out that Scottish National party-controlled councils have the best record of financial prudence anywhere in Scotland? I recommend him to examine SNP-controlled Angus. The hon. Gentleman speaks of balanced budgets, but his own Conservative party doubled the UK state debt when it was in power.</p>

<p>Of all the Members in the House, the hon. Gentleman has the most attractive way of presenting a red herring. The councils are not trying to break away from the rest of local government in Scotland, but the nationalists do intend to break the Scottish Parliament away from the rest of the United Kingdom. That is the essential difference. They will use every means at their disposal, and I urge the Minister not to give them the one weapon that they seek above all else: to raise expectations that cannot be funded. The Secretary of State has said several times that we must prepare for the worst case scenario. I urge him to accept the amendment to prevent that occurrence.</p>

<p>One of the great treasures of the House is the Members who pursue a course of courageous individualism. I have crossed swords with the hon. Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) on open government, science, foreign policy and public services, but as he follows that course of courageous individualism, it is a great pleasure to support him today and to support his arguments, which apply equally to the amendments tabled by me. I disagree with nothing that he said.<br/>
The amendments in my name cover two important areas: the responsibilities of the United Kingdom Parliament, and the application of the proper principles of scrutiny in the Scottish Parliament. The amendments are largely self-explanatory, particularly as they are so long, so I shall concentrate on outlining the general principles involved in them.<br/>
I begin with the responsibilities of the UK Parliament. May I say at the outset that I want the Scottish Parliament to work. That is now necessary to the continued integrity of the United Kingdom. In the words of the Secretary of State, who is no longer with us, I want as far as possible a friction-free relationship between the House of


Commons and the Scottish Parliament. A friction-free relationship, however, will not be advanced by withholding information from the United Kingdom Parliament. It will not be advanced by expecting Westminster to rubber-stamp the allocation of a large sum of money, with neither knowledge of its use nor confidence in its handling.<br/>
As I outlined in my Second Reading speech, this House is accountable to UK taxpayers for the money raised by taxes in the United Kingdom. That argument would not apply if the Government took the route of financial autonomy raised by the hon. Member for North Tayside (Mr. Swinney)&#x2014;I told him that I would compliment him, and I hope that I have not done him too much damage&#x2014;the hon. Member for Falkirk, West (Mr. Canavan), who is not with us, and my right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Mr. Forth). Each of them argued that if there was a Scottish tax base that the Scottish Parliament used, some of the problems that we are debating would not arise. I shall not alarm my colleagues on the Front Bench any more by going further down that line.</p>

<p>I might continue if my hon. Friend provokes me.<br/>
Because of the way in which the Government have chosen to finance the Scottish Executive, by a block grant from United Kingdom taxes, we are accountable for it. We should be clear about one thing. It is possible to delegate power, and we are doing that. It is also possible, with proper oversight, to delegate responsibility to a point. However, it is not possible to delegate final accountability. After all, accountability is a duty, not a right. Final accountability for the disposal of taxes lies inevitably with those who raise the taxes. Attempting to avoid that is not delegation, but abdication.<br/>
Clause 61 creates the Scottish Consolidated Fund and provides for the Secretary of State to pay the grant from the House into it. My proposed amendment requires the Secretary of State to be satisfied about the Scottish Parliament's accounting and auditing arrangements before he pays the grant. The Bill currently fails to make the Secretary of State accountable, in any meaningful sense, for the annual grant of more than &#x00A3;14 billion that he will pass to the Scottish Parliament.<br/>
Amendment No. 242 inserts subsection (2A), which restates a level of accountability that is consistent with devolution. It simply requires that the Secretary of State should satisfy himself that the Parliament has established adequate accounting and auditing rules as required by clause 66 of the Scotland Bill. If he is not satisfied, he must not pay the grant. That straightforward measure will ensure that the Scottish Parliament complies with the Bill's requirements on financial control, and it will hold the Secretary of State accountable to the House for that.

It provides a minimum level of accountability for the &#x00A3;14 billion of United Kingdom taxpayers' money that is voted annually to the Scottish Parliament.</p>

<p>Indeed it is. I made my speech on Second Reading after the Comptroller and Auditor General raised with me his concerns about several issues, which I then pursued. Although the arguments that I put on Second Reading and those that I deploy today are my responsibility, the Committee may assume that the Comptroller and Auditor General agrees with all the amendments standing in my name.<br/>
The proposed amendment moves some way towards, but is more indirect than, arrangements at Westminster and plans for the Welsh assembly. The second proposed amendment to clause 61 deals with the lack of information provided under the Bill to enable the House to reach a proper decision about the approval of the grant. Under the Bill as it is currently drafted, the House can be asked to vote blind on the annual grant to the Scottish Parliament, contrary to the practice for other expenditure. The House voted funds to the Scottish Office for 1997&#x2013;98 on the basis of detailed Supply estimates comprising 10 votes and 73 line items. The Bill could reduce that detail to a single undifferentiated figure.<br/>
Amendment No. 242 would insert subsection (2B), which would remedy that by requiring the Scottish Executive to supply details of their expenditure proposals to the Secretary of State, who in turn would have to lay that information before the House. The Secretary of State could not pay the grant until that had happened.<br/>
I should point out clearly that the Bill does not allow the United Kingdom Parliament to control or direct the expenditure: it simply allows the House to know about it. The amendment is a minimum provision that would give the House some idea of how the Scottish Parliament proposes to use &#x00A3;14 billion of United Kingdom taxpayers' money, which it expects the House to vote to it. It mirrors, to a limited extent, existing arrangements in Westminster and the proposals for the Welsh assembly.<br/>
I reiterate: it will not help the relationship between Westminster and Edinburgh if the House cannot have confidence that the money it has allocated&#x2014;for which it is responsible to the United Kingdom taxpayer&#x2014;is being well spent. Without adequate powers of oversight, the United Kingdom Parliament will be spending its money blindfolded. That will create friction, not avoid it.<br/>
I refer now to the application of proper principles of scrutiny within the Scottish Parliament. Clause 66 specifies the limited framework of accountability and scrutiny that the Scottish Parliament must adopt.</p>

<p>Is the right hon. Gentleman saying that Westminster will scrutinise Scottish taxpayers' money that is allocated by Scottish Members in a democratically elected Scottish Parliament? By demanding that accounts be sent to Westminster&#x2014;I wonder how long that would take&#x2014;and approved before the money could be spent, he would impose on a Scottish Parliament the same system


that the Fees Office imposes on Members of Parliament in this place. That is a ridiculous way to treat any self-respecting Parliament.</p>

<p>I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman has a problem with the Fees Office, but he has not listened to what I have said. I made it clear at the outset that if taxes were raised directly in Scotland&#x2014;including hypothecated taxes&#x2014;these issues would not apply. However, that is not the case: this is United Kingdom taxpayers' money. The hon. Member for North Tayside spoke earlier about the expenditure balance between England and Scotland. Most hon. Members understand only too well that the balance tips towards Scotland.<br/>
However, that is not the problem. The problem is that the House is being asked to allocate blind &#x00A3;14 billion&#x2014;it may be rather more than that&#x2014;in one block grant. That cannot be good for democracy or for the relationship between this place and the Edinburgh Parliament. I will give the hon. Gentleman one more chance.</p>

<p>The previous Government admitted that the subsidy from Scotland to the United Kingdom was about &#x00A3;31 billion over 18 years. The right hon.

<p>The hon. Gentleman is pulling numbers out of the air from 20 years ago, when the oil revenues were much larger than they are now.

Gentleman is missing the point: we are talking about United Kingdom taxpayers' money. It would be a very different exercise if we were dealing with money raised from a Scottish tax base that went straight to the Scottish Parliament&#x2014;as happens in federal authorities elsewhere, such as in the United States. That may be what the hon. Gentleman wants, but it is not what the Government have provided and it is not what we are dealing with tonight. The Committee must deal with the Bill as it is written.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right, and this unique institution is flawed for precisely that

reason. I am attempting to make a difficult entity work because, at the end of the day, I am committed to the United Kingdom, to open government, freedom of information and democracy&#x2014;all of which are tied up in this equation.<br/>
Clause 66 specifies the limited framework of accountability and scrutiny that the Scottish Parliament must adopt. The Government's intention is that the Scottish Parliament will be largely free to devise its own audit and scrutiny arrangements. Clause 66 does little more than suggest the types of arrangement that the Parliament will be expected to devise. Amendment Nos. 257 and 244, again in my name, insert certain fundamental requirements that are currently missing.<br/>
7.30 pm<br/>
First, amendment No. 257 requires that the arrangements which the Scottish Parliament devises for the scrutiny of reports laid before it by the independent auditor should include the establishment of a committee that is not dominated by the Executive.<br/>
Secondly, amendment No. 244 requires that the accounting arrangements of the Scottish Administration should accord with best practice in accounting for and the control of UK Government expenditure.<br/>
Thirdly, the rules applying to preparation, audit and scrutiny, for the Scottish Parliament's Administration, should apply also to bodies funded by grants from the Scottish Executive.<br/>
Fourthly, the decisions on the appointment and dismissal of the auditor of the Scottish Parliament should be independent of the Scottish Executive. That is one of the most critical provisions in amendment No. 244.<br/>
Finally, the funding of the auditor of the Scottish Parliament should not be controlled by the Scottish Executive.<br/>
Those are not theoretical issues, nor are they problems confined to the governance of ramshackle regimes or dubious Governments. For example, to take the last issue of the control of the funding of auditors, in the 1980s the Danish Government cut the funding of their parliamentary auditor, leading to a constitutional uproar in Denmark, which eventually led its Parliament to put into effect a parliamentary audit Act almost identical to our own. That is the sort of problem that can arise as a result of the woolly definition of independence in the Bill.<br/>
The conditions that I have just outlined are the minimum for not just Westminster but the Scottish people to have absolute confidence in the financial probity of the Scottish Executive and Parliament. It is, for example, inconceivable that proper scrutiny arrangements would allow a scrutiny committee that was dominated by the Executive, or that the Scottish Executive should be allowed to control the Scottish Parliament's auditor by controlling his appointment, dismissal and funding.<br/>
The Government say that those are matters for the Scottish Parliament to decide. For the moment, let us put aside the fact that this is UK money that we are talking about. The Government should be clear. Either they are saying that the Scottish Parliament will put in place those minimum requirements, in which case the apparent freedom that it is exercising is illusory and we should properly deal with them here, or they are saying that they are willing to take the risk that it will not put in place such arrangements, with all the dangers that that involves.<br/>
We should remember that we are not simply legislating for the next few years, for the duration of some concordat, or for some other short period. The Scottish Parliament's institutional arrangements are supposed to be permanent. The Government may well in good faith expect the Scottish Parliament to implement similar scrutiny arrangements to those that operate in the House, but no one can predict how a future Scottish Executive, if so determined, might change the rules to hinder scrutiny of their actions.<br/>
One must also understand&#x2014;this goes to the pocket-money Parliament argument, picked up so acutely by the hon. Member for Linlithgow&#x2014;the unique pressure that could face a Scottish Public Accounts Committee. The Scottish Parliament will not raise its own taxes; it will be dependent on another institution for its funding&#x2014;therefore, the action of exposing waste or corruption could place it in the peculiar position of saying, "We wasted this amount of money last year, but can we have some more this year, please?" That would be an invidious position.<br/>
Therefore, it is vital that those minimum safeguards are guaranteed, in the interests of the Scottish voter as well as of the United Kingdom taxpayer in general.<br/>
Even then, no legislation can ever be drafted to prevent the Scottish Parliament or Executive, if so determined, from hindering or constraining the proper audit and scrutiny of their affairs. The House still needs the protection of its own auditor, the Comptroller and Auditor General, having sufficient&#x2014;I use that word carefully&#x2014;access to be able to report independently to Westminster, should the need arise.</p>

<p>Does the right hon. Gentleman agree that in 1977, 1978 and 1979, if it had been possible to find legislation to cover this, those clever men, Bruce Millan and John Smith, would have found it, and those equally clever men, Sir John Garlick, Sir Michael Quinlan and their advisers, would certainly have found it?

<p>The hon. Gentleman again points up the problem of the structure. He is right in his allusion. I am trying to do what I can as a Member of the House and as Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee to influence the Government to go down a route that will make the legislation work as well as it can and ensure, in the Secretary of State's words, the most friction-free arrangement possible, in the interests of the United Kingdom and the people of Scotland.<br/>
Under the Bill, the Comptroller and Auditor General is denied access to the accounts, and he cannot work with the local auditor. Amendment No. 246 seeks to put that right. The aim is not to duplicate audit, nor to curb the actions of the Scottish Parliament's own auditor, his power, independence or range. The amendment is carefully crafted so that the objective can be achieved with a light touch, in co-operation with the Scottish auditor, and in such a way as to give great confidence to Members of this House of Commons and the Scottish Parliament in the disposal of the taxes that they have raised and for which they are accountable.</p>

<p>First, I declare an interest. As we are concentrating on the scrutiny and monitoring of financial arrangements within the new Scottish Parliament, I have to admit, more than anything else, that I am a Scottish chartered accountant. I am a member of the Institute of the Chartered Accountants in Scotland, the oldest accountancy body in the world, which establishes beyond reasonable doubt that the Scots are well able to account for their money and have an honourable and long tradition of so doing.<br/>
The Liberal Democrats broadly agree with the drift of the amendments as far as they go in establishing the principle that we should have adequate scrutiny. But we want to distinguish between proper scrutiny and imposing a financial straitjacket. In amendment No. 81 in the name of the hon. Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) and amendment No. 242 in the name of the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden (Mr. Davis) we see a straitjacket being imposed upon the new Scottish Parliament, essentially requiring some sort of pre-budgetary detailed explanation of where funds must go. People are entitled to say that that surely busts the principle of devolution. The Members of the Scottish Parliament should decide exactly that. Decisions on the financial amounts being passed to the Scottish Parliament should be for it, not this House of Commons.</p>

<p>I recollect a pleasant occasion at the Tait hall in Kelso during the referendum when that question was raised in a slightly different form. It is a genuine problem. How are people whose constituents are involved expected to vote extra moneys, perhaps&#x2014;as under something like Barnett, although they may be reduced&#x2014;to people over whom they have no financial scrutiny rights whatever, to the disadvantage of their constituents?

<p>I remember the debate with the hon. Gentleman with some fondness. It was a busy hall in Kelso that night. Many Conservatives who probably were not out during the election campaign were certainly in evidence in the town hall on that occasion.<br/>
The House of Commons has, for a long time, predating my membership, debated the principles on which the new Parliament is to be established. Members of this House can have no difficulty in knowing that Scottish Members of Parliament will look after the money passed to them with some care and accuracy. We do not dispute the idea that information should be flowing back to this House; it is the manner and style in which it is done that we question. The idea that we should have a straitjacket and that the dead hand of the Treasury should still control what is going on in Scotland to the last tuppence ha'penny is not acceptable.</p>

established and we are glad to support that in this context.

<p>Is not Pandora's box well and truly wide open? The hon. Gentleman referred earlier to the dead hand of the Treasury; he now makes another comment about the Treasury.

Such a position is untenable in a United Kingdom. We are discussing extremely important matters.</p>

<p>I accept that we are discussing important matters but not that we should necessarily accept all the proceedings that go on now, or the gist of them, which is that the Treasury should have so much power and influence. The hon. Gentleman bypasses the fact that the Treasury can go straight to the Scottish Parliament without reference to the Westminster Parliament.<br/>
The essence of what is required for the new Scottish Parliament is that we should devolve responsibility to look after the funds allocated to it, and that those funds should be adequately scrutinised. We should have complete confidence in the Scottish Parliament's ability to do that through the proposed independent Committee. We support those aspects of the amendments.</p>

<p>I find myself trying to come to the rescue of the Unionist forces in this House in terms of their logic and reasoning. Various arguments have been put forward. The right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden (Mr. Davis), and the hon. Members for Woodspring (Dr. Fox) and for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) say that the Government's arrangements skate on thin ice and are extremely dangerous. They say that they will provoke a mentality of "Gie us mair" from a Scottish Parliament, and that that will be the wedge that will break up the United Kingdom. Apparently, that is due to my colleagues and I sitting like cats enjoying the cream. However, it hardly squares with the vote that took place a few minutes ago, when we put forward an alternative arrangement.<br/>
The right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden was kind enough to say that our proposal would have avoided those problems by setting up a line of accountability, but in the Division a few minutes ago he sat and abstained. He did not even vote one way or the other. He has a brave heart when he praises the SNP amendments, but a faint heart when he refuses to go into the Lobbies. We can hardly be accused of the faults which the Unionists see in the Government's arrangements when we put forward a separate line of accountability, which would have avoided those arrangements.<br/>
I think that there are grave deficiencies in the Government's proposals, but how do the Unionist forces propose to deal with them? The hon. Member for Linlithgow says that the Scottish Parliament should submit accounts before it gets any money, as though the


submission of accounts would somehow remove the grievances. I should have thought that putting the Scottish Parliament in a subservient role and giving it a begging-bowl mentality would accentuate the grievances.<br/>
The underlying question put by the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden seems to doubt the Scottish Parliament's ability properly to scrutinise its expenditure. I have just seen a parliamentary answer, which estimates the cost of the new accommodation for Members of Parliament in this place at &#x00A3;250 million.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman has been cut off in his prime. As he develops experience in this House, as he did at St. Andrews university students representative council, he will find a way to change his interventions after helpful guidance from the Chair.<br/>
The proposal for the funding of the Scottish Parliament which has been criticised is not an SNP proposal. The SNP proposal was distinct and clear. It would have set up the clear line of accountability that hon. Members want.<br/>
It is fascinating that we should be attacked for arrangements that are not of our making. The hon. Member for Woodspring claimed that, in the referendum, the question of the SNP being an independence party was not raised&#x2014;<i>[Laughter.]</i> I see the Minister of State laughing. It was an ever present question in every television debate. The Secretary of State and I resolved it by pointing out that it was a matter of choice for the people of Scotland. The people of Scotland were rather happy with the argument that it would be a matter of democratic choice for them.<br/>
I do not know how many interventions the hon. Member for Woodspring made during the referendum campaign. I did not see him as often as I saw the right hon. Member for Devizes (Mr. Ancram). If we had seen him more often, perhaps the Conservatives would have done better in the referendum. That argument was well ventilated during the campaign.<br/>
The proposal outlined by my hon. Friend the Member for North Tayside (Mr. Swinney) would have provided better scrutiny. There would be greater financial accountability if the Scottish Parliament raised its revenue. I am sorry that the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden

disputes that point. The questions dealt with by the Treasury last year on the Scottish financial surplus are conclusive, at least for the years to 1994&#x2013;95.<br/>
Scottish Members will know Mr. Jim Stevens, who is an economist and a member of the Scottish Labour executive. I think he has been called the "Hammer of the Nats", as his views on devolution are sometimes closer to those of the hon. Member for Linlithgow than they are to those of Members on the Labour Front Bench. I have disagreed with Mr. Jim Stevens on just about everything to do with politics and economics in Scotland in the past decade. To his credit, he had the generosity to say that we were right. In <i>The Scotsman</i> on 29 March 1997, he referred to the substantial fiscal surplus in Scotland over the years to 1994&#x2013;95. He said:
<q>I am saying that the SNP are right. The evidence produced from the Scottish Office and the Treasury suggests that they are right.</q>
That may be the first and last time I cite Mr. Jim Stevens in support of my arguments. None the less, as an economist, his pursuit of the truth overrode his political instincts, and he made that concession during the general election campaign.<br/>
I regret that hon. Members who now argue for amendments that contain an artificial proposal for more accountability and for more strings to be attached to the Scottish Parliament did not support the previous set of amendments, which would have established such accountability in a real sense. These amendments do not provide a solution. It is unsatisfactory for a Parliament to have the ability to raise only 3 per cent. of its revenue, but the solution is not to impose checks and balances, and to require accounts and expense claims to be submitted to the Treasury or to this Parliament. That is insulting in the extreme. The solution is to move towards a more financially accountable Parliament.<br/>
The hon. Member for Woodspring says that the Tory amendments would ensure that the Parliament pursues a balanced budget. The Tories doubled the United Kingdom national debt in the space of seven years, yet the hon. Gentleman feels that he is quite entitled to argue at the Dispatch Box that their amendments will impose greater financial accountability on the Scottish Parliament. Does he not realise that people may be insulted to hear that argument from a party that played fast and loose with Scottish resources and with United Kingdom finances?</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman is allowed to enjoy his fantasy, but he may remember that in the 1980s we paid a substantial proportion of the national debt left to us by the Labour Government. However, we shall not go into that.<br/>

<p>The hon. Gentleman should restrain himself. I shall answer in my own way, in my own time. The previous range of amendments would have provided financial accountability. Tory Front-Bench Members chose to abstain, so they cannot now argue that accountability should overlie this parliamentary arrangement. If I were a devolutionist, I would say that devolution is power retained, so that the ultimate power and responsibility is retained by this place. I am sure that the Minister will say something of that sort. The problem for some hon. Members is that they have suddenly realised that that will create tension between the Scottish Parliament and the Westminster Government. That tension is implicit in the proposals. However, I depart from Conservative Members and from the hon. Member for Linlithgow in that I believe that the move to independence will take place not because of the tensions, but because of the growing confidence of the Scottish people as they see the Parliament in operation. It will legislate on subjects in a way that is far superior to the way in which the House has legislated in the past 20 years or more.</p>

<p>I presume, Sir Alan, that I will be in order if I tell the hon. Gentleman why I sat on my hands at the end of the previous debate. The hon.

<p>When the hon. Gentleman has had some experience in the House, he will know that, had my amendments been illegitimate, the Chair would not have selected them for debate and vote. I have known the hon. Gentleman for a long time, and he has not changed many of his habits.<br/>
I have been generous, because I have given way to Conservative Members some seven times. I shall expect reciprocation in future debates.<br/>
Let me summarise my argument. If hon. Members want financial accountability&#x2014;if they want the democratic accountability that goes with a Parliament's ability to raise its own revenue and decide how to spend it&#x2014;they should have followed that logic into the Lobby. There is no way of reproducing such accountability by imposing a straitjacket in the form of amendments that will be seen as insulting&#x2014;almost authoritarian&#x2014;in terms of the Westminster Parliament's relationship with the Scottish Parliament. Either we have an accountable Parliament or we do not, and those who are not prepared to vote for an accountable Parliament are in a very poor position to attack the arrangement that has been made.<br/>
8 pm<br/>
The logic of why the Scottish Parliament is not accountable in terms of financial arrangements comes from the fact that it can raise only 3 per cent. of its revenue through its autonomous tax-raising power. That is the point: if the line of accountability is to be changed, the percentage must be changed, either in the way that we suggested a few moments ago or through some other device&#x2014;some other amendment. The idea that setting up an accounting Committee or supra-Committee, or giving the House a role in overseeing the Parliament, will resolve the difficulties foreseen by Conservative Members and the hon. Member for Linlithgow is fantasy. If anything, such action will exacerbate those difficulties&#x2014;will exacerbate the grievance. Those who, like me, believe that the route to independence is the Scottish people gaining confidence in an institution that develops in a positive manner do not approve of the grievance politics being peddled by the Conservative party.</p>

<p>I shall make two comments about the speech of the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan (Mr. Salmond). First, halfway through his speech he referred to the tensions and frictions that would be created by what is being proposed. I think it fair for the hon. Gentleman to argue&#x2014;as we have argued&#x2014;that tensions and frictions would be involved in the whole arrangement that we discussed in our last big debate, when we voted on the issue. We pointed out then that tensions and frictions were inherent in what we were discussing. But I do not see how the hon. Gentleman can say that the same tensions and frictions will arise from what is actually a technical and parliamentary matter, rather than a matter of fundamental disagreement about levels of public expenditure and the like. I think that the hon. Gentleman grossly exaggerated the impact of the amendment, and approached it from the wrong standpoint.</p>

<p>The amendments imply no more powers than the House has implicitly. The inability of the hon.

<p>Surely the right hon. Gentleman will not seriously argue that anyone in Scotland, or in the Committee, is under any misapprehension about my support for independence throughout my political career.

<p>That is not what I was saying. The hon. Gentleman is extremely good at standing up and making a point that is entirely irrelevant to what has gone before.<br/>
Let me make my second point. The hon. Gentleman argued that, if we were concerned about accountability, we would have voted for his amendment&#x2014;on which he

divided the Committee&#x2014;in the last debate. That amendment, however, sprang from a completely different view of what the Scottish Parliament ought to be, and we naturally were not going to follow its line. The amendment that we are discussing now is concerned entirely with the Scottish Parliament as it is being established by the Bill, and is a much better way of achieving the desired objective. It would be foolish of us to vote in favour of an amendment with whose basic principle we do not agree, rather than an amendment that addresses the Bill as it stands.<br/>
I was unfortunately unable to be present for the Second Reading debate, but I read the report of it thoroughly, and was struck by what had been said by my right hon. Friend the Member for Haltemprice and Howden (Mr. Davis). I noted that the Minister had listened to my right hon. Friend attentively, and had responded sympathetically, saying that there were real issues that needed to be addressed. That is very much my standpoint, and that is why I was keen to participate tonight and to support my right hon. Friend.<br/>
The issue, in fact, is simply about the House's responsibilities in terms of financial probity and value for money&#x2014;but especially financial probity, which is the whole point of the Public Accounts Committee and the Comptroller and Auditor General and his staff. Let me say this to the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan: we are surely discussing an issue of principle, relating to the way in which expenditure authorised by the House is scrutinised to ensure that the money is spent in the way that the House originally intended. The issue is about that, and nothing beyond that. I think that the principle will be breached in a major way if the Comptroller and Auditor General cannot report to the Public Accounts Committee, and the Public Accounts Committee cannot then scrutinise and take evidence on what he has said&#x2014;if that is entirely delegated to the Scottish Parliament. As several of my hon. Friends have said, it is the House of Commons that decides on the amount that goes to the Scottish Parliament&#x2014;</p>

<p>The House of Commons is free to investigate the amount that is sent to the Scottish Parliament. The amendments are about investigating the way in which the money is then spent. Even now, in the Scottish Office, it is for the Secretary of State for Scotland to decide how to shift and allocate money between budgets. The right of the House to investigate the amount that is being sent to Scotland will be unaffected by the legislation.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman's position strikes me as even more curious. He says that in some


ways the House has the ability to scrutinise, but, in the way that matters most to the House, it has no such ability. The general point is that the House can scrutinise the probity of expenditure through the PAC and the Comptroller and Auditor General, but apparently that is the one area from which it excludes itself through the Bill.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman made the fair point that parliamentary Select Committees would be able to call Scottish Ministers and civil servants&#x2014;I presume&#x2014;to appear before them. That is part of the normal process of Select Committees, but the PAC has a different function, and that is the function that is being excluded under the Bill as it stands.<br/>
Let me make two more points. First, there is an important issue that the Minister must meet head on if he is to reject my approach. Clause 90 has already been mentioned, but I must say that it strikes me as an affront to the House to allow Treasury civil servants to demand information that the House cannot demand, and scrutinise it, while the Comptroller and Auditor General apparently cannot do that.<br/>
My other point relates to local government expenditure. The Audit Commission normally scrutinises that&#x2014;just as, presumably, the equivalent of the Comptroller and Auditor General will in the Scottish Parliament. I understand that the Comptroller and Auditor General has the right of access to the Audit Commission and to all Audit Commission papers, and that it would be possible for the Comptroller and Auditor General to recommend to the PAC that an issue needed to be scrutinised in terms of financial probity. That, however, seems to be impossible in relation to a huge chunk of United Kingdom taxpayers' money&#x2014;&#x00A3;14 billion plus.<br/>
Perhaps the Minister will be able to convince me otherwise, but I think that we are setting a dangerous precedent, and creating a loophole in the way in which moneys voted for by the House can be scrutinised not just by Members of Parliament, but with the back-up of staff who do much of the detailed work to unearth whether there is a case to answer. That is why I think that my right hon. Friend&#x2014;who is already doing a splendid job as Chairman of the PAC&#x2014;is fulfilling his role in bringing the issue before the Committee and urging it to accept the amendments. I hope that, if we do not receive a satisfactory and convincing answer tonight on a matter that should concern all hon. Members, the matter will be scrutinised further in another place.</p>

<p>When I used the term "illegitimate" to describe the amendments of the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan (Mr. Salmond), I was being charitable. I might have been tempted to use unparliamentary terms. I described them as illegitimate because the hon. Gentleman is attempting to lead us down a path that it would be interesting to follow, to discuss and to debate&#x2014;perhaps coming up with a different Bill&#x2014;but the time for that has passed.<br/>
The people of Scotland were offered a done deal in the White Paper and it is illegitimate to table a series of amendments that take us away from the White Paper. That is precisely why I took the attitude that I did.</p>

<p>That was the attitude of a Select Committee of the whole House rather than of the Conservative party.<br/>
I wish to remain in order, to be brief and to concentrate on amendment No. 297, which adds the proviso that the total sums that the Scottish Parliament pays out of the fund in any year shall not exceed the amounts that are paid in. That is an essential requirement to ensure that the Parliament's expenditure programme is consistent with the principles of a balanced budget. It is a guarantee against the budget exceeding the Parliament's income in any year. I suspect that it will prevent any posturing in relation to the setting of illegal budgets that are more political than financial.<br/>
Let us consider the pressures under which the parliamentarians may find themselves. Let us suppose that the UK Parliament and the governing party find that they have to take tough decisions, perhaps having voluntarily taken on the spending constraints of a previous Administration. They find that they are able to live within those constraints. However, the Parliament in Scotland, experiencing different social problems, perhaps with unemployment rising in Scotland&#x2014;although not in the rest of the kingdom&#x2014;finds that it is unable to live within those constraints. There will be huge pressure on those parliamentarians at least to posture&#x2014;if they cannot find real money&#x2014;in setting a budget that is well in excess of that which the fund would allow. The amendments are a preventive measure.</p>

<p>I had not intended to speak in the Committee until I was galvanised by listening to the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan (Mr. Salmond) on the monitor. He spoke for a long time, so I listened for a long time, but he did give way often, as he has already said. The key issue in this debate is the financial probity of the House and its responsibility to ensure that money is spent properly and appropriately.<br/>
The problem with the nationalist argument is that it assumes that the sovereignty that will be transferred from the House to the Scottish Parliament is a transfer of absolute sovereignty and supreme responsibility. That is palpably not true. The assembly has democratic legitimacy and a place within a United Kingdom, but it does not have the supreme authority that sovereignty demands. That is retained by this Parliament. Therefore, the duty to ensure financial probity and proper control of expenditure must ultimately still rest with this Parliament. That is the point that the hon. Gentleman ceased to take on board during his contribution.<br/>
8.15 pm<br/>
As my right hon. Friend the Member for South Norfolk (Mr. MacGregor) said, the debate about the responsibility for controlling expenditure is not in itself contentious because the House's powers in that respect are implicit in its role and in its status. The nationalists may not be able to buy that. Although I do not doubt the intentions, integrity or beliefs of the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan, as the official Opposition spokesman, my hon. Friend the Member for North Essex (Mr. Jenkin) said, the truth is that the way in which they were presented to the electorate in Scotland during the referendum was fundamentally dishonest. That is not to say that the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan is dishonest or that he does not genuinely believe in independence for Scotland, but the way in which he dressed up and marketed those beliefs to attract the maximum number of votes&#x2014;for a cocktail of measures with which even he did not agree and which were put together by the Labour party and his own&#x2014;was a fraud and a deception.</p>

<p>With respect to the hon. Gentleman, to whose wisdom, understanding and diligence in these matters I warmly pay tribute, the point that I am making&#x2014;and it is a serious point&#x2014;is that the Scottish nationalists are fundamentally at odds not only with Conservative Members, but with Labour Members. The Scottish nationalists' perception of the role and status of the Scottish Parliament is at odds with the White Paper, the Bill and the view that the House has supreme ultimate authority to ensure that money is spent properly and wisely and that the mechanisms must remain in place to guarantee that authority.</p>

<p>It is a repetition, but clearly the hon. Gentleman does not understand it. His view is a divergence&#x2014;not because of any fundamental debate about the role of Scotland and the role of England-but because he does not recognise the ultimate authority of this Parliament to guarantee probity in expenditure in respect of this Parliament and the new devolved Parliament. That is a fundamental difference, with which the amendments seek to deal.</p>

<p>I want to reflect seriously on the points raised in the debate, in which many hon. Members have made good contributions to a serious subject. It is imperative that the new Parliament takes seriously effective accounting, auditing and value for money. It will enhance the credibility of the Parliament from day one if it has the appropriate procedures, and if it makes clear&#x2014;as I will tonight&#x2014;that every activity of expenditure and monitoring will be taken with the utmost seriousness.<br/>
I have had some discussions with the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden (Mr. Davis), which I hope to reflect in my comments tonight. I also wish to refer to the concerns of the right hon. Member for South Norfolk (Mr. MacGregor), who has long experience in the House. With longevity in this place comes an understanding of the importance of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the PAC. Like many hon. Members, I was a member of the PAC in my first year in the House. It was an experience which has served me well. I should like to reflect the sentiments of that period and the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell).<br/>
We are covering important ground. From the outset, it is important to realise the nature of the Parliament we are establishing. My hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow has a long-standing and principled record of opposing devolution, but he has commented on the procedures to be established in this House and the Scottish Parliament. The Conservatives have made points&#x2014;sometimes not-so-veiled points&#x2014;in relation to their concerns about the Parliament, but have focused on particular issues.<br/>
The Parliament will be a legislative body with law-making powers. Crucially in this context, it will have a clearly defined and separate Executive. That is


important. People may be cynical and have lingering doubts about the Bill, but it is important to make that point. In these circumstances, it is the right&#x2014;indeed the duty&#x2014;of the Scottish Parliament to hold the Executive to account.<br/>
This House must ensure that the Parliament is in a position to hold the Executive to account, but not prescribe every detail of how it is to do that. It is important that the Parliament takes ownership for its own procedures, rather than have these foisted on it. In that way, they are likely to be more successful.<br/>
For those reasons, we said in the White Paper that the detailed arrangements that the Scottish Parliament makes to control and scrutinise the spending of the Scottish Executive will be a matter for the Scottish Parliament and its Committees, but that the Scotland Bill will lay a general obligation on the Parliament to establish effective scrutiny and audit arrangements. The Bill does that. It sets out a framework for the Parliament to legislate for the rules regarding the allocation and approval of expenditure, the accounting and auditing of that expenditure, carrying out value-for-money studies and reporting the results of those to the Parliament.<br/>
It is only a framework. For the reasons I have given, the Parliament must be responsible for the detail. In framing that detail, it can incorporate&#x2014;if it so wishes&#x2014;the suggestions featured in these amendments, such as the establishment of a Committee similar to the Public Accounts Committee. I have no hesitation in saying that I hope that the Parliament will do that. My experience as a member of the Committee was excellent, and it does invaluable work. However, the Parliament should be able to decide on the best way forward, even though my preference would be to go for a Public Accounts Committee.</p>

<p>From the initial discussions that have been held in the consultative committee that the Minister is chairing, does there not seem to be common ground across the political parties to have a Committee structure in the new Parliament which is more powerful and effective than the Committee structure in this House?</p>

<p>I note the hon. Gentleman's sentiment; we should like that to happen. No one can argue that the traditions of this House have not been well served by its auditing, accounting, controlling and monitoring procedures. In some respects, we have an opportunity in the Parliament in Edinburgh to build on this House's success. I shall return to matters such as the designation of accounting officers and the security of tenure of the chief auditor.<br/>
Let me be absolutely clear that there is no difference between the Chairman of the PAC and the Government on the principle of accountability to the Parliament. However, we do differ significantly on how the principles should be put into practice. It is vital that the Parliament holds the Executive to account. But that is its role&#x2014;and not one which this House should attempt to usurp.<br/>
Earlier, we had a discussion about expenditure. The Government believe that the control and scrutiny of the expenditure of the Scottish Parliament should be a matter for the Parliament in Edinburgh. Control and scrutiny of the resources given to the Parliament will still be vested in this Parliament. The Parliament in Edinburgh will be

in charge and will be responsible for what it spends money on, but we must make sure that the grant is properly accounted for and monitored after we have the assigned budget and after the money is given to the Scottish Consolidated Fund. The Bill provides for that.<br/>
The House should not attempt to set out in every detail how the Parliament should go about this task. It will be able to take the best of what we have to offer, but it must be free to adapt the details to its own circumstances.<br/>
We shall ensure that the Parliament and Executive are given the best possible advice in these matters. As I have discussed with the Chairman of the PAC, we have established a consultative steering group and we are setting up an expert panel, which will include the National Audit Office. It will, of course, be up to the Parliament to decide for itself on the basis of the advice it has on the final shape of the arrangements. However, it is a sign of intent and a way of going forward.</p>

<p>It is not a matter of "usurping" the Parliament's power&#x2014;the Minister used that word. However, I find it strange that clause 90 gives the Treasury the ability to require Scottish Ministers to provide any information that the Treasury wants, but not any information that this House wants. The Treasury is to have that power. What mechanism will this House have to scrutinise how money is spent?</p>
</speech>
<speech hansard_id="1232838" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1998-02-12a.636.1" hansard_membership_id="126" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/395" speakername="Mr. McLeish" colnum="636" time="19:45:00">
<p>Clause 90 suggests that, from time to time, information will be required by the Treasury. It is dealing with macro-economic policy and there is no conflict in providing such information. However, there is a very important distinction between that process and democratic debate in the House on the Scottish Parliament's expenditure programmes. Clause 90 is a matter-of-fact clause which rightly allows the Treasury to be provided with information.<br/>
Amendment Nos. 81 and 242 suggest that the House should receive a report of the Executive's spending proposals, as approved by the Parliament, before it votes the Supply for the grant that the Secretary of State will make to the Scottish Consolidated Fund. That would amount to the House's being asked to approve the Scottish Parliament's spending proposals, which is fundamentally at odds with the very essence of devolution. The allocation of resources within the overall budget is quite clearly a matter for the Parliament. It will also be a matter for the Parliament whether to vary the amount of that budget&#x2014;upwards or downwards&#x2014;if it uses the tax-varying power.</p>

<p>Is it not at odds with the principle that a Parliament should be able to monitor the money that it has to raise? It has the obligation of raising the money, and there is a certain principle that those who raise money have a right to monitor it. There are two conflicting imperatives.</p>

<p>I do not see the conflict between the imperatives. Supplying resources from Westminster is one issue; the Scottish Parliament spending those resources is another issue. There are systems&#x2014;in an assigned budget, which is processed in the House, in Supply estimates and in an annual appropriation&#x2014;whereby the Comptroller and


Auditor General will have access, thereby dealing with the central point of the resources that are passed, through grant, to the Scottish Consolidated Fund. The systems would separate Supply from spending proposals, and we believe quite firmly that spending resources in the Scottish Parliament should be a matter for the Scottish Parliament.</p>

<p>I appreciate the hon. Gentleman's point, but there is a problem. I accept that, once the principle of devolution is realised, decisions on how to spend money in the devolved spheres in Scotland will be taken by the Parliament. However, suppose that there are instances in which it is observed not that the principle of expenditure is wrong&#x2014;as that cannot be questioned&#x2014;but that the manner of expenditure is wholly inefficient, and that our constituents' money is being channelled in that way. Is that not the nub of the issue? Is there not a need for some mechanism to allow scrutiny in the House?</p>

<speech hansard_id="1232843" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1998-02-12a.637.1" hansard_membership_id="126" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/395" speakername="Mr. McLeish" colnum="637" time="20:30:00">
<p>That is not the nub of it. If we are involved in serious devolution, the central issue, which some hon. Members find more difficult to grasp than others, is that&#x2014;although we are talking about resources raised by taxation and dealt with by this Parliament in a grant to the Scottish Consolidated Fund&#x2014;a new set of accounting and auditing procedures will be required which will be the responsibility of the Scottish Parliament. I very constructively make the point that there will be no great desire on behalf of anyone in the Scottish Parliament to do anything less than is done at Westminster. Indeed, in the context of United Kingdom politics and Scottish politics, a special premium will be placed on making significant improvements.<br/>
Direction of accounts is dealt with by amendment No. 244 and new clause 3, which suggest the form of accounts, and how they should be constructed and directed by the Treasury. If the Parliament is to hold the Executive to account, it follows that it, and not some external source, should decide on the details of accounting. As I said, we will make available to the Parliament the best advice on those matters.<br/>
The right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden raised the important matter of the designation of accounting officers, which is proposed in amendment No. 244 and new clause 5. We accept the principles that lie behind suggestions that the Parliament should be able to examine officials who may be responsible for misspending and waste, and that officials should be given a clearly separate role as part of the checks and balances necessary for the proper operation of the Executive. Those principles work well in scrutinising expenditure in the House.<br/>
The Scottish Parliament will, of course, have adequate power to legislate on those matters, and it can provide for the appointment of accounting officers if it so wishes. However, given the concerns of the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden, I am willing to give the matter further consideration.<br/>
The second important point is security of tenure of the auditor. We have no quarrel with the principle of security of tenure suggested in amendment No. 244 for the person appointed to carry out, or supervise, the audit of the

accounts. Clearly, that person must be free from control or pressure from either the Parliament or the Executive; and we have already included provision in the Bill for him or her to be independent of both. However, given the concerns that have been expressed, I will undertake to consider whether there needs to be further provision in the Bill to secure his or her independence. I hope that the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden will accept that in the spirit in which it is intended.<br/>
We think that the proposal in amendment No. 244, on the independent auditor's estimates of income, expenditure and remuneration, is unnecessary. The Parliament itself can make the necessary provision for the submission of estimates and provisions for payment of expenses and salary. The Bill has been drafted to allow the Parliament to vote money directly to the auditors, rather than to have them rely on the Executive.<br/>
The establishment of Committees is dealt with in amendment No. 257. The suggestion that the Parliament must have a Committee similar to the House's PAC seems to be at odds with the principle of devolution. There is no doubt that the Parliament will want to have a Committee that embraces the functions performed in the House by the PAC, although it may not be called a Select Committee on Public Accounts; other terminology may be used. However, we accept the spirit of the suggestions that have been made on the matter. Personally, I will have no trouble in establishing a central focus for our activities in the new Parliament.<br/>
The Parliament must consider both the accounts and the auditor's reports. The Bill already provides for that. However, how it does so and its Committee structure will be up to it. There is nothing to stop it having the equivalent of a PAC. Imposing one on it will carry with it unnecessary inflexibility. Clearly, the precise arrangements should be for the Parliament to decide.<br/>
New clause 4 proposes that the Parliament's Standing Orders should make provision for arrangements for scrutinising the accounts of the Executive and for carrying out value-for-money studies. We think that that is unnecessary. Clause 66 already makes adequate provision on both those matters. The Parliament must make provision by or under an Act, setting out the detailed arrangements in those matters. Although it may be possible to encompass some of the arrangements in Standing Orders&#x2014;such as consideration of accounts and reports by the Parliament&#x2014;those are unlikely to be sufficient by themselves. Legislation would be a better vehicle to deliver all that would be required.<br/>
Most of the points so far deal with suggestions designed to ensure that the Parliament has adequate machinery for calling the Executive to account. We appreciate those suggestions, and I shall ensure that my officials take them into account in preparing advice to be put, in due course, to the new Executive and the new Parliament. Generally, however, we do not believe that the proposed level of prescription is necessary or desirable, or consistent with the thrust of our devolution proposals.<br/>
Amendment Nos. 80 and 246 and new clause 3 deal with the locus of the Comptroller and Auditor General, by providing that he should audit the accounts and retain his powers to undertake value-for-money studies and to report results of those activities to the House, and by having the PAC examine relevant officials. Clearly, that would conflict with the principles that I have stated&#x2014;that


it is for the Parliament to hold the Executive to account. To have the House attempt to do so at the same time would only fudge accountability; it would not clarify it.<br/>
Moreover, any circumstances whereby the House and its Officers undertake investigations into the Scottish Executive, or any other body that is accountable to the Parliament, could only be a potential cause of conflict between the two Parliaments. We did not seek to impose dual auditing when we established the devolved administration in Northern Ireland; nor does the Comptroller and Auditor General audit the accounts or conduct value-for-money studies in local authorities.<br/>
I understand the argument that public money&#x2014;money provided by the House&#x2014;is at stake. However, the accounts of the Supply grant for the payments to the Scottish Consolidated Fund will be audited under existing legislation by the Comptroller and Auditor General, laid before the House and open to examination by the PAC. The Bill provides for the Secretary of State to account for other transactions that he may undertake in short-term lending to the Executive and in handling repayment of outstanding loans obtained from the National Loans Fund. Similarly, the Comptroller and Auditor General will audit those accounts and lay them before the House.<br/>
Amendment Nos. 83 and 242 are designed to ensure that the Secretary of State is satisfied that adequate arrangements are in place before he makes any payments to the Consolidated Fund. It will be important for the Parliament to put in place the necessary rules required&#x2014;not only under clause 66 but under clause 62&#x2014;before it takes on full responsibility for accounting and audit. Moreover, it will be important to ensure a smooth transfer of the audit function, particularly if the transfer of executive responsibility occurs during financial year. We will want to present to the House as soon as possible our proposals on transitional arrangements, which will deal with those very important points. We strongly believe that we must have proper procedures in place in Edinburgh before we ask the House to transfer those accounting and auditing responsibilities. I think that that is right, and we will certainly ensure that it will be done, by means of an order.</p>

<p>I thank the right hon. Gentleman for his intervention. He knows that we will discuss the issues many times before the Scottish Parliament is established.<br/>
Let me briefly complete my remarks about the amendments under discussion. The practical effect of amendment No. 296 would be that the Parliament was unable to provide for the salaries and allowances of Members of the Scottish Parliament unless it made them

a statutory charge on the Scottish Consolidated Fund or provided for them to be paid by the Scottish Ministers. Also, it would not be possible for the expenses of the parliamentary corporate body to be paid. It would also mean that the Parliament was unable to vote money directly to the independent auditor and could only arrange for him to be paid by the Administration or for his expenses to be a charge on the fund.<br/>
While amendment No. 297 seems attractive, it is both unnecessary and undesirable for the following reasons. The Scottish Parliament could not effectively budget to live outwith its means, as the Scottish Executive will have no borrowing power on their own account other than the short-term borrowing provided for at clause 63. Moreover, even the short-term borrowing is repayable under such terms as the Treasury may determine&#x2014;including the time scale for repayment.<br/>
Briefly, clause 66 provides for robust financial arrangements where necessary, while leaving the Scottish Parliament the maximum freedom to determine its own procedures. I hope that I have taken seriously the matters raised by hon. Members. I have benefited from the discussions with the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden. Obviously, we shall have further discussions and when we have reflected further on particular points, we shall bring them back before the House. With that contribution, I hope that the amendment will be withdrawn.</p>

<p>I shall resist the temptation to enter into arguments that clearly began more than a quarter of a century ago in St. Andrews university. We shall leave that aside.<br/>
Perhaps in one sense there are two categories of hon. Member: those who have been fortunate enough&#x2014;as the Minister and I have&#x2014;to serve on the Public Accounts Committee and those who have not. I served under three Chairmen: Harold Wilson, John Boyd-Carpenter and Douglas Houghton and I learnt a great deal from them. My hon. Friend has obviously learnt a great deal from his time on the PAC and I accept that he accepts the spirit of what has been said.<br/>
I suppose that my hon. Friend will have further discussions with the audit department. He and I know the importance of transparency, as does anyone who has served on the European Parliament. I served on the Budget Committee and the budget sub-committee under two German chairmen and I learnt a great deal about the importance of transparency. It will have to be worked out. Do I understand that much of the work will be referred to the consultative steering group?</p>

The issue is that they will be under tremendous political pressures to satisfy expectations that have been raised, and that means money. I return to the real problem that



those who raise money expect to do some monitoring, in one form or another, of the way in which the money is spent.</p>

<p>I beg your pardon, Mr. Martin. I was sidetracked.<br/>
If clause 61 is the wedge, clause 62 is the crack in which the nationalists will shove the wedge. If the relationship between Westminster and the Scottish Parliament comes under strain, the consequences will bulge out in terms of the money that the Scottish Parliament wants to spend, but does not have.<br/>
We heard earlier an example of the gulf of misunderstanding between Scottish and English Members over the merits of our respective road systems. That may seem a trite point, but when English Members said that they believed that their roads were less well funded than the roads in Scotland, they were greeted with laughter and derision by Scottish Members.<br/>
We could step back and say that that misunderstanding merely represents our different perspectives. However, such differences&#x2014;and, dare I say, contempt for others'


points of view&#x2014;which have hitherto been expressed behind the closed doors of Cabinet collective responsibility, will now be exposed in all their ugliness in open party political debates in the disputes between Westminster and Edinburgh, with all the lack of tact that modern political debate and the language of politics usually lead to.<br/>
As the relationship degenerates, the Scottish Parliament will, perhaps, come under increasing political pressure to spend more money. It will come under pressure from the continuing debate in Westminster on funding and the Barnett formula, which might mean a progressive annual loss in grant&#x2014;indeed, the Scottish Office has lost grant in the spending round for next year. As that process continues, the Scottish Parliament and Executive may find themselves, in a few years' time, with &#x00A3;1 billion or &#x00A3;2 billion less than they currently have.</p>

The structural funds for building roads may be withdrawn. <i>[Interruption.]</i> The hon. Member for Perth (Ms Cunningham) may scoff, but that was reported in the newspapers this morning.<br/>
When the United Kingdom Parliament considers health service expenditure in Scotland&#x2014;it is 24 per cent. higher per person in Scotland than in England&#x2014;it will argue for a fairer distribution of health resources. As the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan (Mr. Salmond) pointed

<p>My point&#x2014;it is relevant to the amendments&#x2014;concerns how the Executive in Scotland would deal with what they regarded as a shortfall of payments. That brings me to amendment No. 301, and the &#x00A3;500 million borrowing limit, which we do not believe should be increased. As the explanatory note explains, the provisions in clause 63 are for short-term borrowing requirements. Towards the end of the financial year, public sector bodies very often find that they have overspent; if they have a borrowing limit, they will use it to the full or extend their borrowing by delaying payment to their creditors, and so start the following financial year with a further deficit.<br/>
One can imagine the Scottish Parliament using its short-term borrowing facility to continue paying for programmes that were not funded by the Secretary of State, and to tide it over until the beginning of the following financial year.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman made a point about public corporations and other bodies increasing their borrowing towards the end of the financial year.

<p>Yes. It is a well-known fact that&#x2014;<i>[Laughter.]</i> I do not know why the hon. Member for Perth is scoffing in that way. It is a well-known fact that when hospital boards are struggling to treat as many patients as


possible, they delay payments to keep beds open. That has been one of the complaints. Year after year, hospital trusts in England and health authorities, whether in Scotland or England, finish the year with debts that they should not have, which they carry forward into the next financial year and then have to pay off as well as managing their budgets. That is a common problem. There is no reason to believe that the Scottish Parliament will not have similar problems as it will be dealing not merely with hospitals, but with schools and everything else. The Scottish Parliament will need to raise more revenue. Even if it raises the tartan tax, the United Kingdom debate about the Barnett formula could well carry on whittling away the Scottish Executive's budget.</p>

<p>In that case, why was the waiting list money for the national health service&#x2014;it is called the national health service&#x2014;not distributed according to the Barnett formula? The Department of Health and the Treasury thought up a different pretext for distributing it, so that they could distribute more to England, where the waiting list problem was, than to Scotland. If the Minister disputes that, he also disputes the evidence that other hon. Members have put to the House in the past.<br/>
I am describing a degenerating scenario. On many occasions, the Secretary of State has invited us to consider the worst case scenario. I invite the Committee to look at the very worst case scenario&#x2014;a Liverpool scenario. In that case, a local authority wilfully set an illegal budget, borrowed illegally and carried out expenditure programmes for which it had no funding, which put the authorities in an extremely difficult situation. That was only a local authority.<br/>
Under those circumstances, the borrowing limits set in the clause would be likely to be ignored. There is no guarantee that the borrowing limits in clause 64 would be respected. In such circumstances, what powers would this Parliament have? The Minister may well tell us that we would legislate to stabilise the situation, but as we would be dealing not with a local authority, but with a Scottish Parliament, of which a substantial proportion perhaps regarded itself as autonomous, we could be on the way to a serious conflict.<br/>
I shall ask the Minister a few questions about the reasons for the borrowing power and how it is expected to work. What would the borrowing be for? What relationship would the borrowing have with local authority borrowings? How would the Parliament supervise local authority borrowings? How would the liabilities be incurred&#x2014;would the Parliament issue its own loan notes or would there be overdraft facilities and, if so, would they be borrowed from a bank or directly from the Secretary of State? Are we postulating a scenario in which the Secretary of State would ring the Parliament and say, "Sorry, you'll have to borrow a bit because the cheque is in the post"? What if the Scottish Executive should default on their borrowings? What measures are made available in the Bill to deal with that? Why a limit of &#x00A3;500 million? Why not less, or more? Why should we not expect the Scottish Executive to build up a reserve rather than depend on short-term overdrafts to deal with

cash flow fluctuations? What measures would be available under the Bill if borrowing limits were exceeded? How would the Government, or the United Kingdom Parliament, force a future Scottish Executive to live within their borrowing constraints? Who would be liable for borrowing that turned out to have been incurred illegally? In a local authority, that is clear as the councillors are liable. The Minister should answer that question.<br/>
Our amendments are purely for clarification. Amendment No. 298 would make it clear that the borrowing should be subject to the approval of the Treasury and the Chancellor of the Exchequer rather than the Secretary of State. Amendments Nos. 299 and 300 are for the avoidance of doubt and establish that the Treasury should make the decisions. Amendment No. 301 questions whether there should be permission to raise the borrowing limits simply by order or whether it should require primary legislation. There seems to be no reason why the Parliament should not be invited to build up a reserve, rather than depend on short-term borrowing to deal with cash flow fluctuations.<br/>
Finally, in tabling amendment No. 302 to clause 65, we would simply ask why the Bill should contain a power for the Scottish Parliament to borrow in any currency other than sterling. Why would the approval of the Treasury ever be needed for that Parliament to borrow in a foreign currency?</p>

<p>From the seat now occupied by the hon. Member for North Tayside (Mr. Swinney), the late Enoch Powell spent not minutes, but hours on the borrowing requirements, with great effect and great justification. This is a very important issue.<br/>
The excellent notes on clauses provided by the Scottish Office say, on clause 63:
<q>Amounts required for repayment (of principal and interest) are charged on the Scottish Consolidated Fund. The clause also prohibits members of the Scottish Executive from borrowing except under this clause or under any specific power in an Act of Parliament.</q>
What Act of Parliament?<br/>
I do not want to go over all the questions asked by the hon. Member for North Essex (Mr. Jenkin), but may I repeat his question on default? There could be serious over-borrowing&#x2014;in good faith, initially&#x2014;by Departments desperate to fulfil political imperatives in social policy, housing, education and local government. We have to be told what happens if there is a real difficulty in Holyrood on default.<br/>
In view of the time and because I hope that we shall have an opportunity to ask questions on later clauses&#x2014;particularly clause 66&#x2014;I shall leave my contribution at that. I had some of the same questions&#x2014;arrived at from a different direction&#x2014;as the hon. Member for North Essex.

<p>I shall keep my contribution brief. I start with a point of agreement. Like the hon. Members for North Essex (Mr. Jenkin) and for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell), I should like to understand the position on local authority borrowing. It is not clear how that will be affected. I look forward to the Minister's answer.<br/>
The hon. Member for North Essex said that these were probing amendments. I suspect that that means that we can say anything that we like. He almost gave us a lecture


on the near inevitability of the Scottish Parliament being profligate, with heavy borrowing going out of control and no brakes on the system.</p>

<p>That was the implication.<br/>
In 1991&#x2013;92, the public sector borrowing requirement was &#x00A3;21.7 billion; in 1992&#x2013;93, it was &#x00A3;44.5 billion; in 1993&#x2013;94, it was &#x00A3;50.9 billion. I do not remember any Act being breached or any ceiling being reached. Parliament accepted the Executive's view that that level of public sector borrowing was necessary. A lecture from the Conservatives about the inevitability of the Scottish Parliament's finances going out of control is a bit rich.</p>

<p>I did not associate the hon. Gentleman with the remarks about inevitability. I accept the seriousness with which he made his arguments. He has raised some valid issues, as he did in the debate on public accounts. Inevitability was inferable from the remarks of the hon. Member for North Essex.<br/>
My interpretation of the Government's proposals is that they create fairly limited opportunities for sensible financial management and recognise that there will be a bit of ebb and flow in normal public finances. Businesses manage with a cash flow and businesses have borrowing arrangements with their bank managers. The Government's proposals are not dissimilar.<br/>
I am concerned about how borrowing is constrained. I get the impression that a ceiling is being applied, with fairly tight constraints on borrowing. I accept the point of the hon. Member for Linlithgow about the definition in the legislation that constrains borrowing. That is a serious point which must be addressed. On the whole, the proposals are limited in structuring the finances of the Scottish Parliament for the business that it will have to transact.</p>

<p>I associate myself with the remarks of the hon. Member for North Tayside (Mr. Swinney). Conservative Members may not spell it out in words of one syllable, but time after time, the implication of their speeches is that the Scottish Parliament cannot be relied on to act in a civilised manner and that all sorts of constraints must be put on it. The Scottish Parliament will act as well as any other Parliament and, we hope, better than most. It will run its affairs intelligently.<br/>
Clause 63(1) refers to
<q>temporary excess of sums paid".</q>
What is temporary?<br/>
There is also the ceiling, the amount of money that the Scottish Parliament may borrow. What if it decides to fund more of its activities in what might be called a traditional fashion rather than going in for private finance initiatives and other methods of trying to acquire capital that does not count against the system? What if it pays for hospitals, school improvements and the investment

that the Scottish water and sewerage industry so desperately needs by Government borrowing? Local authorities have been mentioned. How will all that be managed? Will it be possible for the Scottish Parliament, within the apparent ceiling of &#x00A3;500 million, to deal with that? Some explanation of Government borrowing to fund such activities and organisations, as well as local government, would be helpful.<br/>
On the Conservative amendments, I do not see how making things subject to the approval of the Chancellor of the Exchequer and inserting "Treasury" instead of "Secretary of State" will fundamentally alter the finances of a Scottish Parliament or the control thereof. The amendments will not achieve what I think is their goal. The Conservatives appear not to want to allow the Scottish Parliament to increase its borrowing.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman may have noticed that under clause 90, all documents and information about the finance of the Scottish Parliament are to be given to the Treasury.

<p>I have never been privileged to be a member of a Government, but I assume that the Secretary of State mentioned in the Bill would occasionally talk to the Treasury, exchange faxes or e-mails, or whatever is used in future, and sort the matter out. Under the Bill, the Secretary of State is supposed to be the liaison between Westminster and the Scottish Parliament, so presumably he would deal with the matter.<br/>
The Conservatives are concerned that the Scottish Parliament will run riot and borrow everything in sight, but it has to borrow from the Treasury. As far as I can tell, the Treasury has to give its approval. According to Tory dogma, the Treasury is all that is sound, sensible and reliable&#x2014;surely it will not allow the Scottish Parliament to go mad and borrow too much.</p>

<p>I think that the hon. Gentleman has fallen into the trap of the Bill by assuming that the Secretary of State mentioned in it is the Secretary of State for Scotland.

My last point&#x2014;I hope to be allowed to get through it without further interruption&#x2014;is that the Conservatives' anti-Europeanism has surfaced even in a Bill about Scotland. The Scots are not to be allowed to borrow ecus or EMUs or whatever. By the time the Bill takes effect and the Scottish Parliament is up and running, sterling may have disappeared, in which case the Scottish Parliament will not be allowed to borrow anything at all.</p>

<p>If we were to enter the single currency, there would be legislation to provide that any reference to sterling in any Act of Parliament would henceforth be taken to refer to euros. I did not want to labour the point, because every time we raise a problem we are told that we must be against the Scottish Parliament, but there is a potential problem. Some local authorities have gone in for curious short-term financial instruments because they were convenient and the authority thought that that would be a good way of earning a little extra revenue. We simply ask: what is the purpose of having a power in the Bill for the Scottish Parliament to borrow in another currency, when we cannot foresee any circumstances in which it might want to do so? The Minister may well come forward with some sensible ideas, but the hon. Gentleman's suggestion is simply ludicrous.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) has raised some good points about a critical part of the Bill.<br/>
In comparison with earlier clauses relating to accountability for money, the terms of clause 63 are restrictive by most standards. I spent 14 years in local government, and I believe that many local government treasurers would be horrified at a limitation on borrowing

powers. According to the notes on clauses, there will be a limitation of &#x00A3;500 million in relation to the turnover of money by the Scottish Parliament, and although that is considerable, it is not a lot of money.<br/>
Our amendments are probing, and we are trying to be helpful. I presume that the clause is concerned mainly with the operation of cash flow in terms of the money available. What does "temporary excess" mean in clause 63(1)(a)? Are we talking about smoothing outflows throughout a 12-month period or beyond that? For example, some health trusts have run deficits and been allowed to roll them over. The totality of money available to the Scottish Parliament will be considerably different from that suggested if the Government take a relaxed view about the annual rollover of funds.<br/>
As for the working balance of the fund, I would imagine that one of between &#x00A3;400 million and &#x00A3;500 million would not be too bad. Perhaps the Minister can confirm that that is what the Government have in mind. Subsection (4) of the clause states
<q>A member of the Scottish Executive may borrow money only under this section or under any power conferred by an Act of Parliament.</q>
In common with the hon. Member for Linlithgow, I should be interested to learn under what other Acts money could be borrowed. It may be a good thing to start off by restricting borrowing, because I presume that any borrowing will have an impact on the public sector borrowing requirement. In the United Kingdom context, therefore, one cannot totally ignore the level of borrowing by the Scottish Parliament.<br/>
We live in a country that has one of the most sophisticated financial centres of the western world, the City of London. Edinburgh is also a major financial centre of the nation. Many sophisticated financial instruments are used as methods of financing various projects. According to the notes on clauses, borrowing is reasonably restricted&#x2014;in effect, &#x00A3;500 million via the Treasury. How will that borrowing relate to leasing agreements? In local government in particular, leasing agreements are made on cars and equipment. On occasions, assets have been sold and leased back. Will such practices be covered within the &#x00A3;500 million of borrowing? An authority's capacity to adjust its budget depending on whether it has sold the parking meters, bits of road or major public buildings is considerable.<br/>
We live in an age of derivatives and various other financial instruments. The hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Mr. Gorrie) mentioned the private finance initiative, which has implications for taxpayers within Scotland. We are trying to probe the limitations on the treasurer or a given member of the Executive who is responsible for finance.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman referred to the Edinburgh finance houses; in practical terms, they represent an extremely important subject. There will be an enormous temptation on the Members of the Holyrood Parliament to press for extra borrowing powers. As surely as night follows day, some members of those finance houses will say, "Why don't you fight to extend the borrowing powers? We would love to accommodate you. We will overcome your short and medium-term problems in any sector that you care to mention. We have the money, and we will do that." There will be great


frustration on the part of the Holyrood Members if they are not able to extend the borrowing powers as offered to them by the Edinburgh financial institutions. Therein lies a considerable pressure to extend the borrowing powers.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman makes a good point. Most of the debate has been about the level of taxation and whether more resources should be pushed north of the border. Given the scale of the cash flow and the turnover of billions of pounds going through to a Scottish Parliament, it is inevitable that the person in charge of financial affairs will try to wriggle within the constraints. Those constraints seem to be reasonably fixed by the Bill. I hope that the Minister will reassure us that that is the case, as there are financial implications for the entire United Kingdom.<br/>
There may be some debate about whether the Scottish Parliament should have more borrowing powers or should have wider powers to use the financial instruments available. As I mentioned, some local authorities have sold buildings, roads, parking meters and other facilities that provide a stream of income. The way in which the Scottish Parliament progresses in terms of its borrowing capacity, leasing and perhaps using the private finance initiative will affect cash flow, education income and everything else, and determine how that assembly works.<br/>
With reference to one of the questions that will be put to the Scottish people&#x2014;the question of the 3p on taxation&#x2014;we heard from the Scottish National party that that relates to only a small portion of money, and we heard from Labour Members that they would not use that to start off with. If Labour controls the assembly, there will be tremendous temptations to look for financial alternatives to finance the Parliament's expenditure. Banks and other institutions, and some of the clever Edinburgh lawyers who are often mentioned in this place, would no doubt look for loopholes and methods by which to finance the political priorities over time.<br/>
I await a reassurance from the Minister that the Bill is as cast-iron as it looks. Are the borrowing powers of &#x00A3;500 million, primarily through the central Government of the United Kingdom, fixed? Are there clear definitions of financial terms such as borrowing, leasing and back-to-back loans? Those terms can become a jungle, and we must be clear, especially as this Parliament has a responsibility to the United Kingdom through the public sector borrowing requirement. If, as is natural, the Scottish Parliament is determined to use such flexibility as it can, that might have overall implications for resources throughout our island.</p>

<p>This group of amendments is vital, as it goes to the heart of the Bill. Once again our discussion reveals the inherent conflict between the powers that the Bill gives to the new Scottish Parliament, and the powers that are reserved to this Parliament. The issues of responsibility and accountability are crucial, and we see yet more uncertainty in the Bill.<br/>
Those who want to see the Scottish Parliament succeed should not be so over-sensitive about its powers. The theme of this debate is like a discussion between a teenager and his parents: "No, I am quite able to do that for myself; "No, I want to watch what you are doing and keep an eye on you." The inherent conflict at this stage of the plan for devolution can only get worse.<br/>
It will be interesting to know whether the Minister envisages the powers of the new Scottish Parliament increasing. Are the powers given by these clauses only the basis for the powers of a Scottish Parliament? Some hon. Members on my left&#x2014;they certainly are on my left&#x2014;representing the Scottish National party envisage the powers of the Scottish Parliament increasing. No legislative assembly operating in any part of the world does not want to see its powers increase. All such bodies look for ways of increasing the powers that they have been given or have taken.<br/>
9.30 pm<br/>
The interesting point is that, by challenging the amendments, the Government are saying implicitly not so much that the House does not trust the new Scottish Parliament&#x2014;although that has been asserted&#x2014;but that they do not trust the House to exercise properly its duties in holding to account the Chancellor of the Exchequer and other Treasury Ministers for public expenditure for which Her Majesty's Treasury is responsible. Only the Chancellor of the Exchequer can answer to the electorate of the whole United Kingdom for tax that is raised from the whole United Kingdom.<br/>
We are talking about that money tonight. Funding for the activities of the new Scottish Parliament will be raised from taxpayers throughout the United Kingdom. The body that is responsible for raising those taxes, and is therefore accountable for spending them, is the Treasury through the Chancellor of the Exchequer and this Westminster Parliament.<br/>
If Parliament is raising the taxes in order to fund the borrowing, it is nonsense to say that it should not be accountable for how they are spent. I am sure that most hon. Members will agree that control of public borrowing must be the responsibility of the body that funds the borrowing.</p>

<p>I have absolute confidence in the way in which Conservative Governments controlled borrowing for 18 years until they lost control of borrowing to the new Labour Government. We shall soon see what a disaster that is for the British people, for business and for the prosperity of the whole economy.<br/>
I remind the hon. Gentleman that borrowing is a cyclical function: when the economy goes up and down, borrowing fluctuates also. There is no doubt that the former Conservative Government controlled the public sector borrowing requirement to a far greater degree than any Labour Government ever did. That was an essential part of the economy's success in the late 1980s and early 1990s. It is sad that the Conservative Government lost control of the PSBR and public borrowing on 1 May.</p>

<p>In reply to one of the hon. Lady's earlier comments, I fear that the teenager may be forced to run away from home. These amendments would

<p>No, certainly not. I thank the hon. Gentleman, but that is not the point. There are constraints on the Scottish Parliament. The point is not where the constraints lie, but who is accountable for the money that is raised to fund the borrowing. It is not reasonable to say that anyone other than the Chancellor of the Exchequer can be accountable for taxes raised in the United Kingdom. Therefore, the amendments are logical and sensible. They can be challenged only by those who do not trust the House and Ministers of this Parliament to carry out their duties properly.</p>

<p>I thank the hon. Lady for giving way once again. Surely many pieces of legislation that pass through the House enable various Secretaries of State to spend from the moneys that are available and do not always require them to refer every piece of expenditure to the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Therefore, why should the various Secretaries of State be treated any differently in this particular enactment?</p>

<p>I must entirely disagree with the hon. Gentleman. Any money that is spent by Secretaries of State who are responsible to the House has come to those Secretaries of State, as the hon. Gentleman said, through the Treasury and the Chancellor of the Exchequer; those Secretaries of State are responsible to the Chancellor of the Exchequer; and the Treasury keeps&#x2014;or it did until 1 May last year, in my experience&#x2014;a firm grip on the spending of any Department of State.<br/>
Therefore, the hon. Gentleman simply emphasises my point. Here we have yet another conflict inherent in the system that the Bill sets up. The hon. Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) has highlighted the conflict itself. If the inherent conflicts that we are discussing are not ironed out now, and if there is not more certainty in the Bill as to how the new Scottish Parliament's financial operation will work, those tensions will increase.<br/>
As a result of that increase in those tensions between the Scottish Parliament and the Westminster Parliament, Scottish National party Members will get their way. There will be a complete lack of confidence in the devolved Parliament because of those tensions and conflicts and, sadly, as I said earlier, that will take us down the slippery slope towards an independent Scotland. That is the great fear.<br/>
It is not the detail that matters here, but the fact that there is in the Government's attitude to the amendments a clear lack of trust between what is envisaged as the new Scottish Parliament and the Parliament at Westminster. It is that lack of trust that will cause those tensions to increase and so allow Scottish National party Members to get their way.<br/>
If we do not get the Bill straight now and allow the devolution plans to work in a reasonable and reasoned way, they will not succeed and we shall go down the slippery slope to a separate Scotland, which is not what I want to see.</p>

<p>I approach the amendment much in the spirit of the hon. Member for North Tayside (Mr. Swinney). It is proper to have amendments Nos. 298 and 299, which are in the spirit of clause 90. They effectively substitute for whomsoever Secretary of State it may be, the Government reality of having to deal with the Treasury. I am not quite so sanguine as my hon. Friend the Member for Poole (Mr. Syms). The amendments will ensure that any money borrowed by the Parliament is approved by the Treasury. That provides yet another safeguard against irresponsible financial behaviour by the Scottish Parliament.<br/>
The Minister will regard my speech as that of yet another Tory who is not prepared to trust the new Parliament. I return to an earlier theme&#x2014;the pressures that the new parliamentarians will be under. They will face tight financial settlements; they will be up against real social problems in Scotland; and they will be unable to secure greater funds from London. One way out is borrowing, with all the sophistication that the modern financial markets can offer. It is in that respect that amendment No. 302 is so appropriate.</p>

<p>May I follow the hon. Member for Poole (Mr. Syms), especially in the light of today's news? Let us suppose that the Scottish Parliament were to embark on a great project, such as a high-speed link under the Irish sea to Ireland, and set it up as a private sector project. If the contract contained a wee clause saying that, in the event of the whole thing going belly-up, it would be bailed out by the Scottish Parliament, would these clauses have to deal with that?</p>

<p>I appreciate that the hour is getting late. To be charitable, there seems to have been some genuine confusion. However, the meaning of the clauses has been completely distorted.<br/>
The general thrust of the clauses is control&#x2014;who is controlling what, and what is the effect of scrutiny? Clause 68 says:
<q>The Secretary of State shall, for each financial year&#x2014;
<ol>
<li>(a) prepare, in such form and manner as the Treasury may direct, an account of sums paid and received by him under sections 63, 64 and 67, and</li>
<li>(b) send the account to the Comptroller and Auditor General&#x2026;</li>

and the Comptroller and Auditor General shall examine, certify and report on the account and shall lay copies of it and of his report before each House of Parliament.</q>

<p>If the hon. Gentleman reads the text of all the clauses subsequent to clauses 63 and 68, he will see that the Comptroller and Auditor General will get reports on those matters. The main point that I am trying to establish is that the powers in the Bill are extremely curtailed. Hon. Members have sought to distort them. The Bill is drafted in such a way as to ensure that the borrowing powers are housekeeping powers. I shall illustrate that point when I deal with the amendments.<br/>
May I answer some of the specific questions that were raised? The Bill does not affect local authorities' powers to borrow. The existing systems of control over borrowing by local authorities and other bodies remain in place.</p>

<p>That is not germane to the clause. The Scottish Parliament has a budget, and any steps that it takes in relation to devolved matters will have a hit on that. It will be up to the Parliament to decide. This matter concerns devolution in the sense that the block provides cash, so decisions that are taken always have a financial penalty.<br/>
Borrowing will involve a charge on the fund. We are discussing the Parliament's ability to act in an irresponsible manner.</p>

<p>I am dealing with clause 63. It is important to deal with the issues at stake because so many distorted comments have been made in relation to our proposals.<br/>
Leasing agreements were also mentioned. Expenditure on finance leases will count against the Parliament's budget at its capital value, as in the current public expenditure survey rules. That will reduce the money available for grant, and will not count against the borrowing limit.<br/>
There was also a question about the word "temporary". That subsection covers sums borrowed over a short time scale: days and weeks, rather than months and years. It puts the housekeeping nature of this arrangement into perspective. The clause is not meant to provide a semi-permanent loan facility to allow the Parliament or Executive to exceed its allocated budget. The phrase may be given more definition in practice by the repayment terms that are set out by the Treasury under clause 63(3), which states:
<q>Sums borrowed under this section shall be repaid to the Secretary of State at such times and by such methods, and interest on them shall be paid to him at such rates and at such times, as the Treasury may from time to time determine.</q>
Every subsection contains formidable checks on borrowing under the rather narrow clause 63.</p>

<p>Yes, I shall follow the usual courtesies.<br/>
Amendment No. 298 would require the Scottish Ministers to seek the approval of the Chancellor of the Exchequer for sums borrowed from the Secretary of State under clause 63(1). Amendments Nos. 299 and 300 would make the Treasury rather than the Secretary of State the lender under the short-term borrowing power. However, all such borrowing is also subject to the provisions in clause 64, which explicitly states that the Treasury may issue to the Secretary of State, out of the National Loans fund, the sums required by him for making loans to the Scottish Ministers under clause 63.<br/>
Clause 63 also provides that the borrowing shall be repaid to the Secretary of State on terms determined by the Treasury. That includes such matters as time scales and methods of repayments and the rates of interest to be paid.<br/>
I am satisfied that those provisions give the Treasury fairly robust powers in relation to such short-term borrowing under clause 63.<br/>
Amendment No. 301 would enable the Secretary of State to reduce as well as increase the ceiling of &#x00A3;500 million for the short-term borrowing power. The ceiling of &#x00A3;500 million specified in clause 64(2) is intended to be just that an upper limit. We expect that borrowing will be well within that limit the majority of the time. Clause 64(3) simply enables that amount to be increased, with the consent of the Treasury, from time to time should it be necessary, such as to deal with unforeseen circumstances.</p>

<p>If the Treasury is responsible for an issue such as the repayment of debt under clause 63(3), it is usual for the statutory provision to specify the Treasury rather than the Secretary of State, as in clause 90. If the Treasury is to be the relevant Department, why should not the Bill say so?</p>

<p>The Secretary of State is much closer to accounting officers, so the strategy used in clause 63 is sensible, given that the Treasury will underpin the arrangements.<br/>
Clause 101 provides that a statutory instrument containing an order under clause 64(3) shall be an affirmative instrument of the House of Commons. There will be ample opportunity for proper consideration by hon. Members.<br/>
Amendment No. 302 would prohibit completely non-sterling borrowing by public bodies. We believe that that is too inflexible. Although we do not expect any great demand for this facility, it is necessary to allow such borrowing should it be required. It is not beyond the bounds of possibility that a public body will want to borrow from a European Union institution, and such borrowing may be available only in euros. This contingency arrangement is designed to give maximum flexibility to the Parliament in those circumstances. Given that non-sterling borrowing can have macro-economic consequences, it is only right and proper for any bodies that want to take advantage of such borrowing first to obtain the consent of Scottish Ministers, who in turn must seek the Treasury's approval. As hon. Members will know, macro-economic concerns are very much a reserved matter.<br/>
There are good financial management reasons for Departments other than the Treasury to undertake lending to public bodies. As I said earlier, Departments are generally closer to their operations and accounting officers than the accounting officer at the Treasury.<br/>
For those reasons I believe that the amendments are unnecessary, and I hope that amendment No. 298 will be withdrawn.</p>

Under the present arrangement, the Scottish Office will distribute borrowing consents to local authorities.

<p>I think that I have made my point.<br/>
Will the Minister answer the other questions that I asked, which he has not answered so far? One of them was raised by the hon. Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell). What happens if the Scottish Executive or the Scottish Parliament defaults on its borrowings? The Minister also gave no explanation or rationale for the figure of &#x00A3;500 million. Was it plucked out of the air?<br/>
In the event of default, what sanctions has this Parliament, or the Government, over the Scottish Executive or the public bodies if borrowing limits are exceeded? How would the Treasury force the Scottish Executive to live within their borrowing constraints, or, indeed, force the Scottish Executive to return moneys that they refused to return? I realise that we are dealing with a worst case scenario, but I think those questions need to be answered.<br/>
I also asked who would be liable in the event of borrowing that turned out to be illegal. I consider that a fair question. We have strict rules relating to local authorities; what are the equivalent rules in this instance?<br/>
The Minister glossed over questions about sale and leaseback. Will the Scottish Parliament be able to enter into such arrangements? Clause 61 deals with sums received by the Scottish Parliament. Must those sums be

paid back in the repayment of loans, or, as currently obtains in the rest of the United Kingdom, must assets disposed of by Departments go back into the Treasury pot? Should there not be an obligation to repay debt on the disposal of such assets?<br/>
I do not feel that the Minister has dealt adequately with a good many questions, particularly the point amplified by the hon. Member for Linlithgow about default.</p>

It is common sense: it allows the Parliament to deal with business as it ebbs and flows throughout the year. The Opposition, however, clearly find it difficult to deal with the issue without trying to distort it and to give us a stronger flavour of their reluctance to acknowledge that devolution for Scots is a serious issue.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend refers to default as a possibility. It is an entirely remote possibility. The serious issue is that this is a mature Parliament dealing with substantial sums of public funds, passed through in grant from this House. It is inconceivable that less responsibility will be exercised in the Scottish Parliament than in the House.<br/>
Comment after comment suggests that Members in the Scottish Parliament will not want to scrutinise or take the responsibility&#x2014;and privilege&#x2014;of spending other people's money as seriously as we do in this House. It is vital that our central proposition is acknowledged. However, if there were default, which I have described as a remote possibility, the Secretary of State can withhold grant. The charge against the Scottish Consolidated Fund is something against which the Parliament cannot vote. Therefore, there are important safeguards in every clause from 63 to 68, but I will set them out in a letter, which we will pass to the Opposition and which will illustrate entirely the implications of the points that have been raised.</p>

<p>I refer to the good notes provided by the Scottish Office. Subsection (4) states:
<q>For the purposes of this section, a person is independent in relation to a function if he is not subject to the direction or control of any member of the Scottish Executive or of the Parliament in exercising that function.</q>
Frankly, this is a query that I promised the Law Society of Scotland I would raise.<br/>
It is noted that an independent person is to be appointed with a supervisory role in respect of Scottish Ministers, the Lord Advocate and other Scottish Departments and statutory bodies. It does not appear particularly clear, however, who might be appointed as such an independent person or indeed who is precluded from appointment. For example, does subsection (4) mean that a Scottish civil servant might not be appointed or is it intended, for example, to be the National Audit Office or a similar body? I believe that my hon. Friend has been briefed on this matter.</p>

<p>It is not accurate to describe the role of the independent person as supervisory. It is an audit function. The Law Society of Scotland complains that it is not clear who might be appointed. Clause 66 sets out several things that the Parliament must provide for, but it does not say what the detail should be. That is properly a matter for the Parliament. The clause sets out a minimum framework. It follows that the Parliament will decide how the audit function is organised. Clause 66(4) means that the chief audit figure may not be a civil servant of the Executive, but will be an entirely separate appointment by the Parliament. The Parliament could decide to appoint the National Audit Office to carry out the audit work, or it could set up a similar body.</p>

<p>May I begin, Mr. Deputy Speaker, by thanking you for the opportunity to raise this issue today? The A3 Kingston bypass is worthy of debate for many reasons. For example, it is reputed to be the busiest stretch of non-motorway road in Europe. It has to accommodate large volumes of traffic on a road designed many years ago for a tiny fraction of that traffic. It is a difficult road on which to drive because the lanes are narrow and traffic is so heavy and fast-moving. Not surprisingly, there are many accidents.<br/>
These are good reasons for debating the A3 Kingston bypass, but they are not the main issue on which I wish to focus today. Instead, I want to focus on the people who live next to the A3&#x2014;the communities on either side of the road which bisects my constituency. In my research and campaigning, I have been horrified by how little attention and weight is given to the needs of these people in the calculations and decision processes of the Highways Agency&#x2014;the body responsible for the A3 and its service roads.<br/>
The shortcomings of the Highways Agency approach was shown recently in a report on the A3 Kingston bypass, entitled "Assessment of accidents involving vehicles leaving the main carriageway on the nearside." The report made the welcome recommendation that the speed limits on the road should be reviewed, but failed to back the case for more verge safety fencing. I believe this failure followed directly from the narrow terms to which the previous Government asked the Highways Agency to operate, and from the flawed statistical methodology the agency has to use. These have to change.<br/>
Even without such systemic changes, it is now vital that something is done to make this stretch of road safer for the people who live alongside it. These residents already live with the pollution and deafening noise from the road. It seems entirely reasonable to ask that they should at least be safe in their homes, protected from traffic accidents.<br/>
To improve safety for local residents, various actions are required. In some places, traffic-calming measures on service roads&#x2014;such as Tolworth rise north&#x2014;would help. Some service roads, such as Hook rise south, would benefit from a reduced speed limit. In other places, such as some stretches of Malden way, blocking the service road where it runs directly and dangerously on to the A3 might be the solution. I ask the Minister urgently to instruct the Highways Agency to consult residents on such options.<br/>
Whatever specific package of improvements might result from such a consultation, I am convinced that any safety improvement programme must contain three essential measures. First, it must provide a reduction in the speed limit, to 50 mph, along the entire stretch of main carriageway. Secondly, there must be measures to ensure proper and rigorous enforcement of such a speed limit. Thirdly, and above all else, safety fences must be installed in the many spots that are still unprotected. I argue for the urgent implementation of those three measures.<br/>
The A3 Kingston bypass is a unique stretch of road. Built before the war, compared with current standards, it is now substandard in many key aspects of its design and construction. The Highways Agency freely admits that, today, no new trunk road would be built to such poor safety standards. However, the bypass should not be compared with a new trunk road: it is more akin to an urban motorway. It is six lanes of fast-moving traffic, snaking through Chessington, Tolworth and New Malden, often at speeds well in excess of the 70 mph limit. That urban speedway has many dangerous features that would be considered totally unacceptable and unsafe on a new trunk road, let alone on a motorway.<br/>
The service roads at either side of the main carriageway are mostly two way, resulting in traffic passing near-side lane to near-side lane, with no safety fences in between, which is extremely disconcerting for drivers new to the road. As for the many entrances to and exits from that busy road, vehicles simply have insufficient room for adequate acceleration or deceleration into or out of the fast-moving A3 traffic. The road design and layout mean that often there are no proper slip roads. Even when there are slip roads on to the A3&#x2014;such as that running from the Tolworth junction, by the Toby Jug pub-people experience real dangers when joining the A3. Several bus stops are still on the main carriageway&#x2014;which would be unimaginable on a motorway and unthinkable on a new stretch of trunk road.<br/>
Undoubtedly, the most dangerous feature for local residents is the high speed of heavy traffic on a road with close proximity to unprotected footpaths and housing. Earlier this week, I met local residents and walked along both sides of the road. They told me how frequently accidents occur&#x2014;once a week in some places. Cars leaving the carriageway and crossing a verge often end up crashing into parked cars, colliding with people's garden walls or smashing into people's houses. It is anyone's guess whether those accidents are all reported or appear in the Highways Agency's statistics, but I doubt that they do.<br/>
Local people told me how vehicles&#x2014;cars and lorries alike&#x2014;with no safety fences to stop them, often cross the near-side verge from the main carriageway on to service roads, simply to avoid queues. Unsurprisingly, such reckless queue jumping often results in accidents or in damage to parked vehicles. It can only be a matter of time before a pedestrian is killed, or even residents sitting in their lounge watching television are killed.<br/>
If the Minister doubts those dangers, I shall recount one relatively recent incident. On 18 January 1997, a Sainsbury's lorry left the main carriageway, crossed the service road and finally crashed into 210 Tolworth rise south. Before this debate, I gave the Minister a copy of a photograph of that dreadful incident. As the verge at that site is sloped and has absolutely no safety barrier, the vehicle left the carriageway and became airborne. It crashed into a house, but caused &#x00A3;135,000 in damage and destruction to two houses. Fortunately, no one was hurt. <br/>
The accident was not the first time that vehicles have ploughed into 210 Tolworth rise south. The resident, Mr. Wouters, told me that his front wall had been knocked down three times. Another time, one Christmas morning, his porch was destroyed. One might ask why he continues to live there. Perhaps, because he served his country in the 6th Airborne, he is reluctant to retreat in the line of fire. However, he should not have to retreat. Mr. Wouters, his wife and their neighbours should have


protection&#x2014;and at the earliest possible opportunity. There is an unanswerable case for safety barriers along that stretch of Tolworth rise south. Indeed, as I walked along the A3, I saw that protection was needed in many places, along Malden way, for example. What makes the problem even more bizarre is that safety barriers are installed in some places and special kerbing in others, yet for some unfathomable reason, a number of places have been left totally unprotected.<br/>
Local feeling is now running high, especially after the recent report from the Highways Agency, rejecting the case for safety barriers. Local residents, especially those from Tolworth rise and Malden way, are so upset that, led by a local young mother, Ms Julie Fisher, they have recently set up the SCAR campaign&#x2014;stop cars, add railings. After years of inaction and excuses, it is clear that they have simply had enough. Having spoken to them and seen the excellent work of Councillor Rev. David Ward on the subject over the years, and having worked on the issue for some months, I can understand residents' frustration.<br/>
Let us start with the report. Even from its introduction, it is clear that it is flawed. It says that it will look at only those accidents involving personal injury. In other words, it ignores the many other accidents that happen almost daily. On that distorted logic, a safety fence can be fitted only when a few injuries and deaths have occurred. It is madness. I hope that the Minister has read the report and that she was as unimpressed as I was by its sometimes illogical and always unconvincing arguments.<br/>
In one part, the report notes that sections of carriageway without safety fences have lower accident rates than sections with safety fences. There is no real attempt to discuss that&#x2014;just the implication that safety fences may contribute to more accidents. With such a finding, one might have expected the Highways Agency to recommend the removal of existing safety fences, yet it does not. Just to show how inconsistent and poor the report is, it goes on to destroy its own argument by admitting that existing safety fencing was, of course, erected in places where accidents were most likely to happen.<br/>
Ministers must not allow decisions to be taken on the basis of reports that, frankly, are even more substandard than the safety features on the A3.<br/>
The report's conclusion that there is no case for more safety fencing is odd, given some of the facts that it sets out. During its 36-month reference period, 341 personal injury accidents were recorded, of which 37 involved vehicles leaving the main carriageway on the near side. Of those, 16 were in areas with no safety fencing. However, of the 21 which occurred where safety fencing was in place, only three resulted in the safety fence being breached&#x2014;in other words, the barriers work.<br/>
Given the number of accidents, the effectiveness of the barriers and the other advantages the barriers would bring&#x2014;such as an end to the dangerous queue jumping via the service road&#x2014;the case for more safety barriers is extremely strong. Yet the report and my meeting with the Highways Agency made it clear to me that those facts were not sufficient to convince the agency to invest in safety.<br/>
So I brought the case directly to the House and the Minister. The Minister may reply that the agency has a long list of competing demands and that there must be a system for prioritising budgets. I do not disagree, but

the current system is wrong. Surely it would be in line with other excellent Government initiatives&#x2014;such as those on drink driving and the 20 mph speed limits&#x2014;for the Minister to instruct the Highways Agency to consider the interests of the local community and not just the road user in its decisions.<br/>
Let me give the Minister another example of problems with the agency's current remit and approach. During my meeting with the Highways Agency, I questioned its representatives closely on the agency's priorities for retrospectively implementing modern safety standards to old trunk roads such as the A3 Kingston bypass. I was told that the agency's priorities did not include safety fences along the verge, so I questioned it about that. I was continually referred to the agency's guidelines, so I asked them to send me a copy. For the record, it was departmental standard TD 19/85 published in June 1985&#x2014;a thrilling read. It makes it clear that, like the accident cluster analysis in the report, the guidelines for retrospectively fitting safety fences and barriers are fundamentally flawed. Section 4 of the document sets that out. It states:
<q>Fences can be retrospectively fitted to verges in cases (a) to (f) set out below.</q>
Let us look at (d). It refers to
<q>obstructions including bridge piers or abutments, posts or large signs and sign gantry legs and trees.</q>
Nowhere do the guidelines mention anything relating to pedestrian safety or the protection of property&#x2014;with of course, the exception of the agency's own property. According to the guidelines, protecting subways is more important than protecting people's homes.<br/>
I hope that the Minister will assure me that she will review those guidelines as a matter of priority, as they cannot be right. In the context of the A3 Kingston bypass, they have resulted, and could continue to result, in substantial amounts of public money being spent on items that are not the top priority for safety for either local residents or the road user.<br/>
Councillors and residents have been given many excuses over the years for inaction on safety barriers. They have, for example, been told that the verge is not wide enough for barriers, yet it is wide enough to install barriers to protect gantries and subways. They have also been told that barriers would reduce visibility for drivers but, with sufficient signing, good design and a reduction in the speed limit, I do not believe that that would be the case. No one believes the excuses any longer.<br/>
I make no apology for being hard on the Highways Agency and its attitude to safety fences, but I want to be fair. I am delighted that, with the agency's help, we seem at long last to be making progress on the speed limit. I understand that it is highly likely that, later this year, the limit will be reduced to 50 mph. Anything that the Minister can do to ensure that the change is made would be heartily welcomed. If she can confirm today that the speed limit will be reduced, that would be excellent news.<br/>
The Minister will know that a reduction in the speed limit is no good unless it can be enforced. I have been told by the Hampton traffic unit that, with current resources, it would be stretched to enforce the limit, so we must also ensure that speed cameras are turned on, that they contain film, that the film is processed and checked and that there are more speed cameras. We must also ensure that it is


made visually clear to motorists that they are entering the reduced speed limit section&#x2014;the signing must be clear and precise.<br/>
This issue is not going to go away. The previous Government failed abysmally to listen. I hope that the new Government will have fresh ears to hear, especially as this is the first time on the Floor of the House that the modern A3 Kingston bypass has been discussed and the views of those who live on the road properly represented.<br/>
I hope that the Minister will assure me that she will ensure that, when the speed limit is reduced and enforced, safety barriers will be installed. If she has any worries about the issue, I extend to her an open invitation from the local residents to visit the site at any time. She will be most welcome, and I am sure such a visit would convince her, as it did me, that urgent action needs to be taken on this matter. My constituents are looking to her for help.</p>

<p>I congratulate the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey) not only on obtaining the debate but on having carried out so much research into issues that are, as he said, of particular concern to his constituents.<br/>
I welcome the opportunity to speak about the A3 Kingston bypass. I am aware that the hon. Gentleman has discussed a number of issues relating to the road with the Highways Agency. The road forms part of an important connection between the M25 and central London, as well as providing for local journeys. It is approximately 9.7 km long, consisting almost entirely of dual three-lane carriageway. It has, as the hon. Gentleman said, a speed limit of 70 mph and lane widths of 3 m.<br/>
I am pleased to inform the hon. Gentleman&#x2014;I hope that he will be pleased to hear it&#x2014;that the Highways Agency has commissioned a planned infrastructure investment study, which will comprise a major review of the maintenance and improvement works. The study will take a long-term look at the road, providing an outline programme for a 40-year period and a more detailed programme for upgrade and improvements that are required over the next four to five years. We believe that that will help to improve co-ordination of works, reduce the impact on road users and result in less disturbance to residents.<br/>
As the hon. Gentleman said, a number of issues affect the Kingston bypass. The Highways Agency has been actively involved in commissioning its consultant agent&#x2014;Parkman Ltd.&#x2014;and the London accident analysis unit to provide in-depth route and accident studies.<br/>
I am aware&#x2014;indeed, the hon. Gentleman made it brilliantly clear&#x2014;that he and his constituents are especially concerned about the provision of near-side safety fencing. I fully understand his wish to protect the occupiers of properties that front the bypass, especially those along the section at Tolworth rise south where, as he so graphically detailed, a heavy goods vehicle left the near-side carriageway on 18 January 1997.<br/>
Following that dreadful incident, it was decided that the Highways Agency should investigate the history of near-side accidents. The London accident analysis unit

was commissioned to carry out an analysis of accidents involving personal injury along the entire length of the A3 Kingston bypass from the A243 Hook road to the A308 Kingston vale. It used, as a basis, accident data collected over a three-year period ending November 1996. There were 341 personal injury accidents, of which 194 involved vehicles on the main carriageway. Of those, 37 involved a vehicle leaving the main carriageway on the near-side.<br/>
The analysis found no evidence of accident clusters, which, for a road such as the A3, are locations where there are three or more injury accidents within three years. The analysis found no such locations on the A3 verges. The study also found, as the hon. Gentleman pointed out, that those sections of the Kingston bypass with safety fencing had a higher incidence of vehicles running off the verge than did sections without verge safety fencing. However, that could be due to existing safety fencing having been erected where it was geographically most likely that vehicles would leave the main carriageway.<br/>
A comparison of personal injury accidents taken from the London accident analysis unit reports for 1994 and 1996 shows that the Kingston bypass has fewer personal injury accidents per kilometre than other trunk roads, borough roads and motorways within Greater London. For the A3 Kingston bypass, typical values are 12 accidents per kilometre. Elsewhere, the figure is nearer 16 accidents per kilometre.<br/>
A key target set by the Secretary of State for the Highways Agency is to contribute to reducing the number of accidents by the year 2000 by a third. One of the ways to achieve the target is to carry out safety schemes where the road environment is believed to contribute to the occurrence of accidents. The identification of suitable locations is not simple. The nature of accidents is such that it is not possible to predict where or when one will occur. Besides the isolated cases, it is known that accidents occur at sites of higher risk and those are identified by clusters of similar types of accidents. Therefore, the Highways Agency targets such sites.<br/>
Reliable data on personal injury accidents are available as a result of the legal requirement to report them. However, I recognise that a number of damage-only accidents will also have occurred. Indeed, residents and their representatives have brought those to the attention of the Highways Agency, for which I am grateful. As yet, there are no reliable records of those and, therefore, the nationally accepted practice is to use injury accidents to decide priorities between sites.<br/>
The criteria used by the Highways Agency for the provision and location of safety fencing are set down in departmental standard TD 19/85, "Safety Fences and Barriers", which is contained in volume 2, section 2 of the "Design Manual for Roads and Bridges". A copy of TD 19/85 is lodged in the House of Commons Library. The then Minister for Roads and Traffic made a statement to Parliament on 17 December 1986, which extended the provision of safety barriers to all dual carriageway trunk road central reserves where it could be shown that that was justified by the traffic using the road. That was to reduce the number of multiple-vehicle crossover incidents.<br/>
The "Safety Fences and Barriers" standard gives advice on the need to protect exceptional local hazards and it is for the designers to consider whether, in their professional experience, safety barriers should be provided. Safety barriers in themselves may present a hazard.<br/>
Verge accidents on the highway, unlike central reserve crossover accidents, usually involve one vehicle. Therefore, continuous-verge barriers are provided at sites of higher risk in accordance with departmental standard TD 19/85.<br/>
The policy of providing vehicle protection only at identified obstructions and hazards is well tested. However, it is under continuous review and is amended in the light of changing circumstances. The Highways Agency and the Transport Research Laboratory are examining accident data to evaluate the case for extending the provision of safety barriers at verges. Safety fencing on the verge should be provided where there are exceptional local hazards involving layout and roadside features. That includes obstructions closer than 4.5 m to the edge of the running carriageway on roads with speed limits above 50 mph. There is no requirement to protect obstructions, including buildings, beyond that point.<br/>
Safety fencing does not always provide the full solution. A safety fence would not have prevented the lorry from leaving the carriageway on 18 January 1997. Safety fences are designed and provided to contain vehicles of up to 1.5 tonnes. Evidence shows that a safety fence would have only a marginal effect on reducing the speed of errant heavy goods vehicles. In many locations on the verge, there is insufficient room to erect safety fencing that complies fully to TD 19/85. Where safety fencing is erected with less clearance than desirable there is an increased risk of accidents. For example, a car hitting a safety fence may be redirected back into a fast-moving traffic stream.<br/>
Another consideration is the effect that safety fencing can have on drivers' stopping sight distance, as the hon. Gentleman said. A safety fence can be an obstruction to a driver's line of vision approaching a bend and inhibit the ability to brake safely and stop before reaching an observed hazard. Other alternatives to protect near-side verges on the A3 such as higher kerbs are not viable. Research has shown that they are not suitable for high-speed roads such the Kingston bypass.<br/>
One positive proposal to come out of the London accident analysis unit's report was a recommendation for a review of the existing 70 mph speed limit on the A3 Kingston bypass. The Highways Agency has discussed the matter with the police, who are keen for the existing limit to be lowered to 50 mph. I trust that the hon. Gentleman will welcome that. Having completed an initial consultation with interested parties, the Highways Agency is proposing to publish draft orders on 20 March 1998 to reduce the speed limit to 50 mph. A statutory objection period of seven weeks will follow before the Highways Agency can make the necessary orders. If no objections are received, it will organise the erection of signing to implement the new speed limit. The works will include the installation of additional speed cameras,

requested by the police to enable the effective enforcement of the new speed limit. The hon. Gentleman said that that was particularly important. It is anticipated that implementation will be completed by summer 1998.<br/>
We believe that the measure will offer benefits to road users and local residents. Research has shown that reducing the speed limit can result in a reduction in the total number of accidents. That is an important principle in the Highways Agency's key objective of achieving a one-third reduction in the number of accidents by 2000.<br/>
I am aware that local residents and councillors have campaigned for a reduction in speed. A petition presented to the Government last year by local residents favoured a 50 mph speed limit. I trust that the residents will recognise that their concerns have been taken into account and something has been done. The Government have a duty to protect road users and residents. A 50 mph limit will strike a balance between the needs of both. Once the Highways Agency has completed the exercise, I shall ask it to monitor the situation and report back to me on the benefits obtained and make recommendations for any further measures.<br/>
There is also the problem of vehicles crossing the near-side verge at certain locations and using the service roads as a short cut when traffic on the A3 is delayed. The most notable example was on 18 December 1997, when a burst water main caused a long tailback and led to a driver intentionally crossing the near-side verge. The vehicle subsequently hit a car parked in the service road. The Highways Agency is aware of the situation, but, because of the specific circumstances and site constraints, it is having difficulty identifying a practical and safe solution. For example, raised kerbs and concrete bollards can create risks.<br/>
For other road users, such as motor cyclists, flexible knockdown bollards do not present a significant deterrent. The Highways Agency will therefore continue to monitor and consider the situation carefully. The service roads are part of the trunk road network, but are more akin to local roads in terms of problems faced by residents. The agency would like to reopen discussions with a view to transferring all service roads to local authorities. They could then be managed as local roads for the sole benefit of local residents.<br/>
Concern has also been raised, and was again tonight by the hon. Gentleman, about the safety of pedestrians, particularly schoolchildren. However, the majority of such journeys are made on footpaths not adjacent to the A3, and we therefore believe that the risks are low. The risk will inevitably be further reduced by the intended reduction in the speed limit. I will, however, ask the Highways Agency to identify any locations where large numbers of pedestrian movements occur on footways immediately adjacent to the A3 carriageways. It will also identify opportunities to implement schemes that encourage reduced dependence on car-borne journeys in support of its Toolkit initiative, which was launched by noble Friend the Minister for Roads on 22 January 1998.<br/>
In conclusion, it is clear that the reduction of speed on the A3 Kingston bypass will have an impact on the entire length of road in terms of reducing accidents. By monitoring the situation closely, the Highways Agency will be able to determine whether the speed limit reductions, combined with action to safeguard areas where exceptional hazards exist, will have the desired

effect. However, I realise that the hon. Gentleman will conclude that that does not go far enough. An open mind will therefore be kept on the issue of safety fencing following the introduction of the 50 mph speed limit, and I will&#x2014;</p>
