	<p pid=".949.6/1">Spending on primary schools in Nottinghamshire has doubled under this Government, but the figures show that Nottinghamshire is seriously disadvantaged against the national norm&mdash;out of 150 local authorities, it is the 129th worst funded. A new funding formula is being put together, so what hope is there for children in Nottinghamshire of a better, fairer and more equitable system from <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-01">1 April</phrase> next year?</p>

	<p pid=".952.1/1">The hon. Gentleman is right: that does not fall within my area of responsibility. If he wants to send me further details, I shall consider them. However, I am sure that he knows that all Government agencies have a responsibility to ensure value for money for the assets that they own. That does not undermine our concern to ensure that, whether we are considering the development of new sixth forms or the expansion of popular and successful schools, we do even more than we have been able to achieve up to now by, for example, changing from <phrase class="date" code="2005-08-01">1 August</phrase> the regulations on the speed and ease with which it is possible to make applications to expand schools. That should ensure that such expansion happens more often.</p>

	<p pid=".962.2/1">I hesitate slightly before I answer, as the last time that I responded to Solicitor-General's questions&mdash;the first time that had done so, in fact&mdash;I had to apologise to the House for the CPS' failure to refer what had happened in a homicide case to a victim's family. The CPS does not always carry out its duty as efficiently as we would prefer, but the procedures exist and are implemented in the vast majority of cases. The CPS' obligations are much more at the forefront of its staff's minds than they ever have been in the past. There has been a remarkable transformation in the CPS, which now acknowledges its responsibility to do justice and to ensure, along with the police, that victims and their families, and witnesses, are informed of what is happening in court cases. Things are changing, and I hope that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1775" name="Vera Baird">the local CPS of my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Redcar (Vera Baird)</phrase> will be at the forefront of that change.</p>

	<p pid=".964.0/1">I hope that there are sufficient protections. The Criminal Justice Act 2003, which applies after <phrase class="date" code="">15 December</phrase> last year, imposes enhanced relevancy tests for submitting evidence that relates to the character of certain individuals. There are three grounds on which evidence of bad character can be admitted: first, if important explanatory material is involved and the court consents to its being admitted; secondly, if its use helps to prove important material issues and, again, the court consents; and, thirdly if the defence and prosecution agree that such material should be put before the court. Significant safeguards therefore exist, but if my hon. Friend is concerned about a certain case, I will happily discuss it with him.</p>

	<p pid=".967.0/1">Will my right hon. Friend comment on the proposed industrial action by cleaners employed by outside contractors, which is, I understand, due to take place next Wednesday? Can the Government use their good offices to try to ensure that people employed by contractors have the same conditions as those directly employed by the House, so that we do not have cleaners who are paid only &pound;5 an hour, with no sickness pay and no pension? That is deplorable. We would not stand for it in our constituencies; we would make our protest, and we should do so here. As for the so-called rest rooms, I visited them only the other day. They are slums on our own doorstep. When we consider our accommodation for Members or Officers, why should our fellow citizens have as rest rooms places that Dickens would have recognized in his time? This is totally unacceptable. We must treat those who clean up after us properly and that includes those who are employed by contractors. Why have contractors in the first place?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2005-07-14.991.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1441" speakername="Gerry Sutcliffe" colnum="991"  time="13:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050714/debtext/50714-14.htm#50714-14_spnew10">
	<p pid=".991.5/1">I am delighted with the quality of our debate on new clause 1, but as Members have said, in discussing it we have to consider the wider context of the Bill, on which there is considerable consensus within the industry, among consumer groups and in all parts of this House. Interestingly, new clause 1 is a joint arrangement between the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats&mdash;a new pact is emerging. That said, I thank the hon. Members for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb) and for Wealden (Charles Hendry) for tabling the new clause, the spirit of which I genuinely accept.</p>
	<p pid=".991.5/2">The new clause raises a very important issue that was been debated in the House and by the Treasury Select Committee, of which the hon. Member for North Norfolk was a member. The Government believe that data sharing is a necessary and important means of ensuring responsible lending, but the issues are wider than just those covered by the Consumer Credit Act 1974. They include other types of lending regulated in other statutes, such as the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, and the important question of data protection, which is regulated by the Data Protection Act 1998. Members of the Association for Payment Clearing Services agreed data sharing principles in 2004 and, among other things, they committed to sharing all data that they are legally able to share.</p>
	<p pid=".991.5/3">The Department of Trade and Industry is discussing measures to improve current levels of data sharing with the credit industry, so we are taking the lead that Members have asked us to take. Such measures include working with the credit industry to determine the case for possible legal changes that would allow the sharing of data on accounts dating back to before lenders routinely sought permission to disclose data for credit reference purposes.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2005-07-14.1011.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1913" speakername="Charles Hendry" colnum="1011"  time="14:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050714/debtext/50714-20.htm#50714-20_spnew4">
	<p pid=".1011.0/1">I am grateful to the Minister, especially for meeting the hon. Member for North Norfolk and me last week to talk about the issue of arrears notices. I am pleased that we have been able to agree on Government amendment No. 7 to help to resolve the problems that would have arisen from the Bill's original wording, to which the hon. Gentleman and I drew attention in Committee. That shows how far we can go when the Minister genuinely understands where we are coming from.</p>
	<p pid=".1011.0/2">The amendment addresses a significant difficulty. In the Bill's original format, there is no distinction between cases in which four payments have been missed in a short period of time, where the borrower is likely to be in arrears, and possibly in some distinct trouble, and cases in which four payments have been missed sporadically, over a much longer period of time. In the latter case, missed payments are likely to have been repaid and amicable arrangements may have been made with the lender. If the Bill does not draw that distinction, lenders will be forced to issue arrears notices to borrowers who, in the latter case, may not be in arrears at all.</p>
	<p pid=".1011.0/3">The problem is an aggregate one that relates most closely to home credit loans repaid on a weekly basis, where missed payments are not uncommon for most customers during their loan agreement. Indeed, on average, most home credit borrowers miss four payments during the period of a loan. A customer on a one-year agreement might miss one payment at Christmas, because of the increased costs at that time of year; a second in the spring because of a child's birthday; a third in the summer simply because they are on holiday the week the collector visited; and a fourth in the autumn for an entirely different reason. On all occasions, they may have notified the credit company and agreed amicably to repay the missed payments at a subsequent point. However, as drafted, the Bill would require the lender to issue an arrears notice on the missing of that fourth payment, despite the fact that the customer was not in arrears.</p>
	<p pid=".1011.0/4">As the Minister said in Committee, the customer would not technically be in arrears. In such circumstances, an arrears notice would cause great stress and concern. It would lead to family tension, as the borrower would be forced to explain why they had been issued with an arrears notice, however user friendly the format of that notice might be, when they would contend they are not in arrears because no additional debts or charges had been incurred.</p>
	<p pid=".1011.0/5">The requirement would also create a bureaucratic nightmare, as potentially every one of the 3 million home credit borrowers would need to be issued with an arrears notice. That also presents a major administrative burden. Assuming that the cost of writing, posting and administration is just &pound;1 a letter, that represents an extra &pound;3 million in administrative costs, which would inevitably be passed on to borrowers in the form of higher charges, and that is the opposite of what the Bill seeks to achieve.</p>
	<p pid=".1011.0/6">By reducing the time-frame in which the four payments must be missed before an arrears notice is required to be issued, from the entire length of the agreement to 20 weeks, we can overcome many of those difficulties. I am particularly pleased that the Minister has responded to our request that the period should be 20 weeks rather than the 26 weeks that he initially proposed. I am grateful for his flexibility. A 20-week period will be far more indicative of a customer in trouble, and will help to reduce the unnecessary distress and bureaucracy caused by issuing incorrect notices. Perhaps raising the number of payments missed from four to six would have helped that further, but I nevertheless welcome the Minister's compromise.</p>
	<p pid=".1011.0/7">I tabled amendment No. 4 to the Bill before I was aware of the exact wording of the Government's amendment, but it remains relevant. I hope that the Minister will not think me churlish after his generosity if I seek to push him one step further. The aim of amendment No. 4 is to ensure that arrears notices will need to be served to customers only if their interests are prejudiced, and that means that they have incurred a charge or penalty on their account. The hon. Member for North Norfolk made that point especially strongly in Committee and it is fundamental to what we seek to achieve.</p>
	<p pid=".1011.0/8">It looks possible that section 9A of the Government's amendment, which states that</p>
	<p pid=".1011.0/9" class="indent">&quot;only amounts resulting from failures by the debtor or hirer to make payments he is required to have made during that period shall be taken into account in determining any shortfall&quot;,</p>
	<p pid=".1011.0/10">addresses that same issue. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1685" name="Michael Fabricant">My hon. Friend the Member for Lichfield (Michael Fabricant)</phrase> mentioned the need for plain English, and I cannot quite understand the exact meaning of the provision. I would be grateful if the Minister clarified the implication of the amendment in that respect.</p>
	<p pid=".1011.0/11">I think that the Minister understands why this issue is so important. We totally agree that arrears notices should be issued where a person is genuinely in growing arrears, but we do not think it right that it should be issued if they may technically be in arrears, but that has no other implication for the borrower. To give an example, if I lend the Minister &pound;100&mdash;I know that that is highly implausible&mdash;to put on the horses this afternoon, he might offer to pay it back in 10 weekly instalments of &pound;10. Of course, as a generous person I would not charge him any interest. If he tells me that he wants to treat Mrs. Sutcliffe to a special night out&mdash;we know that he can get a good deal up in Yorkshire&mdash;and to miss a couple of payments and so pays it back over 12 weeks instead, he would technically be in arrears, but neither of us would believe that to be the case in reality. It would be a reassignment, with no further debt or charge involved. The same is true in most home credit agreements, so the further change&mdash;</p>

	<p pid=".1014.0/1">We must be careful about the principle involved. The first sign of people having debt problems is that they miss payments. That is why we tabled amendment No. 7. It is a dangerous to allow people to miss payments. I feel strongly about that and I hope the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his amendment. It is dangerous and risky.</p>
	<p pid=".1014.0/2">There is some confusion about whether amendment No. 4 relates to clause 9. It relates to clause 10, which deals with running-account credit. There is no difference between default and arrears. They are both breaches of the agreement. I hope the hon. Member for Wealden will reflect on what I and the hon. Member for North Norfolk have said. The amendment may relieve the bureaucratic burden on business but it is dangerous. I hope the hon. Member for Wealden will withdraw it.</p>
	<p pid=".1014.0/3" class="italic">Amendment agreed to.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2005-07-14.1014.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1913" speakername="Charles Hendry" colnum="1014"  time="14:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050714/debtext/50714-21.htm#50714-21_spnew7">
	<p pid=".1014.4/1">Clause 19 is undoubtedly one of the central components of the Bill. As I have said, it determines the thrust of what we are all trying to achieve&mdash;a better, fairer and more responsive system for consumers. Opposition and Government Members have discussed the new unfair relationships test during the Bill's progress through the House, and we all favour that provision, because it replaces the out-of-date &quot;extortionate test&quot;, which has failed to offer consumers adequate protection in a market that has changed beyond all recognition in the past 30 years.</p>
	<p pid=".1014.4/2">The current imbalance, which does not serve consumers' interests, must be addressed, and the new unfairness test is central to achieving that objective. Extensive debate took place in Committee about the nature of the test, and we continue to have serious reservations about the concept of &quot;guilty until proven innocent&quot;, which is alien to British law.</p>
	<p pid=".1014.4/3">We received representations from both sides of the issue in Committee. Lloyds TSB stated:</p>
	<p pid=".1014.4/4" class="indent">&quot;The Bill introduces a new unfair credit relationship test, which means consumers can challenge unfair practices and terms in court. However, the meaning of 'unfair relationship' is vague and the scope of the provision is generally too wide for both consumers and creditors . . . The Bill contains no guidance for consumers as to what constitutes 'fair' or 'unfair' to enable them to identify when they have a valid claim. Similarly, there is no guidance for creditors on how they should conduct themselves to ensure that their actions are not 'unfair'. Unlike comparable legislation in respect of unfair contract terms or financial regulation, there is not even a non-exhaustive list of relevant factors.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1014.4/5">From the other side of the debate, a charity, Credit Action, stated:</p>
	<p pid=".1014.4/6" class="indent">&quot;The presumption that all relations are 'unfair' unless proved otherwise is in itself unfair, excessive and contrary to normal British law.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1014.4/7">We also received representations from the Finance and Leasing Association:</p>
	<p pid=".1014.4/8" class="indent">&quot;We reiterate our support for the principles behind the Consumer Credit Bill. However, the combination of the lack of information regarding the unfairness test and the retrospective nature of the test hugely increases uncertainty within industry and could impact critically on the UK's &pound;235 billion per year securitisation market. This market has to date been a very important source of capital for many lenders. Industry is concerned that the Government have not taken account of the potential for the market to be disrupted by retrospective application of the unfairness test. Market risks may ultimately have to be revised, thereby having an adverse impact on the credit ratings of securitisation transactions. This could increase securitisation costs and ultimately have a negative impact on competition and cost in the consumer credit market.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1014.4/9">Both borrowers and lenders the support the idea that the situation should be clarified, but we will watch the shift to the unfairness test with the greatest care. That concept already exists in employment law&mdash;an employer is assumed to have acted in a discriminatory manner unless he can prove that he has not&mdash;but we are wary of spreading it elsewhere.</p>
	<p pid=".1014.4/10">The focus of amendment No. 5 is that the unfairness test cannot achieve its desired effect unless the present lack of definition about what would be considered &quot;fair&quot; or &quot;unfair&quot; is cleared up. The Bill offers no guidance to consumers or the credit industry on the practices that will fall within or outside the boundaries of that test. Indeed, we do not know where those boundaries lie, which is why both the consumer organisations and the credit companies have asked for greater clarity.</p>
	<p pid=".1014.4/11">The lack of clarity presents problems on both sides. Consumers, without a thorough understanding of their chances of success through the courts, will be deterred from pursuing cases that, if unsuccessful, could only add to their financial difficulties, stress and problems. On Second Reading and in Committee, we heard about how concerned people are about taking such matters to court. They are often people of very limited financial means and, even if they are supported by outside organisations or on legal aid, they are terrified about taking on a multi-billion-pound corporation in the courts.</p>
	<p pid=".1014.4/12">The credit industry, without a thorough understanding of what lending practices will be considered inappropriate, will remain unaware of the changes that it might need to make to ensure that its consumers are protected. As a consequence, lenders will be forced to become more cautious in their lending, achieving exactly the result that the Government least want. Those at the margins will be driven to the least scrupulous lenders, to the loan sharks or to the lenders charging the higher rates of interest.</p>
	<p pid=".1014.4/13">The approach to tackling unfairness in lending must be targeted and consistent. Lenders need certainty from the outset that their contracts are secure and customers with genuine cases need to be clear about where they stand. My amendment aims to reach that level of clarity. It would allow the Office of Fair Trading, under its extended remit as provided for under the Bill, to issue guidance on those circumstances and activities that would be deemed unfair, subject to approval by the Secretary of State. By issuing such guidance, the level playing field that we all want restored will be that much more achievable. The Minister may argue that such guidance is not necessary or that it will somehow act as a constraint, but that argument simply does not hold true, because there are already legislative precedents that show how feasible and effective such guidance can be. The Unfair Contract Terms Act 1997 and the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contract Regulations 1999 demonstrate that it is possible to give sufficient guidance to consumers and creditors by means of a non-exhaustive list of the factors that are relevant to an assessment of fairness.</p>
	<p pid=".1014.4/14">I draw the House's attention to annexe 1 of the directive on unfair commercial practices, which contains an extensive list of commercial circumstances or practices that are considered unfair in all circumstances. It says that misleading commercial practices include:</p>
	<p pid=".1014.4/15" class="indent">&quot;Claiming to be a signatory to a code of conduct when the trader is not . . . Claiming that a code of conduct has an endorsement from a public or other body which it does not have . . . Falsely stating that a product will only be available for a very limited time, or that it will only be available on particular terms for a very limited time, in order to elicit an immediate decision and deprive consumers of sufficient opportunity or time to make an informed choice . . . Establishing, operating or promoting a pyramid promotional scheme where a customer gives consideration for the opportunity to receive compensation that is derived primarily from the introduction of other consumers into the scheme rather than from the sale or consumption of products . . . Passing on materially inaccurate information on market conditions or on the possibility of finding the product with the intention of inducing the consumer to acquire the product at conditions less favourable than normal market conditions&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1014.4/16">and</p>
	<p pid=".1014.4/17" class="indent">&quot;Conducting personal visits to the consumer's home ignoring the consumer's request to leave or not to return except in circumstances and to the extent justified, under national law, to enforce a contractual obligation.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1014.4/18">All hon. Members would endorse those as activities that would be unfair in all circumstances. There is therefore no good reason why a clear standard could not also have been applied to the Bill.</p>
	<p pid=".1014.4/19">I also draw hon. Members' attention to the OFT guidance that was issued to all Standing Committee members by the Minister prior to the proceedings, in which the OFT was able to indicate examples illustrative of scenarios where it would consider imposition to be a requirement on licensees. If the OFT is capable of offering these examples, that clearly demonstrates that it is also capable of issuing guidance and examples relating to unfairness. That is a perfectly logical and sensible follow-on, and it is what the amendment calls for.</p>
	<p pid=".1014.4/20">Unclear and ill-defined legal frameworks do not represent good law making and, in this case, do not represent positive steps towards offering better protection for consumers. We should realise from the precedents that the opportunity is there for us to give the Bill more authority and certainty. I firmly believe that we should seize that opportunity.</p>
	<p pid=".1014.4/21">Amendment No. 3 aims to ensure greater certainty about what is meant by unfair relationships. Further to amendment No. 5, it requires the Office of Fair Trading to publish guidance on the scope of the unfairness test before the provisions on unfair relationships come into force. It would be unfair and inappropriate if the test were introduced before the advice and information was published.</p>
	<p pid=".1014.4/22">The new provisions will clearly have a major impact on the way in which credit companies operate but they are not clear about the extent to which those companies may need to change their practices to conform with the Bill's requirements until they have the information. As we know from the Consumer Credit Act 1974, such changes can take a considerable time to implement. It is therefore right and proper that companies receive as much notice as possible. Any mistakes caused by unnecessary hurrying will impact negatively on the consumer.</p>
	<p pid=".1014.4/23">Let me deal with amendment No. 6 on retrospection. Hon. Members know that the new unfairness test will apply retrospectively to any credit agreement that continues beyond the transitional period, which is set at one year from the date of the commencement of clause 20. Although I do not believe that applying law retrospectively is normally appropriate&mdash;indeed, it often represents bad law making&mdash;it is necessary in the circumstances that we are considering.</p>
	<p pid=".1014.4/24">Many credit agreements run for a considerable length of time. Without a retrospective dimension to the Bill, too many people will be left uncovered by the protection that it offers. Given the extent to which the credit industry has changed in the 30 years since the 1974 Act, that would be unacceptable.</p>
	<p pid=".1014.4/25">Nevertheless, I am worried that the Bill will create substantial unnecessary bureaucracy in relation to retrospection because of the number of shorter-term agreements that could caught in its grasp. For example, an existing credit arrangement that is due to finish a few months beyond the transitional period will be subject to the provisions of the measure because of those few months. The cost, administration and time expended by lenders on adapting their processes to meet the changes will be significant. As we all know, those charges will be passed on to consumers in higher interest rates or additional charges. The amendment therefore excludes those agreements that will expire in two years after the transitional period. I am not wedded to the two-year period and would be willing to consider a shorter time if that would make it easier for the Under-Secretary to accept the principle of the amendment and if he undertook to table a Government amendment in another place. However, the principle is sound. The new rules and regulations would come into force, as currently planned, for agreements that last longer than two years after the one-year transitional period at the end of that transitional period. We should try to keep bureaucracy to a minimum for agreements with only a short time to run. It will ease the transition process for lenders and consequently help to alleviate the risks of consumers bearing extra costs.</p>
	<p pid=".1014.4/26">The amendments therefore emphasise a desire for greater clarity in the Bill. The Under-Secretary has resisted accepting such proposals throughout our proceedings and I suspect that he will do so again, but I hope that, on reflection, having heard the argument once more, he will be prepared to budge.</p>

	<p pid=".1026.2/1" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move, That the Bill be now read the Third time.</p>
	<p pid=".1026.2/2" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">The House has considered the Bill at some length and on several occasions, and I am pleased with the consensus that we share on many of the issues. With the Bill, we are creating a modern framework for the regulation of consumer credit in the United Kingdom. We want a market that is fair and that rewards competitiveness, innovation, choice and enterprise, but we also want to stamp out the irresponsible and unfair lending practices that do so much to harm many consumers. I believe that the Bill fulfils those aims.</p>
	<p pid=".1026.2/3">The Bill is the centrepiece of the most ambitious reform of consumer credit regulation since the early 1970s. The reform process involves not just legislative change, but a cross-Government strategy to tackle the problems of over-indebtedness in our society. Dealing with debt is more than just a consumer credit issue. Among other things, we are looking at why people get into debt problems and how to deal with the causes of those problems. We are funding more face-to-face debt advice for consumers, with &pound;45 million over the next two years from the financial inclusion fund, and we are considering the best ways to tackle the pernicious problem of illegal money lending.</p>
	<p pid=".1026.2/4">This long-awaited Bill has much support from consumer and industry groups and from hon. Members on both sides of the House. I thank hon. Members for contributing to our debates on the Bill. The involvement of all hon. Members who have explained their experiences has been invaluable in developing the Bill. I am grateful, in particular, to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1677" name="David Taylor">my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1751" name="Derek Conway">the hon. Member for Old Bexley and Sidcup (Derek Conway)</phrase>, who chaired the Committee so effectively, and to the hon. Members for Wealden (Charles Hendry) and for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb) and all the other hon. Members who served on the Standing Committee. Hon. Members' support for the Bill is reflected in its swift progress in this Session.</p>
	<p pid=".1026.2/5">From our constituency postbags, we know of the many problems that people suffer because of debt. The debate on Second Reading gave us the chance to hear about many of those problems and the issues that affect business in developing an effective credit market. The Committee sittings offered us a chance to discuss with hon. Members concerns about specific aspects of the Bill.</p>
	<p pid=".1026.2/6">In what I hope will be the final debate on the Bill in the House, I should like to concentrate on a number of issues that have been of interest to hon. Members. In Committee, the hon. Member for Wealden asked many pertinent questions about issues of great detail. As he said, I have written to him to answer those questions, and hon. Members can find copies of those answers in the Library. Although I understand where the hon. Gentleman's concerns are coming from, it is important to remember that the Bill will provide a framework for regulation. It will allow Parliament to impose general requirements that can be fleshed out in secondary legislation. So we will consult on that detail and can adapt it to changing circumstances.</p>
	<p pid=".1026.2/7">Hon. Members will recall that I recently took great care to explain the unfair relationship provisions to the Committee. Those provisions must be considered in the context of the laws that deal with specific unfair practices and terms, as well as the way in which the courts will apply the law, and I will not get involved in that issue again today. We have considered extensive arguments from across the sector, and I believe that those provisions constitute the most effective means for consumers to obtain the redress through the courts, if they choose to take that route when resolving their dispute. The approach taken in the Bill is a solution that provides comprehensive and flexible protection for consumers, while allowing the industry to make credit available to all, not most, consumers and to continue to innovate.</p>
	<p pid=".1026.2/8">Some hon. Members are concerned about the powers of the Office of Fair Trading. We must ask ourselves whether the body that enforces the Consumer Credit Act 1974 should have the power to investigate potential wrong-doing and whether consumers should be able to operate confidently in the market, safe in the knowledge that they are dealing with responsible lenders. The answer to both questions is yes. The Bill will provide a regime that ensures that there is fairness for consumers, that businesses are competitive and that the regulator has the powers that it needs to ensure that is so.</p>
	<p pid=".1026.2/9">The OFT does not have an unfettered power to act. As a public body, it is has a responsibility to act reasonably and proportionately. In relation to its powers under the 1974 Act, it is subject to certain constraints and to an independent appeals tribunal. The powers that the Bill will give to the OFT are an essential foundation for a modern and effective consumer credit market. They are not a luxury. So if we enable the regulators to penalise misconduct, we must also enable consumers to resolve disputes for themselves. That involve introducing a system that is cheap, fair and easy to use. The alternative dispute resolution scheme in the Bill is all those things. It is informal. There is no need for hearings; a dispute can be dealt with in writing and issues can be cleared up over the phone. It can adapt to changes in the market quickly. Not only will it empower consumers to act with confidence in the market, it will also ensure stable competition across the credit sector.</p>
	<p pid=".1026.2/10">In Committee, I noted some suggestions that clause 24 would impose a requirement to be licensed on retailers who do no more than hold on to a card at the point of sale when requested to do so by the card issuer. It is certainly not the Government's intention to include that in the definition of debt administration. At that time, I said that if, on reflection, the clause was wrong in that respect we would table an amendment to clarify the position. Having considered the issue carefully, I have concluded that the definition of &quot;debt administration&quot; does not include holding on to a card at the point of sale when requested to do so, thus no amendment is necessary.</p>
	<p pid=".1026.2/11">Members will be aware of the speed with which the Bill went through Committee, which is an indication of the broad degree of consensus that surrounds it. As it stands, the Bill fulfils everything we set out to do. However, the Government have always listened, and will continue to do so. We have listened to the concerns of Members about the timing of notices of sums in arrears for short-term credit, which we discussed earlier, and have now made an adjustment. In the context of the Bill, I have committed to look further at other issues.</p>
	<p pid=".1026.2/12">I have restated the Government's commitment to look further at the issue of credit card cheques under secondary legislation, and the Department is working on that. Similarly, I have arranged, with my Front-Bench counterparts, to meet the credit card industry on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-18">18 July</phrase>, before the recess, to discuss how industry is addressing, through self-regulation, concerns about unsolicited increases in credit card limits.</p>
	<p pid=".1026.2/13">The Bill enjoys wide support both in the House and among consumer and industry groups. Some aspects of the Bill give rise to concerns, and I have no doubt that they will be explored again in this debate and as the Bill goes through the other place. However, after more than four years' work, I believe that the Bill represents the foundation of a fair and competitive 21st-century consumer credit market. It enhances consumer rights and redress, while giving business confidence that it is competing in fair markets that are fit for the modern world. It encourages effective competition, driven by demanding and discerning consumers.</p>
	<p pid=".1026.2/14">The Bill is important and I commend it to the House.</p>

	<p pid=".1029.0/1">I have been delighted to have the chance to lead for the Opposition on such an important Bill, which will help to bring consumer protection in the UK up to speed with the considerable changes that have taken place in the credit industry in the 30 years since the introduction of the Consumer Credit Act 1974.</p>
	<p pid=".1029.0/2">The extent to which things have changed in terms of the size of the industry, the range of products on offer and the level of indebtedness among consumers shows how outdated that legislation has become and how imperative it is that new measures are introduced to respond to the situation. From the outset, we have made it clear that the Conservatives give the Bill broad support in achieving that goal and we are fully committed to action to root out loan sharks and bad practice, especially as it is the most vulnerable who are usually the hardest hit.</p>
	<p pid=".1029.0/3">We have raised concerns and probed the Minister on a number of issues and problems along the way. That was part of the process of ensuring that we get things right this time and that the Bill can cope with the demands that will be placed on it by future changes in the credit industry. Had the Minister been prepared to say &quot;yes&quot; a few more times, the Bill would have been even better, but we shall leave that to our friends in another place.</p>
	<p pid=".1029.0/4">I pay tribute to Members on both sides of the House for their expertise and for their determination to look after the interests of people preyed on by those who seek to exploit their financial circumstances and their lack of understanding of sharp lending practices. An understanding of the issues and the passion to drive them forward is a good combination and we have been lucky that Members have demonstrated that.</p>
	<p pid=".1029.0/5">Many Members referred to tragic cases where individuals were caught up in a vicious cycle of worsening debt, often caused by unscrupulous lenders and unfair practices. That was an important part of our considerations and it is those lenders and practices that the Bill seeks to stamp out. At the same time, it is important that the Bill does not stifle the ability to operate of credit businesses that behave responsibly and whose services are often of great benefit to individuals and families, especially those on low incomes. We recognise that the overwhelming majority of credit providers act responsibly and the legislation, although it will inevitably affect them, is not targeted at them.</p>
	<p pid=".1029.0/6">As the Minister said at the outset, debt of itself is not bad; it is irresponsible lending that causes the problem. By far one of the most important aspects of the Bill has been the new unfair relationship test, which replaces the old, impractical, extortionate credit test. We support the new test as a means of clamping down on loan sharks and unfair practices but, as the Minister is well aware, we are concerned about the lack of detail. As he knows, we have argued powerfully for that greater detail and we are disappointed that he has not given ground on it. Many of us believe that the Bill will be of less benefit to consumers as a result. It should be Parliament that gives the detail, not the courts, with all the time and huge costs that that will involve. It means that lawyers will benefit rather than borrowers.</p>
	<p pid=".1029.0/7">Many still do not think that the Bill goes far enough. Even the <i>Daily Mirror</i> quoted just this week the chief executive of the Nationwide building society, who said:</p>
	<p pid=".1029.0/8" class="indent">&quot;It is a great shame the opportunity was missed at the Committee stage to improve the Bill. While we support the broad thrust of the Bill, we still don't believe it goes far enough. We strongly urge MPs to grasp this last opportunity to make a real difference to consumers. Some practices, like credit card providers applying payments to the cheapest debt first, remain unfair and can only be to the detriment of the consumer. Any debt counsellor worth their salt would tell you to pay off your most expensive debt first.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1029.0/9">There have been areas where we have tried to make those changes and I am disappointed that we did not succeed in persuading the Government to agree to them.</p>
	<p pid=".1029.0/10">We also welcome the new systems of redress provided through the Financial Ombudsman Service. The Bill also provides expanded powers for the OFT as a means of improving regulation. Again, we agree that better regulation of licensees is a crucial step forward, but we remain concerned that the OFT's powers will go unchecked and that it will be judge and jury. We would like to see more control retained by Government and Parliament over its actions.</p>
	<p pid=".1029.0/11">Another crucial dimension of the Bill is the increased level of information provided to consumers concerning their credit agreements. That, too, is an important step forward towards tipping the balance of power back towards consumers. They need to be granted an equal standing and to have access to appropriate information to make informed choices over their credit decisions. It is also a vital means of helping consumers avoid getting into trouble with their agreements. I am pleased that the Minister has been working with us to ensure success in this respect.</p>
	<p pid=".1029.0/12">I join with the Minister in paying tribute to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1677" name="David Taylor">our two Chairmen, the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1751" name="Derek Conway">my hon. Friend the Member for Old Bexley and Sidcup (Derek Conway)</phrase>, for the way in which they kept us in order during debates. I pay tribute to hon. Members on both sides of the House who have spoken with such passion and commitment on what is an important area for many of our constituents. In particular I pay tribute to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1626" name="Michael Penning">my hon. Friends the Members for Hemel Hempstead (Mike Penning)</phrase>, for Wantage (Mr. Vaizey) and for Hornchurch (James Brokenshire), who as new Members have shown tremendous commitment, understanding and expertise. I do not restrict my comments to Conservative Members. This has been an extremely valuable process on all sides, with many years of expertise brought to bear.</p>
	<p pid=".1029.0/13">We have had a wide-ranging debate. We have focused in particular on issues, such as loan sharks, but we have also discussed a helicopter clause, so that when the Prime Minister's friends need to buy a new helicopter or yacht at short notice, they can be given greater assistance in doing so. We have made progress on those issues. Naturally, I pay tribute to the Minister who has been courteous and charming throughout. He is the natural heir to General de Gaulle and Mrs. Thatcher in being able to say no so forcefully and so often, but I wonder whether perhaps he should move in his next life to the Department for Transport because his sense of direction is remarkable. He always knows where we are coming from and understands where we are heading in every contribution. As I said earlier, it is just a shame he would not help us get there.</p>
	<p pid=".1029.0/14">I thank the officials at the DTI and in the House. Departmental officials must have dreaded yet another list of Hendry questions. No doubt forests were torn down, gallons of ink were expended and writers' cramp inflicted simply to give the Minister the answer as quickly as possible. They have been extraordinarily helpful, too, in providing written replies subsequently. I was particularly struck by the one about my challenge to the Minister to find some fees which had gone down under this Government. They produced an extensive list of Companies House charges. However, I win on points. The Directors Register by e-mail has indeed gone down from &pound;3 to &pound;2.50 but things like the full snapshot of the Directors Register has increased from &pound;60,000 to &pound;120,000. The list shows that the general drive is upward, even if there are some examples of fees that have come down. In any case, the officials have provided a great service, both in Committee and subsequently.</p>
	<p pid=".1029.0/15">The Minister has made a tremendous effort to bring the Bill back to the House so quickly, and we all pay tribute to him for doing so. He should be praised for that, and for consistently dealing with our amendments with great courtesy and good humour. I am pleased with the level of consensus that we have struck throughout the Bill's progress and, although we have not always been able to agree on the detail, we all want to see the same end product&mdash;more protection for consumers, better systems of redress, more access to information and better regulation.</p>
	<p pid=".1029.0/16">I regret that the Government rejected our proposals on matters such as credit card checks and controlling unsolicited increases in credit limits. I sense that most hon. Members supported us and we will look back and regret that we were not more effective. I am also disappointed that some issues were ruled out by the Chair&mdash; although of course we respect that judgment&mdash;such as the amendment on the standardisation of interest rate calculations, which is a matter of tremendous importance.</p>
	<p pid=".1029.0/17">I remain concerned by the complacency about the growing level of debt that we face in this country. The Minister was able to point to the rising value of property and the huge bedrock of capital that supports that debt, but we are seeing a worrying growth in credit card arrears, bad debts, mortgage repossessions and bankruptcies. We need be aware that the problem could be getting worse.</p>
	<p pid=".1029.0/18">We have, however, gone a substantial way to reaching the aims that we set out to achieve and we all look forward to monitoring the Bill's progress. To end on a conciliatory note, I congratulate the Minister once again on his personal commitment to ensuring that the Bill becomes law.</p>

	<p pid=".1044.2/1">Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, for allowing me to raise this important issue in the House and I also want to thank the Minister for responding. He will be aware that the Crays Hill Travellers' site is the largest in the country. Should council plans go ahead, there will be a very large-scale eviction over the coming months of about 50 families who have developed green belt land without authorisation and therefore live, in a sense, on the illegal part of the site.</p>
	<p pid=".1044.2/2">It is a very unfortunate and sad state of affairs. The eviction will cause much heartache for both the settled and Traveller communities. No doubt, when the time comes, the newspapers will be full of pictures of crying children and distressed adults as the bailiffs move in to do their job. There is little doubt that the law as it presently stands is to blame for this situation and I would like to make the Minister aware of why I believe that to be the case. I also want to ask him some specific questions in the hope that we can move the issue forwards and clarify certain matters.</p>
	<p pid=".1044.2/3">The law as it stands is presently inadequate. It can deal with the issue of trespass, but it cannot deal with those who buy green belt or greenfield land and then speedily and illegally develop it. There is no shortage of examples in my constituency of where that has taken place. A relatively recent example occurred two or three years ago near Saddler's Farm roundabout where, over the course of a bank holiday weekend, Travellers built a 6-ft earth mound around the perimeter of a field that they owned. They laid hardcore the next day and the day after that moved the caravans in. The council reacted with stop and enforcement notices, but by the time that they had been served, the development was complete. Consequently, a lengthy planning and appeals process was entered into, which is still ongoing, and meanwhile the illegal development remains. The problem is a result of the law's ineffectiveness, because it allows small illegal sites to become much bigger ones, so the issue becomes much harder and costlier to deal with. That is precisely what happened at the Crays Hill site.</p>
	<p pid=".1044.2/4">The Minister will be aware that, after a long and protracted planning process that involved several enforcement notices, appeals, and public inquiries, Basildon council finally got to the point where they sought authorisation to evict those Travellers who had illegally developed the green belt. However, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister effectively overruled the council in 2003 and gave the Travellers a two-year extension to move on. Instead, the number of caravans on the illegal site increased significantly during that period.</p>
	<p pid=".1044.2/5">Needless to say, the problem has become much harder to deal with, because the number of families involved has increased and the Travellers have had longer to settle down and establish a way of life. Basildon council now has no choice but to evict those Travellers who have broken the rules, as not doing so would send out the very clear signal that the green belt was up for grabs.</p>
	<p pid=".1044.2/6">I want to make it absolutely clear that no one wants to discriminate against a minority. I have tried to make the same point whenever this matter has been discussed over the past few years, but it is only fair to insist that all those who live in a community abide by its laws and regulations. Otherwise, the law-abiding majority are the ones who suffer discrimination. That is important, because there is a minority in the Traveller community&mdash;and I stress that it is a minority&mdash;who in the past have resorted to unwise words on this matter.</p>
	<p pid=".1044.2/7">We in Basildon district have no problems with law-abiding Travellers. The latest figures show that we have more than 100 authorised sites and pitches for the Traveller and Gypsy communities, whereas some neighbouring districts have none at all. We have a long and proud history&mdash;of literally hundreds of years&mdash;of living in harmony with those communities. Indeed, Basildon district has the largest number of authorised caravans in Essex: in 1990, we had 37, and now we have about 180. That is an increase of nearly 500 per cent., and compares with an increase in the same period of roughly 100 per cent. in Essex, and 55 per cent. in England as whole.</p>
	<p pid=".1044.2/8">No one can accuse us of discriminating against Travellers or of being intolerant or racist. All that we ask is that everyone obeys the same set of rules, especially if they wish to live in the community. Clearly, that has not happened at the illegal Crays Hill sites.</p>
	<p pid=".1044.2/9">I want to make it clear, too, that local politics has played no part in the discussion. That important point is worth stressing, and I am not using this debate to play politics with the issue. I first became MP for Billericay four years ago, when Labour controlled Basildon council. I refused to blame the council then, as I believed that the law needed reform. I know that my approach is appreciated by Labour councillors to this day.</p>
	<p pid=".1044.2/10">I am pleased to note that the Opposition Whips are no longer in the Chamber, as I have also made it clear that I believe that the Conservative Government of 1994 were wrong to remove the statutory duty on local authorities to provide authorised sites. That was a bad mistake, and I shall return to it in a moment.</p>
	<p pid=".1044.2/11">What needs to be done? I have no doubt that the law is to blame, as it is outdated and ineffective. We urgently need to adopt a twin-track approach, as outlined in my private Member's Bill, the Greenbelt Protection Bill of 2003. My aim was to change the law, on the one hand by obliging councils to provide authorised sites where there was sufficient demand and for which an honest rent and council taxes could be charged, and on the other by giving them much stronger powers speedily to evict those Travellers who insisted on breaking the law. Also, my Bill would have allowed councils to put right any damage caused and to recover the cost from those who had caused it. Moreover, my Bill provided that those powers would have been available to councils only when the required sites had been provided. I felt that that was the fair way to go about dealing with the problem.</p>
	<p pid=".1044.2/12">I could give further details of the proposals in my Bill, but I refer the Minister to the explanatory notes, of which his Department has a copy. The change in the law that I proposed would have been fair to those Travellers who respect the law and it would have allowed those who do not to be dealt with speedily. That would have prevented the development of the large-scale illegal sites, such as Crays Hill, that are often so much more difficult to deal with.</p>
	<p pid=".1044.2/13">The Government's response to my proposals was disappointing, to say the least. A long consultation was held, which involved many site visits, public hearings and meetings with residents, Travellers, councillors, police and Basildon council's planning department. In addition, I sought&mdash;and had no trouble securing&mdash;very good cross-party support in the Chamber, but the Government blocked my Bill without explanation.</p>
	<p pid=".1044.2/14">After continually raising the issue in Parliament and meeting Ministers from the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and, indeed, the Prime Minister, there are tentative signs that the Government are now at least considering adopting a twin-track approach, but progress is far too slow. I should therefore like to ask the Minister a number of questions, to which I hope he will respond directly.</p>
	<p pid=".1044.2/15">First, the Minister is fully aware that I raised the issue of eviction costs with the Prime Minister, by way of letter, and with the Deputy Prime Minister during Prime Minister's questions last week. The two-year extension given in 2003 to the Travellers at Crays Hill before they must move on has resulted instead in the number of caravans increasing significantly. The precise figures are difficult to come by, but there is no doubt that there has been a significant increase. The cost of eviction has increased accordingly and, according to Basildon council, now stands at about &pound;2 million, which represents approximately 15 per cent. of a year's council tax revenue.</p>
	<p pid=".1044.2/16">Will the Minister now commit the Government to assist Basildon council financially with those increased eviction costs, which are a direct result of the Deputy Prime Minister's decision to give a two-year extension, or will he at least promise to look into the issue? If the answer is no, Ministers are, in effect, unfairly penalising local council tax payers for a mistake made by the Government.</p>
	<p pid=".1044.2/17">The response from the Deputy Prime Minister last week was totally inadequate. He suggested that the money could be better spent on providing land for the Travellers, but such a view displays an ignorance of the situation locally, while nationally, it would spell disaster for our green belt because it would allow Travellers to drive a coach and horses through our planning laws, for there would be no disincentive to buy and illegally develop large chunks of the green belt, as councils would be encouraged by the Government not to meet evictions costs, but to spend the money instead on providing sites.</p>
	<p pid=".1044.2/18">Secondly, will the Minister update me on what progress is being made on the much-needed reform of our planning laws? Many people think that the progress so far has taken far too long, particularly bearing it in mind that the Government have been aware of the issue for a number of years now. The Minister will be aware that two consultation exercises have been instigated&mdash;one to look at the provision of authorised sites, the other to consider whether to give stronger powers to councils&mdash;and I have contributed to both.</p>
	<p pid=".1044.2/19">With regard to authorised sites, in December 2004, the ODPM issued a consultation paper, &quot;Planning for Gypsy and Traveller Sites&quot;. The consultation period ended on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-18">18 March</phrase>. When can local authorities expect to receive the revised guidance that will replace circular 1/94? Does the Minister accept that the provision of sites for Traveller families is a national issue and that it should not be left to a small number of local authorities to provide the majority of the sites? Will the new guidance therefore include measures to require all local authorities, where demand is sufficient, to make adequate provision for Traveller sites?</p>
	<p pid=".1044.2/20">I am concerned to learn that there is talk that the Government have dropped the idea of direction and are instead considering leaving the solution to regional spatial strategies. That simply will not work, for there is nothing to force councils to comply with those strategies, except for the Travellers themselves resorting to the appeals process. The Minister will be aware that paragraph 20 of the draft circular on planning for Traveller sites advised that the regional spatial strategy should include provision for Gypsy sites. Yet the draft east of England plan, published very recently, says nothing about Gypsy sites. The draft spatial strategy is meant to guide development in the east of England for at least the next 20 years, yet no mention is made of Gypsy sites whatsoever. I hope that the Minister will appreciate that such confusion needs to be sorted out by the Government.</p>
	<p pid=".1044.2/21">The Government have consulted on whether to give stronger power to councils. They proposed a 28-day temporary stop notice in response to the pressure to give much stronger powers to councils. Indeed, such notices became law on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-07">7 March</phrase> this year. The main difference from the existing law is that local authorities will have power to serve a temporary stop notice without first serving an enforcement notice. That sounds good, but when we consider the detail and the exemptions the power is actually quite ineffective. Basildon council has several concerns. Within the 28-day period, for example, the local authority has to serve an enforcement notice and a normal stop notice, which gives right of appeal against those notices. However, such an appeal also has the effect of putting into abeyance not only the enforcement and normal stop notices but also the 28-day temporary notice itself. That is a real concern for my local planning department.</p>
	<p pid=".1044.2/22">Meanwhile, in the interim 28-day period, the local authority can indeed prosecute the contravener in the magistrates court for continuing to occupy land in breach of the temporary stop notice. However, the magistrates court is in many respects an inappropriate means for securing an effective deterrent to the breach, because it can usually impose only a fine. In many cases, it is difficult to get someone to court in 28 days if they do not want to be there. All sorts of delaying tactics can be used, such as an application for legal aid or simply not turning up.</p>
	<p pid=".1044.2/23">More important, the new law does not allow local authorities to serve a temporary stop notice against someone who is occupying a caravan where that caravan is their main home, unless it is parked where it is causing a highway danger or there are other exceptional circumstances. It is highly likely that most Travellers will claim that the caravan in question is their main residence and, in fairness, there is a good chance that it will be, so the exemption renders the temporary stop notice next to useless. The fact that the caravan was on green belt land would not entitle a local authority to serve temporary stop notices if that caravan was a main residence.</p>
	<p pid=".1044.2/24">The conclusion is that the law will not help local authorities to take effective, swift action against Traveller families who move on to green belt sites without planning permission. It will certainly not help Basildon council with the situation at Crays Hill. Meanwhile, it must not be forgotten that, even if a stop notice is invoked, it postpones the problem only for four weeks&mdash;thereafter the present ineffective laws kick in.</p>
	<p pid=".1044.2/25">May I ask the Minister to address some other issues? Will he clarify some of the terminology on needs-based assessment under the Housing Act 2004? He will be aware that the Act stipulates that the needs of Gypsy communities should form part of a local authority's homelessness needs assessment&mdash;rightly so. However, little or no methodology has been given as guidance and councils are wondering how to undertake that task. It has been suggested that the number of unauthorised caravans is one way of measuring the needs of local travellers; in other words, if there is a large number, there must be a need. However, in Basildon district, there are about 220 unauthorised caravans&mdash;representing a 700 per cent. increase since 1990&mdash;while some neighbouring districts have very few or none at all, so if that methodology was used, it would suggest that only in Basildon district was there a further requirement for Traveller sites, which is clearly nonsense. Will the Minister clarify the methodology councils are to use to meet their obligations under the Act?</p>
	<p pid=".1044.2/26">Will the Minister update me on the Government's progress, if any, on my proposals for a twin-track approach? During this short debate I have tried to highlight the extent of the problem at the Crays Hill Traveller site, and to show where I believe that Government policy is causing confusion, is ineffective and at least partially to blame. I have suggested the improvements that should be made, as highlighted in my attempt to change the law in 2003. As I have said previously, the Government initially blocked my Bill, but after pressing them in Parliament and after meetings with Ministers and the Prime Minister, who seemed to suggest that my proposals should be examined further, it seems that the Government are at least heading down the road towards the twin-track approach that is required. However, for the reasons previously stated, the Government's proposals to date will not provide the solutions required. Will the Government take a fresh look at my proposals which, as the Minister knows, have good cross-party support and, when he has time, will he get back to me?</p>
	<p pid=".1044.2/27">In conclusion, I hope that the Minister will appreciate that I am not interested in playing politics on the issue. What is required is good law, and the current law is inadequate. Proof of this is that we still have a sad situation in Crays Hill, where a large number of Traveller families will be forcibly evicted, which will cause much pain and anguish. The situation can be avoided in future if the Government grip the problem, but so far from what we know of their proposals, both with regard to the provision of authorised sites and giving councils stronger powers, they are clearly inadequate. Left as they are, they will not solve the problem.</p>
	<p pid=".1044.2/28">A twin-track approach is required. With regard to the provision of authorised sites, clear direction must be given to local authorities, while councils must be given much stronger powers speedily to evict Travellers who insist on breaking the law and to put right any damage. Otherwise, the unnecessary and sad conflict that we have seen in the past between settled and Traveller communities, and that we will see again at Crays Hill in the coming months, will continue and intensify in future in other parts. Given that the Government have been aware of the issue for a good number of years, they have a moral obligation to act, and to act quickly, before too much more pain is caused. I look forward to hearing the Minister's response.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2005-07-14.1052.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1765" speakername="Jim Fitzpatrick" colnum="1052"  time="16:36:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050714/debtext/50714-31.htm#50714-31_spnew5">
	<p pid=".1052.0/1">I am sorry, but we do not accept that. We introduced the two-year extension in an attempt to ameliorate the situation and solve problems. We wanted to provide time to make sure that we did not provoke a crisis for settled communities, Travellers, local authorities and enforcement agencies such as the police service. Problems with evictions could be resolved over the course of time. Obviously, that did not happen in Basildon where, over the two years, the site became bigger and there was no attempt to use local authority powers to restrict the number of people coming on to the site. There is therefore some local responsibility for the fact that the position is more difficult now than it was two years ago. As I have outlined, that is a local statutory responsibility: we do not have that responsibility, and we will not take it upon ourselves.</p>
	<p pid=".1052.0/2">As I was saying, the Government grant available to local authorities this year is &pound;8 million. It is being used to allow local authorities to build new residential sites for rent as well as to refurbish existing sites. Local authorities could do more to deal effectively with unauthorised development, and we plan to provide further help by producing an enforcement toolkit to provide guidance. The purpose of the guidance is to support local authorities and the police in taking whatever action is required to address the local problem that they face. Under powers in the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, as amended by the Planning and Compensation Act 1991, local planning authorities have wide-ranging enforcement powers to deal with unauthorised development, including enforcement notices and stop notices, which carry penalties of up to &pound;20,000 for non-compliance, and injunctions in the High Court or county court that can be used to restrain any actual or expected breach of planning control.</p>
	<p pid=".1052.0/3">Since <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-07">7 March</phrase> this year, local planning authorities have been able to use a new enforcement power&mdash;the temporary stop notice&mdash;where they consider that a breach of planning control has taken place and it is expedient that the activity that amounts to the breach is stopped. Temporary stop notices were introduced by the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004, and they are a new general enforcement power. Temporary stop notices have already been used, and I am aware of at least one case in which they were used both to stop the development of a Gypsy and Traveller site and to prevent caravans from going on to the site. Under the regulations, temporary stop notices can be used to halt all development. They need to be reviewed and, over the longer term, there should be scope to link stronger enforcement with greater site provision. Those measures should go hand in hand both nationally and locally, like measures to tackle unauthorised encampments.</p>
	<p pid=".1052.0/4">I share the hon. Gentleman's concerns that the planning control regime should not appear to encourage unauthorised development. It is clearly unsatisfactory for anyone to carry out development without first obtaining the required planning permission. However, to remove the prospect of retrospective planning permission would excessively penalise those who inadvertently undertook work without permission.</p>
	<p pid=".1052.0/5">The Government's current approach is that development without planning consent or in breach of a consent which has been granted is not an offence, and that criminalisation would be an inappropriate and disproportionate response. The margins between lawful and unlawful development are not sufficiently clear-cut to form an acceptable basis for a new criminal offence.</p>
