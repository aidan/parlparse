<p>The hon. Gentleman may know that some weeks ago I attended the main French agricultural show.

<p>I am sure that my hon. Friend will acknowledge that the three green pound devaluations last year removed the main artificial hindrance to our dairy farmers competing properly. Now that they can compete without the MCAs, there is much greater opportunity for them to take an increased share of our markets and to export dairy products. The House may not appreciate that 50,000 tonnes of butter are sold overseas every year.</p>

<p>It is clear that the family succession provisions in the 1976 Act have not been in the interests of tenants or landowners. The procedure itself has been working as the Act intended, but, as I forecast during the passage of the Bill, it certainly does nothing to preserve the system.</p>

<p>Will the Minister please examine the workings of the Act in Scotland, where it has been operated since before 1976?

<p>Does the hon. Gentleman appreciate that the answer that he gave earlier will cause dismay to the families of tenant farmers? Is he aware that the measure of security which the last Labour Government gave to the sons of tenant farmers was supported by the NFU, and was long overdue? Is he further aware that any attempt by the Government to undermine that legislation will be resisted ferociously by the Labour Party?</p>

<p>As the hon. Gentleman was one of the authors of that dismay, it is strange that he should criticise us. There are no farms to let, and rents are soaring as a by-product of the previous Labour Government's legislation. There must be a new look at the position if young farmers are to be able to take over farms within their means.</p>

<p>I appreciate the considerable efforts that my hon.

<p>We enforce the rules in our waters up to 200 miles, without discrimination against ships of any nation. The problem is that it is up to the individual nation to apply the rules.

<p>Is the Minister aware that it appears that a common fisheries policy that is satisfactory to Britain is being delayed?

<p>As the right hon. Gentleman knows, the common fisheries policy issues are complex and require a great deal of preparation. From the bilateral discussions, I believe that most of our European colleagues are prepared to work constructively towards a resolution. The industry is encountering problems, but only six weeks ago we introduced a scheme on the lines requested by the industry, and involving a sum of money of the size that was asked for by the industry and by the Labour Party.</p>

In this respect, the industry today is no different from what it was many

years ago, and no doubt it will face changes in the future. We hope that at the next Fisheries Ministers Council, which I hope will be in June, we can make progress on these major issues, which will then give us a proper basis for restructuring policies.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, I discussed that subject with the Chancellor of the Exchequer this morning. The banking figures published recently, and the money supply figures published today, indicate that there is still a very high demand for borrowing from manufacturing industry, and also some considerable demand from the personal sector. While that demand remains as high as it is, the interest rate cannot be reduced.</p>

<p>Will my right hon. Friend confirm that pay increases not justified by productivity are the greatest avoidable source of unemployment and that to the

Will my right hon.

<p>I agree with my hon. Friend that where there is a wide gap between high pay increases and increased output, that gap will lead to increased unemployment.

<p>On the earlier part of the question, it is expected that when the inflation rate is announced tomorrow it will be seen to have risen. There are, of course, technical reasons for that. The Budget was earlier this year than last year.

<p>I beg to ask leave to move the Adjournment of the House, under Standing Order No. 9, for the purpose of discussing a specific and important matter that should have urgent consideration, namely,
<q> the deteriorating security situation on the United Kingdom frontier with County Donegal.</q>
I have a specific reason for wishing to move the Adjournment of the House, and that reason was given impetus by the murder yesterday of a 23 year-old workman, who was working on a building site&#x2014;Ballymagroarty&#x2014;close to the border. Indeed, the building site is within a few hundred yards of the border. The young man had no connection with the security forces. He was working with his companions when he was shot by three armed men. They were armed with a hand gun, a rifle and a sub-machine gun. He was shot to death in front of his workmates. He was the second civilian to die

in Northern Ireland at the hands of the IRA in the past few days.<br/>
The issue is important because there has been an apparent change in the IRA's tactics. In addition, it was one of a number of recent serious incidents in that area. It is important also because the Prime Minister will soon be meeting the Prime Minister of the Irish Republic. I think that it would do the Prime Minister a world of good if she heard the views of hon. Members, especially those representing Northern Ireland constituencies before that meeting.</p>

A large number of amendments were selected that were linked to new clause 1. Those amendments and other new clauses have fallen because the Government have removed new clause 1.

<p>I accept, Mr. Speaker, that you were put in an obvious difficulty. When you saw today's Notice Paper you had to make a fresh selection. However, this is not a technicality.

I realise that you are not responsible for that, Mr. Speaker, but the Secretary of State for Social Services has dealt with the House in a cavalier manner that is outrageous.

The marshalled list of amendments today did not contain new clause 1 and the provisional selection list which you had issued did. I do not think that you should be surprised that many of us thought that new clause 1 was still before us, or that the Government still intended to move it. When I rose at the beginning of these proceedings, all that I was seeking was a simple one-phrase indication from the Government that it was not their intention to move the new clause and that its disappearance was no accident but their deliberate intention.</p>

<p>Are you telling the House, Mr. Speaker, that in the debate on new clause 6, we shall be able to range much more widely as a consequence of the Government's removal of new clause 1?

<p>New clause 1, which has been withdrawn, included a schedule referring to dental charges. As I understand it, the schedule will fall.

<p>The hon. Gentleman has helped me a great deal. If new clause 1 was as wide as he says, it is clear that it will not be covered by new clause 6.

<p>Futher to the point of order raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton), Mr. Speaker. We are put in a serious dilemma because new clause 1 referred to dental charges as well as sight testing. We understand from the Government's leak that they will drop the sight-testing charges

but will return on some future date to dental charges. The way in which the Government are operating is denying the Opposition a fair chance to debate the issue.<br/>
As you rightly say, Mr. Speaker, new clause 6 deals with the partially-sighted. You could, Mr. Speaker, stretch a point to allow us to bring in sight testing for the non-disabled. However, I agree that to bring in dental charges would not be in order while discussing new clause 6. The Leader of the House and the Secretary of State are in the Chamber, and we are entitled to a statement from the Government that will clarify their policy.

to continue to be included in the definition of a local authority in section 64(1) of the National Assistance Act 1948.

<p>The matters contained in the clause are directly related to Scotland, an aspect of United Kingdom affairs with which I am not especially familiar. However, the new clause deals with charges for sight testing and the comprehensive treatment in Scotland of those with poor sight. Those people would therefore have come within the provisions of any clause that might have been laid before the House with regard to sight-test charges.<br/>
Shortly before we began debating this new clause, the Government withdrew new clause 1, which also related to charges for optical tests. It dealt with a consultation charge, which is a totally new principle for charging within the Health Service and directly against what the Prime Minister promised during the election. We greet the withdrawal of new clause 1 with almost unalloyed joy. We are afraid only about the horrors that might replace it. We shall fight any charges that the Government attempt to introduce to replace the sight-test charge. There is more joy
<q> in heaven over one sinner that repenteth </q>
and so forth, and with 300 repenting the joy is considerable. That is the first evidence of a U-turn by the Government. We look forward to many more between now and the next election.<br/>

Strong representations have been made that the way in which charges for sight testing were proposed was not necessarily in the best interests of patients. There was the fear that some patients might be deterred from seeking sight testing. We feel strongly that the needs of individual patients must always be considered most carefully. We therefore decided that it would not be right to proceed without further discussion. We hope to put down a modified clause in time for Report.</p>

<p>It might be easier to congratulate the Minister if we knew what he was doing. The reason for the agitation this afternoon is that we have been unable to find out. We shall not complain if the Government are merely getting rid of the obnoxious notion that people should be charged at the point

where they first seek access to the Health Service&#x2014;in this case the opthalmic service. I am delighted that the Government appear to be abandoning the idea that people should be charged for sight testing.<br/>
In the brief remarks that the Minister addressed to us on the new clause he gave the impression that it was merely the arrangement of the charge for sight testing that the Government would modify and come back with at a later stage. It is in the interests of all hon. Members to have a clearer picture of what the Government intend, and at what stage they intend to move further. I am especially anxious about what now seems to be the possibility that when the Bill goes to another place there will be a new clause on sight testing that merely modifies the charge.<br/>
The Minister said that he had received representations that suggested that the manner in which he would seek to obtain these moneys was not satisfactory. That is true. The complaints that have come to me from those who know most about it&#x2014;those engaged in the ophthalmic services&#x2014;have been of that kind. Those involved say that if&#x2014;it is not a matter that they view with enthusiasm&#x2014;further charges are to be imposed on the ophthalmic services, which already bear a heavy proportion of charging, they should be raised by increasing existing ophthalmic charges rather than by charging people for having their sight tested in the first place. That makes very clear the distinction between sight testing and charges, later on, for spectacles, lenses and similar items.<br/>
In what he said this afternoon the Minister made no distinction. He seemed to imply that sight-testing charges were still with us and that there would be an improvement or tidying up of the form.<br/>
Perhaps for the next few moments I may talk about another subject, so that what may be fruitful consultations may continue. Clearly, events are moving fast. Who am I to discourage what could be beneficial developments?<br/>
I should like to summarise my views and those of my hon. Friends. We intensely dislike charges in the National Health Service. We do not want to see them increased. One of the worst points at which to place them is that at which people first seek aid, when diagnosis first


takes place. The dangers that that imposes are already apparent in dentistry. We do not want to import them now into the care of the eye. I am particularly anxious that at a later stage sight-testing charges in a slightly modified form should not be smuggled back into the Bill.<br/>
I do not seek to be carping or hostile to the Minister in making this plea. He owes it to the House to give us a slightly fuller explanation of what I hope are the good intentions of abandoning this principle. I am aware that he is working within financial constraints and that he is under orders to seek savings in various places. If he cannot give us an assurance this afternoon that sight testing will not become a chargeable item he will not have deserved the praise that the hon. Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston (Mrs. Knight) heaped upon him a moment ago. I should be most grateful to him if he would seek a further opportunity in the debate on this new clause to make the position a little clearer.</p>

<p>I am amazed at the mean and ungracious way in which the Opposition, in a typical way, reacted to Government policy and the speech made by my hon. Friend the Minister of State.<br/>
I take the view, as I think do many Government supporters, that the Government have been wholly realistic and sensible in two regards. They said, first, that there would be no cuts in expenditure on the National Health Service. In spite of the difficult economic situation that the Government inherited, they said that they intended to retain the expenditure programmes, however swollen, which they inherited from the previous Administration. I welcome that as a correct allocation of priorities.<br/>
The Government also said that to ensure the most vital services in the National Health Service should continue, there are areas in which additional resources can be raised through charges. I welcome the Government's intention to do that and to raise additional resources in that way. It will mean that some vital areas of the service which may otherwise have to be cut, possibly as a result of the ramifications of the Clegg Commission,

may now be retained in their entirety. I welcome the Government's attitude.</p>

<p>On the question of eye testing and examinations, many of us felt that here was a new principle that had not so far applied in the National Health Service.

However, hitherto we said that the preventive area&#x2014;going to see a general practitioner or to have an eye test&#x2014;should be free of charge. That door should be open on the grounds that we should encourage people, wherever possible, to go at the earliest opportunity, on the principle that in the long run there would be a saving on National Health Service expenditure.</p>

<p>I do not blame the Government for examining all the possible areas in which money may be raised to assist the National Health Service. The Conservative Party talks about open government. It is amazing that when we have spoken to the Government, or when various outside interests have put a case to them, all we received at first were complaints and groans. However, when the Government listened to the arguments they were eventually prepared to concede them. The right hon.

<p>I should like to finish my point first.<br/>
The Opposition demonstrated the height of irresponsibility. When a point is put forward and the Government, having listened to it, eventually agreed that the argument was worthy of recognition and that they were prepared to concede it, surely that is Parliament in action. That is Government listening to outside interests. There are on the Opposition Front Bench two ex-Ministers who held responsibility in this Department. They should have been the first to congratulate the Government on having conceded the point.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman is working hard to earn his keep in the Conservative Party, I agree. He says that


all measures should be considered to raise money for the health service. Does he include those areas to which the Prime Minister referred, when she said, before the last election, that the Conservative Party had no plans to introduce any new charges for the National Health Service?

<p>The right hon. Gentleman is now trying to change the point. I suspect that if I pursued that point I might incur your displeasure, Mr. Deputy Speaker. If I may, I shall stick to the narrow but important point that I have been making.<br/>
The Government deserve great credit for listening to the arguments that were put forward. I hope that it will be possible for my hon. Friend the Minister of State, before the debate is completed, to give a little more indication of what the Government have in mind.<br/>
It is clear that the Opposition are not prepared to treat this extremely serious matter seriously. We are. We are resolved to try to get this matter right and to assist the Government in arriving at an economically sensible solution.<br/>
4.30 pm<br/>
I hope that before the debate is over my hon. Friend will be able to say a little more about the economics of the matter and about the Government's thinking. If, as I hope, the Government have decided, having listened to representations, that it is inappropriate to make charges for examinations, that must surely mean that certain revenue that would otherwise be raised&#x2014;possibly amounting to &#x00A3;10 million or &#x00A3;11 million&#x2014;will no longer be available. I should greatly regret seeing that amount of money sacrificed; it would not be available for other areas of the NHS. Therefore, I hope that my hon. Friend, having conceded the argument on eye examinations, will be able to tell us of other areas within the charging structure in which a similar or equivalent amount of money can be raised.<br/>
I should be prepared to see more charges for appliances. There are what are called the hybrid prescriptions. The interests that argued the case strongly for no payment for examinations said&#x2014;with their realistic approach to the matter, in contrast to that that of the Opposition&#x2014;

that if the Government had to raise money elsewhere they should look at the hybrid prescription or other areas. I should be ready to support the Government if they made proposals, now or later, to raise the equivalent sum on appliances rather than examinations.<br/>
I contrast the Opposition's wholly irresponsible attitude to the matter with the attitude of the Government, who have been prepared to listen to the arguments. I hope that before the debate is over my hon. Friend will be able to give a little more indication as to what the Government have in mind for raising the additional revenue that I am sure we need in order to preserve the basic fabric of the National Health Service.</p>

<p>I should like to return, even if temporarily, to the new clause and the precise reasons why it was tabled. It concerns a small but important number of people who suffer from severe visual handicap and who are expected to make full payment for assistance to their sight.<br/>
My right hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Wythenshawe (Mr. Morris) persuaded the previous Government to make available the money that could have exempted people with severe visual handicap from payment of optical charges. At that stage an anomaly manifested itself as between the law in England and Wales and that in Scotland. In England and Wales such an exemption could have been effected simply by the laying of regulations under existing legislation in the National Health Service Acts. However, to give the equivalent measure of exemption in Scotland would have required primary legislation.<br/>
In order not to upset the sensitivities of the time, the Government decided that primary legislation would be embarked upon for Scotland to allow the laying of regulations to occur at precisely the same time as in England and Wales. There would have been considerable inequity if the laying of regulations and the exemption in England and Wales had not been accompanied by similar regulations and exemptions in Scotland. Although, with the benefit of hindsight, some of us now wish that at least the first measure could have been carried out, it is clear that at the time the inequity would have


been a source of major friction in the country at large.<br/>
It was as a consequence of the outstanding commitment to those who suffered from severe visual handicap that my right hon. Friend the Member for Wythenshawe and a number of right hon. and hon. Members on both sides of the House tabled a Private Member's Bill, the Optical Charges (Exemption) (Scotland) Bill, which would have provided the primary legislation for the Secretary of State for Scotland to lay regulations similar to those in England and Wales. We intend in the clause to provide precisely the power that would have been given in that Bill. It would allow and, we would hope, encourage the Secretary of State for Scotland to introduce regulations allowing for the exemption of those with severe visual handicap.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend is probably right if he is referring to the Government's laying the regulations and even making available the money to make the laying of regulations meaningful. I shall come on to that matter shortly.<br/>
I should like to emphasise the great problems experienced by those with severe visual handicap who are not classified as being completely blind. My hon. Friend the Member for Coatbridge and Airdrie (Mr. Dempsey) would have wished to take part in the debate, because he freely acknowledges the visual handicap from which he suffers, and the inordinate expense of the implements that can sometimes assist those in a similar position.<br/>
The provision in the clause would not mean an increase in public expenditure. It is simply an enabling provision that would bring the law of Scotland into line with that in England and Wales. It would empower the Secretary of State for Scotland to exempt people with severe visual handicap.<br/>
That is not to say that I do not believe that the Government should not implement such regulations. I know from a letter I received towards the end of last year that the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, who looks as though he is to wind up the debate, will tell the House

that paragraph 4 of schedule 5 will provide precisely the powers that we seek to introduce in the clause. If that is so, I give the Government due credit for taking the point about the Scottish Office commitments that existed when they took office.<br/>
However, I believe that those in Scotland who suffer from the affliction in question will hope that this evening the Minister will not resort to tactical subterfuge in explaining that the complexities of paragraph 4 of schedule 5, simply providing the power to make regulations, take him off the hook. They will properly expect him to commit himself to laying regulations in the near future.<br/>
We know the hon. Gentleman's commitment to the Health Service. Although we have often questioned his constant assertions that the NHS in Scotland is being protected from Government cuts, there is at least an argument that those in the community who suffer from the affliction should at this stage receive the small extra resources that would be needed to implement this provision.</p>

<p>I am interested to know that my hon. Friend has received a letter from the Under-Secretary of State giving assurances on schedule 5(4). Is he aware that the name of the Secretary of State for Scotland was attached to new clause 1, specifically providing for the new increased charges? Although the Government say that they are taking power to help these people, it is the case that the Secretary of State and the Scottish Office were committed to increasing these charges.

<p>My hon. Friend displays his normal realism. I dare say that I was being unduly optimistic in hoping for a commitment to any additional resources at a time when the Minister is supervising some major cutbacks in the real resources of the Health Service in Scotland.<br/>
I hope that the Minister, a reasonable man, who has been persuaded to bring in powers to introduce legislation and who has served as chairman of the Scottish Conservative Party, will recognise the real case that can be put for people with severe visual handicap. I trust that he will


throw off the chains of dogma that are tying him so closely to the cash limits of the national administration and make resources available.<br/>
This is a simple provision to help those in the community whom no one in this House would dream of passing by. They must pay large sums of money for modern technical assistance to alleviate the lack of sight that the rest of us take for granted. Now that the Secretary of State for Scotland will have power to lay regulations, it is to be hoped that the use of these regulations will be made a matter of some priority.</p>

<p>I should like to preface my remarks by informing the House that I could be said to have an interest. My husband is an ophthalmic optician. However, he does not practice in Scotland. Nor would he be concerned with the sight test fee directly, since his job is mainly concerned with the provision, prescription and supply of contact lenses.<br/>
It is important to attempt to clarify a mistake into which I believe the House may easily fall. There is all the difference in the world between levying a charge on an examination to see whether a need exists, or a condition exists, which must be treated, and actually charging for appliances. Throughout the National Health Service&#x2014;the medical side, the dental side and the ophthalmic side&#x2014;it has been a long-accepted principle that examinations should be free. The reason is that the early warning system that the eyes provide of the need for appliances or treatment is real and important.<br/>
Examination will indicate whether a person has glaucoma. Without an early decision in such cases, sight can be lost. Examination can also indicate whether there is a detached retina. Again, if not treated immediately, this can lead to loss of sight of the eye. Other diseases, including sclerosis of the blood vessels, can show themselves first in the eyes. The importance of keeping the early warning system&#x2014;the putting of a fence at the top of the cliff rather than an ambulance at the bottom&#x2014;is immensely important. It saves the National Health Service much-needed funds. It would be absurd if people were not able to check on the need for a simple step, taken at once, rather than waiting until a stage when treatment was more difficult and perhaps even impossible.

4.45 pm<br/>
I want to make it crystal clear that I see a great deal of difference between the supplying of an appliance and an actual test. Those who need an appliance, an operation, a pair of glasses, or any other treatment under the Health Service should have that free if they are genuinely unable to afford to pay for the appliance. It is absurd for Opposition Members to cry " Tut, tut", because appliances do not fall free and fully formed out of the sky. They cost a great deal of money. The money has to be found from somewhere. That " somewhere " is the public purse. Those of us responsible for spending public money must see that the money goes to people who really need it.<br/>
I could not support the totally free provision of appliances for many people who are able to afford to pay for them. I will go all the way to the barricades to ensure free treatment and appliances for those who genuinely cannot afford to pay. My understanding is that my right hon. and hon. Friends on the Government Front Bench feel the same about the need to supply appliances free to those who need them but cannot afford them. It is surely not so extraordinary to expect those who are well able to afford to pay for their treatment to do so. If that theory is not accepted, much-needed areas of the Health Service will be in dire trouble.<br/>
1 am delighted, as I stated in an intervention, by the withdrawal of the plan for charging for sight tests. I believe firmly that the Government have seen that the principle being embarked upon was wrong. I am confident that the proposal will not re-surface later in debate on the Bill.<br/>
It is clear that money must be raised for the Health Service in other ways&#x2014;</p>

<p>I am obviously putting forward my opinion, which I am entitled to hold. My right hon. and hon. Friends have listened to a great deal of argument. It is incomprehensible to me that, having listened to the arguments and taken the action that they have, they will now go back on that action. The matter seems perfectly clear.<br/>
It is well understood in many quarters of this House that the Health Service cannot be free. The money is not available to enable it to be totally free at the point of distribution. There now arises the question of how to raise the money that is necessary. I have no doubt that we shall hear about that. My hon. Friend the Minister can have my support for charges that will overcome the financial difficulty in which this section and other sections of the Health Service find themselves so long as he does as he has indicated he is doing and leaves sight tests alone.<br/>
I wish to make clear that the only reason why the ophthalmic service has been able to operate in this country is that ophthalmic opticians and others have earned their bread and butter and paid their rent, rates, their telephone bills, their staff and other costs because they are encouraged, and have been so encouraged by successive Governments, to charge for frames. There has never been any secret about that. Professional men with between five and seven years training, much of it in hospitals, find it a bone of contention that they are able to continue in practice not because of their expertise at conducting eye tests or for understanding the early warnings of eye trouble but because they earn their bread and butter from frames.<br/>
It is important to remember that optical services cost less than any other part of the National Health Service. I beg my right hon. and hon. Friends to appreciate that there is real admiration for the way in which they have listened to the arguments. The. Government will have our support for the reasonable steps which I have no doubt will be taken to overcome this serious deficiency.</p>

<p>If it proves necessary I shall have great pleasure in following the hon. Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston (Mrs. Knight) to the barricades. However, I hope that it

will not be necessary. Much as I enjoy the hon. Lady's company, I shall resist the temptation to deal with her other arguments.<br/>
I abominate and totally detest all charges on the sick and the disabled. Those who are healthy should remember that it is more a privilege not to wear glasses than to wear them. They should be prepared to pay for that privilege rather than that those with a disability should have to pay.<br/>
The House is in a difficulty. The new clause is important to Scotland. The reply will come from the Scottish Minister. However, the debate began with one of the most unclear statements that I have heard from a Government Front Bench when we were told about the withdrawal of new clause 1. I echo the sentiments of the hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) and those expressed by the hon. Member for Somerset, North (Mr. Dean) in the last part of his speech. We must have a clear indication of the Government's intention rather than a vague suggestion that we shall have something at a later stage.<br/>
The House must know whether the Government intend to impose for the first time a charge for early diagnosis which would prevent people from having the necessary treatment. Alternatively, are the Government planning another round of charges to make up the &#x00A3;11 million which will have to be found from elsewhere if they do not proceed with new clause 1?</p>

<p>I regret that I cannot agree with the hon. Gentleman. I was listening most carefully, because the Minister was discussing the item that concerns me most. The Minister gave the impression that he was more worried about the technicalities and the way in which the proposal was being implemented than about whether it was being implemented. It is easy for the Minister. All that he has to do is to stand up and tell us and then we shall be clear where we stand.<br/>
New clause 6 is extremely important for Scotland. It involves the problem of preventing blindness. When a patient has low visual acuity, there is a need to change spectacles frequently. It is a pity that we must examine two Acts and that Scotland has to make its own amendments.<br/>
The wording causes difficulty. For many years there has been a registered list of blind persons which is covered by an Act. After my right hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Wythenshawe (Mr. Morris) did the House and the country a service by putting the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act on the statute book local social services departments established a complete register of the disabled, including the blind.<br/>
However, there is some reluctance by many blind persons to be included on the

local authority register because they are already on one register for employment. They are anxious not to confuse the issue in case inclusion on one register prejudices them in relation to the other. The paraplegic person is able to move freely from sheltered employment to unsheltered employment and back, but the blind are not. Once they are in sheltered employment they must remain. One in 10 blind persons is unemployed.</p>

<p>I have received representations from the National League of the Blind but not from the Scottish branch.<br/>
The argument expressed by Scottish colleagues is important. It affects one of the most disadvantaged sections of our community. All disabilities are difficult to live with. People understand what it is like not to see and what it is like to miss some of the beauties of life. Sometimes, because of my deafness, people say " You can always turn off." Nobody says to a blind man " You do not need to look, because it is ugly." Everybody understands the difficulties of a blind person.<br/>
5 pm<br/>
Therefore, when the Minister replies I hope that, even if he does not accept the wording of the new clause, he will accept the principle that there should be no barrier to a person who suffers from failing eyesight. I sometimes think that this Government hate those in the 50&#x2013;60 year age group. The Government are aware of the under-fives and the over-65s, but it seems that they are determined to put every barrier in the way of those who have not yet reached 65 and who need the Health Service. The Government appear to be prepared to allow free treatment to people only when they have reached the age of 65.<br/>
Many problems arise in relation to low visual acuity. We are not just dealing with one disability. When we speak of eye trouble the problem can reflect the general health of a person and be an indication of other problems.<br/>
Therefore, no barrier should be placed in the way of the people of Scotland, or anywhere else, when they need treatment. If a person needs to have an eye test every


six months and that means that lenses must be changed every six months, that person should not have to pay for those new lenses because he suffers from a serious disability.<br/>
Even though the Minister may not accept the precise words of the new clause, I hope that he will guarantee that the meaning and the principle of the new clause will be incorporated into the Bill before it reaches the statute book.</p>

The Association of Optical Practitioners in its representations to all Members of Parliament said quite clearly:
<q> To introduce a statutory charge of any kind payable by the patient for an examination, whether medical, detail or ophthalmic".</q>
The House will note the reference to medical and dental as well as ophthalmic examinations. We hope that there will not be a reintroduction of charges for dental assessment as was originally envisaged in the schedule. The Minister did not say anything about that just now.

<q> would breach a fundamental principle of the NHS which should be preserved, namely, 'examination without charge'.</q>
The association then went on to make an important point in its representations about charges for optical assessment. It said:
<q> The public interest will not be best served by seeking an anticipated saving of &#x00A3;11 million on eye examinations. The General Ophthalmic Service already represents by far the <i>lowest</i> charge on the Exchequer of the primary health services (medical, dental, optical and pharmaceutical), and the <i>highest</i> contributor in terms of patients' charges.</q>
The association said that patients' charges currently amounted to 32 per cent. of the cost of the ophthalmic services, whereas the patients' charges in

the dental service represented 21 per cent. and in the pharmaceutical service 4 per cent. We know that these figures may have been calculated before the Government increased prescription charges in two waves recently. Prescription charges were increased to 45p in April last year and were further increased to &#x00A3;1 in December. The percentage figures I have quoted, therefore, may be slightly out of date.<br/>
Generally speaking, however, the figures are right. Charges in the ophthalmic service represent a far higher proportion of the total cost than is the case in the other services. That is an important point when the Government are arguing that they wish to see higher charges for spectacles, frames and lenses to National Health Service patients. Those patients are already contributing much more substantially to the cost of their appliances than people elsewhere in the NHS. I am not arguing that the charges that were to be made in the ophthalmic sector should be shifted to another sector of the NHS. I am saying that there is no need whatever for the reintroduction by the Government at the further Report stage, which I understand we are to have after Whitsun, of a new charge or of additional charges in the ophthalmic sector to recover that &#x00A3;11 million.<br/>
I could not disagree more with Conservative Members who say that we must recover this money somehow. If the Government insist that the Chancellor has got it wrong&#x2014;that is what is being said: as far as I can recall, this charge was referred to in the Budget Speech&#x2014;and if the Minister is now saying that the Chancellor was wrong in principle when he said that the Government would be introducing that charge, it is the Chancellor's job to produce the money which would otherwise have been brought in by this tax. Therefore, I do not agree that the NHS should be asked to provide this &#x00A3;11 million. It should be found from the contingency reserve.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend will recollect that we both served on the Standing Committee which considered this Bill and the Standing Committee which considered the Social Security (No. 2) Bill. When we were talking about savings and this &#x00A3;11 million, I had my defence Blue Book with me&#x2014;the


defence White Paper&#x2014;and I easily calculated that I could save the &#x00A3;11 million by not spending &#x00A3;10 million on five Tornado aircraft. It would be much better not to spend that money, and to allow people treatment under the ophthalmic or other services of the NHS.</p>

<p>Yes, that is right.<br/>
The point that my hon. Friend makes is absolutely right. This shows the Government's political priorities. That is what the new clause that we were to have debated this afternoon was to be all about.<br/>
Clearly, if the Minister of State wants to make representations to the Chancellor of the Exchequer about the way in which he might recover this &#x00A3;11 million, if he does not want to load it on to patients in the NHS, he might refer the Chancellor to the contribution made on this issue by my hon.

<p>My hon. Friend and I both served on the Standing Committee.

<p>My view about that may be slightly different from that of my hon. Friend. As I understand it, this charge was to have been introduced in practice in April 1981. If the Government had wanted to introduce this charge in a proper fashion, with proper consultation with all those concerned, they could have done so by introducing legislation, if that was required, at a much later stage, in the next Session. But they chose not to do that.<br/>
I make this point very seriously to the Ministers responsible for the Bill. When one brings together the expenditure and the revenue sides of the Budget equation on Budget day and publishes one's public expenditure White Paper and the assessment

of the Chancellor as to the kind of taxation that he will be bringing forward, that telescopes any possibility of consultation on this kind of issue. We saw that on the Social Security (No. 2) Bill, precisely because the reductions in social security benefits were defined as Budget measures, financial measures. There was no consultation with any of the interested parties.<br/>
With new clause 1 we have got ourselves into exactly the same situation. What the Government really said about new clause 1 was that it was a financial measure arising from the Budget. The Government really ought to take note about what has happened over this issue and the climb-down that they have had to make over it. If it means anything at all&#x2014;I am sure that the Minister will understand this&#x2014;it means that they did not consult the people who knew about the issue, and, because they did not consult them, they got their fingers badly burned with this political hot potato&#x2014;and it serves them right.<br/>
5.15 pm<br/>
Therefore, I believe that what we need to see, if the Government are to bring forward expenditure measures and taxation measures at the same time, on Budget Day, is a situation in which new charges or reductions in benefits of the kind that we have seen from the present Government will be subject to proper consultations with the interested parties, even though they are Budget measures. In other words, before they are announced, there should be proper consultation about the way in which they are to be implemented and the character of the charges themselves.<br/>
I think that the Minister will agree, on reflection, that this charge, which was foreshadowed in new clause 1, was a political hot potato which would have been avoided, without any political embarrassment to the Government, if such a procedure had been followed. I strongly advise the Minister to consult the Leader of the House and the Chancellor of the Exchequer about the way in which these sorts of measures are introduced. This is a very serious matter.<br/>
We are very glad to have the opportunity of discussing new clause 6 and the putative new clause 1 together. In my view, the loading of charges on to other


sections of the ophthalmic service, to which the Minister has just alluded, would be completely unacceptable to Opposition Members. We are opposed to charges in the NHS. We are certainly opposed to swingeing increases in charges for lenses and frames. If the Government want to increase those charges to the extent that they would have to increase them to obtain the &#x00A3;11 million saving in public expenditure, they will incur the wrath not only of those on the Opposition Benches but of a substantial section of the ophthalmic profession and of the people of this country.<br/>
For that reason, I believe that the Government ought to ignore the views of the hawks on their own Back Benches and the hawks in the Cabinet and they ought to listen to the representations made to them by the ophthalmic profession. Without such consideration, we shall see a swingeing increase in charges which would not be justified.</p>

<p>Given that there may well be an objection such as the hon. Gentleman is putting forward to increased optical charges of any kind, which is the less distasteful to the hon.

<p>The simple answer to that is that we do not want any new charges and we do not want to see an increase in any of the existing charges. As I understand it, the Labour Party's policy is to abolish charges in the NHS. That statement has been made not only from the Opposition Back Benches but the Opposition Front Bench as well. The Minister would be well advised to listen to our representations. He is laughing his head off at the prospect of more people in the NHS being charged more money for the privilege of obtaining spectacles that they need in the ophthalmic sector. Is he laughing about that? Is he happy about people being forced to pay substantially increased amounts for the glasses that they need?<br/>
What he is really saying to the House is this: " We shall not charge you for the privilege of having your eyes tested, but we shall charge you through the nose for the glasses that you need." There is little difference in principle between the

new charge that was originally proposed and the vastly increased charges that will be proposed by the Government in the near future.</p>

<p>I do not wish to delay the House, but I wonder whether my hon. Friend would give a further opportunity to the hon. Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston (Mrs. Knight) to explain matters? I received two or three letters from opticians asking me, if all else failed, to vote for the hon. Lady's amendment. I do not think that she ever tabled an amendment. If she did, I am not aware that she was advocating any increase in charges for optical equipment. The House and the country deserve a greater degree of honesty and openness from the hon. Lady.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend has hit the nail on the head. I am absolutely certain that the hon. Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston (Mrs. Knight) did not table an amendment on that point. I carefully watched the Order Paper to see whether her amendment would appear. No doubt she will tell us what proposals she intended to introduce.</p>

<p>Certainly. I made it absolutely plain that I went to the Table Office for advice. I looked at the new clause tabled by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State. I was quite clearly opposed to the amendment as it was drafted. The advice given to me was that it would be quite useless to table an amendment to an amendment, which would delete that amendment. As we were discussing the question of sight testing, and not appliances for optical needs, there was clearly no point in tabling an amendment about that.</p>

<p>Now we know the truth, which is that the hon. Member for Edgbaston would have had to vote against new clause 1. That is the point. The Minister has avoided the political embarrassment of the hon. Lady and some of her supporters voting against the Government. No doubt the Government have avoided a politically bruising defeat on this matter. The hon.

<p>I return to the debate. I want to come on to the important point about the alleged difference between consultation charges and charges for lenses and frames, which no doubt the Minister will increase substantially in due course. No doubt he will tell us later&#x2014;I was asking this question when the points of order arose&#x2014;how much those charges will have to be increased in order to recoup the &#x00A3;11 million.<br/>
There is very little difference in practice between a consultation charge of say, &#x00A3;2 to have one's sight tested, and a 20 or 30 per cent. increase in the charge for replacing glasses or frames or for providing them for the first time. Both charges act as a disincentive. A charge for sight-testing is a disincentive which applies to all individuals who are not exempted from charges under the Bill. The increased charges which will be levied on frames and lenses will also affect everyone who is not exempted by the Bill. Therefore, there will be a strong disincentive to attend the optician's.<br/>
The opticians whom I know believe that the average interval between eye examinations is at present too long, and that anything which increases that interval would be a very bad thing indeed. Therefore, I do not accept the distinction that has been made by some Conservative Members between the proposal to increase charges for frames and lenses and the consultation charge.<br/>
With that, I welcome the removal of new clause 1, even if it is just for the


time being. We shall watch like hawks to see whether there is any proposal to reintroduce that charge at a later stage, or, indeed, whether there is any proposal substantially to increase charges in other parts of the ophthalmic sector in order to recoup the &#x00A3;11 million.</p>

<p>I have considerable sympathy with those who are pleading on behalf of the partially sighted. It is precisely for that reason that I am delighted that the Minister has withdrawn the proposal to charge for sight testing. I am astounded at the grudging reception which the Minister's action has received, both from the Liberal and Labour Benches.<br/>
To my mind, it is democracy at its best when representations are made to a Minister and he accedes to them.</p>

<p>This would have been the only test in the whole of the NHS for which a charge would have been made. That may be serious with regard to spectacles, but what I am concerned about is the early detection of disease. There are so many diseases which can be detected through the eyes which, in a sense, are quite unrelated to the eyes. In addition, diseases of the eyes can be cured if attacked at an early stage. For that reason, I am particularly glad that the Minister listened to the representations and withdrew the charge, which both sides of the House would have found regrettable. I thank him very much.</p>

<p>I do not suppose that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary would say anything off the cuff at that moment, and in the circumstances that is not surprising.<br/>
What has happened today is gratifying. It is right and proper, especially if a Government or Ministers have made an error, and in this case I believe that there was an error. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston (Mrs. Knight). I believe that the error was probably made through a natural desire to study every possible method of readjusting and rearranging the costing of NHS as a whole.<br/>
Nevertheless, I believe that that zeal induced that rather serious error. It is most undesirable, without more mature consideration for any Administration to branch off in such a new direction, because I believe that that is much more serious than has been suggested. It is undesirable to impose a charge when an eye patient comes into contact with the NHS for the first time. It would also be grossly


inconsistent to impose such a charge only in respect of eye patients and not in regard to other branches of the NHS. Obviously, it would be grotesque if a neighbour of mine had a free examination for some obscure tropical disease, costing an infinite amount of money over a long period, whereas I had to pay quite a significant charge for a comparatively minor examination of the eyes.<br/>
I echo what both my hon. Friends the Members for Edgbaston and for Lancaster (Mrs. Kellett-Bowman) said about the value of an early examination in all cases, not only in regard to incipient eye disease but also with regard to the possibility of some other illness or disease which might be revealed by a careful and competent examination of the eyes.<br/>
I hope that this and future Administrations will stand back before they take any decision to embark on charges of this nature&#x2014;whether they are for eye tests or any other areas of the National Health Service. There are far less objectionable ways of obtaining necessary revenue support for the Health Service.<br/>
I wish that this country were richer and more successful economically and industrially so that we could afford much more spectacular advances, and we would not need to study methods of sustaining the work of the Health Service by charges. But if we wish to sustain and improve the quality of the social and the welfare services generally, we shall have to do so by charges until industry is much more buoyant and productive.<br/>
I am glad that we have not taken the proposed undesirable step in the wrong direction. This is not in any way a defeat for the Minister or the Government. It is a kind of democracy in action, and Governments which are not prepared to take such steps are weaker rather than stronger.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston (Mrs. Knight) began her speech by drawing attention to the fact that her husband is an ophthalmic specialist. I acquit her of any financial motive and I am sure that she is not influenced in any way by her husband's income. However, I am equally certain that she has been greatly influenced by her husband's optical knowledge as an ophthalmic specialist. She

is a walking advertisement for polyandry. If she were married also to a gynaecologist, a dental surgeon and a general practitioner, she might bring knowledge of a much wider spectrum to our debates on the National Health Service. People are always prepared to come forward and say that they are opposed to particular charges, but they are not opposed to others. It is all a matter of where we draw the line.</p>

<p>I think that I had better draw a veil over the hon. Lady's matrimonial life.<br/>
It is bit much to be chided by the hon. Members for Edgbaston and for Somerset, North (Mr. Dean), who has a distinguished record as a former Health Service Minister, for being churlish about the withdrawal of new clause 1 on optical charges.<br/>
The Government tell us that as a result of the withdrawal, &#x00A3;11 million will be lost from the Health Service budget. We are also told that the Government are considering other ways of raising this &#x00A3;11 million. I am certain that at present the Health Service cannot absorb &#x00A3;11 million. Ministers travel the country telling people that the Health Service budget is growing and that there will be a 2&#x00BD; per cent. increase this year. But that is not true. The Health Service budget is based on the proposition that inflation will run at 14 per cent. this year. That is the target set for the health boards, and Ministers have told them that they will not get a penny more. At that time inflation was running at 18&#x00BD; to 19 per cent. and now it is widely forecast&#x2014;and the Prime Minister did not deny it today&#x2014;that tomorrow the RPI will show that inflation is running at an annual rate of 21 per cent. If we average out the 14 per cent. between now and the end of the financial year, it means that in 12 months inflation will need to be about 8 per cent. No one in his right mind in the Treasury or in this House can believe for one second


that the annual inflation rate next year will be 8 per cent.<br/>
If Ministers say that there is a 2&#x00BD; per cent. growth rate in the NHS budget, based on 14 per cent. inflation, and the inflation rate is 50 per cent. higher than the figure that has been allowed for, how can there be any real growth at all? It means that there has been a deliberate cut in expenditure on the National Health Service. Ministers should not tell the health boards that 14 per cent. is their target figure unless they can say that the Government will make sure that general economic conditions are such that the NHS will be protected against inflation. In fact, they are now saying that the health boards will get 14 per cent. and not a halfpenny more. How can anyone claim that that is a growth in the Health Service budget?<br/>
Ministers should make up their minds about where they stand. Ministers in virtually every other Department are going around the country saying that public expenditure will be cut. The Financial Secretary to the Treasury has predicted three years of misery. The Minister for Social Security has said that everyone will suffer and every area will take a cut, but not Health Ministers. For some curious reasons they are shamefaced about it. I would have much more time for them if they would stand up and tell the health boards that they will get less money. The Government will have to find the extra &#x00A3;11 million from somewhere else&#x2014;certainly not the Health Service budget.<br/>
I do not object to the Minister giving credit for the withdrawal of new clause 1 to his hon. Friends the Members for Somerset, North and for Edgbaston. They kicked up a fuss, went to him and persuaded him. It is right to give credit to Back Benchers, but it is unworthy of him and the traditions of Ministers of the Crown to suggest that there have been no objections from elsewhere on this matter. I did not know that the Minister intended to make this concession, otherwise I would have brought my correspondence with me. If he cares to check with the departmental files, he will find that I have raised this issue strongly by correspondence. I hope that he will give credit where it is due.<br/>
I fear that the hon. Members for Somerset, North and Edgbaston will find that

they have won a Pyrrhic victory. One set of charges has been withdrawn, but others may be imposed elsewhere. However, I admire hon. Members who stand up to their own Government and are prepared to carry their opposition into the Division Lobby. I give them credit, but let it not be said that there have been no objections from other hon. Members.</p>

<p>Like most of my hon. Friends, I welcome the fact that new clause 1 has been withdrawn, though the test of the Government's good intentions is their attitude to new clause 6. If they had care and concern, they should have indicated by now that they are prepared to accept that new clause.<br/>
Why did the Government withdraw new clause 1 only last night, thereby presenting the House with considerable procedural difficulties? If pressure had been building up from a number of sources it would have been reasonable for the Government to withdraw the new clause at the beginning of the week and to have put its replacement on the Amendment Paper so that we could debate it.<br/>
If the Government intended not to replace new clause 1 we should be happy, but the Minister has indicated that something else is to be inserted. Time was found to debate new clause 1 because it was being introduced on report and had not been in the Bill on Second Reading or in Committee. I assume that more time will be found to debate any new proposals that come before us in the form of a new clause taking back part of what has been removed by the withdrawal of new clause 1. It is important that we get an undertaking from the Government that they will find extra time if any of the obnoxious proposals contained in new clause 1 and schedule 15 are brought back in another form.<br/>
It was discourteous to the House for the Government to act in this way, because it is difficult to debate any of the new clauses until we know the Govment's intentions. If we made progress today and got beyond the new clauses, we should be in difficulty, because we would not have an opportunity of debating the Government's proposals, and they would have to be introduced in another place, which would be unacceptable.


I hope that the Minister will accept new clause 6. We all have constituency examples of the problems faced by the partially sighted. The new clause deals only with Scotland, but if the Government accepted it they would be saying that they would adopt the regulations for the rest of the United Kingdom.<br/>
I hope that we shall have an indication that the Government are prepared to find time at a reasonable hour to debate any proposals that they intend to bring forward to replace new clause 1. That will be particularly important if the Government intend to introduce a differential principle between sight-testing and teeth inspections. Most of my hon. Friends would regard it as unacceptable if the Minister said that sight-testing was to be exempted but that dental inspections were not.</p>

<p>I apologise, Mr. Speaker. My remarks were not meant as a dig at the occupants of the Chair. Let me say that the speaking to new clause 6 was interesting in its brevity.<br/>
The new clause does not deal with sight-testing; it deals with charges for optical appliances. It is right to get that on the record at the start.<br/>
I do not want to stray too much into a Second Reading debate on erstwhile new clause 1, but there has been some talk of financial irresponsibility, and my problem is that Labour Members are forward in telling us how they would spend money but backward on how they would earn it.<br/>
The jollity on the Government Frent Bench to which the hon. Member for Wood Green (Mr. Race) referred was

<p>In the light of the way in which the debate was conducted by Labour Members it was not surprising that the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton) moved the new clause formally so that the speeches that were prepared yesterday could still be made.<br/>
The hon. Member for Hamilton (Mr. Robertson) made a good speech about new clause 6. I appreciate some of the things that he said, particularly the fact that we have in the House the hon. Member for Coatbridge and Airdrie (Mr. Dempsey), who suffers from the affliction of being partially sighted. We know how difficult it is for him to carry on with the duties that he performs so well and we can therefore appreciate what it must be like for those outside in their careers.<br/>
The hon. Member for Hamilton also anticipated, to some extent, the reply that I shall give. He knows, as he said, that I would never stoop to any tactical subterfuge. The hon. Gentleman referred to my commitment to the Health Service, and I shall come to that later.<br/>
We had two interventions from the hon. Member for Aberdeen, North. (Mr. Hughes). The first was a tease, when he asked me to reply for the Government to the general debate. If I had done that


he would have asked me to restrict myself to the Scottish aspect.</p>

<p>The rest of the debate was answered so adequately by my hon. Friend that I had already decided to limit myself to the Scottish aspect.<br/>
Before turning to clause 6, I confirm what the hon. Member for Aberdeen, North said about my visiting health boards and pointing out that the increase of 2 per cent. this year' was based on a 14 per cent. rate of increase in both pay and inflation throughout the 12-month period. If that figure is not achieved, not just the NHS but the whole of Britain will be in trouble. This year we are spending &#x00A3;1,600 million more on the NHS than we did last year. That is no mean figure.<br/>
I oppose new clause 6 on three grounds. First, now that the inclusion of schedule 5&#x2014;has been agreed in Committee, the apparent intentions of those who support new clause 6 have already been met.<br/>
Section 105(7) of the National Health Service (Scotland) Act 1978, as amended by paragraph 4 of schedule 5, provides that the Secretary of State may make regulations " with variable application" under virtually all the regulation-making powers conferred on him by the Act. That includes the power to prescribe optical charges under section 70. By variable application I mean regulations that apply in a specific way to specific cases or classes of case.<br/>
6 pm<br/>
Secondly, this extension of the regulation-making powers available to the Secretary of State in relation to charges for optical appliances would allow him to prescribe either a reduced level of charge, or no charge at all, to certain categories of patient. That category could include partially sighted patients as specified in the new clause. However, it could also include others who are blind in a technical, legal sense, but who have limited

powers of vision, and who could sometimes benefit from optical appliances.<br/>
Thirdly, it is wrong to use two nails where one will do. I therefore assure the Opposition that the new clause adds nothing to the effect of paragraph 4 of schedule 5. However, it draws particular attention to the cases of optical charges and partially sighted persons. If the new clause were inserted in the Bill, it might prove unhelpful. It could imply the early relaxation of optical charges.</p>

<p>I shall not give an answer off the top of my head. I shall look into that question and advise the hon. Gentleman accordingly.<br/>
I can give no assurance that there is an early prospect of lower charges. As the Committee knows, the Government have carried out a review of the range of possibilities that exist for modifying the present arrangements for exemptions from health charges. In the light of this review the Government have decided that they cannot give priority to extending exemptions from optical charges, especially as help is already available for those in need and those on low incomes.<br/>
I have explained fully why we consider that new clause 6 is unnecessary. I understand that Opposition Members still consider voting in favour of the new clause. I ask them to oppose it. If they vote in its favour they will be kicking at an open door.</p>

<p>I wish to intervene only briefly from the Opposition Front Bench. I do so for two reasons. First, the new clause stems directly from my Optical Charges (Exemption) Scotland Bill, which I drafted and sponsored as a Private


Member's Bill under Standing Order No. 37. My Bill is, in fact, still before the House.<br/>
The second reason for my intervention is that I was the Minister with responsibility for the disabled in the previous Labour Government. I then secured approval to exempt the severely visually handicapped from paying optical charges. In England and Wales exemption could have been given by the laying of regulations. In the case of Scotland, primary legislation was needed and, but for the fall of the Labour Government, this would have become law by last summer. Pending the enactment of the Scottish Bill, it was agreed to delay the laying of the regulations for England and Wales in order to avoid creating any inequity between people with the same handicap in different parts of the United Kingdom.<br/>
Following last May's change of Government, there was no indication that the Government intended to bring Scottish law into line with the law of England and Wales. I therefore introduced my Bill. The Government now say that the purpose of my Bill and the purpose of the new clause has been met by their Bill. If that is so, why did they block my Bill&#x2014;which appeared before theirs&#x2014;so sneakily and so repeatedly? My Bill could have been law by now if it had not been for the Government's ruthless blocking tactics. As the Minister knows, my Bill and the new clause seek to help those who suffer from a severe visual handicap short of blindness itself.<br/>
I am pleased that my hon. Friend the Member for Coatbridge and Airdrie (Mr. Dempsey) was among the sponsors of my Bill, along with many of my hon. Friends who have spoken tonight. We all listen with respect to the views of my hon. Friend the Member for Coatbridge and Airdrie on this important matter. When I last checked the figures, it was estimated that the reform proposed by my Bill would cost between &#x00A3;500,000 and &#x00A3;750,000. About 50,000 visually handicapped people were thought likely to benefit from the reform. These may be underestimates but, on any assessment, the cost and the number of beneficiaries cannot be greatly in excess of those figures. So it is only a modest step forward we have been seeking.<br/>
After all, in their first Budget, the Government crammed &#x00A3;1,500 million into the

pockets of the richest 7 per cent. of taxpayers. By contrast, we are seeking a modest reform indeed.</p>

<p>I am grateful to my right hon. Friend for his kind references to me. I have the distinct feeling that even the Minister does not understand the type of visual aids involved, their cost and the general problems involved. I have to go to the eye infirmary in Glasgow to obtain them. Few people could afford to pay for them. I do not think that that is understood. I am delighted that my right hon. Friend is stressing the importance of this subject.</p>

<p>As I said, the House as a whole listens to my hon. Friend with great respect. He is eminently right to argue that a very heavy cost falls on those who are severely visually handicapped. I hope that the Minister has listened at least with some sympathy to our proposition. Not only should the necessary power be acquired, but also the exemption itself. Had the Labour Government remained in office, the exemption could have been given last summer. The Minister has said that he does not want to make any off-the-cuff decisions. Last October, my hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton (Mr. Robertson) was in touch with the Minister. My hon. Friend pointed out then that the exemption should be given at the earliest possible date. We are therefore asking him not only to acquire power but to give the exemption.<br/>
The Minister spoke of our intentions towards the disabled. Between 1974 and 1979 the previous Labour Government increased spending on the chronically sick and disabled by &#x00A3;1,100 million. We are entitled to be judged on our record. The issue raised in new clause 6 is now very urgent. We shall show our feelings on this important subject by voting in the Lobby tonight.</p>

<p>My right hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Wythenshawe (Mr. Morris) has argued the case much better than I could have done. He has been intimately concerned with these matters for a long time. In some ways it is a pity that he did not speak earlier in the debate.<br/>
My right hon. Friend has put many facts before the House. I suspect that the Minister might not have been too well aware of some of them. However, he must have been aware that my right hon. Friend and others have been putting considerable pressure on the Department for months to give exemption. A relatively small sum is involved. It is no good the Minister saying that the powers exist in schedule 5. That is the equivalent of saying " Our intentions are good." Intentions cost nothing. If the Government are not prepared to supply the means to translate that intention into practical effect, it is a worthless intention.<br/>
It is true that the debate has widened considerably from the fairly narrow confines of the clause. That was in the nature of events. The Government withdrew their new clause 1, which provided for new charges for various items, including optical tests. The withdrawal of that clause presented the House with a different ball game. Mr. Speaker said&#x2014;in my view rightly&#x2014;that wider issues could be raised while discussing new clause 6. Those issues have been properly raised, and the debate has ranged much more widely as a consequence.<br/>
The Minister said that the clause deals with optical charges. It does, and such charges are extremely important for a small and very handicapped section of the community. The Minister made jibes about the previous Labour Government ignoring inflation. He well knows that inflation had been reduced to less than 10 per cent. when the Conservative Government took office. The Government have been so successful in tackling inflation that it has risen from 9 per cent. to 21 per cent., as will be declared tomorrow.<br/>
On the basis of that argument, the Minister is not likely to translate his declared intentions into practical effect. On the contrary, the Minister of State went out of his way to say that while the proposed

optical charges are being withdrawn other charges&#x2014;no doubt equally indefensible ones&#x2014;are to be substituted.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Stockport, North (Mr. Bennett) advanced the valid argument that such proposals make the Bill a completely different measure from that to which the House gave a Second Reading some months ago. If the Government are to introduce additional charges at a later stage, we are entitled to ask for additional time in which to debate the new proposals.<br/>
If the Government are intent, as I hope they are, on consulting the proper authorities outside the House, it will be some time before they present the House with their proposals. Conservative Members have made great play of the value of the democratic process by which the Government's mind can be changed. If it can be changed overnight on the proposed charges in new clause 1, to such an extent that the Government see fit to withdraw that clause, they should tell us at an early stage precisely what they have in mind for new, substitute charges to raise &#x00A3;11 million. They should proceed to consult the appropriate professional and trade union organisations before they bring forward their proposals in the form of a new clause.<br/>
If they produce their proposals without consultation and they receive the hostile reaction that met new clause 1, the House may witness the strange situation of the Government withdrawing a second new clause and saying " We shall forgo this new clause 1 the second time round in favour of a new clause the third time round, so that we may produce a clause that will eventually be approved by professional and other bodies outside the House."<br/>
6.15 pm<br/>
It is no good a Minister saying that new clause 6 is already provided for in schedule 5. As my hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton (Mr. Robertson) has said, schedule 5 is purely an enabling power. The Minister is giving himself an enabling power, but he was careful not to say that any group, either generally or specifically as in the new clause, will benefit by money being provided to translate a declaration of intent into practical effect. On the contrary, we have every


cause to believe that no money will be made available and that the powers provided in the schedule will have no practical value.<br/>
To show our contempt for the case that has been advanced by the Government against the new clause, I ask my right</p>

<p>I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.<br/>
One reason for moving this clause is that by this Bill the Government are abolishing the Health Services Board. The board, as well as having the function of phasing pay beds out of the Health Service, has the function of protecting it from the encroaching effects of

the private sector, which, it seems to us, will be encouraged in its growth and development by the Government as part of their policy.<br/>
6.30 pm<br/>
The National Health Service provides care for the overwhelming mass of our population. Therefore, it must be carefully protected from the encroachments of the private sector. The private sector has two advantages in competing with the National Health Service. First, it has no overall responsibilities for the health care of the population. It can carefully select those aspects of human suffering which can be made commercially viable and can then proceed to exploit them. This means that there are many responsibilities to which it need pay no attention in the area of health care. The private sector has no substantial responsibility for training.<br/>
The NHS, in fact and by comparison, is a vast training college. All the health authorities in England, Wales and Scotland carry out vast programmes of training. They bear the full cost and time of training, apart from sections of medical education that are supported by the University Grants Committee. However, even in the case of medical education a heavy proportion of the training of doctors is borne by the public sector, the NHS.<br/>
When the NHS has carried out its training remit, the private sector has been in the habit of poaching the trained personnel&#x2014;the doctors, the nurses, the supporting professions, the ancillary workers, craftsmen and others&#x2014;away from the NHS and applying them to employment in the private sector.<br/>
That problem affects all public bodies with large private sectors acting as satellites to them, or acting in competition with or working in parallel with them.


For the past 15 years the broad solution has been the industrial training board solution, whereby a training board is set up to cover the entire industry concerned, both public and private, so that it can supervise the training for the whole industry and receive costs for defraying its expenses from everybody in the industry, whether public or private.<br/>
Such an industrial training board as we propose setting up in this context would seem to commit the Opposition to the permanent extension and existence of the private sector of medicine. If an industrial training board were set up it would immediately start recruiting staff and organising training in the public and private sectors of health throughout the country. If ever we wished to abolish it, there would be the question of redundancy. It is our hope that we shall be in a position to abolish these arrangements upon the Labour Party's return to power.<br/>
An industrial training board would be a quango within the meaning of the term applied by Government supporters. We decided that we would spare the Secretary of State the annoyance and anxiety of setting up a quango to cover the training of personnel in the public and private sectors of health. We urge him, under the new clause, to be his own quango, in fact.<br/>
We suggest that anybody with a nursing home that is registered, with responsibility for the equivalent of 10 professionally qualified people in his employ, should pay a levy to the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State should use that levy to defray the costs of training in health authorities. If a private nursing home could show that it was carrying out its fair share of the training it need not pay the levy. If, on the other hand, it did not pay the levy, and was not carrying out its fair proportion of training, it would be struck from the register of nursing homes. That is the solution that we put forward.<br/>
There is only one other point that requires explanation from me. We have set the levy on nursing homes at what we concede to be the high level of 4 per cent., compared with the minimum of the 1 per cent. levy that exists under the Employment and Training Act 1973. This is the reason for the 4 per cent. levy;

medical education is the most expensive form of education. That justifies the substantial nature of the levy.<br/>
It is interesting that the civil aviation training board at one time imposed a 3&#x00BD; per cent. levy on payrolls on the grounds that it was training airline pilots, which was an expensive form of training. The training of nurses, and especially of doctors, is even more expensive and justifies the levy at the level we set.<br/>
On the other hand, if the Minister can give us the details of the breakdown of training costs and can show us that the levy should be somewhat less than 4 per cent., we shall not stand by the 4 per cent. as a reason for opposing his advice to the House.<br/>
The Government should accept that the private sector of medicine and health care should not poach trained people from the Health Service without making a full contribution to the costs of their training.<br/>
On 25 March, in Committee, the Minister of State said that a substantial amount of training was being carried on by the private sector, in any case. From his enthusiastic description of the training carried out the Opposition do not fear that the private sector has anything to worry about in being called upon to pay a high levy to the Secretary of State for training purposes.</p>

<p>Has it occurred to the right hon. Gentleman that one of the ensuing strange results would be that nursing homes in the United Kingdom would have to pay this levy, although those in Jersey, Guernsey, Ireland, the Isle of Man, Canada, the United States and other countries could all benefit from this kind of trained personnel without any payment?</p>

<p>I have no doubt that that argument could be advanced against every industrial training board in this country. That has not stopped us from acting. Nor would it stop us from acting in this area.<br/>
In Committee the Minister of State said that the private sector was carrying on substantial training. Our view is that it need have no fear of the levy that is imposed under the new clause. In the view of the Government it is carrying out such excellent training that very few private establishments would be called upon to pay the 4 per cent. On the other hand, if


they are not carrying out their training obligations, there is no reason on earth why they should not contribute to the levy and help to defray the costs of training doctors, nurses and other Health Service professionals.</p>

<p>The principal justification&#x2014;for me the only justification&#x2014;for having a levy on the private sector is to make sure that it pays the full economic cost for the trained personnel that it uses, who overwhelmingly come from the National Health Service. The Minister of State revealed in Committee that two small private hospitals did some training.</p>

<p>Those were the only ones that he could produce then, but I bow to his superior wisdom now. Even if there are five, the number of staff that they train cannot be substantial. We want to ensure that at the very least the private sector pays the full economic price of training its staff.<br/>
The private sector does not pay the economic price for many other services rendered to it by the NHS. For example, in Committee we had a debate about the provision of blood to the private sector hospital services. No charge is made at present. It may be that we would not wish to charge for that item, but many of us believe that charges for other services provided by the NHS, such as ambulances and laboratory services for individual private patients, are not being properly collected and that the private sector is getting away with substantial amounts of money that it should be paying to the NHS for services now provided under the National Health Service Act.</p>

<speech hansard_id="1749467" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1980-05-15a.1815.3" hansard_membership_id="312" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/3497" speakername="Mr. Nicholas Winterton" colnum="1815" time="17:45:00">
<p>The hon. Gentleman is developing a very interesting argument, but is he not aware that people who take advantage of the private sector of medicine are paying twice, as they contribute through various insurances and taxation to the running costs of the NHS? Therefore, why should the private sector pay again for services for which those who are taking advantage of it have already paid?</p>
</speech>
<speech hansard_id="1749468" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1980-05-15a.1815.4" hansard_membership_id="8351" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/19824" speakername="Mr. Race" colnum="1815" time="17:45:00">
<p>The charges are laid down by statute at present; the charges for ambulance services and laboratory services are laid down by the House. While we still have a private sector I do not believe

that there is any justification for removing them. I am anxious to ensure that individual private patients and the private sector as a whole pay properly, through the existing charges, for the services provided.<br/>
As for paying twice, it is clear that people want to do that in order to gain an advantage over others. Those people are not entitled to jump the queue in the way that they wish by exercising the right to go to a private hospital or a pay bed in an NHS hospital.</p>
</speech>
<speech hansard_id="1749469" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1980-05-15a.1816.0" hansard_membership_id="5764" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/15938" speakername="Mr. Haynes" colnum="1816" time="17:45:00">
<p>In my area a well-known footballer who cost &#x00A3;1 million jumped the queue into a bed and beat an 85-year-old lady in desperate need of hip operations. I am convinced that that is the kind of point that my hon. Friend is trying to make.</p>
</speech>
<speech hansard_id="1749470" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1980-05-15a.1816.1" hansard_membership_id="8351" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/19824" speakername="Mr. Race" colnum="1816" time="17:45:00">
<p>We all&#x2014;at any rate on the Labour Benches, if not on the Conservative Benches&#x2014;deplore people jumping the queue, going ahead of others whose medical needs may be at least equal to theirs, if not greater.<br/>
The representations that the Health Services Board received during its existence from the 1976 Act onwards make clear what was the principal problem that it discussed when it talked about whether it would give authorisation for hospitals to exceed the legal limit on the number of beds under the Act. That problem was whether those hospitals that requested authorisation would remove from the NHS substantial numbers of trained workers. One authorisation was rejected on the grounds that it would have removed a substantial number of NHS workers from NHS hospitals in the Sunningdale area of Surrey.<br/>
If the clause has anything to commend it, it is that it would prevent the private sector doing that. The onus would be on the private sector to provide money for increasing the numbers of trained staff working in the Health Service generally.</p>
</speech>
<speech hansard_id="1749472" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1980-05-15a.1816.2" hansard_membership_id="10405" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/21694" speakername="Dr. Vaughan" colnum="1816" time="18:45:00">
<p>We are not at all opposed to the idea behind the clause, that of possibly having a levy. We have been discussing the matter with the private sector. There are problems, and I do not wish to commit us to such a proposition, but I want the House to know that we do not have a closed mind on the subject.


I was asked about some of the training figures. I do not have them all available, but I have the current figures for the training of doctors and dentists, which now costs over &#x00A3;50,000 per student. Comparable figures are as follows: professions supplementary to medicine, &#x00A3;7,500; student nurses, &#x00A3;11,500; pupil nurses, &#x00A3;7,500; and administrative trainees, &#x00A3;9,000. That shows that large sums of money are invested by the State when the NHS trains members of staff.</p>

<p>Can the hon. Gentleman tell us the number of establishments recognised for nurse training by the Royal College of Nursing?</p>

<p>I cannot do so offhand, but I shall be glad to let the hon. Gentleman have that information if he gets in touch with me.<br/>
There is also in the NHS a shortage of certain kinds of trained staff. For example, we have recently been looking particularly at staff available for, for example, renal dialysis units and body scanners. All in all, there is a strong argument that the private sector should play a part in training&#x2014;and it wants to. The Government have been in regular touch with it. We have a liaison group with representatives of certain parts of the private sector, under the chairmanship of Sir Richard Bayliss. I pay tribute to his work in bringing together private sector groups and views so that we can have discussions.<br/>
So far the discussions have concentrated almost exclusively on nurse training, but there is no reason why we should not go wider, and we should welcome that. I shall suggest that to the private sector.<br/>
Straightforward nurse training is not the only aspect that we are examining. We have been discussing, for example, sponsorship of existing places in nurse training schools and in independent hospitals. Alternatively, students from independent hospitals might be seconded or sponsored to attend existing NHS training schools. We have also been looking at the possibilities of financial contributions given directly to support existing training facilities&#x2014;again, in both the NHS and the private sector.<br/>
We are short of time in this debate, so I shall not go further now. But I

can say that there is a whole area that we are exploring.<br/>
Finally, we are examining the possibilities in the universities, a number of which offer nursing degree courses. It has been put to us that sponsoring just one lecturer could lead to an annual increase of five or six nurses with degree qualifications in our annual intake.<br/>
Those are some of the options that we are exploring. They are quite exciting. I quote them only as examples of what may be possible. As I have said, we are also considering the possibility of a voluntary levy, but I am not very enthusiastic about that. That is why I ask the House to reject the clause.<br/>
First, the discussions are progressing extremely well. Inevitably, if we had such a clause it would undermine the progress that we are making.<br/>
Secondly, I am not sure that the sponsors of the clause have thought through what would happen. The levy would be imposed on all private nursing homes and hospitals employing more than 10 professional staff. It would be completely non-selective. Have Opposition Members appreciated the implications? Would there be no exceptions? As it stands the clause would embrace such premises as homes looking after the terminally ill and would include voluntary and religious homes where many patients are admitted without charge. It would include hundreds of small nursing homes catering exclusively for long-stay, elderly patients. I am sure that this is not the intention of the sponsors of the clause.<br/>
Nor can it be argued that the staff in these homes, even if they were trained in the National Health Service, are not doing jobs that are vital not only to the patients in the homes but also indirectly to the National Health Service. The services in these homes are supplementary to the National Health Service. If this private provision did not exist, the National Health Service would have to provide about 30,000 extra long-stay patient beds.<br/>
The cost to the National Health Service of training staff in these homes is far smaller than the cost of providing for those patients. About 4,000 of these private beds are also used by National


Health Service authorities on a contractual basis to provide a service for National Health Service patients. Would they have to pay? Would that not simply drive up the cost to the National Health Service? Without pursuing the argument further, in view of the time, I would indicate that we are sympathetic to the idea of a levy. We are looking into it. Discussions are taking place. I ask the House not to pursue the clause tonight.</p>

<p>My object in speaking twice was to comment on the Minister's contribution, as I think those hon. Members who have been in the House for some years would probably have divined. The Opposition are somewhat encouraged to learn that the Minister is having discussions with the private sector on this subject. We are interested to learn some of the options for organising training that he is discussing with the private sector. But the real reason for considering the whole subject is not the organisation of training but the sheer cost of training. All our worst fears are borne out by the figures that the hon.

<p>We are surprised that although it costs &#x00A3;50,000 a year to train a doctor, the Government are apparently not talking to the private sector of health care about how that cost is to be met. The hon. Gentleman said that the discussions were primarily about nursing. That feeds our worst fears. It was interesting to learn that even a member of the professions supplementary to medicine, if one can use that shorthand term, costs about &#x00A3;7,500 a year to train. These are substantial figures. The private sector, apparently to be encouraged by the Government and, therefore, destined to grow, unless action is taken, will get the benefit of huge sums of money expended on the training of large numbers of people in the Health Service.</p>

<p>About 75 per cent. of the &#x00A3;8,000 million cost this year of running the National Health Service is borne as a result of employment costs&#x2014;wages, salaries, training and matters of that sort. The answer to the point made by the Minister, which was reinforced by the hon. Member for Macclesfield, is that what the National Health Service loses on the swings, it will gain on the roundabouts. There is obviously a vast outflow of money from the National Health Service to the private sector of medicine under the existing system. This allows the private sector to compete more effectively with the Health Service.</p>

<p>Apart from general fairness, one of the reasons why we want the levy and why we are determined to press it on the Government is to encourage their somewhat feeble response and push them towards a solution of this problem that both sides of the House seem to want. I urge hon. Members to accept the new clause.</p>

<p>In addition to opening the debate, with the leave of the House I should like to reply to questions that arise during it.<br/>
I begin with a statement on which all will agree. There cannot be many jobs of a difficulty or importance exceeding that which we are discussing tonight. The British Steel Corporation is a huge organisation which now disposes of a great deal of modern and good plant, some of it manned and working to international standards, but much of it, alas, overmanned and uncompetitive. The corporation serves what is now a weak home market, with three of its main using industries&#x2014;the shipbuilding industry, the car industry and the mechanical engineering industry&#x2014;in a relatively depressed state and the world supply of steel exceeding the demand. Therefore, steel is a fiercely competitive international trading commodity in a buyer's market.<br/>
There has been heavy investment by the taxpayer of thousands of million of pounds over the last few years under Governments of both parties. As the House is aware, losses falling on the taxpayer have amounted to &#x00A3;1,250 million over the last four and a half years. I repeat that there is much good modern plant and I emphasise&#x2014;I do not think that there is any disagreement&#x2014;that the corporation contains a great deal of talent, skill and pride.<br/>
It is as a result of this background&#x2014;worth a great deal to the country and to those who work for or depend upon the British Steel Corporation and the taxpayer&#x2014;that the present prospects of continuing losses can be reversed. To achieve a transformation in the corporation's affairs will require an enormous

effort by all concerned, and in that effort top leadership can be decisive. Over many months, since the approach of the end of tenure by Sir Charles Villiers later this year, the Government have been seeking the right person to succeed him as chairman.<br/>
A job specification was prepared which sought a combination of ability, experience, character and leadership. We considered many names, nearly all of them British. A number of very senior, and some less senior, people in industry were approached. I can tell the House that for my part I should have been happy to secure any one of a number of candidates who were approached. Each would have filled many, if not all, of the requirements of the job specification.<br/>
The fact is that most of those who were approached declined either because they already occupied highly responsible positions and felt great obligations or because they did not feel that they wished to change career to take up such an exposed and daunting task in the British Steel Corporation.<br/>
There were more or less prolonged discussions with three particularly suitable British men, but, after discussions, two decided that they could not leave their present heavy responsibilities. One of them decided that he would not take the job because he feared, for one reason or another&#x2014;possibly ministerial interference&#x2014;that he would not be free to carry out the policies that he thought would be necessary to transform the prospects for the corporation.<br/>
I must tell the House emphatically that money was not a critical obstacle in a single case. I repeat that I should have been happy if any one of those three&#x2014;and in fact some of the other candidates who were considered&#x2014;had felt able to take on the task. However, without any imputation against any of those men, I believe that&#x2014;except in the matter of age&#x2014;Mr. Ian MacGregor meets the job specification at least as well as, if not better than any other person considered.</p>

<p>A number of names within the corporation were considered. I did not consider anyone within the corporation up to the point of discussion, because in my judgment, and upon the advice I received, I did not feel that any of those under consideration were, in their present state, suitable for this enormously demanding task&#x2014;or as suitable as those whom I had approached.<br/>
Mr. Ian MacGregor&#x2014;I want to convey this to the House&#x2014;is not a man with a single, simple solution to the problems of the BSC. He is not dedicated to tackling overmanning and excessive productive capacity only. He is a man who has in mind a wide range of possibilities that will help the corporation and the country. He is an example of the type of man of whom I wish we had more in this country. He is a technologist&#x2014;a metallurgist&#x2014;who has become an extremely successful industrialist. He is able, experienced, determined and has a powerful and friendly character. He is willing to interrupt a career in which he is a great success, in which he has very high earnings indeed, and which he finds congenial, to take on a daunting task in an extremely exposed position.<br/>
One of the reasons why he is willing, as far as I can see, to take a dramatic drop in earnings and take on this difficult task is a desire to serve the country in which he was born and brought up.<br/>
Having identified the man, we then negotiated the terms necessary to secure him. There was a lengthy bargaining period. The terms that resulted are unorthodox. They reflect the circumstances, especially Mr. MacGregor's desire to remain a partner in Lazard Freres, of New York, in which he has invested much of his savings.</p>

<p>I must get on. I intend, with the leave of the House, to answer questions during the debate. May I make progress now?<br/>
The terms agreed were &#x00A3;675,000 down when Mr. MacGregor takes up his responsibilities. Two-thirds of that sum will be repayable, pro rata, if Mr. MacGregor does not complete his three-year term. The first payment to Lazard Freres is due on 1 July. It was a necessary part of the agreement to secure Mr. MacGregor's services that the first payment should be made to Lazard Freres on the day on which Mr. MacGregor took up his appointment as chairman of the British Steel Corporation and ceased to be a joint partner of Lazard Freres.<br/>
Here I come to the point made by the hon. Member for Keighley, and I had better deal with it precisely. There is no statutory authority for the payment to Lazard Freres, but, as is usual when non-recurrent expenditure arises, authority will be sought under the Appropriation Act by means of a Supplementary Estimate to include a special sub-head in my Department's Vote. That will come forward for consideration as part of the Summer Supplementary Estimates in the normal way.<br/>
Since this Estimate will not be approved by 1 July it is intended to use the Contingencies Fund to make the first payment to Lazard Freres. This is the usual procedure when a Government enter into a commitment of this kind.</p>

<p>No. I am not giving way. I shall be specifically asking leave of the House to reply to questions raised during the debate.<br/>
In addition to the first payment, which I have described, there will be a retrospective fee against performance of up to &#x00A3;1,150,000, which I shall go into in more detail shortly. These two payments together form the compensation, not to Mr. MacGregor, but to the Lazard Freres New York partnership for the loss of the services during three years of a very profitable and active partner now contributing to that company's revenue and profits. I repeat that these payments do not go to Mr. MacGregor direct. I shall come to the implications for Mr. MacGregor shortly.<br/>
I repeat that nearly two-thirds of the payments are conditional upon the results that Mr. MacGregor achieves. The maximum payment may seem big. It is very small in comparison with the cost to the taxpayer, the country and the industry if present losses are not stemmed.<br/>
I am not saying that no other manager in this country could have stemmed those losses, at least to some extent. I am saying that, for the various reasons that I have explained, no one that I approached was willing to take on the job. I judge, moreover, that Mr. MacGregor is at least as capable, if not more capable, of reversing the losses as anyone else. I remind the House that the losses are running at about &#x00A3;1 million a day. If the full compensation is earned and paid it will be a real bargain for the country and a real benefit to those who work in the nationalised steel industry.<br/>
Could anyone else have done the job for less? I have tried to explain to the House that no one we judged as suitable as Mr. MacGregor was ready, for one good reason or another, to take the job.<br/>
Mr. MacGregor himself will earn &#x00A3;48,500, the salary laid down by the Review Body on Top Salaries, for being chairman of BSC. He will keep some fees from other directorships. While he is chairman of British Steel, he will cease to be a full partner&#x2014;that is, an active or general partner&#x2014;of Lazard Freres New York and will become what is called a limited partner. As one of the class of limited partners who have been full partners,

he will get a share of the profits of the partnership. The capital that he has built up during his career is to a large extent invested in the partnership, and of course, he takes the risk of bearing a share of any loss that the partnership experiences.<br/>
If, after his chairmanship of British Steel, he returns to full partnership, he will get the larger share appropriate to full partners. The details of the share that goes to limited ex-general partners and to general partners or full partners are between Lazard Freres New York and Mr. MacGregor.</p>

<p>I think not. I shall do my best to answer questions later.<br/>
To the extent that the compensation payments form part of the income and profit of Lazard Freres New York, Mr. MacGregor's benefit from them will derive solely from his position as a continuing partner, limited or full, in the firm.</p>

<p>No, I am sorry.<br/>
We have been assured that no direct payment is being made to Mr. MacGregor out of the money paid and payable from here to Lazard Freres New York. The normal tax rules will apply.<br/>
I assert that in my view we could not have got this man for less, and I repeat that nearly two-thirds of the maximum payment that may be payable will be conditional upon results.<br/>
I now want to describe the process by which the business and financial objectives of British Steel under Mr. MacGregor will be set. I shall go on to describe the quite separate process for assessing his performance in order to determine the amount of any performance-related final payments to Lazard Freres New York. The two processes of determining the objectives, on the one hand, and of appraising Mr. MacGregor's performance against those objectives, on the other hand, will be quite separate. It is important for the House to understand this.</p>

<p>I am sorry; I am not being discourteous. If it gives me leave, the House will have the opportunity to listen to my answers to questions at the end of the debate.<br/>
The objectives of different nationalised industries vary with circumstances. They normally include a financial target. The targets are set in discussion between the Government and the management of each industry. When Mr. MacGregor has been able to take stock of British Steel's present circumstances, I shall discuss appropriate further targets with him. I have not changed the terms of the &#x00A3;450 million external financing limit for this year. Mr. MacGregor knows the importance that the Government attach to this limit.<br/>
At the apt time, the question of a capital reconstruction will be decided by a similar process of discussion between Government and management. So will the BSC's future structure, including possible sales of plants to the private sectors or private participation in various works. But Lazard Freres will play no part whatsoever in any of these discussions about targets or structure for the BSC.<br/>
I now turn to the quite separate process of assessing the performance criteria for Mr. MacGregor. The criteria are to be agreed by the end of October this year between Mr. MacGregor and me, in consultation with Lazard Freres.</p>

<p>They will be applied by a performance review committee&#x2014;two members each, nominated by Lazard Freres and me, under a chairman acceptable to each of us. The committee will be asked to assess how far Mr. MacGregor establishes the health and strength of British Steel over three or four years from 1 March 1981.<br/>
The criteria will include factors that are quantitative and factors that are qualitative. The criteria might include: the achievement of financial targets; the achievement of a specified level of results by British Steel in the year ending 31 March 1984; the share of the United Kingdom market being achieved by British Steel; the satisfactory establishment of a strong and healthy organisation through, for example, an effective corporate structure; management strength and stability; labour relations stability;

and improved productivity. I repeat that some of these criteria are quantitative and some are qualitative.<br/>
If, as I believe, Mr. MacGregor can put BSC on a healthy footing in all these respects, any payment by results will be worth every penny.<lb />
Let me emphasis this: unless Mr. MacGregor is judged to have improved BSC's health and strength, as measured by each of the criteria, there need be no final payment. Only if he achieves total success will the final payment by results be at the maximum. The first instalment of the payment by results would not become due until April 1984, and any second instalment not until April 1985. So the BSC under Mr. MacGregor will need to have shown steady and lasting improvement.<br/>
Only if Mr. MacGregor ceased for any reason to be chairman before the end of the three years would a recommendation about the payment by results be made sooner, and in that case against the maximum sum reduced in proportion to his period of service. It would be open to the review committee to recommend upwards or downwards in the light of the circumstances leading to any termination of the contract because of serious disagreement between Mr. MacGregor and the Secretary of State at the time.<br/>
Mr. MacGregor must be allowed to tackle the task of leading the BSC to enduring profitability, subject to the exigencies of public finance and to the statutory duties laid upon the corporation and upon myself by the Iron and Steel Acts. I have assured him of as free a band as possible. I hope that the House, whatever its judgment of what I have thought fit to negotiate in the interests of British Steel and for the nation as a whole, will join me in wishing Mr. MacGregor great success in his daunting task.</p>

<p>In another place yesterday, my noble Friend Lord Bruce of Donnington raised the question which we are debating now. He asked a number of searching questions, which the Minister of State, Lord Trenchard, did not attempt to answer. Instead, Viscount Trenchard gave a blanket reply. He said of the Secretary of State:
<q> he sometimes follows a complicated path with very great clarity, and it sometimes takes time for the rest of us to absorb the process of his actions and his reasoning; so we fail, initially at least, to understand his correct conclusions, and they are very often correct.</q>
<q>In this case our minds were perhaps too encrusted in the framework of Britain, and perhaps in the perennial sickness of some of our nationalised industries. Perhaps we were too unimaginative to grasp the world dimension in which his mind had been working."&#x2014;[<i>Official Report, House of Lords</i>, 14 May 1980; Vol. 409, c. 310&#x2013;11.]</q>
I understand that the text of that speech had been approved by the Secretary of State and, presumably, by the Prime Minister. Therefore, it represents definitive Government policy. If the Secretary of State reaches a decision, we must never challenge it&#x2014;he is grasping the world dimension. It may be that we mere mortals are not able to exist in the rarefied atmosphere in which the Secretary of State exists. Unfortunately, as my hon. Friend the Member for Keighley (Mr. Cryer) pointed out, the House has the right and the duty to vote the money that is concerned in this matter. It is to that question that we must direct ourselves, and not to the grasp of the Secretary of State on world dimensions.<br/>
<i>The Economist</i> claimed that the final details of this somewhat complex arrangement were agreed over lunch in an Italian restaurant near Whitehall. To us mere mortals a meeting in such a venue would have been rather difficult&#x2014;but not for the right hon. Gentleman. In between the minestrone and the zabaglione, the right hon. Gentleman satisfied himself that he had picked the right man, and on the right terms. Nevertheless,


having listened to the right hon. Gentleman's speech this afternoon, and having read the speech of Viscount Trenchard yesterday, I find that none of the real questions has been answered. We are entitle to ask whether the Secretary of State asked those questions of himself during that pleasant Italian lunch, or at any time before.<br/>
The Secretary of State has kindly said that he will answer every question that we ask him. I have six questions. Perhaps a note can be taken of them. It is necessary to divide the somewhat complex arrangement into the three payments that are under consideration. The first payment will be &#x00A3;48,500&#x2014;the normal terms for a chairman of a nationalised industry. The second payment works out at &#x00A3;225,000 a year over a three-year period, and will be paid to Lazard Freres. The third payment is a performance payment of up to &#x00A3;1&#x00B7;15 million.<br/>
My first question is: will the &#x00A3;225,000 a year, which is to be paid to Lazard Freres, be subject to United Kingdom tax, or is it free of tax? There is a rather important distinction between the two. If it is subject to United Kingdom tax, the net payment would amount to &#x00A3;122,588 a year&#x2014;a considerable sum in any event, as I think the House would agree. If that payment is grossed up, it is equivalent to a figure of &#x00A3;546,575 a year.<br/>
Secondly, will the performance payment of &#x00A3;1&#x00B7;15 million be subject to United Kingdom tax, or is it free of tax? If it is subject to United Kingdom tax it is equivalent to a sum of &#x00A3;223,388 a year&#x2014;a considerable sum indeed. If it is free of tax it is equivalent to a gross payment of &#x00A3;941,575 a year. The Secretary of State can work out those figures on his own computer.<br/>
All three payments together, if they are subject to tax amount to &#x00A3;369,765 a year. If they are free of tax, they are equivalent to a grossed-up payment of &#x00A3;1,577,075. When such sums of money are considered it is irrelevant whether the money is paid direct to an individual or to his partnership. His interest in that partnership, whether it be direct or indirect, still exists. Such sums of money as are received by the partnership must inevitably increase the goodwill of that partnership and, therefore, increase his stake in it.

We heard from the Secretary of State that Mr. MacGregor sank his life savings into Lazard Freres. That is up to him. Inevitably, the value of those savings must grow if such payments are made. [HON. MEMBERS: " There is nothing wrong with that."] Conservative Members may not think that there is anything wrong with it, but I can assure them that that is not the view that will be taken throughout the country.<br/>
Thirdly, Mr. MacGregor is 67 years old. I make no point about that, except to say&#x2014;[<i>Interruption</i>.]&#x2014;I shall only detain the House longer if Conservative Members keep on. I am trying to put a rather important question to the Secretary of State, who said that he will answer my questions. Therefore, if Conservative Members will permit me, I shall ask the question. Mr. MacGregor is 67. Therefore, he is too old to participate in the normal pension plan. Has a special pension plan been arranged for him? If so, is it additional to the payments that have already been quoted? If so, what is the cost to the long-suffering taxpayer, if I may use a Homeric epithet which the right hon. Gentleman so often uses?<br/>
Fourthly, Mr. MacGregor starts his term of duty as chairman of BSC on 1 July. If, say, after one day, on 2 July, he should unfortunately die, or suppose he should chuck the job, will that &#x00A3;225,000 be immediately forfeit to Lazard Freres? It is not a financial impossibility that, at any rate, he may decide to chuck the job. Other nationalised industry chairmen who have had to deal with the right hon. Gentleman have not been slow in doing so. Therefore, will that sum be forfeit immediately?<br/>
Fifthly, we have heard about some of the criteria which the right hon. Gentleman hopes to agree with the performance review committee, when the time comes. As the right hon. Gentleman spoke a little quickly, I may have miscounted, but I counted about 10. However, I assume that Mr. MacGregor would get a mark for each. Therefore, it would seem that he would get &#x00A3;110,000 or so for every mark which he earned. That would seem to be the basis. But suppose there is disagreement. That is not fanciful either, because there are two Lazard Freres people on the committee, two Government people and an independent chairman&#x2014;a committee of five


&#x2014;which as any lawyer knows is a recipe for disagreement. Can Lazard Freres sue the Government if they resist any claim, just as Mr. Hoppe, who was appointed by a previous Conservative Government to Harland and Wolff, did in his time?<br/>
My sixth question relates to Messrs. Russell Reynolds, the celebrated head-hunters. I noticed that Lord Trenchard, having been asked the question direct, did not reply to it. There seems to be some confusion as to what its remuneration is. This is a matter of which the House should be aware. I understand that Russell Reynolds is being remunerated according to a percentage of Mr. Mac-Gregor's salary. Perhaps we could be told what that percentage is. Will Russell Reynolds also be entitled to a percentage of Lazard Freres' fee, either of &#x00A3;675,000 or of the figure of up to &#x00A3;1&#x00B7;15 million? It might be of use if the House were informed. If the fee is not payable by the British Government, will it be paid by Lazard Freres, because that situation sometimes arises when agents are employed?<br/>
The arrangement itself seems to be a very strange compensation for loss of services. The right hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Grimond) perceptively and effectively pointed that out when the Secretary of State made his statement the other day. After all, loss of services means just that. Those services are lost whether Mr. MacGregor performs well or badly. I know very little about Lazard Freres, but I do not believe that its altruism is such that it would say "We are prepared to lose &#x00A3;1&#x00B7;15 million if MacGregor does not fit your criteria ". Therefore, this remains a very odd agreement indeed.<br/>
I turn again to Messrs Russell Reynolds. They are paid on a percentage of salary. I make no complaint about that; it must be so. Russell Reynolds are good businessmen, and the right hon. Gentleman is rightly interested in the question of profit. It must be in the company's interest to produce the more highly-paid candidates. That brings me to something which has bedevilled Governments of all sorts&#x2014;the question of how people are chosen or appointed in respect of the chairmanship of quangos or nationalised industries.<br/>
As I think every hon. Member knows, they come by a list of the great and the

good which the Civil Service Department&#x2014;it used to be the Treasury&#x2014;produces. The great and the good are rather rare in number, because in order to be great or good one must have existed in the favour of the Establishment for a rather long time, and there are not many of them. In addition, they get a bit aged as time goes by.<br/>
What happens to head-hunters? They also go immediately for their list of the great and the good. Indeed, I assume that some of the names are supplied by the Civil Service Department. They do what is called " a trawl ". In answer to a question from one of my hon. Friends, the right hon. Gentleman said that Russell Reynolds had considered 31 people&#x2014;not much of a trawl; more a fish farm when one thinks of it. [HON. MEMBERS: " Did they ask you? "] No, and I would have had to consider the position carefully, because my ideas of shaping the BSC are, first, the right ones, and, secondly, very different from those of the Secretary of State. Therefore, 31 represents a very small section of those who perhaps would have been capable of doing the job, myself included.<br/>
I notice that Mr. MacGregor was quoted in the <i>Financial Times</i> as saying that he felt it was an honour to be asked to help to bring about a reverse of the decline in industrial Britain. Good for him. I make no cheap point about it. But others have felt the same. There must be more than 31 people in this country who have also felt the same thing. There is the example of Mr. Atkinson, the new chairman of British Shipbuilders. In his opening remarks, the right hon. Gentleman pointed out how similar the two industries were. Both are in a position of difficulty, both are facing monumental world competition and so on. Mr. Atkinson said:
<q>As far as I am concerned I am and always have been an intensely patriotic person. I have always said and always will say ' I will serve my country wherever and whenever required'.</q>
Mr. Atkinson did not say " I am terribly sorry, but someone else ought to be paid for my loss of services." He accepted a salary cut of &#x00A3;7,000 a year in order to do the job.<br/>
Again I do not make a party point. But I think that here is an opportunity for a change. It is time that we got rid of the short trawl, paying head-hunters vast


sums of money and taking the list from the great and the good. A number of my hon. Friends have come more and more to the conclusion&#x2014;</p>

<p>No, I shall not give way. A number of my hon. Friends have come more and more to the conclusion that these posts should be publicly advertised. That seems to be the right way of doing it.<br/>
In this case, a distinguished man has been brought across the water to take over British Steel, an industry about which he knows absolutely nothing.<br/>
What do people in middle management feel? What do people in that industry feel? During the general election campaign we heard a lot from the Conservative Members about the lack of incentive for middle management. All this was supposed to be cured the moment a Conservative Government came to power. What kind of an incentive is it that says " You may strive as hard as you will, but it does not matter because we shall bring in someone else over your head to the chair&#x2014;someone who knows nothing about the business. Furthermore, just to rub it in, we shall pay the equivalent of &#x00A3;1,577,075 "&#x2014;if I am right about it being tax-free&#x2014;" for the privilege of doing so "? If this is intended to raise the morale of those in middle management, it will have exactly the opposite effect. British industry should be self-seeding, and it should give all those with ability within the industry the opportunity to rise from the shop floor or from management to the chairman's chair. That should be the basis on which we should work.<br/>
The damage has been done, subject to a vote of the House. Mr. MacGregor has been appointed, but he faces some rather critical judges in the job ahead. First, he will be judged by the work force. That is the same work force as the Secretary of State, in stark contrast to what he has offered Mr. MacGregor and his friends, thinks is worth only an additional 2 per cent., despite inflation at 21 per cent. I have heard it said&#x2014;indeed the Minister of State said it yesterday&#x2014;that we must not judge these payments by British standards, because they are very common in the United States. If such payments to chief executives are commonplace in the United States, perhaps it is about time the

steel workers began to get United States wages too, because the United States steel industry is also in great difficulties.<br/>
Mr. MacGregor will also be judged by middle management, because it has the knowledge, the industry and the expertise. Middle management will know whether Mr. MacGregor is taking advantage of the opportunities that have been offered to him as chairman.<br/>
Finally, Mr. MacGregor will be judged by this House. I wish to re-echo the final words of the Secretary of State. Of course we wish Mr. MacGregor well in his job, provided that he does that job well. The truth of the matter is that Mr MacGregor will be in a position of great strength if he cares to use it. The Secretary of State has paid so much for him that he really cannot afford to treat him like Sir William Barlow or Sir Leslie Murphy of the NEB. He dare not do it. The Secretary of State is the prisoner of the new chair man and not the other way around. The question is, has the new chairman the courage, imagination and wisdom&#x2014;</p>

<p>Yes, he has the money, but does he have the other qualities which are much more important? Has he the courage, wisdom and imagination to reverse the trend in the industry under the Secretary of State? Will he reverse the policy on redundancies? We shall all judge him by that. Will he tell the Secretary of State that he must cast aside his rigid and absurd timetable that was originally imposed upon the industry and from which it still suffers? Will he see that steel does not suffer from lack of investment? We do not know. We must suspend our judgment until we see what happens. We hope that Mr. MacGregor has that wisdom and courage. If he does not have it he will find that he has critics enough and that he must tread a thorny path. If he takes up the challenge, we shall wish him all the luck in the world. But in the meantime this staggering arrangement, entered into by the Secretary of State, who obviously has not the faintest idea of the sort of people with whom he is dealing, without the authority of the House, is something that we shall protest about in the Lobbies tonight.</p>

<p>I speak as one who has been


in the steel industry. I confess that I do not know Mr. MacGregor. When I was in the industry in 1950, and then again when I was in the House in 1970 I found that Conservative Ministers had to take responsibility for managing the corporate State, State Socialism, and the Socialist machine. I find that now, too. The very fact that we are having this debate today has made my right hon. Friend's task more difficult. He is in danger of being drawn into being a good Socialist caretaker of a Socialist legacy. The British Steel Corporation could be a monument to Socialist dogma if we do not look after it. There is a great temptation for my right hon. Friend to fall into a trap. He has resisted it so far, but I am conscious that he is having a difficult time in putting his case.<br/>
The right hon. Member for Deptford (Mr. Silkin) made one or two other suggestions. He said that we should publicly advertise these posts and publish the <i>curricula vitae</i> of the candidates. That would put many people off. Most appointments are made by selection from within, whether the company is from this country or anywhere else. The fact that we had a special form of selection for the new head of the BSC presented any person offering himself as a candidate with a challenge. Mr. MacGregor put his name forward and was chosen.<br/>
Before I entered the House in 1958 I took the view that politics were too all-embracing and the less that Governments took on the better. My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister has also said this time and time again. In 1958&#x2013;59, I added the rider that the less politicians concerned themselves with, the better. This might have ruined my chances of the Conservative candidature for the Hallam constituency, but I felt that if my political opponents thought that the road to power was political, I, too, was prepared to go along it with a view to ensuring the maximum decentralisation and flexibility.<br/>
I regret that basic steel is still a State monopoly. In the debates that we had during the strike, I claimed that the corporation was inevitably a dinosaur and that unless it lost its imponderous characteristics it would destroy the jobs of many of its workers. The strike of

the last three months has been expensive&#x2014;expensive, too, to everyone who is not in the industry. It has been a bonanza for our competitors and it will take a long time and a lot of courage to overcome the dangers to job opportunities in a city such as mine.</p>

<p>We must consider the fact that the British Steel Corporation has been losing almost &#x00A3;1 million a day. This is a great challenge to everyone in the industry.<br/>
In another place Lord Trenchard had to explain the virtues of Mr. MacGregor, after Lord Bruce of Donington had ridiculed the appointment. The right hon. Member for Deptford asked who had been approached and who had been turned down. I think that this is the most deplorable example of the difficulties of running any State industry. We have mentioned that the British Steel Corporation loses &#x00A3;1 million a day. In his statements on 1 May and subsequently the Secretary of State gave the terms of the appointment. Of course, there is the figure of &#x00A3;1,150,000. Depending on the outcome, one could call this a bonus payment for success, part of which is a transfer fee. Against that, hon. Members must look to the future of British Steel bulk steel, and to what is happening in the world.<br/>
There has been much press comment on my right hon. Friend's decision. In <i>The Times</i> on 12 May, Catherine Gunn pointed out that top industrial salaries in the United Kingdom could be &#x00A3;100,000 a year. The United States list of companies paying high salaries included Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Mobil, McGraw-Edison, Revlon and Hughes Tool. They all provide good salaries, with the chance of top directors participating in the capital structure of the companies.<br/>
Reference has been made to Mr. Robert Atkinson, who took a pay cut to become the head of a nationalised industry. Many people have claimed that my right hon.


Friend's appointment of Mr. MacGregor was an extraordinary political decision, but a decision had to be made. I was in Sheffield when my right hon. Friend made his decision. It stunned those in both the public and the private sectors, because it was an unusual if not extraordinary decision. I found it difficult to defend the decision, but we have to bear in mind that the total sum involved is only two days' losses of the BSC. I do not resent reward, because whoever takes the job under my right hon. Friend will have a difficult and unenviable task.<br/>
I have spent two days this week at the annual meeting of the Metals Society, at a conference of metallurgists, managers and leaders of steel industries throughout the world. I spent more time there than usual because I wanted to sense what is going on in other countries. Last year's president was a Dutchman. The current president, an Australian, was a professor at Sheffield University and is Goldsmith Professor at the Department of Metallurgy, Cambridge, which is where I gained my degree. The department course at the metallurgical department taught me to look out for the sources of materials for all metal industries, including the steel industry, and I could well have gone into mining.<br/>
At the Metals Society I had conversations with the heads of steel industries in Japan, Hungary and Yugoslavia, and even with a delegation from China which visited Sheffield this week. There is a company called Climax Molybdenum, one of the biggest suppliers of molybdenum to British Steel. It is part of AMAX. Mr. MacGregor has done much to bring together Climax Molybdenum and the American Metals Company.<br/>
I took the precaution of speaking to those in the BSC, mainly the technological management. They realised that a decision had been made and I sensed that they wanted it to work and rather resented the fact that I, for example, had a right to question the decision. The message that I received was " The decision has been made, give it a chance." If hon. Members spoke to the managements in the steel factories in their constituencies they would find the same reaction.<br/>
If my right hon. Friend and Ian MacGregor can pull the BSC round and

bring in some of the changes that are necessary, a sore for our country could become something of which we are proud.<br/>
The right hon. Member for Deptford spoke about the world-wide dimension and referred to Lord Trenchard's speech in another place. In the past two days I have learnt of new steel plants going up in Yugoslavia, Algeria, Mexico, Venezuela and Brazil. The iron ore and the cheap materials are to be found in some of the Latin American countries. I remember making a speech, as a Conservative candidate, saying " Wealth is where wealth is." I could go into the history of why the steel industry moved to Sheffield. The raw materials were there a century and a half ago, but that is not so true now.<br/>
I have been concerned with materials through the parliamentary and scientific committee. A number of members of that committee attended a meeting in November, organised by the Metals Society and the Institute of Mining Metallurgy to take a look at the resources for the metal and engineering industries, including the steel industry.<br/>
What could the future of the BSC be? It could be that more of the industry, particularly in Sheffield, will, as the hon. Member for Sheffield, Heeley (Mr. Hooley) suggested, move into stainless steel and special steel, but one of the great difficulties of the steel industry has been to secure supplies of raw materials. We have discussed cobalt. That has been dealt with by AMAX, as have molybdenum and tungsten.<br/>
There are huge operations throughout the world. I see that AMAX is even the owner of the Selibi-Phikwe mine in Botswana, which I, with one or two Labour Members, have visited.<br/>
Therefore, the perspective of the British steel industry and the individual units within it is to be aware of where the materials come from. Mr. MacGregor is one of those who have lived with that perspective.<br/>
The cost may be high and the reward for Mr. MacGregor, if he succeeds, may be heavy, but, in spite of criticism from many of my friends outside, I congratulate my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for being courageous and taking a chance. I wish to back it.</p>

<p>The Government justify the conditions of Mr. MacGregor's appointment by arguing that British Steel is a commercial company and must, therefore, pay international commercial rates for top management. But British Steel is not a commercial company. It is a public institution supported by the taxpayer, as the Secretary of State is constantly pointing out. The BSC does not have to raise its own money or satisfy shareholders, its directors stand in no fear of bankruptcy and it has a Minister of the Crown looking over its shoulder all the time.<br/>
The pretence that nationalised industries are ordinary commercial undertakings lies at the root of many of our troubles. We are in danger of having the worst of all worlds. They are not ordinary commercial undertakings and are subject to none of the disciplines of such undertakings. On the other hand, we are in danger of killing any spirit of public service in those undertakings that are genuine public service undertakings. The only valid reason for putting any business directly under State control is that it should not be run solely on commercial motives, but, like the Armed Forces and the Post Office, should be run as a public service answerable to Parliament.<br/>
Governments are in the process of wrecking some of those services, including the Post Office, by trying to make them into bogus commercial businesses and are, in the process, throwing away all the esprit de corps that such organisations once enjoyed. Years ago, Mr. W. R. Williams used to sit near me on this Bench. He spent much of his life in the Post Office and was as proud of it as old General Jeffreys was of the Brigade of Guards. Why? Because he had a genuine sense of public service.<br/>
What would the Army think if the Government said that they were not pleased with the performance of the Brigade of Guards and had hired an excellent German mercenary and were paying him a lot of money to smarten up the Brigade? I do not think that the Army would respond well to that.<br/>
Of course, nationalised industries are not treated as commercial undertakings. The British Gas Corporation is ordered

by the Government to put up its prices and is treated as a tax collector rather than as a commercial undertaking.<br/>
Steel making should never have been nationalised. It was not an appropriate industry for nationalisation. Does Mr. MacGregor's appointment mean that the Government have decided to keep British Steel as a large nationalised undertaking run very much as at present? Is that the significance of the appointment? If so, I believe that the Government are wrong. It will not work. If the Government do not intend to keep British Steel essentially as it is&#x2014;perhaps pared down&#x2014;has Mr. MacGregor been given a remit to suggest different forms of organisation? For example, are the Government contemplating splitting up the steel industry into smaller units?<br/>
Can we be told exactly what Mr. MacGregor's job will be? I have listened to the Secretary of State and I have read the speech of the noble Lord, but I remain confused as to the nature of his job. It is inconceivable that in three short years he will manage the unmanageable so brilliantly that it will be all right for all time. I do not believe that that is possible. During those three years he might suggest totally different methods. What will he do? How much independence will he be given? What directions will the Secretary of State give him? The terms of the contract would be peculiar even in football circles. Presumably the &#x00A3;225,000 a year is free of tax. Who will pay the head-hunters? How much? Why are they necessary?<br/>
We have been assured that Mr. MacGregor is known all over the world. The Prime Minister said that everyone recognised that Mr. MacGregor was one of the most outstanding industrialists, not only in America or Japan but in the world. Presumably the Secretary of State knew him. In that case, why did he have to go to Russell Reynolds and be told something that he already knew? I do not understand why the Government had to employ such people. The extraordinary arrangement involving &#x00A3;1&#x00B7;15 million appears to be a wager. The terms of the wager are that if Mr. MacGregor does well, Lazard Freres will win. If he does badly, it will not lose. Why was the bet made? Lazard Freres is being paid for the loss of Mr.


MacGregor's services. Has British Leyland been paid for the loss of his services? He was deputy chairman of British Leyland. Is British Leyland being given a cut? What services did he perform at Lazard Freres? After all, he had 50 other directorships. He could not have worked full-time for Lazard Freres. If he did, he must have been working double time, because he was working part-time for 50 other firms as well as British Leyland.<br/>
This is not a direct incentive payment. In some ways I wish that it was. Part of the reason behind this method of payment was to get round taxation. If a direct incentive payment had been made, it would have been taxable. However, if a payment is made to Lazard Freres, it is not taxable. Mr. MacGregor is a partner in Lazard Freres, and presumably he will gain considerably. Lazard Freres will avoid paying tax. I can see no other reason for entering into that strange arrangement.<br/>
If Mr. MacGregor were to put his own money into British Steel and if he were to take a risk, it would be appropriate for him to receive a share of the profits if the firm did well. He is not doing that. Neither he nor Lazard Freres is putting money into British Steel. They would not dream of doing so. He is not an entrepreneur. He is risking neither his reputation nor his capital. He is as old as, or older than I am. At my age, one's reputation is finished.<br/>
Mr. MacGregor is a public servant. Other public servants should be treated in the same way. What is being done to Sir Michael Edwardes? He is doing a good job at British Leyland. What extra payments will he receive? If this example is set, what will happen to the other heads of nationalised industries? The arrangement will have a bad effect on wage restraint in the public sector. In a recent debate I pointed out that the fundamental cause of inflation was the repeated demands for more money by institutions and unions, regardless of output. Such demands must be stopped at the top. We cannot go on chasing our own inflationary tails. We must cut that vicious circle at the top. An American President is said to have had a notice on his desk saying, " The buck stops here ". Ministers and top public servants should have notices on their desks saying " Inflationary

drive is reversed here. No more money at the top until inflation is under control."<br/>
I regard Mr. MacGregor's appointment as an affront to those in public service. Nurses do a skilled job. Public service jobs are often more boring than running a big firm such as Lazard Freres. I suspect that that firm has its interesting moments. Some public servants are badly paid. The Government are presuming on their dedication and patriotism. They are expected to go on struggling. A wealthy man is to be paid the going rate.<br/>
If one spends one million pounds here, and another million pounds there, what is that in the affairs of the BSC? It is a mere bagatelle. How does that rate appear to nurses and to those who work hard, with a sense of public dedication?<br/>
To quote a phrase once used in reply to a question that I asked, this is indeed the unacceptable face of socialist capitalism.<br/>
I wish Mr. MacGregor well. I accept that the nationalised industries pose great difficulties for the Secretary of State. I have every sympathy with him, but I believe that the terms of Mr. MacGregor's appointment are a mistake.</p>

<p>Having listened to hollow and bogus speeches from the Opposition, I must unreservedly congratulate my right hon. Friend on this inspired appointment. I represent a constituency in which 16,000 of British Steel's employees work. Their future welfare will depend upon the success of the man who leads the BSC. They have a vested interest in his success.<br/>
I place on record how impressed everyone at that plant in Scunthorpe was when Mr. MacGregor made a private visit to the constituency on Monday and Tuesday. He was received with enthusiasm by senior managers, middle managers and union representatives. I have since spoken to a cross-section of all three sectors, and I can assure my right hon. Friend that Mr. MacGregor very much impressed those who work in the BSC.<br/>
We had a knockabout turn from the right hon. Member for Deprford (Mr. Silkin). We have heard a lot of bogus questions about pension rights and other


questions on similar side issues. However, no Opposition Member can question Mr. MacGregor's clear ability to take on this difficult appointment. He has an international track record, and is known throughout the world. Indeed, if Opposition Members had done their homework on Lazard Freres they would have known of that reputation. His reputation is clear and beyond all doubt. Those steel managers who will have to work with the gentleman have no doubt about his ability. They have no doubt that he is the best man available for the job. No one has questioned that fact.<br/>
My right hon. Friend is to be congratulated on having spared no effort to secure the services of Mr. MacGregor. It was an unenviable task. Not many people want the job. My right hon. Friend went to great pains to stress that he approached others, but that none of them wanted the job. One can understand why they do not want the chairmanship of the BSC.<br/>
We should pay tribute to the sense of public duty that Sir Charles Villiers has displayed. What thanks has he received? All hon. Members have criticised him. He has had to bear the brunt of a tremendous amount of criticism. Any man who took on such an appointment would have to bear such criticism. It is a thankless task, and we should be grateful to anyone who takes it on. However, we do not want just anyone to take on the job. It is important to get the right man for the job. The livelihood and welfare of many of my constituents depend on Mr. MacGregor's success.<br/>
I do not begrudge him his appointment. He is receiving only &#x00A3;48,500. It is the transfer fee that seems to cause Opposition Members the greatest unease. If that is the price that we have to pay, I say unreservedly that it is time that we started to get off our high-horses about the chairmanships of nationalised industries and to recognise that the type of person that we want to run nationalised industries is the best, and has to be the best. It may be that in future we shall have to pay for the best.<br/>
In the past we have always regarded the chairmanship of a nationalised industry as, in a sense, a reward. There was sometimes the prospect of a knighthood, or a peerage in another place. However, the nature of the job has changed in recent

years. We should start to take a more realistic and twentieth-century approach to the chairman of our top nationalised industries.<br/>
We should not be spending three hours of parliamentary time merely talking about the pension arrangements and one or two other issues raised by the right hon. Member for Deptford (Mr. Silkin). The steel industry has recently been through a most damaging and self-inflicted dispute. It has little time if it is to survive in the increasingly tougher international world of surplus capacity, declining demand and increasing imports into Britain. If we have to pay the price for the best man, so be it.<br/>
If Mr. MacGregor is successful, it will mean relief and encouragement for steel workers, who need reassurance for the future. I understand that Mr. MacGregor has accepted the disciplines that the Government, as guardians of the taxpayer, have rightly imposed on the corporation. These are the same disciplines as those that were imposed by the right hon. Member for Chesterfield (Mr. Varley) when he was Secretary of State.<br/>
No man can wave a magic wand when he sits in the hot seat in Grosvenor Place. Mr. MacGregor will rely on the skills of the unions, of management and of the steel workers to assist him. No one imagines that the mere replacement of one man by another solves the problem. We are all alive to the realities. However, Mr. MacGregor's job immediately is to restore morale and confidence in a flagging industry. Within days of coming to the corporation he took the trouble to make a purely private visit to my constituency. He was received enthusiastically and he was most impressive in the way in which he acquitted himself before those who have been in the industry for a lifetime.<br/>
The managing director of the Scunthorpe division of the BSC, Mr. Don Ford, has been in the industry virtually since leaving school. He recognised immediately the skills of Mr. MacGregor. One is a metallurgist and the other is an international manager. From what I have read, Mr. MacGregor recognises that we must make full use of modern technology. In Scunthorpe and elsewhere we have some of the most modern plants in the steel industry.<br/>
Technology changes constantly. I hope that Mr. MacGregor will recognise that


once manpower productivity is dealt with we shall have to continue with modern technology. For example, we shall have to continue to introduce continuous casting. I hope that my right hon. Friend will recognise that it is important for a man of Mr. MacGregor's managerial ability to have freedom within the corporation to invest as much as possible in new technology. In the first instance, it is essential that we deal with manpower requirements.<br/>
Scunthorpe has agreed the rationalisation programme. I pay an unreserved tribute to the local unions that have agreed to a rationalisation programme involving the loss of 2,800 jobs. It was a difficult decision for Scunthorpe. It is a problem that has been recognised by the unions during the past two or three months. I think that reality dawned on them during the steel strike. They have recognised that it is essential that the manpower issue should be settled as quickly as possible.<br/>
There was a difficult climate in the steel industry, but towards the end of the strike I noticed a healthy realism overtaking union leaders. That realism has been present among steel workers for many months. The appointment of Mr. MacGregor, coupled with the sense of realism, is a hint of distinct optimism. There is a hint that my right hon. Friend has taken a courageous decision.<br/>
People like to be led, and they like firm leadership. That is what has impressed the ordinary steel worker in my constituency. My right hon. Friend may rest assured that there is no opposition from management, unions and the work force on the shop floor. I suggest to Labour Members that they are misleading the House if they suggest that Mr. MacGregor's appointment will be opposed.<br/>
It is important for us all to recognise that the steel industry needs a fresh approach. Nevertheless, it needs to recognise the basic reality that my right hon. Friend recognised from the moment he took on his own position. I do not underestimate the difficulties before Mr. MacGregor. I believe that his appointment is now being recognised as inspired. I wish him success. Upon that success will depend the success of the BSC and the industrial success and future of my

constituency. I congratulate my right hon. Friend upon this appointment, and I give it my enthusiastic endorsement.</p>

<p>I hope that what I have to say will not be seen as an attack on an individual in the person of Mr. MacGregor. It must be acknowledged that there was not a word of that vein in the speech of my right hon. Friend the Member for Deptford (Mr. Silkin).<br/>
Mr. MacGregor has had to carry the stigma of the Secretary of State's peculiar and idiosyncratic approach to the steel industry. For us mere mortals it is difficult to follow the Secretary of State's byzantine thought processes. A peculiar arrangement has been adopted whereby Mr. MacGregor's performance is to be judged. A super-quango is to adjudge a quango chairman. We are baffled. We know not how the arrangement will work. What weight will be given to the quantitative factors? What weight will be given to the qualitative factors? All that we know is that when Mr. MacGregor is about 73 years of age in 1985 the final evaluation will be made.<br/>
The Minister has tried as best he can to explain this peculiar arrangement. We shall judge Mr. MacGregor in due course. I wish Mr. MacGregor well. I hope that he will read the report of the debate when he has the opportunity to do so.<br/>
Although Mr. MacGregor is of British origin, he has spent 35 years mainly in American industry. That does not mean that he has a close awareness of the real problems of the great British steel industry. I believe that its financial problems can be resolved reasonably. The real problem of leadership of BSC in the next few years is that of human management and personal relationships. These are the problems that Alf Robens had to face in the coal industry many years ago. It is necessary for there to be a deep awareness if we are to ensure that this great industry comes through its present problems.<br/>
There is nothing necessarily wrong in appointing someone from abroad to a key job. Different people have different but honestly held views on who is the best man for the job. However, given the Minister's track record and general approach, what weight can we put on his judgment? I hope, therefore, that it was


not the right hon. Gentleman's decision but was considered widely within the Government. For the sake of the industry, I hope that there has been wide discussion. The industry demands and deserves the best man, whoever he is.<br/>
We are concerned about the future. Mr. MacGregor is reported to have said that he wanted to " add 2,000 yards to the runway ". If that means that he wants to get rid of more jobs than the present management intends, that is serious. However, I read Lord Trenchard's speech in the Lords yesterday when he said that Mr. MacGregor had done nothing yet to request a change in the general course. In South Wales we are deeply dissatisfied with the general course and our share of the market. We should like a change. Deep injustice is felt throughout the industry, from top management in South Wales downwards.<br/>
We fear that under this peculiar byzantine performance arrangement devised by the Minister and his advisers the measurement of performance will lie basically in short-term profitability. We shall fight bitterly and deeply to the end if that involves more job losses. However, if Mr. MacGregor's remarks about 2,000 yards more runway mean that he wants more room to manoeuvre and leap out of the straitjacket imposed on the industry by the Government, he will have our support. The present time scale of cash limits cannot be achieved. The Minister has given Mr. MacGregor, or whoever is to be chairman, an unfair start.<br/>
The new chairman should look at certain problems immediately. First, he should press the Government for urgent capital reconstruction. Why should the workers have the albatross of previous investment decisions by Governments of both parties hang round their necks after this year? Why should they bear that burden alone? A considerable part of BSC's losses is due to servicing existing capital. We have experience of the grandiose plans for industry of the present Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in a previous Tory Government. I confess that I welcomed with open arms those that concerned my constituencies, although we are left without a new hot mill that is badly needed. However, in their totality those plans have proved

wholly wrong, having regard to the share of the market that BSC professes that it can win.<br/>
Secondly, I hope that the new chairman will turn his beady eye on the forecasters in BSC, who have been proved to be wrong time after time. Incidentally, he might immediately give a golden handshake to the bright boy who conceived the idea of making steel at Port Talbot and sending it to Llanwern to be finished, which would have been the longest production line in the world. The best possible investment would be to give that man a large handshake to ensure that his services did not again militate against BSC's fortunes.<br/>
Thirdly, the new chairman should inquire into the entire management structure of BSC, starting at board level. There are too few independent board members, able, with adequate resources and research support, to give their independent views to the board, if necessary, through direct access to the Minister, as I experienced when I was a Minister at the Ministry of Power a long time ago. Where grave decisions of national importance have to be taken, no major national industry, whether publicly or privately owned, can afford industrially incestuous arrangements.<br/>
The next question that the new chairman should ask is whether he needs a chief executive at present. If so, should there be a chief executive's committee or whatever it is called to present uniform monolithic views before each board meeting? Another important question is what opportunity there is within the board to ensure that members of management are able to dissent and provide the board with alternative plans, as opposed to the present monolithic arrangement.<br/>
There is great concern about the prodigality in numbers of former United Steel men in BSC. In South Wales and other parts of the country they are known as " United Steel's mafia ". The arrangement is odd. Why are about a dozen former United Steel executives in key positions in BSC? They may be the best available. I know some of them very well and hold them in the highest regard. However, it is extremely odd that so many former executives of one firm are at one time in major positions right across the whole of BSC. Is it any wonder, therefore, that there is no uniformity of view


in BSC? In contrast to this, there is no one from the Welsh steel industry in the top echelons of BSC. The same goes for many other parts of the country. Therefore I hope that very soon the chairman will examine&#x2014;I can give him the names; they are well-known&#x2014;the 10 or 12 people, right across industry, who are in high positions. If they are the best, certainly they should be kept and, if necessary, promoted and given wider responsibilities. However, it is odd that at one time there should be so many people from one stable. I know that that feeling is not confined to Wales.<br/>
The next matter that the chairman should examine is the over-centralised commercial structure of the board. I raised this matter in the December debate. It is not possible for this great industry to sell its products through one highly centralised commercial arrangement. There are six or seven businesses in the board. The centralised machinery should be broken up and tied much closer to the individual plants. The customer would then be able to complain directly to the plant. If there is any problem of double sourcing, if one buys Port Talbot or Llanwern steel, one may double source either for industrial or any other reason in any other part of BSC. That will be welcomed by the work force and the management. The Minister should consider that point rapidly.<br/>
A retrograde step was taken by transferring the Welsh tinplate industry from the sheet steel division to Sheffield. The Secretary of State for Wales lost another battle in that context&#x2014;if he fought it at all, and I suspect that he did not. If that decision was taken ambiguously in the tinplate industry, may I warn him now that the greater the distance from those who provide supplies, the greater will be the jeopardy of the industry when problems of new investment arise in the future. Therefore, I hope that this matter can be examined speedily to ensure that the Government go back on the step taken only a few months ago, as they had to do in the past with so many of the other plants.<br/>
I wish the new chairman well. He has a very difficult task indeed. I hope that he has the room for manoeuvre that is necessary, that he is not kept in a

straitjacket and that he is given the necessary capital reconstruction. I hope that he will speedily consider the board structure, and the structure immediately below it, because this industry, which provides the livelihood for the overwhelming number of my constituents, and of those of many of my right hon. and hon. Friends, should be given the chance to play a formidable and important part as a major part of British manufacturing industry.</p>

<p>One of the Government's tasks is to educate the British people in economic realities&#x2014;realities which the previous Labour Government, all too often, pretended did not exist. One of those realities is that many of our nationalised industries are overmanned, unproductive and badly managed. It therefore follows that they need the best management that money can buy.<br/>
Another economic reality is that top managerial talent does not work for peanuts, I am afraid. It follows that we must match international rates if we are to persuade top people to work in the nationalised industries.<br/>
Another economic reality is that the nationalised industries are unattractive to international top managers, because they are always at risk from non-commercial pressures from Ministers and other politicians. Most nationalised industries are monopolies. Therefore, management must negotiate with monopoly unions. That encourages trade union irresponsibility, to put it mildly.<br/>
At the same time, the industries rely on the Government for funds and therefore their investment plans are liable to be affected by whether the Government wish to expand the economy or otherwise, rather than by the market forces affecting the industry.<br/>
It follows that it is not sufficient to match the top rates in the private sector. We must exceed them if we are to attract people into the nationalised industries.<br/>
A further economic reality is that, of all the nationalised industries, the British Steel Corporation is the least attractive to anyone who wants to work in them. First, it is bankrupt. Secondly, its markets


have completely collapsed, and the chairman will inherit the problem of enormous redundancies, which will dog industrial relations for many years.<br/>
That suggests to me that the chairman must be paid even more than any other nationalised industry chairman. The point has been clearly made that the pay intended for Mr. MacGregor is negligible compared with the vast losses incurred by the corporation.<br/>
I should like to ask three questions about Mr. MacGregor's terms of reference. First, are they perhaps too narrow? They seem to me to be confined to managing the corporation and working within the existing structure. But another economic reality is that the steel workers who earn the best wages and have the highest productivity and the greatest job security are those in the private sector. It follows that the best thing that Mr. MacGregor can do in managing BSC&#x2014;indeed, the best thing that he can do for the British steel industry as a whole&#x2014;is to move as many steel workers as possible into the private sector.<br/>
Secondly, is Mr. MacGregor expected to work within the cash limits? I understand that he has ideas about financing expansion and going into different areas, moving towards finished products and so on. Will he be in a position to return to the House for new money to finance those developments; or will he be expected to do so by disposals within the corporation?<br/>
My third question is about the future of Shotton. Will Mr. MacGregor be free, and encouraged by the Government, to sell the whole complex there to the private sector? It is far more important that we worry about job security in the area than about whether selling the whole of Shotton fits in with a corporation master plan.<br/>
I believe that the British steel industry has a great future but that that future largely lies in the private sector.</p>

<p>Because of the time, I shall not take up the point raised by the hon. Member for Epsom and Ewell (Mr. Hamilton).

I recall the earlier remarks of the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Osborn), who referred to the condition in which British Steel emerged from the recent dreadful strike. He knows, as I and some of my hon. Friends who are so close to the Sheffield scene know, the impact that the strike had on steel locally. We are all too well aware that as a result the industry is now weaker, that many of its foreign and home markets have been lost. The trade unions have, unhappily, little to show for that strike. They are expected to negotiate collectively in future&#x2014;and that is a gain&#x2014;but they are embittered, divided and weakened.<br/>
The chairman, if anybody, can pick up the pieces. That is why we are so concerned about the appointment of a new chairman, apart from the controversial circumstances of the present appointment.<br/>
Despite the assurances of the Secretary of State, I wonder whether he will be equal to this challenge. I am sceptical about his possessing the requisite qualities. I cannot see, given his record, impressive though it is, but in a different context and in a different scene, how he can have an understanding of trade union attitudes in Britain, especially in steel. He could not have got off to a worse start. The manner of his appointment has undone all the impression of non-intervention that the Government were so concerned to create during the steel strike.<br/>
As recently as February the Prime Minister told the House that she had total confidence in Sir Charles Villiers, the outgoing chairman. The events of the past week, with Sir Charles going three months before the end of his contract and the evidence that the Secretary of State, the Prime Minister and, presumably, a Cabinet Committee had long been acting as executive head-hunters, must have considerably undermined that public posture of the earlier weeks of this year.<br/>
All the more regrettable is the manner in which the appointment of Mr. MacGregor was arrived at, and then presented. The Secretary of State must surely agree. The right hon. Gentleman cannot be proud of the way in which the appointment has been presented, not merely to the House but also to the public. He must surely recognise that it has destroyed any lingering, positive


impact that he might have been concerned to bring about as a result of the steel strike and his role in it.<br/>
It was insensitive in the extreme, especially at a time when the industry is striving to climb out of the wreckage of the strike, to announce a payment of this size, upon which the Secretary of State has again dwelt today, for the services of just one man. After the strike and the disappointment of workers in the steel industry, I do not know how the hon. Member for Brigg and Scunthorpe (Mr. Brown) could have been so uncritical of the Secretary of State's appointment and could so unreservedly have expressed approval of it, informing the House that this approval had the endorsement of many, though perhaps not most, of those who work in the Scunthorpe steel industry.<br/>
I am staggered that the hon. Gentleman could have made such a claim, if I understood his remarks correctly. I can only say that steel workers in Sheffield, a few miles away, take precisely the opposite view. As recently as yesterday, as well as last week, many have drawn to my attention the comparison of their pay with the cut that is to go to Lazards. The hon. Member for Hallam, who has now left the Chamber, said that those with whom he has contact in Sheffield had expressed themselves as stunned by the appointment. The impression of the hon. Member for Brigg and Scunthorpe of the reaction of steel workers in his constituency does not seem to make sense.</p>

<p>The point that I made was that the reputation of Mr. MacGregor was enhanced as a result of his visit and the meeting that he held on Tuesday. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will judge differently after he and his colleagues have met Mr. MacGregor.</p>

<speech hansard_id="1749539" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1980-05-15a.1859.1" speakerid="unknown" speakername="Mr. Daffy" colnum="1859" time="20:43:00">
<p>The hon. Member might judge differently when he checks the text of his speech in <i>Hansard</i> later tonight or in the morning.<br/>
I was interested in the Secretary of State's reference to a gesture&#x2014;although he did not use that word&#x2014;of public service in the appointment. There is little evidence of that to people in Sheffield with whom I have discussed the appointment. It is regrettable that there is not more place for public service in such an appointment. Mr. MacGregor's appointment

has got off to a resoundingly bad start. The overriding need of the industry is leadership in which the workers have confidence. The repercussions of the appointment will not be confined to steel, given the simultaneous appointment of Mr. Robert Atkinson to British Shipbuilders. Since the terms of the appointments are different, neither the Secretary of State nor the Prime Minister can claim that he is pursuing a coherent policy towards nationalised industries.<br/>
That is why we must now consider different ways of making such appointments. It is suggested that they should be advertised publicly. Of course they should. However, the decision will still rest with the Secretary of State and his successors. Select Committees are being developed in a positive and meaningful direction. Perhaps such appointments can be vetted by the appropriate Select Committee before confirmation. I have in mind the United States model.<br/>
Such a procedure would enable hon. Members from both sides of the House to question Mr. MacGregor on his attitude, in the late 1940s, towards steel nationalisation. He was antagonistic to that notion. Examination by a Select Committee would enable hon. Members to question him on his free enterprise views as well as on his scepticism about certain aspects of the Welfare State. Such a procedure would enable hon. Members to ask Mr. MacGregor how, if he still holds such views, he can reconcile them with his acceptance of such an appointment.<br/>
Such a procedure could also be employed by hon. Members to question the timetable for viabliity. It is not enough for questions to be asked of the Secretary of State, because we know that they will have no effect. We should be able to ask about the financial support that is necessary in the meantime. The Secretary of State has already affirmed the existing cash limit. It is right to anticipate an early capital reconstruction. The vetting of appointments by hon. Members would enable us to raise the all-important question of pricing policy. The BSC's recent experience has resulted in its reluctance to raise prices during 1980. We can understand why.<br/>
I speak on behalf of the east end of Sheffield. The BSC is the price leader


for both the public and private sectors. That is always crucial. I understand why the BSC is reluctant to raise its prices. However, I hope that it appreciates that private steel companies are in danger of being forced out of business because increases in the prices of raw materials and public utilities due to inflation can no longer be absorbed by increased efficiency. In Sheffield the BSC's prices policy is of grave concern. The condition of some parts of private steel is near-desperate. The BSC will survive only by teamwork and co-operation.<br/>
We must therefore wish the chairman-elect well for the future. His future is obviously of vital importance, not only to the future of steel. His failure could only damage the national interest. If he merely acts as a trouble-shooter on a tough short-term assignment, that will only accelerate the move towards a nation divided into affluent Tories in the South-East, and the rest. It is significant that the hon. Member for Epsom and Ewell (Mr. Hamilton), who preceded me in the debate, comes from the South-East. My remarks have nothing to do with him personally.<br/>
I am concerned that if Mr. MacGregor does not approach his new assignment with the utmost care the present increasing division of our nation into an affluent South-East and millions of embittered have-nots elsewhere will be accelerated.<br/>
On the other hand, if Mr. MacGregor consults fully and regularly with the work force and draws up a programme that gives management the chance to steer the corporation through the present crisis, if he develops a longer-term strategy for steel to enable BSC to use its modern iron and steel-making facilities in an increasingly up-market direction, he will give BSC a much-needed boost in morale, and its workers may yet come to regard him as worthy of his hire.</p>

<p>I come from a south of England constituency, but I have spent much of my working life in the steel industry. I am in a part of the world which is a big steel user.<br/>
This debate has shown that there is common ground between both sides of the House in wanting to see the steel industry

become successful. I believe that my right hon. Friend has taken a sensible gamble by trying to break out of the management straitjacket which the steel industry has experienced since it was nationalised.<br/>
The story of British Steel in the last 12 years has been an unhappy one and I hope that we do not fall into the trap into which the Opposition fell, of appointing chairmen and subsequently attacking them.<br/>
I pay personal tribute to Sir Charles Villiers. He is, perhaps, one of the most undervalued men in British industry. He picked up the legacy left by all the glowing over-optimistic forecasts which were made for the industry. He has had to do much of the dirty work which was essential if we were to get the industry into viable shape and I think that he has been, wrongly, much vilified.<br/>
The particular problem facing Mr MacGregor is a simple one in three main tasks. His first job is to sell British steel. Therefore, he must be a man with a strong market base. Following the steel strike it is now clear that the forecasts of a 10 per cent. loss in our markets are probably, and unfortunately, optimistic. We may be concerned with something a good deal worse. We know that many customers have now decided to buy abroad and in so doing they have had to enter into long contracts.<br/>
The historic problem is that many of the stockholding firms are, of course, in foreign hands. That being so, Mr. MacGregor has a major problem in seeking to sell the Corporation's products. The problem is to some extent less serious for him than for others because he is a metallurgist. He will be able to cure the significant shortcoming&#x2014;which customers of BSC, unfortunately, identify&#x2014;of poor quality. We have to face that problem.<br/>
That is not in any way a reflection on individuals in the industry; but the quality control has not been good enough. I think that Mr. MacGregor will be able to bring a refreshing new look to this particular sales problem.<br/>
Mr. MacGregor's second task is to be able to stand up to politicians. Coming from a different environment, and from the other side of the Atlantic, he is less likely to be browbeaten by politicians


than some others who have commanded nationalised industries. I am delighted that we have a Secretary of State who keeps out of the day-to-day running of these industries and who showed in the steel strike that he was prepared to let the corporation and its employees work out their own agreement. But even with respect to my right hon. Friend, there is a temptation for Secretaries of State to take perhaps rather too much detailed interest in the affairs of the Department over which they have some authority. I hope, therefore, that Mr. MacGregor will be resolute in putting the interests of the British steel industry first and the concern of politicians second.<br/>
The third and last task which Mr. MacGregor has to face, as I see it, is that of restoring morale to an industry which, under the previous Government and under the present Government, has seen its market getting smaller and smaller and has had to face massive closure programmes, which are now available for us to study. Because Mr. MacGregor is coming fresh to the job, I hope that he will realise that the closure programmes could do with a second look. I should like him very much to take another look at Consett. I mean that. I see that the hon. Member for Consett (Mr. Watkins) is present this evening. I should like Mr. MacGregor to take another look at Hunterston and the direct reduction plant, because if the gas under the North Sea is going to be as plentiful as it appears, that reduction plant is a world beater. I understand that Mr. MacGregor is a Scot and has a home not too far away from Hunterston. I hope that he will take a serious look at that plant.<br/>
What we do not want is a man who goes back and studies the books all the time. We have done that. They have been examined ad nauseam. Indeed, I was delighted to see that Mr. MacGregor was reported on one occasion as saying " I do not care about the balance sheet."<br/>
In my estimation, Mr. MacGregor wants to get right the three priorities which I have described&#x2014;sales, standing up to politicians, and building up the morale. But more important than any of those is that he has to recognise that this industry of ours, which just over 12 years ago was 14 separate companies, has had a miserably unhappy past. It

is making a fraction of the steel it made at the time it was nationalised. I believe that the lowest ebb is the turn of the tide&#x2014;and very good luck to Mr. MacGregor.</p>

<p>I make only one comment on the speech of the hon. Member for New Forest (Mr. McNair-Wilson). That is to say to him that if he believes that his right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Industry does not interfere in a broad general way with the operation of the British steel industry, he would believe anything. I am not surprised, therefore, that he will be supporting his right hon. Friend in the Lobby tonight.<br/>
I realise that one of the most difficult tasks of the Secretary of State for Industry is in the making of appointments. I believe that the right hon. Gentleman is convinced that Mr. MacGregor is the right man for the job, but I believe that he has misjudged the attitude of the House of Commons and of the British steel industry. He has surprised and annoyed a great many people involved in it by this appointment.<br/>
The hon. Member for Brigg and Scunthorpe (Mr. Brown) said that there were few of us who really took exception to the appointment in itself. That surprised me, because this debate is taking place because we do take exception to Mr. MacGregor's appointment. I certainly do, and I take exception to the manner in which the appointment was made and to the financial conditions attached to it.<br/>
Having said that, I must say that I do not know Mr. MacGregor. I do not really know anything about him other than what I have read in the press and in his entry in the Directory of Directors. Therefore, it is difficult to make a judgment. However, I find it difficult to accept that the only man whom the Secretary of State can produce to do the job is a 67-year-old American&#x2014;albeit Scots born. To do that following a difficult steel strike is to put a burden of responsibility on that gentleman&#x2014;and it is a heavy burden indeed.<br/>
I do not take exception to the appointment of a 67-year-old man to industry. I do not take exception to the appointment of a 67-year-old man in politics.


Many men of that age bring considerable experience and wisdom to our deliberations and to the process of industry. By the same token, I do not take exception to American management in Britain. It is good to intermingle American and British management. The Americans often bring new skills and innovation to our management.<br/>
However, the appointment reflects very badly on what the Government think about British management. What is the Secretary of State doing? He is saying that of the 100 or more professional managers in the public and private sectors of the steel industry, there is no one who can do that job. The hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Osborn) has been in and around the steel industry for many years. Yet he was not able to suggest anybody for the job. That surprised me. I have an old-fashioned view, in that I believe in the adage that every soldier carries a field marshal's baton in his knapsack. It is good for young managers in the steel industry to know that one day, by doing a useful job, they may reach the top of the tree. It was a poor reflection on the management of the BSC and on private sector management when the Secretary of State indicated, in reply to a question from my hon. Friend the Member for Motherwell and Wishaw (Dr. Bray), that of all the hundreds of professional managers within industry he had not thought fit to approach any one of them to take on that important task.<br/>
I become cross with the Secretary of State when he goes even further, and says to the 55 million who live in these islands&#x2014;many of whom make their living out of managing industry&#x2014;" I do not think that any of you are good enough for the job". He, and many of his right hon. and hon. Friends, pay a great deal of lip service to the bright young men in British industry. But today he gave them a massive kick in the teeth. He said " We regret the brain drain, but perhaps there is something in it after all. Go to America, stay there for 25 years, come back when you are drawing your old age pension at 67, and we will find you a nice, comfortable, well-paid job in the BSC."<br/>
If there were ever any encouragement to anyone to join in the brain drain, it is the appointment of Mr. MacGregor.<br/>
The appointment is remarkable. The terms of the appointment are bizarre. I shall not go over the details, but I wish to mention the transfer fee, which is massive. The contribution that Mr. MacGregor will receive is also massive. We all wish to know whether we will get back our money if Mr. MacGregor does not succeed.<br/>
My last concern is simple. I understand from the Secretary of State's statement that the chairman-designate will be allowed to continue to operate&#x2014;albeit in a non-executive capacity&#x2014;in a considerable number of other companies. Many hon. Members&#x2014;I suspect on both sides&#x2014;take exception to that. The task of the chairmanship of the BSC is massive. There is no doubt about that. It appears to be a 24-hours-a-day, seven days a week job. I cannot understand why the Secretary of State&#x2014;anxious though he is to obtain Mr. MacGregor's services&#x2014;should not only give him a masive transfer fee but allow him to continue to operate as a non-executive director, which will take him away from the headquarters of BSC on many occasions during the year.<br/>
If Mr. MacGregor succeeds in raising the productivity of the BSC, and if he succeeds in creating more jobs for the people whom I am privileged to represent in this House, I apologise for the speech that I have just made. On the other hand, if he indulges in one of these axe-swinging exercises, and if there are more closures and fewer jobs in the industry, the people of this country are entitled to get their money back.</p>

<p>The right hon. Member for Rutherglen (Mr. MacKenzie), who has had responsibility for the appointment of senior officials, recognised the difficulty faced by successive Governments in finding people of calibre to fill these posts. That was also a point which the right hon. Member for Deptford (Mr. Silkin) raised. We rather expected a devastating and trenchant attack on my right hon. Friend by the right hon. Member for Deptford. We were rather surprised by the low-key nature of his speech. We thought that he had an open goal but that he muffed it.<br/>
So far as I can recall, this is the first debate in which the appointment of the chairman of a nationalised industry has


engaged the attention of the House. I remember a debate several years ago when the sacking of the chairman of a nationalised industry was the subject of a motion of censure on Christopher Chat-away, who sacked Lord Hall. That motion fully vindicated Christopher Chat-away's decision in that matter. However, this is the first occassion on which I can remember the House debating the appointment of the chairman of a nationalised industry, and I believe that it is valuable for the House to focus its attention upon the appointment of these important people.<br/>
As has been said, we do not have the right in our constitution&#x2014;as the United States Senate does&#x2014;to advise upon the appointment of Ministers or senior public officials and to consent. So far as I can see, we restrict our activities to attacking them as soon as they are appointed. I believe that the right hon. Member for Bristol, South-East (Mr. Benn) is at this moment making a speech in which he is advocating that the House of Commons, through Select Committees, should vet the appointment of the chairmen of nationalised industries and certain other important appointments. I think that we are some way away from that system. I hope that the Select Committees which shadow the Departments turn their attention to the rather humdrum, but in my view more important, task of examining the Estimates of those Departments before dealing with the rather glamorous task of vetting the appointment of the chairmen of the nationalised industries.<br/>
I think that Ministers in the previous Government and Ministers in this Government all recognise the fact that it is exceedingly difficult to get people of high calibre to accept these posts. That is because under successive Governments chairmen of nationalised industries are subject to ministerial interference of one sort or another. Back in the 1960s, I well remember the right hon. Member for Huyton (Sir H. Wilson), when Prime Minister, interfering incessantly in the activities of the Post Office in order to prevent the price of the postage stamp from going up from 2&#x00BD;p to 3p, and that seemed to be the touchstone of prime ministerial success. That particular goal is not now considered to be so important. None the less, Ministers interfere because they feel

that in one way or another public policy is involved. That makes it exceedingly difficult for great industrialists to take on these tasks. Governments interfere with both pricing and investment policies. It is to the credit of my right hon. Friend that in respect of the nationalised industries for which he has ministerial responsibility, he has deliberately taken a back seat and has said that it is the job of the managers to manage after he has appointed them, as in this case.<br/>
The other interference comes from us as Members of Parliament. We are constantly badgering the chairmen of the nationalised industries to change their policies. There is always a lobby saying that this or that must be subsidised and the cries do not only come from the Labour Benches. One only has to attend a debate on rail policy to realise that considerable pressures are placed upon Conservative Ministers by Conservative Members&#x2014;for example, in respect of suburban rail fares. There is pressure from hon. Members when the question of closures comes up, and that is right. Labour Members who represent steel towns have been vociferous in defence of the employment opportunities in their constituencies. These are the difficulties facing the chairmen of our nationalised industries.<br/>
I do not believe that the chairmen face unique trade union pressures. The chairman of any large organisation will have that sort of problem. Nor do I believe that chairmen should complain that they are in the goldfish bowl. They must accept that they are operating in a public arena, and that their decisions will be questioned in this House and by a wider audience.<br/>
There are real difficulties in finding people of calibre. It was a credit to the previous Government that they found people of the calibre of Peter Parker and Michael Edwardes to run parts of our great public sector. The case for the Government, in a nutshell, is that if they want a person with exceptional qualities they must be prepared to offer exceptional terms. The proof of the pudding is in the eating. If Mr. MacGregor succeeds in his task, the terms that the Secretary of State has agreed will be very modest.<br/>
Mr. MacGregor has been attacked for being an expatriate Scot. He has also


been attacked for being 67 years old. I believe that the contribution of older people to national affairs grows greater every day. It does not lie in the mouths of the Opposition Front Bench to attack Mr. MacGregor for being 67, because the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition are both within spitting distance of that age. I wish them well for many years in their respective posts.<br/>
If this debate focuses attention on the real problem of making appointments of this nature, it has been worth while. I hope that Ministers will accept that they should have greater discretion, particularly as to the salaries that are offered. The salaries for these chairmanships seem to range from &#x00A3;40,000 to &#x00A3;50,000. Although this seems to be a large amount, everyone knows that it is exceptionally difficult to get people of first-class calibre to take these jobs. Perhaps we should look at comparable salaries. The chairman of BP, which is part State-owned, gets &#x00A3;120,000 a year. The chairman of ICI gets &#x00A3;124,000 a year. If one looks at the salaries paid to the executives of American steel companies, one realises the extent of the gap. A comparable company is Bethlehem Steel, which has an output of about 17&#x00B7;5 million tons a year&#x2014;similar to the BSC&#x2014;and the salary of that chairman is seven times what is being offered to Mr. MacGregor.</p>

will continue&#x2014;quite understandably&#x2014;to attack the economic and industrial policy and philosophy of my right hon. Friend, and the decisions and judgments that derive from that. There have been some attacks outside this place indicating that some underhand deal has been done in this case. Innuendoes have been made by people who are more willing to wound than to strike.

<p>It is difficult to decide whether this bizarre incident is comedy, tragedy or farce. I find elements of all three in it. Certainly the Secretary of State has been behaving strangely for some time now and he has clearly moved into some fantasy world of his own. He is not living in the real world that my hon. Friends and I live in.<br/>
I do not intend to attack Mr. MacGregor. For all I know, he may be a splendid fellow, but it is clear that he knows nothing about the industry over which he is to preside. However, even that sort of ignorance has not been a bar to the chairmanship of nationalised industries, so the Secretary of State is following precedent in that respect. We feel it important that the chairman of a nationalised industry ought to have some sense of the ethos of public ownership. I know that that is foreign to Conservative Members.</p>

<p>I understand why Conservative Members do not appreciate the ethos of public ownership. My hon. Friends and I have a different political philosophy from them.<br/>
There are far too many chairmen of nationalised industries to whom public accountability is irksome. They do not like what they call interference, but what I regard as proper accountability to the public. Mr. MacGregor's business career gives me no confidence that we shall get a different attitude from him, There is nothing to suggest that he will have that sense of the ethos to which I referred.</p>

<p>The national interest requires that the steel industry should be expanded and not contracted.<br/>
The weirdest aspect of the affair has been adequately described by my right hon. Friend the Member for Deptford (Mr. Silkin). We are told that huge amounts may be paid, depending on whether Mr. MacGregor is successful. Even after the Secretary of State's speech, it is not clear how success is to be measured, but I suspect that the right hon. Gentleman has already made clear to Mr. MacGregor that the Government's policy is to wipe out a large part of the industry and to sell what little remains to private enterprise. That has come out time and again in steel debates.<br/>
I do not know why it should be necessary to pay &#x00A3;2 million for a gentleman of 67 to come from America to do the job. The Secretary of State has told us that no one in Britain was willing and able to take on the chairmanship at the price offered, though he assured us that the salary had nothing to do with it.<br/>
The recently retired chairman of Rolls-Royce told <i>Now!</i> magazine:
<q> I do not accept that there are not good younger men in Britain who would have been prepared to do the job for &#x00A3;100,000 to &#x00A3;150,000 a year.</q>
What decent patriotic chaps they are who are willing to work for such a paltry salary! Those who speak in such terms are making comparisons between the chairmanship of a nationalised industry and a chairmanship in the private sector.

What is wrong is not that we are paying too little to nationalised industry chairmen, but that some of those with whom they are being compared are getting far too much.<br/>
At a time when trade unionists are being urged to use all possible restraint and when thousands in the public sector are being put out of work because of the Government's cash limits, some of the salary levels of private sector chairmanships are a scandal. The greatest scandal is the farce that we are discussing. My right hon. Friend the Member for Deptford said that the most important job in the industry is to rebuild morale, which is at a low ebb&#x2014;not just because of the strike, but because of the widespread belief, substantiated by a good deal of evidence, that the Government are putting considerable pressure on the BSC board to hive off some of its most important assets. I do not know how this appointment will improve morale. I do not believe the stuff that we heard from the hon. Member for Brigg and Scunthorpe (Mr. Brown). I think that most of my hon. Friends do not believe it.<br/>
Many of us suspect that Mr. MacGregor is being brought in as a hatchet man to carry out a surgical operation on the industry. I hope that that suspicion turns out to be misplaced. However, many of us feel that the corporation will be reduced to a tuppenny-ha'penny concern that will make a profit but not very much steel. I hope that he will do a decent job on the industry, but I have strong reservations.</p>

<p>I appreciate, Mr. Speaker, that what I have to say has to be compressed somewhat, and I shall endeavour to do so. I regret that I cannot be as enthusiastic about the appointment and the terms of it as my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State. I consider the terms of the arrangement and the fact that we have had to import from abroad to be mistaken in their conception.<br/>
My right hon. Friend and the right hon. Member for Deptford (Mr. Silkin) have related the appointment to a football transfer fee. When All Souls and Trinity College, Cambridge try to be earthy in discussing football there is a tendency to get things wrong. There is no relationship between the fee that is being paid to Lazard Freres and a head-hunter, and the transfer fee.<br/>
I think that the highest transfer fee paid by a football club is between &#x00A3;1&#x00BC; million and &#x00A3;1&#x00BD; million. A football club spending that sort of money usually buys a player in mid-career, so that it can sell him and get back half the transfer fee. My right hon. Friend will not get back any of the transfer fee from Mr. MacGregor. At the end of three years he will put him on a free transfer. He will be able to return to America to collect some of the transfer fee that has already been paid. The arrangement is not to be commended as a precedent for the appointment of anyone in a nationalised industry.<br/>
The Prince of Wales was hurt in a polo accident a few days before Mr. MacGregor's appointment. The Prince insisted on making a speech in the City. He said " I must go to make this speech because it is about buying British." Two days later my right hon. Friend bought an import from America. I refuse to believe that throughout the wide stretches of British industry no business man could be found to undertake the job.<br/>
If my right hon. Friend insists that no British business man was prepared or able to do the job, there is something wrong with his Ministry. If that is so, there is something wrong with the narrowness of the net of selection within the establishment of his Department. That can be afforded in the Foreign Office and in other Departments, but not in the Department of Industry, which is the Department by which Britain is made successful or otherwise. If the Department cannot find in Britain someone to take on this type of job, what is wrong? Are British business men short of patriotism or short of ability, or short of both?<br/>
My right hon. Friend should tell his departmental officials to look at their own head-hunting activities. We are told

that the Minister had appointed head-hunters for this position. They came up with the name of someone who was already working for the British Government. Mr. MacGregor was already vice-chairman of a nationalised company&#x2014;British Leyland. Why were head-hunters necessary at all? The Department of Industry should realise that it has a job to motivate those who work in the private sector, as well as to make them realise that they should assist the public sector. They should be prepared to use their talents in the public sector from a sense of patriotic duty.<br/>
If the Secretary of State felt that he must employ Mr. MacGregor, he should have appointed him as chairman only of British Steel. He could then have kept all his other jobs. There would have been no need to pay out such an enormous amount of money, a large proportion of which will finish up in Mr. MacGregor's pocket. The posts of chairman and executive managing directors should be separated. When Lord Melchett was chairman of British Steel he decided that he could not do the two jobs. He separated the post of chairman from that of chief executive. An article in this week's edition of the journal of the Institute of Directors states:
<q>To combine the duties of Chairman and Chief Executive is like asking a man to argue with himself.</q></p>

<p>I shall concentrate my brief remarks on the future of British Steel. That industry is of paramount importance to the future of our country. I accept the point made by the hon. Member for Rutland and Stamford (Mr. Lewis), when he referred to patriotism and the public service. The Prime Minister makes many speeches on the subject of patriotism. Some Opposition Members, including the right hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Grimond), have referred to the public service. Conservative Members sometimes seem to sneer at it. They talk as if such issues could be settled only by money. As a result of that spirit and approach, the Government have committed a grave mistake.<br/>
During the past week or two we have seen a contrast. My right hon. Friend the Member for Deptford (Mr. Silkin) referred to Mr. Robert Atkinson's


appointment in the shipbuilding industry, and the way in which he took it up. Some of us may have seen the statement that he made on television. It was a remarkable statement. He underlined that he had been guided by a spirit of public service. There is a sharp contrast between the way in which he took up his appointment and the way in which Mr. MacGregor is taking up his.<br/>
It is partly Mr. MacGregor's fault. He cannot be absolved from responsibility. However, the Secretary of State is primarily responsible. What type of leadership will be given to the steel industry?<br/>
Let the market rate prevail. Grab all one can. Squeeze as much from the orange as possible, even hire special experts to do it for one. Ensure that one has the last penny out of the British Government or taxpayer. No one can deny that that has happened on a scale never before seen. As for the performance review, that is the greatest quango of all. By the way, will the chairman of the quango be paid; or will he step forward and do the job as a service to the public? Let us have the details.<br/>
The quango has been hedged round with arrangements which have not been properly explained to the House. I can hardly believe that that arrangement is advantageous to a new chairman of the British Steel Corporation. It is a form of productivity deal. I doubt whether it is convenient for the new chairman of BSC in the circumstances in which he will have to operate to have to act under the most bogus productivity agreement reached in the history of collective bargaining. That is the situation. None of the terms is known. None of the agreements is made. It is all settled later. Bill Sirs would never be allowed a productivity deal of that nature if he were arguing on behalf of his members. It would have to be much more cut and dried, and there would have to be a strike to get such agreement.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman has altered the form in which appointments are made to the public service. The new chairman, Mr. MacGregor, has used his industrial clout to knock the right hon. Gentleman sideways and make him look not ridiculous but less of the philosopher-statesman, as the right hon. Lady sometimes thinks that he should be described.

Mr. MacGregor has used his industrial clout to get every penny, pound, pension and arrangement for himself. If it is right for go-ahead men to do that, why not everyone else? The example has been set. No one will be able to complain, least of all the right hon. Gentleman, if steel workers and other sections of the community fight for their rights and pay in exactly the same way. If it is right for Mr. MacGregor to have such adulation and encomiums poured on his enterprise and skill in negotiating that deal with the Government, why should not everyone else do the same?<br/>
By that form of appointment the Government have helped undermine the credit of the public service in this country. Most people working in other great public industries, such as coal and the Post Office, will draw that deduction, especially those in the Steel Corporation. They are informed by the right hon. Gentleman that not only was it necessary to make that appointment but that the Government had searched for months, and doubtless gone through the entire Steel Corporation, to try to discover a person fit for the job. They could not find anyone. That is a fine way to treat the public service, not only the steel industry. The right hon. Gentleman&#x2014;not even Mr. MacGregor&#x2014;must bear the responsibility for degrading the rights and claims of our public service.<br/>
I come to what was said by Mr. MacGregor the day after his appointment. One would imagine that such a superman, such a world beater, would be careful about what he said within a day or two of his appointment. Having such knowledge of these matters, he must know of the sensitivity in the industry; but not at all. Mr. MacGregor made a statement on some of the matters that we have debated. He added that bulk steel did not bring big profits and that the corporation should look to exotic materials, saying he hoped that this was one of the areas in which to become pre-eminent.<br/>
One does not need Mr. MacGregor's high salary and the payments that he will receive over the coming decade to know that one can make bigger profits on special steels than on bulk steels. Everyone has known that for a long time. The question for the workers in the industry and for this country&#x2014;the defence reason, if I can put it in such terms&#x2014;is this: will


we preserve a bulk steel industry in this country? That is the great question. The Opposition have made up their minds about it. However, according to the economics of the Minister there is no certainty that we shall preserve a bulk steel industry. According to the declarations of Mr. MacGregor, he is not, apparently, committed to it. Therefore, I hope that very soon there will be declarations by Mr. MacGregor and the Government repudiating the whole idea that we shall allow the British steel industry to be run down. It is bad enough to run it down to the 15 million tonnes that the Government talk about, but they will run it down even further, if the statement by Mr. MacGregor is to mean anything at all.<br/>
I do not claim or ask that the Government should consider these matters on grounds of public service to the community. We know that they do not care about that. But what about defence? I am no great military strategist&#x2014;[HON. MEMBERS: " Oh."]&#x2014;I thought that that would raise a cheer from Government supporters. I suggest to the Government&#x2014;especially the right hon. Lady&#x2014;that it might be better, for the defence of this country, for the bulk steel to be produced at Port Talbot and Llanwern rather than in Brazil. However, that is the policy.<br/>
Indeed, that may be said about the steel policy of the previous Tory Government&#x2014;the Finniston-Peter Walker policy. It had many mistakes about it, but at least it was a patriotic policy. At least it enabled us to look to a future for the steel industry. I know that Government supporters do not like to stand up for it now. One member of that Government&#x2014;the present Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office&#x2014;at the time when the Finniston-Walker plan was before the House and the country, agreed to put it into operation on a great scale at that time. I forget whether the Minister of State was in the Government or out of it at that time. He said " Do not worry about the steel industry. If it does not make a profit, let it go. If bingo makes a profit, have the bingo rather than the steel."<br/>
Of course, the Secretary of State's policies are exactly the same. We may discover that the steel industry cannot make a profit on that basis and that it will be

allowed to run down. We do not accept that argument. The Opposition have never accepted the 15 million tonne target or the drop to that figure. We say that that means devastation for Wales and for great parts of the country, mass unemployment and the destruction of parts of our coal industry. It is essential for this country to maintain an expanded steel industry.<br/>
Now we are told " Perhaps the brilliant Mr. MacGregor will come to the same conclusion as the Government." Let us suppose that he comes to the conclusion that they reached, on grounds of defence, of public interest and the requirements of the rest of our industry and trade over the next 10 years. What will be the position if in August, September, or whenever, Mr. MacGregor says " The policy laid down by the Government, the &#x00A3;450 million cash limit, in these circumstances means death for the steel industry? It means disaster for us "? What will Ministers say then? One of them will have to resign. I must say that that makes the picture more attractive.<br/>
If the right hon. Gentleman will give me an undertaking that he will waive the cash limit, and that if Mr. MacGregor wishes we can put forward a programme for a 20 million tonnes target for our steel industry which could sustain the jobs that would be lost otherwise, a different state of affairs would reign.<br/>
If Mr. MacGregor really wanted to serve the public he could tear up the agreement and say " I shall work for the people of this country that I left in 1945. I do not need the pension arrangements, the paying off of Lazard Freres and all the rest. I prefer to show that I am a patriot". If only Mr. Macgregor would say " I shall serve this country in the same spirit as Robert Atkinson will", it would be a benefit for the whole industry.<br/>
What the right hon. Gentleman has done is to ensure that Mr. MacGregor will start on his career in the worst possible circumstances. The right hon. Gentleman has done grave injury to the public service. He has insulted everyone working in the management of the steel industry, as well as the workers. He has refused to discuss the appointment with those who work in the industry.<br/>
That is why we move this vote of censure on the right hon. Gentleman. We ask the House to support it.</p>

<p>With the leave of the House, I should like to try to answer the questions that have been raised in this debate, which I remind the House is on a motion for the Adjournment.<br/>
Mr. MacGregor will find some most instructive comments in a number of speeches, particularly those of the right hon. and learned Member for Aberavon (Mr. Morris) and my hon. Friends the Members for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Osborn), for New Forest (Mr. McNair-Wilson) and for St. Marylebone (Mr. Baker).<br/>
Now I shall try to answer as many questions as I can in the time available. The right hon. Members for Deptford (Mr. Silkin) and for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Grimond) asked me about tax. I am assured by the Inland Revenue that the normal tax rules are of course being applied in relation to both Lazard Freres and Mr. MacGregor. I must remind the House&#x2014;if there is any dissatisfaction with the confidentiality that this Government must maintain about the tax affairs of those with whom the Inland Revenue has to deal&#x2014;of what my hon. Friend the Member for Gosport (Mr. Viggers) interjected in the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for St. Marylebone. He said that when the last Government took the Inmos initiative&#x2014;I commend them for their political courage in encouraging entrepreneurship&#x2014;they absolutely refused to discuss the tax treatment of the two American citizens, who, under favourable circumstances, stood to gain large fortunes, and. say I, " Good luck to them ".<br/>
I come now to questions of structure raised by the right hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland, the right hon. and learned Member for Aberavon and my hon. Friend the Member for Epsom and Ewell (Mr. Hamilton). Mr MacGregor will be free to make or, where statutory obligations require my consent or other consultation, to propose whatever changes in the structure of the BSC he considers best suited to secure the enduring profitability and viability of the British steel industry. If he wishes to propose or to introduce more devolution of responsibility to the regions, or to introduce partnership with the private sector in certain plants or, indeed, to sell certain plants to the private sector

&#x2014;as my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister has already said we would welcome in the case of the sale of Consett&#x2014;he is free so to act, subject to the statutory requirements to which I have referred. He is free to try to sell Shotton as a going concern to the private sector, but I cannot give him any encouragement that there would be a dowry from the taxpayer.<br/>
I come to the question of Mr. MacGregor's own equipment for carrying out this task. The hon. Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe (Mr. Duffy) and the right hon. Member for Rutherglen (Mr. MacKenzie) asked what he could possibly know about trade unions and labour relations in this country. He was considered good enough by the previous Labour Government to be made, first, a director and then deputy chairman of British Leyland. As for his relevant knowledge, he has been a director for some years of a great American metals and natural resources firm and of a great American steel company.</p>

<p>The right hon. Gentleman should not misrepresent the policy of the previous Government. He said that Mr. MacGregor was appointed as deputy chairman of Leyland by the last Government. He was not. He was appointed by the National Enterprise Board. [HON. MEMBERS: "Oh."] That National Enterprise Board was the same National Enterprise Board that the right hon. Gentleman sacked.</p>

<p>In answer to the right hon. Member for Deptford, there is no pension provision for Mr. MacGregor's service. The right hon. Gentleman is correct in assuming that if Mr. MacGregor does not serve for the whole of the first year, the first payment of &#x00A3;225,000 is forfeit, even after one day, subject to his obligation to give notice.<br/>
I should like to point out, in answer to a number of comments by hon. Members, that there seems to be an emerging pattern that those people who have met Mr. MacGregor personally are far less critical of him, if they are critical at all, than those who have not met him.<br/>
The hon. Member for Attercliffe and the right hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland referred to the reactions of steel workers, on the one hand, and nurses, on the other, to the compensation to be paid. I must point out that the future of the steel workers depends a great deal on the competence and drive of the chairman of British Steel. It will be no comfort to them to have less than the best appointed to this vacancy.<br/>
Do nurses want to be taxed in order to meet the losses of British Steel? It is very much in their interests that the losses should cease. The right hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland asked why, when we knew of Ian MacGregor, we had needed to appoint head-hunters. We did not know, when we started, who would take this job. We needed to consider all the possible names. There was a joint recruiting effort by us and the head-hunters. The head-hunters will be paid the proper, but not excessive, fee. The details are subject to contractual confidentiality.<br/>
The right hon. Member for Deptford asked whether we were creating likely litigation in appointing a five-man committee. No, we have specifically provided that the committee's decision will be based on a simple majority in order to avoid deadlock. The answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Epsom and Ewell and the right hon. Member for Ebbw Vale is that the cash limit position remains unchanged.<br/>
I must answer three remaining and important points. A number of hon. Members, including the hon. Member for

Attercliffe, my hon. Friend the Member for Rutland and Stamford (Mr. Lewis) and the right hon. Member for Ebbw Vale laid emphasis on public service. They asked why we could not count on people coming forward to do these daunting tasks from a sense of patriotism and public duty. I must make some comments. A number of the people whom we considered suitable did not feel free to accept or even to go into detail about the post because they had existing commitments to jobs which they felt that they had to honour. Some people found the task to difficult to contemplate.<br/>
Mr. Atkinson, for whom I have great respect, and who has sacrificed some income to take on the chairmanship of British Shipbuilders, has so far as I know, no obligations to partners, as has Mr. MacGregor.<br/>
The bulk of the payments that will be made&#x2014;and two-thirds will depend upon performance&#x2014;will go not to Mr. MacGregor but to the partnership to which he has obligations and in which he has invested the bulk of his life savings. I emphasise that Mr. MacGregor has accepted, as far as I can tell, a very steep fall in his personal earnings in order to take on a desperately challenging job and to subject himself to the criticism of the media, the newspapers and hon. Members in tackling a job that is in the national interest. The reason why he has done that is that, among other things, he feels a sense of obligation to the country in which he was born and brought up.<br/>
The right hon. Member for Ebbw Vale said that the performance payment was a bogus productivity deal. Seldom can there have been a productivity deal more monitored and policed than this.<br/>
I turn to a criticism that has been repeated time and again by the right hon. Members for Deptford, Ebbw Vale and Rutherglen. The criticism is of bringing in an outsider to chair a great British industry. Before I answer that criticism I must emphasise that I have heard from Mr. MacGregor that he regards it as his duty to identify and promote promising young managers in the British Steel Corporation. His performance in his previous jobs shows that he takes that task intensely seriously. Are we really to accept criticism for


finding the best person that we can, even from outside the industry, from hon. Members whose Government did not&#x2014;I make no criticism of the people that I shall mention&#x2014;promote a manager from British Steel when they had to fill a vacancy? I make no criticism of Sir Charles Villiers, who served his country well in a difficult task. He was not drawn from inside the management and yet the Labour Government, after long search, promoted him to chairman.<br/>
What did the Labour Government do about British Rail? Did they promote a manager from inside British Rail? No; they sought Sir Peter Parker. I make no criticism of that choice. What about Cable and Wireless? [HON. MEMBERS:</p>

<p>I am grateful for the opportunity of raising a subject upon which I have already made written and oral representations to the Manpower Services Commission and to the Department, namely, the proposed closure of the Treforest skillcentre annexe. I hope that by focusing attention on this totally mistaken decision I shall, even at this late stage, obtain its reversal.<br/>
The present Government have looked at retraining in two ways since they assumed office. The first was an exercise carried out by Sir Derek Rayner, upon whose business acumen the Government heavily rely, and his remit was to look at the efficiency of the skillcentre network. It was proposed to close five skillcentres and five annexes, as <i>The Times</i> reported last December. Treforest was reported last December. Treforest was not among those recommended for closure. Therefor, it passed its efficiency audit, which is significant in itself and throws a curious light on the Government's later attempts to discredit it.<br/>
However, in December, in their theological fervour to save public expenditure regardless of the consequences, the Government told the Manpower Services Commission that it had to save 3,400 jobs, out of which the skillcentres had to save 520. Rayner had been abandoned in favour of Procrustes, and the Treforest annexe had to be included, quite literally, to make up the number.<br/>
By now, some reasons had to be discovered, and they were encapsulated in the Minister's letter to me of 5 March 1980 as being a combination of poor performance and over-provision in the area.<br/>
I should like to separate those two reasons and deal with them. First, what does "poor performance" mean? It certainly does not mean a shortage of applicants. The annexe had 72 places,

and it was proposed to add another class of between 12 and 14 places, with the equipment already purchased and on site. Occupancy of places was always high and there was a waiting list. Surely the Minister cannot mean the quality of the training given by the staff. The pass rates were extremely high, and employers who took the graduates were very pleased with the quality they employed. Therefore, to attack their training would be an unwarranted slur upon the teaching staff. I think that what the Minister means by that clumsy phrase is the record of subsequent placings of the men in jobs having the requisite skill requirements.<br/>
The exact placement record is a matter of dispute. The staff at the skillcentre have produced higher figures for placing than the chairman of the Manpower Services Commission. Indeed, even the chairman had to have two goes at it, and his latest letter to me not only contradicts the union figures but his own earlier letter to such a radical extent that I wonder whether someone ought to have another go at revising it.<br/>
In the latest letter there is this memorable paragraph:
<q> We now have the 100 per cent. local follow-up for the September 1979 quarter which shows that of the 48 per cent. of trainees who responded unfortunately only 31 per cent. were using the skills in which they had been trained for any part of the work ".</q>
Frankly, I am not at all certain what that means, and it might even tax many who spend their lives studying the meaning of words.<br/>
My tentative conclusion is that it means that almost three-quarters of the trainees who responded to the inquiry have jobs calling for all or part of their skills. In any event, one cannot divorce this from the general economic climate which makes placements difficult&#x2014;a difficulty compounded by the apparent friction between the employment services division and the training services division in Wales, which seems to have led to a less than wholehearted placement policy.<br/>
Secondly, there is over-production of training places in the area. The implication is that the Cardiff centre will be able to cope with all the existing courses without its two annexes at Tremorfa and Treforest. That is not true. Of the courses being conducted at Treforest, only two are being redirected within the system,


and neither of those will go to the Cardiff skillcentre. Three courses have been lost at Tremorfa and six at Treforest. These are being lost without replacement at any other centre. Since their occupancy is high, there is an obvious demand for them, which will now be unmet. Therefore, the second reason for closure seems to be quite unsound.<br/>
It is rarely enough to demonstrate that the reasons given for closing something are not sound. Indeed, it would never be enough for this Government, whose every move seems to be based on unsound reasoning. Therefore, I shall put forward some positive reasons why the Treforest annexe should be retained. These reasons are nothing to do with sentiment, although I am grateful that a Government training scheme existed in Treforest more than 40 years ago because it enabled my father, an unemployed miner, to be retrained as a painter. Nor are they based on the strong local support for its retention., as evidenced both in the local newspapers and by the very strong support given to the fight by the Taff Ely borough council.<br/>
The two reasons that I adduce are, first, the ostensible strategy of the Government, which says that job loss in obsolescent industry is inevitable and that we must switch to new industries. The Government counsel us not to be afraid of change, but how can that be unless men are given the opportunity to train in new skills? It would be cruel if the Government were to tolerate job loss without trying to create new job prospects.<br/>
The second reason is that there is an increasing need in this area for men to -acquire new skills. The Government and the Manpower Services Commission have concentrated on likely steel and colliery closures and have modified their proposals for skillcentre closures to take account of these. I beg the Government not to be oblivious to the job loss that is occurring constantly in our area.<br/>
This annexe is situated on the Treforest industrial estate, which is fast becoming an industrial desert. Since the beginning of this year nearly 1,000 jobs have been lost, either through whole factories closing or through existing employers shedding labour. By emptying this factory the

Government will have added their direct contribution towards making this a ghost industrial estate. We cannot see an end to it, and without training facilities we will have no hope of taking advantage of whatever bright spots may occur in the future.<br/>
If the Government believe in a strong industry, and if they believe that workpeople have the adaptability and resilience to change their industrial circumstances, they will retain the annexe. If not, it will be because dogma has blinded them to the economic consequences of wasted potential and to the human tragedy. Therefore, I hope that even at this late stage the Government will think again about what I profoundly believe to have been a mistaken decision.</p>

<p>I am grateful for an opportunity to make a brief intervention. The Treforest skillcentre, in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Pontypridd (Mr. John), is on the border of my constituency. Mine is a constituency of very high unemployment. Many members of the staff of the Treforest skillcentre, and certainly many of the trainees there, come from my constituency, and there is great concern that an institution that is performing such a useful function in difficult days should be closed. I hasten to add that these days are made more difficult by the policies of the Government. A great deal of benefit was being derived from the skillcentre.<br/>
A Manpower Services Commission press release of 23 April pointed out in reference to cuts and redistribution that although skillcentre rationalisation would involve closures, the chairman had said that, overall, the needs of individuals and industry would be better served than before.<br/>
That is abject nonsense. It is like a surgeon trying to comfort a patient by telling him that although he has to undergo the amputation of a leg, he will afterwards be able to hobble along more rapidly on crutches than he could when his legs were in good condition.<br/>
I could understand the Government going in for cuts and saying that they were not really interested in the problems


of unemployment and retraining, but trying to dress up cuts by saying that everyone will be better off is not only nonsense, but dishonest nonsense.</p>

<speech hansard_id="1749590" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1980-05-15a.1893.0" hansard_membership_id="7785" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/17224" speakername="The Under-Secretary of State for Employment (Mr. Jim Lester)" colnum="1893" time="22:25:00">
<p>I start by saying that I appreciate the concern and disappointment of the hon. Members for Pontypridd (Mr. John) and Caerphilly (Mr. Hudson Davies) at the Manpower Services Commission's decision to close the skillcentre annexe at Treforest. Loss of such a facility can never be welcome to local people.<br/>
It is fair to say that that is something that has very much influenced the way in which the MSC has gone about taking its decisions on rationalising the skillcentre network. I hope that I can at least help the hon. Member for Pontypridd and others who may share his views to understand why the MSC has taken its decision.<br/>
The decision to close the Treforest annexe is part of a much wider set of decisions on the future shape of the skill-centre network. It is the result of the review established by the previous Labour Government two years ago.<br/>
The MSC's aims, which I entirely support, are to get a network of skillcentres located where industry can make most use of them and where a majority of individuals can easily get access to training. The rationalisation proposals are designed to achieve these aims while providing more training, but in fewer centres and therefore at less cost.<br/>
The closures will also enable the commission to put more resources into offering direct training assistance to employers and their employees, through the direct training services. These services are especially valuable in helping new and developing industry, which is of particular importance to Wales.<br/>
At a general level, these proposals must make good sense, but the MSC has rightly recognised that closures are bound to disappoint and inconvenience local people. It has paid a great deal of attention to the ways in which individuals will be affected&#x2014;whether they will have access to alternative training, how difficult the transport arrangements are, whether specal transport needs to be provided, how

many other people will benefit from new alternative centres opening and from classes being moved from closed centres, and so on. I believe that the commission has made an honest and successful attempt to decide on a future network that minimises inconvenience and maximises advantage.<br/>
The commission has been at pains to consult widely and to take full account of local views. In one or two cases that process is still going on. Obviously, the commission has had to balance the views that it has heard against its aims in rationalising the network to provide a better and a stronger system overall, but as a result of the consultations there have been changes, shifts in emphasis and timetable, and consideration given to transport arrangements. Above all the MSC has taken a positive approach to the best means of ensuring, with the help of local input, that local training needs&#x2014;of both employers and trainees&#x2014;are met, whether through skillcentres or otherwise.<br/>
The hon. Member for Pontypridd has made his own representations. I hope that he will agree that he has received a full and fair response, even if he cannot share the MSC's conclusions, though I gathered from his remarks that that is not the case.<br/>
Perhaps I may now turn to the Treforest annexe, and why the MSC has decided that it should be closed. As the hon. Member will know, and has said, one of the main criteria used by the commission in selecting skillcentres or annexes for closure has been how successful they are in producing trainees who find and settle into jobs using the skills that they have learnt. Another important factor has been how well utilised are the skillcentre facilities, and those of other neighbouring centres. The Treforest annexe has 70 places operational at present. I freely concede that recently these have been well used, with over 90 per cent. of the possible capacity being used. This is partly the result of taking out classes with a poor occupancy record.<br/>
Treforest is one of a number of centres within not very many miles of each other. There are a further 270 places at the main centre at Cardiff, an easy eight miles away. There are 250 places at Newport, 15 miles away, and another 160


places at West Gwent skillcentre, 12 miles away. Occupancy has certainly improved in all these centres, but there are unused places&#x2014;130 in mid-March&#x2014;and there is unused space. Classes have been shut for lack of an instructor, and they can be opened if staff become available from closing skillcentres.<br/>
Overall, the area at present has twice the national average of skillcentre places per head. Even after closures it will still have substantially above average places. No one will quarrel with that, in view of high unemployment and the need to do what we can to regenerate industry. But there is spare capacity close by to take trainees who might otherwise have gone to Treforest.<br/>
That is not the main reason why Treforest is to be closed. The commission has had to take account of the employment prospects for trainees. The simple and distressing facts are that of 158 trainees completing courses at the annexe in 1979, only 44&#x2013;28 per cent.&#x2014;were placed on completing their course. Of 32 trainees who completed courses in the quarter ending March, only two were placed on completion. And this is not for want of trying by the skillcentre staff. Thank goodness, the results of the regular 100 per cent. survey of trainees, which is taken three months after they finish training, tell a slightly happier story. They show that 58 per cent. of respondents in training used their skills for the quarter ending December last year. But these placing results give a most depressing picture.<br/>
Of course the hon. Gentleman is right to stress the need to have facilities available to retrain those who will be made redundant in South Wales, if they want to be trained. However, Treforest is not ideally situated from that point of view. That is why the MSC has taken careful account of the alternative capacity available, and of the timing of other closures in South Wales.<br/>
The MSC cannot just offer training with a blind and cynical disregard for whether trainees will get a job at the end. The training is long and arduous. It involves a considerable investment of effort by the individual and of money by the State. I regret that, by and large, employers on the Treforest trading estate

and others nearby do not take skillcentre trainees, and they do not use the annexe facilities for upgrading the skill of their own employees, but it is less than fair to trainees to offer them training with such dismal prospects of a job at the end of it. Moreover, their lack of success can give skillcentre training generally a bad name.<br/>
The basic facts are that the placing results from Treforest cannot justify its continuance, and that alternative facilities exist reasonably close by.</p>

<p>Does the Minister dispute my statement that six classes, including three welding classes, one motor mechanics class, one class in motor body work and one in radio and television work, are disappearing? Does he dispute that they are not being replaced in Cardiff or anywhere else?</p>

<p>I was just about to come to that point. Treforest has six classes, all duplicated in neighbouring centres. There are motor vehicle body repair classes at Newport and Port Talbot; motor vehicle repair and maintenance classes at those two centres and West Gwent; electric are welding classes at all four of the neighbouring centres; a radio and television servicing class at Cardiff; and coded welding classes at Newport and Port Talbot. One coded welding class will move to Wrexham skillcentre, where it can help those made redundant from Shotton. Closing the radio and television class should mean that an important class in industrial electronics can open at Cardiff, using the same instructor.<br/>
There are good prospects for redeploying the staff concerned, some to fill important vacancies. Between now and February 1981, when the annexe is due to shut, trainees will be gradually diverted elsewhere. None will be unable to finish the course.<br/>
The advantages of rationalising the skillcentre network, and the case for closing Treforest as part of the exercise, seem to me to be irrefutable. I understand that the district manpower committee for Mid-Glamorgan and the MSC's Welsh committee have accepted the case for closure, whilst regretting the loss of a local facility. I hope that the hon. Gentleman can do likewise. I am sure


that he can look to the Manpower Services Commission, in concert with those concerned locally, to do all that can be done within the resources available to it to ensure that training needs of both

individuals and employers in the area are properly catered for.</p>
