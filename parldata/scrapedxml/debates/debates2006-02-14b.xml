He will be aware that the <i>Evening Standard</i> has been running a campaign to stress the importance of safety in our stations, but he will also be aware that safety is not only an issue in the capital. In my constituency, Camberley station has witnessed an upsurge in antisocial behaviour recently. I invite the Minister, when he invites companies to tender for the franchise currently held by South West Trains, to ensure that passenger safety and security are at the heart of the tendering process so that my constituents have the protection they deserve when they travel.</p>

She should bear in mind, however, that we need to ensure that we make the best use of existing rail capacity, and underused services sometimes have to be rationalised. When that happens, we have to ensure that there are alternative services, but at the end of the day we have to get the greatest number of people on to existing capacity, which is what we seek to do. However, my hon. Friend's views and those of her constituents will of course be taken into account.</p>

	<p pid="b.1265.6/1">I did read it, and it is the Minister who may need to read again, because I can assure him that it makes no reference to safety. The Government promised in their 10-year plan to enable passengers to travel safety and to feel secure. Since the plan was first published, the number of violent assaults taking place on trains and at stations has risen by 43 per cent. Does the Minister think that the Government are keeping that promise?</p>

	<p pid="b.1265.7/1">First, let me tell the hon. Gentleman what the consultation document states, since he seems to have had a little bit of word blindness:</p>
	<p pid="b.1265.7/2" class="indent">&quot;Bidders will be expected to demonstrate in their bids how they will achieve a continuing improvement in service levels at stations, address issues of safety and security, accessibility&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.1265.7/3">Perhaps he will get himself a new pair of reading glasses.</p>
	<p pid="b.1265.7/4">Certainly, it is true that the figures on attacks at stations that we produced this week are very disappointing. However, the mechanism by which they were calculated changed halfway through, which gives them a false air, unfortunately. Nevertheless, one is one too many. That is why we have increased the number of British Transport police on mainline stations and the underground by 50 per cent in the past two years&mdash;we have increased it by 300 in the past year alone&mdash;and it is why we are working to invest in CCTV at stations and to improve station services. We are making that investment because we believe in ensuring people's safety, and the hon. Gentleman has consistently voted against that.</p>

	<p pid="b.1266.5/1">It is important to point out that, of course, working together is a very significant part of improving performance. That is why reliability is improving, with the number of on-time trains reaching more than 85 per cent and, of course, with the record investment of &pound;87 million a week that is going into the railways. We have introduced joint control centres along lines, such as Birmingham to Waterloo, and joint improvement plans are being set up between the train operating companies and Network Rail.

	<p pid="b.1266.7/1">Clearly, part of the problem is that money was not spent on the infrastructure over the previous few decades, particularly under the Conservative Government, but I have raised the issue with First Great Western and Network Rail. Of course, we want to see further improvements, and significant investment has been put in place on the Great Western lines to ensure that improvements take place over the coming years.</p>

	<p pid="b.1267.2/1">Co-operation between Network Rail and the train companies is so poor that three out of 10 cancelled trains are cancelled because of Network Rail. Co-operation between the Department for Transport, the Association of Train Operating Companies, Network Rail and Alstom is so poor that Alstom has closed the UK's only test track for trains without formal prior discussions. Does the Minister believe that the Secretary of State for Transport's efforts to improve co-operation on the railways have been more or less effective than his intervention in the Dunfermline and West Fife by-election?</p>

	<p pid="b.1267.3/1">The point that the hon. Gentleman is trying to make about the Alstom test track is an interesting one. The fact remains that railway performance is improving. We have record investment in new rolling stock, the youngest railway stock that we have had for a number of years and more than 1 billion passengers used the railways last year. It is the fastest-growing railway in Europe. Significant improvements are being made but, of course, there are still things to do. About 20,000 train services run every week, about 1.2 per cent. of which are cancelled. Of course, we need to improve that, and it is something that we are working on.</p>

	<p pid="b.1267.5/1">I do not think that we have any proposals to privatise Network Rail, but the working relationship between the train operating companies, Network Rail and the Government has been important in securing improvements to the railways.

	<p pid="b.1267.6/1">Does the Minister realise that one of the biggest obstacles to improving the rail infrastructure is the sheer complexity of the number of bodies involved? For example, we desperately need an extension to the platform in Bromsgrove, but it is not clear who is responsible for paying for it. Is it Network Rail; is it Central Trains, which is about to lose its franchise; is it Worcestershire county council under the local transport plan; or should the Minister's Department provide the money?

	<p pid="b.1268.0/1">If we are talking about the mess made to the organisation of the railways, we have to go back to the Tory party and what it did to Railtrack and so on. We have now set up a new structure on the railways involving the Department for Transport, Network Rail, which is responsible for performance, operating and improvement, and the train operating companies, which are responsible for improving the service. Clearly, the answer to the hon. Lady's question depends on who owns the platform. Bringing together the partners is an important part of any business case or reasoning for developing the platform or changing it.</p>

The East Lancashire Railway is part of a heritage railway that brings in lots of income and visitors to the area.

	<p pid="b.1269.8/1">Numerous studies have made the rather obvious point that the more congested the road system, the greater the disadvantage to the economy. The bigger question to address is what we do about that. Clearly, we need additional capacity, which is why, for example, we completed a major widening of the M25 just before Christmas. We need to manage the road system better, which we are doing throughout the network with, for example, traffic management officers clearing up after accidents. However, those two measures would not be enough on their own. We need to examine whether it might be better to replace the existing system of paying for road use with distance-based charging. As I have said on many occasions, if we do not do that, we will face total gridlock. We are not short of analysis, but we need to concentrate on solutions that will reduce congestion in the longer term.</p>

Many of our motorways are almost urban slip roads around the great cities of Britain, yet we have one of the few motorway systems that involves no charge. Will my right hon. Friend consider introducing in the interim a vignette of &pound;30 to &pound;40 for motorway users, including all foreign cars and lorries that come into Britain, but allowing rural people who do not use motorways not to pay that extra money? Such a simple and practical scheme could be put in place until his all-singing and all-dancing road pricing and satellite in the sky operation comes into being, for which we might have to wait a little after the end of his term of office.</p>

	<p pid="b.1270.1/1">Having been here for almost four years, I would not bank on that. I am not sure how much thought my right hon. Friend has given to the matter, but it simply would be neither feasible nor desirable simply to toll motorways if we thought that we would adopt a completely different method of charging for roads a few years later. I have said before that a national road pricing scheme is some years off, but I believe that we can pilot such a scheme regionally in the next five years or so. Simply charging for some roads, but not for others&mdash;<i>[Interruption.]</i> I shall come on to the vignette in a moment. Although my right hon. Friend prides himself on his knowledge of matters European, I think that he would find that the Commission would come down very hard on us if we tried to impose something that discriminated against foreign drivers, because the Single European Act is supposed to stop that. The short answer is that I do not think that he is advocating a good idea, but I will be more than happy to discuss it with him afterwards.</p>

I have made it clear, however, that we are prepared to provide that funding, because I want to be able to choose, probably next year, a particular area where we can pilot the scheme. Until we conduct a pilot we will not be able to bottom out the technical problems or evaluate how people behave in practice.

	<p pid="b.1273.4/1">I think I can. As my hon. Friend knows, my Department and I have been in discussion with the Greater Manchester passenger transport authority, among others, about how we improve public transport, particularly bus services. The problem is that it is not possible for representatives of a local authority and two bus companies to sit down and reach an agreement about the adequacy of the bus service, matters of fares and so on. If we are to achieve greater demand management and introduce road pricing and other measures, there must be such an agreement. If we are to say to people, as in London, &quot;Don't take your car, but get on to public transport&quot;, the public transport must be available in the first place. I am not satisfied that the present system of dealing with buses deals with that. I have said before that I do not want to go back to the pre-1986 legislation because that had its own problems, but I think we can make a quantifiable change in the way in which bus services are provided outside London. That is what we are discussing, and I hope to have something further to say in the not too distant future.</p>

That certainly is not the case in south Manchester, where we have seen the systematic removal of services over a number of years, including most recently the service to Manchester royal infirmary on a Sunday.

It is as much in the interests of bus operators as of everybody else to ensure sensible management of the amount of traffic going through the streets of Manchester, as well as other places. That is why the Greater Manchester passenger transport authority is currently looking at the measures that it needs to take over the next five to 10 years to reduce the amount of traffic coming into the city and improve public transport. We are working closely together to achieve that. In terms of bus services, it will be possible to deliver such improvements only with the powers that will be necessary to ensure that buses are running where they are supposed to be running, as they should be if we are to persuade people that they should leave their cars at home. We discuss these matters not only with the Greater Manchester PTA, but with Stagecoach and other bus operators.</p>

	<p pid="b.1274.2/1">Does not the fact that bus usage in London since the mid-1980s has risen by almost 60 per cent., whereas in the rest of England and in Wales it has fallen by almost a half, show that the London model, which combines public planning on routes, fares and timetables with competition for specific contracts, has been a huge success, while deregulation has been a disaster?</p>

	<p pid="b.1274.3/1">The position varies across the country. The hon. Gentleman is right that London bus usage has increased dramatically, but he should bear in mind two things. First, the Mayor of London has deliberately introduced measures such as the congestion charge and others to encourage people to leave their cars at home. Furthermore, through the support of central Government, the Mayor is spending more than &pound;400 million supporting those bus services. In other parts of the country, such as Brighton, York, Oxford and Cambridge, where bus companies and local authorities are working well together, there has also been an increase in bus patronage. What I have been referring to is further measures that are important and indeed necessary if we are to see an increase in the use of buses, particularly in larger conurbations such as Greater Manchester or in the west midlands, where I believe that we need to do more to reduce congestion on the roads and improve public transport. As I said in reply to the previous question, I am determined to ensure that we have a pilot for a national road pricing scheme, and improved public transport is an essential part of that.</p>

Quite a lot of resignalling is needed at Reading, because the bottleneck affects services not only going up to Birmingham, but going down to the west country, and Network Rail is on the case.</p>

	<p pid="b.1277.1/1">The review of the British Transport police comes at a sensitive time. As the Secretary of State knows, violent crime reported on the railways has increased by 40 per cent. in the past five years, and passengers in London are seriously concerned about safety because of unmanned stations and partially manned stations. Will the Secretary of State assure the House that passenger safety will be prioritised as part of the review, rather than the review being used to fit in with the Government's wider regionalisation agenda for police forces up and down the country?</p>

	<p pid="b.1277.2/1">The hon. Gentleman is right that what matters is providing effective police for the railways&mdash;despite its name, the British Transport police is essentially a railway police force. He is also right that we must ensure that the safety of passengers is paramount, which is why we have increased funding to the BTP&mdash;the number of officers has increased by about 300 in the past year alone, and more than 200 officers are due to be recruited in next three years. We have spent a lot more money on CCTV, and policing on London underground has been increased, too. It is important that the BTP focuses its efforts on tracking down the people who commit such crimes. We must ensure that people have the confidence to use the railways and the underground, and part of our review of the BTP is about making sure that policing is firmly focused on that objective.</p>

	<p pid="b.1277.4/1">Yes, the BTP does a very good job. We are having this review because, given the prospect of reducing the number of police forces in England and Wales, it makes sense to look at how the BTP is structured. It has to work very closely with police forces outside London because BTP officers tend to be more thinly spread in some areas and other forces need to help. In addition, the BTP is being asked to do an increasing amount of sophisticated work in relation to anti-terrorist activities in London, where it works with the Metropolitan police. The question that we are considering is whether it is best that it should remain as   the BTP&mdash;[Hon. Members: &quot;Yes&quot;]&mdash;or be firmly focused. I hope that the review will be completed fairly quickly. My hon. Friend is right to say that the BTP does a good job in different parts of the country, and its work is appreciated.</p>

	<p pid="b.1278.0/1">We will complete the review as soon as we can, but it is important to carry it out thoroughly to ensure that we get it right.</p>
	<p pid="b.1278.0/2">It is true, as has been said, that the amount of reported crime has gone up. That is partly because all crimes are reported and recorded more accurately, but it is also the case, as the House will know, that there has been an increase in the amount of crime against individuals generally. We have increased the amount of officers and the amount of money available to spend on measures such as CCTV&mdash;every single penny of which, I must tell the hon. Gentleman, was opposed by the Conservatives at every opportunity. The House should be in no doubt that we are committed to doing everything that we possibly can to ensure that the railways are safe. The fact that increasing numbers of people are using the railways every year tends to suggest that the vast majority have confidence in the system. That said, there is clearly a lot more to be done in relation to the fight against crime, and we will ensure that British Transport police and other police forces have the resources they need to do that.</p>

	<p pid="b.1278.4/1">I wonder whether the measures are proportionate. Someone who flies to Paris buys a ticket with their name on it, and before they get on the aeroplane the name on their ticket is checked against their passport at least three times. Someone who gets on Eurostar to go to Paris, Brussels, or wherever does not necessarily have a named ticket and all that is checked is whether they have a ticket. We therefore have no idea who is travelling on Eurostar. Should not we review that arrangement to ensure that our borders are secure?</p>

	<p pid="b.1278.5/1">The arrangements are very different as between Eurostar and the airlines. Airlines have named tickets because they must have a passenger manifest in case of an accident and because they must carry out a reconciliation between the hold baggage and the individuals on the plane. There is no hold baggage on Eurostar, and it is not necessary to have the same passenger manifest. Nevertheless, I have noted my hon. Friend's comments and will ensure that they are relayed to the people who keep security on Eurostar under review.</p>

	<p pid="b.1280.3/1">My hon. Friend correctly said that e-government services are widely available.

	<p pid="b.1280.4/1">My hon. Friend is absolutely right that IT has the potential to bridge the divide, which, left unchecked, would grow. There are excellent examples of that improvement throughout the country. I visited Eastserve in Manchester, a project in the western isles and another on an oil platform in the North sea halfway to Norway. They are excellent innovations and examples of the delivery of public services to people, regardless of their background and age. However, I agree that much more can be done and many comments and ideas are contained in our transformational government strategy, which was published in November last year.</p>

We are learning from the Dutch, the Danes and others who match our aspirations and ambitions on better regulation. Importantly, we shall know that we have succeeded&mdash;as we are beginning to do now&mdash;when other countries look at our example.

	<p pid="b.1282.0/1">My hon. Friend's analysis is correct. If the UK and the European Union are to succeed in the global economy, given the challenges from China and India, our ambitions for better regulation need to be much more robust.

The Minister has said that he favours the principle of one in, one out. That is, for every new regulation, an old one should be scrapped. So why has not he, as the Cabinet Office Minister charged with responsibility for deregulation, published a list of the regulations to be scrapped? Or is he content that there is now &pound;40 billion-worth more regulation than there was in 1997 and that it is rising fast? What is he going to do about that?</p>

	<p pid="b.1282.2/2">Labour Members make no apology for well-targeted, effective regulation that delivers protection for families, helps the working poor and protects our environment. It is a shame that the Conservative party has not yet flip-flopped on all those issues.</p>

	<p pid="b.1282.3/1">Does the Minister not agree that the reason the Government have failed so dismally on regulatory reform is that regulatory reform orders are initiated by Ministers?

	<p pid="b.1283.1/1">On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. I seek your advice in your capacity as guardian of the rights and privileges of the House, as I believe that the House may have been misled.</p>
	<p pid="b.1283.1/2">On 12 January, in a point of order from this Dispatch Box, I drew attention to an inconsistency. The answer to a written parliamentary question that I had received on that date stated that UK Sport had not</p>
	<p pid="b.1283.1/3" class="indent">&quot;set an aspirational target for Olympic medals in . . . 2012&quot;.&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, 12 January 2006; Vol. 441, c. 783W.]</p>
	<p pid="b.1283.1/4">That was inconsistent with remarks to the contrary in UK Sport's annual report. You replied, Mr. Speaker, that if that answer was incorrect, it should be corrected by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport.</p>
	<p pid="b.1283.1/5">I wrote to the Secretary of State immediately after your remarks, Mr. Speaker. I have yet to receive an answer. I also issued a freedom of information request for the documents relating to the issue. I received a reply this morning. It denied me access to those documents; however, owing to a mistake by a civil servant, the document that I sought was included in the reply. The summary states&mdash;some of it is in bold type&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="b.1283.1/6" class="indent">&quot;UK Sport's ultimate goal, in consultations with BOA&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1283.1/7">&mdash;that is, the British Olympic Association&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="b.1283.1/9">There is clearly a massive inconsistency between that and the Minister's statement that UK Sport had not set an aspirational target for Olympic medals in 2012. You can see why I believe that the House has been misled, Mr. Speaker.</p>
	<p pid="b.1283.1/10">I have now raised the matter twice on points of order, and have received no response from the Department. I have written to the Secretary of State; she has not yet had the courtesy to reply to the letter. What further action can I take?</p>

	Disabled Children's Assessment and Services
</major-heading>

	<p pid="b.1284.1/1" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move,</p>
	<p pid="b.1284.1/2" class="indent" pwmotiontext="yes">That leave be given to bring in a Bill to make provision about the assessment of disabled children's needs; to amend the law relating to children; to place duties on local authorities and the National Health Service in respect of disabled children and their carers; and for connected purposes.</p>
	<p pid="b.1284.1/3">In Britain today, there are some 770,000 disabled children&mdash;7 per cent. of all the children in our country. Despite medical advances, the prevalence of disability is increasing. Since 1975, there has been a 62 per cent. increase in the number of disabled children. At this point, I want to pay tribute to the many thousands of parents, carers and teachers of children with severe learning disabilities, who work tirelessly day in, day out to give children in their care all the opportunities, love and support that they need and deserve.</p>
	<p pid="b.1284.1/4">One test of a civilised society is how it supports the families in greatest need. We know that disabled children and young people face multiple barriers to achieving their potential, or to sharing similar life chances to everyone else. We know, too, that severe disabilities place great burdens on families and close friends. Surveys show that it costs three times as much to bring up a disabled child, while for many parents the barriers to work are insurmountable. More than half of disabled children in Britain today live in poverty.</p>
	<p pid="b.1284.1/5">Successive Governments have recognised our obligations to these families. The Government's recent report, &quot;Improving the Life Chances of Disabled People&quot;, which was masterminded by the Under-Secretary of State for Education and Skills, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1687" name="Maria Eagle">my hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Garston (Maria Eagle)</phrase>, set out the overarching children's policy framework and how it has evolved in recent decades: from the Children Act 1989, to the &quot;Every Child Matters&quot; Green Paper and the subsequent Children Act 2004. That report highlights how the Government are doing more to support disabled children and their families through measures such as extra cash help in the form of the child tax credit, a network of special educational needs co-ordinators, and section 8 of the national service framework for children. But we know that there is still a long way to go.</p>
	<p pid="b.1284.1/6">Last December, I met the parents and teachers of Kingsland school in Stanley, in my constituency, to where younger children with severe and profound learning difficulties come from across the Wakefield district. Kingsland is truly a brilliant school. Highly praised by Government inspectors, it is the first special school in my district to receive the primary basic skills quality mark. As I have seen, the children have a great time every day, especially at lunchtime. But when I talked to a group of parents and teachers, I heard first hand how tough life can be. Head teacher Nitsa Wainwright explained to me how difficult the school finds it to access services such as speech therapy or physiotherapy outside the school term.</p>
	<p pid="b.1284.1/7">Parents' biggest concern is the lack of reliable respite care. They described to me the great stress that both parents and siblings endure, especially during the holidays, when there is no school and such families are caring for severely disabled children 24 hours a day, seven days a week. They told me how much they value the chance of an occasional break&mdash;to go to the pub or on a trip to meet friends&mdash;and they explained how much more difficult life becomes when, as happens too often, their respite care is delayed, curtailed or cancelled because of staff shortages or problems with transport. These parents need more support, and I have been in contact with my local authority and primary care trust to represent their concerns. There is a real will in our district to make things better.</p>
	<p pid="b.1284.1/8">I have also discovered that these families are not alone in their struggle. Contact a Family and Mencap tell me that thousands of parents across the country face similar problems. In Britain today, 3,000 children are on waiting lists for family-based short breaks; three out of 10 children wait more than a year for such a break; and six out of 10 of those in greatest need get no, or very few, breaks. It is no wonder that, according to a Mencap survey, eight out of 10 families with disabled children are at breaking point. Margaret Sparks, a school governor of Kingsland school, told me of her and her husband's huge struggle to get proper respite care for their daughter, Kathryn. As one parent said to me:</p>
	<p pid="b.1284.1/9" class="indent">&quot;Most of the time the organisational challenge of getting out together as a family can be too great and it's just too difficult. At least with respite care you have the hope of a chance of being able to go out and be a normal family and enjoy things like cinema or swimming which many people just take for granted. For us, respite care means the difference between doing normal things like this and actually cracking up as a family.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1284.1/10">My Bill aims to improve the services for families such as the ones whom I met in my constituency. It is supported by Contact a Family, the Council for Disabled Children, Mencap and the Special Educational Consortium, which have been working together for several years to raise awareness of the issues that the Bill addresses. It is also supported by a number of backers and supporters from all parts of the House, many of whom have campaigned for years for a better deal for disabled children and their parents. They include Members such as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1967" name="Tom Clarke">my right hon. Friend the Member for Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill (Mr. Clarke)</phrase>, who introduced disabled persons legislation in 1986, and who is chairman of the all-party group on learning disability.</p>
	<p pid="b.1284.1/11">I also wish to pay tribute to the late Rachel Squire, the former Member for Dunfermline and West Fife, who was a patron of Contact a Family and a tireless campaigner on behalf of carers and disabled children and adults. She will be sadly missed.</p>
	<p pid="b.1284.1/12">My Bill proposes three important changes that would improve the rights of disabled children and their families. First, it seeks to make clear in law for the first time that local authorities must assess disabled children and provide them with a range of services where those are assessed as necessary. Our research has shown that there is no duty to assess disabled children under the Children Act 1989 equivalent to that in the National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990, although that duty has been implied in case law and policy guidance.</p>
	<p pid="b.1284.1/13">The Bill would give disabled children the right to a local authority assessment and to receive services. It would do so by proposing amendments to section 17 of the Children Act 1989, and by drawing directly on a previous and pioneering private Member's Bill, which became the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act 1970. I am sure that the whole House joins me in paying tribute to the work of Alf Morris, now Lord Morris, whose work radically improved the life chances of disabled people in our country.</p>
	<p pid="b.1284.1/14">Secondly, my Bill would give disabled children and their families an explicit right to short breaks and respite care. Under the community care regime, adult social service authorities are obliged to provide disabled adults with short breaks where the authority has assessed that such a need exists. However, no such obligation exists at present under the Children Act 1989. If enacted, the Bill would therefore empower parents in coming forward to ask for assessments and for the services and respite care they badly need.</p>
	<p pid="b.1284.1/15">Thirdly, my Bill would also require NHS bodies to work co-operatively with local authorities to promote the health and welfare of disabled children in England and Wales, and enhance the delivery of services such as speech and language therapy.</p>
	<p pid="b.1284.1/16">I know from my discussions with Ministers that they support the objectives of my Bill. I know that they intend to study its provisions in detail to see how and if it can be taken forward. I know, too, that Ministers are committed to using every lever at their disposal to deliver our manifesto commitment to</p>
	<p pid="b.1284.1/17" class="indent">&quot;ensure that services are designed to meet the additional needs of disabled children and their families&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.1284.1/18">I look forward to further discussions and, in the forthcoming spending review, I hope that the Government can bring forward a cross-cutting public service agreement for disabled children, which can match resources with greater co-ordination between local authorities and the NHS to deliver, for families with disabled children, the care and support they badly need.</p>
	<p pid="b.1284.1/19">I hope that we can make progress in giving parents with disabled children enhanced support&mdash;building on what has already been done&mdash;so that every child in our country has the best start in life. Parents of children at Kingsland School told me that they need more support. I hope that my Bill can make it happen, and I thank the House for giving me the opportunity to present it today.</p>

	<p pid="b.1286.2/1">On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. I seek your guidance, because I hope that the House will be able to divide on amendment No. 8 to the Health Bill. I say that for two reasons. First, I believe that the House should be given an opportunity to vote for the status quo, and my amendment would provide the only chance to do so. Secondly, if the House cannot vote on my amendment, some of us might be obliged to vote against the Bill on Third Reading, which would be most unfortunate, because it would mean a confusion between the smoking elements in part 1 and the rest of the Bill, which is&mdash;I have no doubt&mdash;admirable. I hope that you will give consideration to allowing a division on amendment No.   8, so that the House may take a distinct and separate view on that part of the Bill.</p>

	<p pid="b.1288.1/16">I am delighted that we have reached the Health Bill's final stages in this place. The Bill had 12 constructive sessions in Committee, just over six of which were devoted to the smoke-free provisions, with the remaining time spent discussing other important parts of the Bill. With no programming at all, I was delighted that the Committee managed to discuss all the Bill's main provisions. I was even more pleased that there were only two Divisions during Committee, a reflection of the fact that this is a very good Bill indeed.</p>
	<p pid="b.1288.1/17">As time is more precious on Report, we decided to programme the proceedings, but only lightly. Although the smoke-free provisions are clearly an important part of the Bill, and have generated much interest, the measure contains many other significant provisions. Few amendments have been tabled in relation to other parts of the Bill, but there are amendments on the important provisions on infection control in part 2, and it is right that they should receive a hearing. We have thus proposed a generous three hours in which to conclude our discussions on the first two groups of amendments, which relate to smoking, after which we shall move through the remaining amendments. That is a sensible allocation of time and I hope that Opposition parties will not delay the start of what promises to be a lively debate.</p>

	<p pid="b.1288.2/1">As time discussing the programme motion is time taken from the substantive issue, I shall not detain the House. However, I want to make one point.</p>
	<p pid="b.1288.2/2">In the three hours available, we are discussing two groups of amendments&mdash;those relating to the smoking ban and the completely separate provisions about the position of 16 to 18-year olds. As the first group is obviously contentious, with a wide range of related issues, it seems extremely likely that the whole three hours will be taken up by discussion of the smoking ban, which means that the provisions on 16 to 18-year-olds will not be debated at all, although I am aware that there was a short debate in Committee. Furthermore, as there is a Government new clause it will be voted on, even though it will not have been debated.</p>
	<p pid="b.1288.2/3">Will the Secretary of State confirm that even if we do not debate the new clause she will force a vote on it? She is nodding, so she must be happy for us to change the position for 16 to 18-year olds without debate in the House. It will thus seem that not enough time was available, but in fact the Government could have given us more than one day on Report. The Pensions Bill had three days on Report. If these important issues cannot be properly debated because there is not enough time this afternoon, the Government should allocate extra time and not make a quite major change without any debate. For that reason, I regard the programme motion as unsatisfactory.</p>

Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron)</phrase> on the birth of his third baby. We all wish him well, both as a parent and, of course, in his efforts to give up smoking.</p>
	<p pid="b.1292.0/2">The Bill will ban smoking in virtually every enclosed public place and workplace in England. As the director of Action on Smoking and Health said:</p>
	<p pid="b.1292.0/3" class="indent">&quot;This Bill will be a big step forwards for public health. If passed into law, it will save thousands of lives every year, as vulnerable people are no longer exposed to dangerous second-hand smoke at work, and as thousands of smokers are encouraged to cut down or quit altogether.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1292.0/4">The medical evidence is absolutely clear&mdash;smoking is the principal avoidable cause of premature death. Almost 85,000 people die every year from lung cancer, respiratory illnesses and heart disease. We have acted to deal with that scourge. We have already banned tobacco advertising, strengthened health warnings on cigarette packets and introduced NHS stop-smoking programmes, which in 2004&ndash;05 alone have helped nearly 300,000 people to give up smoking.</p>
	<p pid="b.1292.0/5">Yesterday, the Under-Secretary of State for Health, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1543" name="Caroline Flint">my hon. Friend the Member for Don Valley (Caroline Flint)</phrase>, launched our latest anti-smoking television and radio campaign. Now, with this Bill, we will ensure that from the summer of next year&mdash;18 months earlier than we originally proposed&mdash;smoke-free workplaces and public places will become the norm. Over time, we estimate that an additional 600,000 people will give up smoking as a result of this law and that millions more will be protected from second-hand smoke.</p>

There are working men's clubs, political clubs, military and sporting clubs and so on. I believe that the arguments on membership clubs are very finely balanced. On the one hand, there is a case for making even more places smoke-free and establishing a level playing field for pubs, licensed premises and membership clubs. On the other, there is the case, strongly put to me by many of my own constituents, that a genuinely private membership club that is not for profit and is effectively owned and run by the members themselves should be treated in the same way as people's own homes, where people decide for themselves. I believe that that is a very strong argument, but I will listen to the debate extremely carefully, and on this point in particular.</p>

	<p pid="b.1298.5/1">As I have already said, I think that the arguments are extremely finely balanced. In the spirit of the free vote that we on the Government Benches will have, I intend to listen to the debate very carefully.</p>
	<p pid="b.1298.5/2">If both the amendments and the new clause are passed, the smoking ban will cover all public places and workplaces, including all licensed premises and private membership clubs. Only a few specific exemptions will be made, mainly for places that are essentially a person's home or personal space. If the amendments fall but the new clause is passed unamended, the smoking ban will cover all public places and workplaces, including licensed premises, but not genuine private members' clubs. If the new clause falls, the smoke-free provisions that are set out in the current draft of the Bill will remain&mdash;in other words, in that situation we will introduce regulations to exempt both membership clubs and licensed premises that do not prepare and serve food.</p>
	<p pid="b.1298.5/3">I stress that in order to fulfil the promises that we made to the public in our manifesto, the Government are not prepared to accept any smoke-free provisions that are less comprehensive than those set out in the Bill when it was first published. I wish that there was similar clarity on the Conservative Benches, w<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1476" name="Andrew Lansley">here the hon.

Member for South Cambridgeshire is going to tell us that there has been a further flip-flop since this morning.</p>
	<p pid="b.1298.5/4">Whatever the outcome of the votes on these two specific issues, this Bill marks a huge step forward for public health. It will make smoke-free the norm. It will protect non-smokers from passive smoking, make it easier for smokers to give up and save thousands of people's lives. I look forward to a fruitful debate and to hon. Members making their views known on exactly how far the smoke-free legislation should extend. I commend new clause 5 to the House.</p>

	<p pid="b.1299.4/1">Better than the Labour party.</p>
	<p pid="b.1299.4/2">I am sure that the House is pleased to see the Secretary of State here after her indisposition last week, although I think that she might have preferred to be diplomatically ill today. As I said on Second Reading, I believe that the Bill can contribute to a significant reduction in smoking. On Second Reading, the House resolved to achieve that reduction by means of a legislative ban. We did indeed debate on Second Reading and in Committee the question of whether it could be achieved on a self-regulatory basis. Of course, there is evidence of a significant increase in the number of smoke-free places that are being established without legislation being enforced, but the issue before us today is in practice not whether we should have a ban, but what its extent should be.</p>
	<p pid="b.1299.4/3">Let me be clear: smoking kills and it remains the largest cause of avoidable deaths in this country, and that mortality includes several thousand people each year who we believe die as a consequence of exposure to second-hand smoke. The greatest element of that problem is exposure to second-hand smoke in the home, to which the Secretary of State referred. The figures were clearly set out in November 2004 in the Scientific Committee on Tobacco and Health report: there is a 24 per cent. increase in the risk of developing lung cancer for non-smoking women whose partners are smoking men; there is a 37 per cent. increase in the risk of developing lung cancer for non-smoking men whose partners are smoking women; and there is a 19 per cent. increase in the risk of developing lung cancer for those who are exposed to passive smoke in the workplace.</p>
	<p pid="b.1299.4/4">The risk of lung cancer is well understood; the risk of cardiovascular disease is less well understood, but arguably much more significant. The risk of developing lung cancer increases in direct proportion to the number of cigarettes smoked and the duration of smoking. Damage to the heart and arteries, however, seems to occur disproportionately at lower exposures, such as those experienced through exposure to second-hand smoke. Although passive smokers may have an uptake of tobacco smoke equivalent to only about 1 per cent. of that of an active smoker, the risk of their developing heart disease increases by 25 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="b.1299.4/5">Last year, a study in the <i>British Medical Journal</i> estimated on that basis that more than three times as many people die from ischemic heart disease as a result of passive smoking as die from lung cancer. Evidence produced in the past four or five years suggests that small amounts of exposure to second-hand smoke can lead to substantial increases in the risk of developing cardiovascular disease.</p>

	<p pid="b.1300.3/1">I recall the figure to which the hon. Gentleman has referred, although I think that it appeared in a different BMJ study. I do not dispute that a significant number of deaths have been and continue to be associated with exposure to second-hand smoke in the workplace, which is one of the reasons why we have always supported protection in the workplace. As we set out in our manifesto, the objectives of policy should be to reduce the incidence of smoking, to ensure that non-smokers are not exposed to smoke unless they want to be, to protect workers in the workplace and to ensure that children are not exposed to second-hand smoke. We set out that position in our manifesto; I said it again on Second Reading and I have not departed from it. We are debating how those objectives will be achieved and the balances to be struck, which I shall discuss in a moment.</p>
	<p pid="b.1300.3/2">As shadow Secretary of State for Health, I must say&mdash;not least to my hon. Friends&mdash;that it is imperative on health grounds to stop unwanted exposure to second-hand smoke and potentially reduce the prevalence of smoking, especially among young people whose smoking habits tend to become entrenched in the workplace. The Secretary of State accepted that point when she introduced the Bill at the end of last year, but she then made a perverse and bogus distinction between pubs that serve food and those that do not. On Second Reading, we asked her to explain the health grounds for making such a distinction, but she offered no evidence on that point. However, given the effect of that on health inequalities, which was subsequently exposed in great detail by the Select Committee on Health, we knew that it was wrong when it was presented. I think that most Labour Members knew that it was wrong and, frankly, that the Secretary of State knew that it was wrong, but she would not admit it. Her acquiescence in the Airdrie and Shotts provisions was a failure on her part. She is condemned by the fact that she would not stand by her own instincts and, as Secretary of State for Health, by the views and recommendations of the chief medical officer.</p>

	<p pid="b.1301.1/1">I shall come to that in a moment. <i>[Interruption.]</i> Well, I will do better than the Secretary of State, because I will tell the House how I am going to vote. A few minutes ago, she appeared to extol the fact that she is giving a free vote to Labour Members&mdash;or her Whips are. We gave a free vote on Second Reading. The Liberal Democrats did not, but have been persuaded to do so by the changes that we have brought about. I recall that on Second Reading Labour Members endorsed our view that this matter should be governed by a free vote because of the contrary views and evidence that needed to be listened to.</p>
	<p pid="b.1301.1/2">The Secretary of State would not listen, and now she has had to learn. Curiously, however, we do not know quite how far she has gone. In new clause 5, she has abandoned the prospect of an exemption for non-food pubs. Whereas previously she was prepared to consult on whether there should be smoking rooms in licensed premises, she now seems to have concluded that there cannot be such a consultation and must not be such smoking rooms. I did not hear her express a view on the remaining central question relating to clubs. Presumably we can have a debate about that, and in two and a half hours we will all be very excited to see whether she is for or against it. On Second Reading, she said:</p>
	<p pid="b.1301.1/3" class="indent">&quot;It is . . . right to exempt membership clubs&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.1301.1/4">She said of members of the public:</p>
	<p pid="b.1301.1/5" class="indent">&quot;They clearly view membership clubs as private clubs run by members for members. Such clubs have always been treated differently from other licensed premises because they are non-profit-making organisations.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, 29 November 2005; Vol. 440, c. 156.]</p>
	<p pid="b.1301.1/6">That was the Secretary of State's advice on Second Reading, but given the handbrake turn that we have seen since then, what point is there in taking her advice? Even her own junior Minister, the Under-Secretary of State for Health, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1543" name="Caroline Flint">the hon. Member for Don Valley (Caroline Flint)</phrase>, is not going to do so&mdash;or perhaps it is vice versa; we simply do not know.</p>

Those health effects demand that non-smokers should not be exposed to second-hand smoke.

	<p pid="b.1303.1/1">I do not accept that and I shall explain why. Freedom to choose whether to smoke in one's private space must be respected. That liberty does not extend to exposing other people to harm in a public place. On that basis, exemptions to the requirement for premises to be smoke-free should include private homes and private vehicles, as amendment No. 6 proposes&mdash;I hope that we shall have an opportunity to press that to a Division. Places that are one's home on a temporary basis and private members' clubs should be exempt.</p>
	<p pid="b.1303.1/2">I understand the case about employees but, as was said from the Liberal Democrat Benches, I do not believe that we could or should require people not to smoke in their homes when staff or employees are present. I therefore do not support the argument that private homes or private members' clubs should be smoke-free on the ground of the presence of employees.</p>

	<p pid="b.1303.5/1">Yes. That was a timely intervention. If we give clubs an exemption, we should not necessarily exclude them from regulations. Through their desire not to expose themselves to litigation, they will have to consider ventilation. Changes in technology may have an impact on that. I do not believe that it is currently sufficient to rely on ventilation because of the persistence of toxins in the air, but it may be possible in future.</p>

It would also have the benefit of offsetting any market distortion between pubs and clubs that might otherwise result. Pubs that are non-smoking and open to the public would also offer a smoke-free environment for families and children.

If amendment (a) is defeated, I will then&mdash;with your permission, Mr. Deputy Speaker&mdash;seek to press amendment (i) to a vote, so as to prevent children from being exposed to second-hand smoke in clubs.

	<p pid="b.1305.2/4">The voting might be complex, but the principles involved are pretty straightforward. We must reduce smoking and the exposure to second-hand smoke. We should not permit people's liberty to choose whether to smoke to extend to a licence to cause harm to others, but we cannot allow legislation to intrude into the choices that people make in their private space. I hope that these explanations have been of some assistance to hon. Members across the House.</p>

	<p pid="b.1305.5/1">Well, the imminently right hon. Member, then. I associate myself with his congratulations on the extraordinary fecundity of those on the Conservative Benches. If Conservative Members keep producing children at this rate, I will be seriously worried that the Labour Government could be threatened in about 18 years. For the moment, however, I think that congratulations, and possibly a cigar, to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1932" name="David Cameron">the right hon. Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron)</phrase> would be entirely appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="b.1305.5/2">We have the unaccustomed and rather intoxicating luxury of a free vote on this subject. A number of my colleagues are already asking how the Whips want them to vote on the free vote, but for once we are able to make a decision without any of the normal party-political baggage. It does credit to right hon. and hon. Members that much of the discussion that has taken place has been non-partisan, and I genuinely believe that we are trying to do what is best.</p>
	<p pid="b.1305.5/3">Let us start from the assumption, revolutionary though it may seem, that tobacco is not actually good for one, and that were it to be discovered today it would be a dangerous drug and we would not have a great deal to do with it. The temptation to take the simplistic approach, however, seems to have gone to the heads of a number of right hon. and hon. Members.</p>
	<p pid="b.1305.5/4">I would suggest that it is not possible to uninvent something. We must look at the sheer practicalities. It is entirely understandable that we wish to stand as sea-green incorruptibles on a snow-capped peak and say &quot;There shall be no tobacco: let a thousand children breathe uncluttered air&quot;&mdash;unless, of course, they happen to live in a city or a village or a town, or anywhere where there is a motor car, or anywhere where there is any ancillary industry. But will new clause 5 and the amendments tabled by the Under-Secretary of State for Health, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1543" name="Caroline Flint">my hon. Friend the Member for Don Valley (Caroline Flint)</phrase>, achieve that?</p>
	<p pid="b.1305.5/5">We have the chance to benefit from some empirical evidence. Purely for the purpose of my parliamentary duties, I was in Dublin the week before last. As dusk settled over that wondrous city, I took the opportunity to wander the streets in search of licensed premises&mdash;in an investigative role. I had been told that Ireland was the exemplar of the new legislation, as it is an exemplar in so many ways. This was the place where the smoking ban had been imposed, and by heaven, the proud Celts had stepped back and said &quot;That's it: no more cigarettes.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1305.5/6">What a vision I observed in Temple Bar! What an extraordinary sight greeted me when, with a number of my parliamentary colleagues and several Members of the Dail, I visited a number of pubs to find that all fell into one or other of two categories. In one category, the entire perimeter area was covered with patio heaters and armchairs, so that anyone who wanted to go into the admittedly smoke-free pub had to fight his way through a tangible fug of nicotine-soaked air to get into the damn place to start with, which made something of a nonsense of the arrangement. If it was not possible to find a pub ringed with patio heaters&mdash;there may be some hon. Members, possibly on the Conservative Benches, who are not entirely averse to making a profit from time to time, and I say to them &quot;Buy patio heater shares now&quot;&mdash;there were other pubs which, to my amazement, had somehow managed to fit a false ceiling and to claim that part of the pub was no longer part of the integral structure.

	<p pid="b.1307.4/1">No doubt my hon. Friend will regard me as something of a spoilsport when I point out the following to him. Last Friday, my parliamentary assistant went to the Bill Office to try to table amendments that would have banned smoking in the outside spaces of establishments where people are served food and drink and in outside spaces where people are required to gather to use public transport or as spectators for sporting or cultural events. She was told by the Clerk that the measures I wanted to include in the Bill are in fact already included under clause 2. It refers to</p>
	<p pid="b.1307.4/2" class="indent">&quot;areas which are enclosed or substantially enclosed&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="b.1307.4/3">and states that the</p>
	<p pid="b.1307.4/4" class="indent">&quot;appropriate national authority may specify in regulations what 'enclosed' and 'substantially enclosed' mean.&quot;</p>

	<p pid="b.1307.5/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend, as is, I believe, the whole House. So it is &quot;Goodnight Irene&quot; for the walled city of York. However, it must be said that those of us in the wide open spaces of west London seldom consider ourselves enclosed, and very seldom restrained.</p>
	<p pid="b.1307.5/2">There is a desperately serious point. We are trying to do something about public health, and the group of people about whom we are most worried&mdash;young people aged between about 11 and 13 who are taking up this habit&mdash;are the very people who do not go to pubs. To a large extent, discussing pubs in the context of stopping smoking is nonsense, because in doing so we are not dealing with the people whom we actually want to address. We must never forget the Oscar Wilde quote:</p>
	<p pid="b.1307.5/3" class="indent">&quot;As long as war is regarded as wicked, it will always have its fascination. When it is looked upon as vulgar, it will cease to be popular.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1307.5/4">As long as tobacco smoking is seen as this dreadful, wicked thing that film stars do and there are people in pubs doing it, it will be attractive to children. We must address the issue of role models and public practice. Were I a role model, I would plead guilty in this regard, but fortunately I am not. So this is a very serious issue and the question is how we best deal with it. Frankly, as with so many things, there are three different options.</p>
	<p pid="b.1307.5/5">The first is the pure libertarian view, eloquently expressed by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1795" name="Alan Duncan">the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton (Mr. Duncan)</phrase> in his famous book, which is compulsory bedside reading for many of us, that everything should be allowed. That is a legitimate intellectual argument.</p>
	<p pid="b.1307.5/6">The second option is the counter-argument that everything should be banned. Tobacco is bad for people&mdash;ban it. Cars are bad for people&mdash;ban them. Alcohol is bad for people&mdash;ban the lot. Ban everything, and we will subsist on a milk toast diet of muesli as we shuffle through the empty streets of our city, looking for a little stimulation where we may find it.</p>
	<p pid="b.1307.5/7">Those are both perfectly legitimate intellectual arguments: everything bad is banned; everything bad is allowed. Or, we can opt for&mdash;dare I say it?&mdash;co-existence and compromise. Instead of concentrating on what divides us, let us concentrate on what unites us. Would it not be possible&mdash;</p>

One need go only to the Upper Committee Corridor, where one will find an oasis, capped with graceful brushed aluminium, beneath which the discerning man or woman may stand, enjoy a cigarette, do whatever damage to themselves they will, and do no damage to anyone else.

	<p pid="b.1309.3/1">The hon. Gentleman makes a very good point about Ireland. The issue is where people smoke. There is evidence that since the ban there has been a 5 per cent. drop in the consumption of tobacco in Ireland, but if 95 per cent. of deaths from passive smoking occur from smoking in the home, the number of deaths from passive smoking may increase as a result of a ban on smoking in public places.</p>

	<p pid="b.1310.11/1">It is clear that two of us here read the Irish Medical Journal. The figures show that there has been a continuing decline in the numbers of smokers over the past five years. There is no statistical evidence to suggest that the numbers have risen since the smoking ban was introduced. The long Kondratiev cycle has to be borne in mind, but five years is statistically significant.</p>
	<p pid="b.1310.11/2">I do not want to detain the House, but I appeal to hon. Members to think about the practicalities. A total ban will not make tobacco disappear, but coexistence is possible. I accept that we would prefer not to have either tobacco or smokers, but in fact we have both.</p>
	<p pid="b.1310.11/3">Earlier, I mentioned the smoke-free cowl on the Upper Committee Corridor, but now I refer the House to the dystopic hell&mdash;&quot;Hernando's Hideaway&quot;&mdash;that is the smoking room on the Library Corridor. It is like the &quot;Raft of the Medusa&quot; most nights, with great groups of people crammed into it. The air there is a little much even for my fragile lungs.</p>
	<p pid="b.1310.11/4">We need sanity and sense. This debate has stirred great emotions, but talking about dead bodies littering the streets, adopting an absolute position and saying that smoking will disappear if it is banned are not good ways to approach the matter. We must accept the reality of tobacco's existence and try to mitigate the nuisance and annoyance that it causes. We must protect young people from tobacco smoke and stop them taking up smoking, but for heaven's sake we must not make matters much worse by introducing legislation that Draco the lawgiver would have felt was too extreme.</p>

	<p pid="b.1311.0/1"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1560" name="Stephen Pound">The hon. Member for Ealing, North (Stephen Pound)</phrase> is a tough act to follow. Although I have been the butt of his humour, I think that the Standing Committee might have been greatly enhanced by his presence.</p>
	<p pid="b.1311.0/2">At the heart of this debate are the health and safety of people working in pubs, clubs and enclosed public spaces. That has to be our starting point. It is welcome that the Government have got rid of the absurd distinction between food and non-food pubs.</p>
	<p pid="b.1311.0/3">In the Standing Committee, on which I served, and on Second Reading, the House was told why a gradualist approach was the thing to do: any country that introduced a ban had done so gradually, so the food/non-food distinction was a vital part of the effective implementation of the policy. Some weeks later, it is apparent that that was nonsense and that the Government knew it all along, so at least we have made some progress on that front.</p>
	<p pid="b.1311.0/4">I am trying to work out what constitutes a rebel nowadays, because we seem to have reached a never-never world. The Secretary of State has tabled an amendment in defiance of her party's manifesto and her junior Minister has tabled an amendment to the right hon. Lady's amendment, while the Department of Health press release, issued on 2 February, stated:</p>
	<p pid="b.1311.0/5" class="indent">&quot;Although the New Clause has been tabled in Patricia Hewitt's name and the Amendment in Caroline Flint's name, this is simply in order to facilitate a free vote and does not necessarily indicate which way either will vote themselves.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1311.0/6">That is an incredible situation and, even today, in response to an intervention, the Secretary of State said that she had not made up her mind. One can understand the merits of a free vote, but the idea that the Secretary of State, who is responsible for the health of the nation and thus, to some extent for the health and safety of workers, does not know what she thinks is extraordinary. Indeed, the whole sequence of events has shown a lack of leadership by the Government. They tried to discern and follow public opinion, realised that they were running behind it and so they are trying to play catch-up. That is no way to set a health policy.</p>
	<p pid="b.1311.0/7">The principal bone of contention is the position of private members' clubs. If we consider the matter, as I have done throughout, in terms of the health and safety of people who work in those environments, the fact that I am breathing in the second-hand smoke of someone who happens to have a membership card is irrelevant. The fact that they have agreed with other club members that they have the right to smoke, and I am expected to breathe it in, is irrelevant. The club is not home and people are inflicting smoke not on themselves or their loved ones, but on other people.</p>

	<p pid="b.1312.3/1">The hon. Gentleman makes a good point and I admire his courage in standing up for his principles. It is an extraordinary notion of health and safety that we should tell people who are working in an environment that is bad for their health, &quot;Tough. Go and work somewhere else.&quot; If asbestos was found in the roof of a private members' club, we would not tell the staff to work somewhere else. We would sort out the health and safety problem, which is exactly what we should do in this case.</p>

	<p pid="b.1313.1/1">I understand the hon. Gentleman's point. I suspect that the reason is more to do with pragmatism than anything else, but I am making an argument about private clubs. The Secretary of State says that 95 per cent. of passive smoke comes from the home, as though the other 5 per cent. is somehow inconsequential, yet we have heard that we are talking about a very large number of people whose health is clearly adversely affected and, probably, thousands of premature deaths over a period of years. Although I enjoyed the comments of the hon. Member for Ealing, North, perhaps we need not be apocalyptic, but such things are fundamentally important to each individual case.</p>

	<p pid="b.1313.2/1">Of course, such things are fundamentally important to each individual case but, if only 5 per cent. of those who have died of passive smoking acquired that outside the home&mdash;that seems to be the figure that the Secretary of State was quoting&mdash;will the hon. Gentleman explain on what basis we are supposed to make a judgment? Of course, if that was 100 per cent. likely, the case for banning it might be better than if it was nil per cent. likely. What we seem to be hearing is that that is relatively unlikely. Is not passive motoring a great deal more dangerous?</p>

	<p pid="b.1313.3/1">No. The hon. Gentleman is getting confused between a certainty of 5 per cent. and a probability of five in 100. In other words, as we have just heard, no one doubts that the health of people who work in bars where people smoke suffers and that some of them die prematurely. That is certain, inasmuch as these things can ever be proven with certainty. There is not a 5 per cent. chance that that is true; it is pretty much 100 per cent. true for that 5 per cent. That is the distinction that I am making. A set of people who work in such environments suffer and that is pretty much proven empirically.</p>
	<p pid="b.1313.3/2">Irrespective of whether we are talking about private space, the issue is about the welfare of the people who work there. If we exempt private members' clubs, do we risk driving a coach and horses through the exemption altogether? I am not sure whether I am clear about the answer. Will the Rose and Crown turn itself into a private members' club?</p>

	<p pid="b.1313.4/1">The hon. Gentleman is making a compelling point. I got involved in this campaign many years ago, because I believed in the protection of workers' health. I joined the Labour party because I thought that protecting workers' health was one of our fundamental principles. Is not this also about changing the culture? That is why it is important to take the clubs out as smoking venues: we want to change the culture of how people perceive their leisure and their fun. It is important to have smoke-free leisure and smoke-free fun.</p>

	<p pid="b.1314.0/1">The hon. Gentleman is right in the sense that a total ban would have that effect&mdash;total bans have done so where they have been implemented&mdash;but that is not where I am coming from. Clearly, a total ban is much easier to enforce than a partial one. I want to return to the loophole point, because the profit-making issue has been raised. Again, I cannot understand the relevance to someone who works in a smoky environment of whether or not they are making more or less money from the sales than it is costing them to sell the goods. That seems to be a red herring.</p>

	<p pid="b.1314.1/1">May I push the hon. Gentleman in a different direction on loopholes and private members' clubs? A private members' club such as the Garrick in London is a very different beast from a private members' club such as Treorchy working men's social club, because the working men's clubs in constituencies such as mine are, to all intents and purposes, the place that people normally go to do their drinking, as if it were an ordinary pub. If we exempt working men's clubs, we will do nothing for the vast majority of the poorest people in my constituency who are equally affected.</p>

	<p pid="b.1314.2/1">The hon. Gentleman raises an important issue about, for example, communities with one members' club and one pub. To the extent that a set of people will vote with their feet, a pub that is prevented from allowing anyone to smoke could lose business and thereby possibly be undermined. Again, it would be unfair to introduce such a distortion using legislation.</p>
	<p pid="b.1314.2/2">The Secretary of State spoke about space around the bar. If we do not pass the ban on smoking in private members' clubs, I am not sure whether people must chalk lines on the floor or use white tape to show that people can smoke on one side of the line but not the other. A distance criterion has been suggested, as though the smoke will come to a screeching halt at the line. That is a strange basis on which to protect people's health. Will we say that people can smoke if they face away from the bar but not if they face towards it? It seems incredible that ministerial comments so far have suggested a distance criterion. People can smoke if they stand away from the bar, but not if they are close to it. The Secretary of State shakes her head, but that is exactly what was said on Second Reading, as the record will show. In a sense, the proposal is a fudge that accepts that passive smoke is bad for the people who work in such clubs.</p>

	<p pid="b.1314.3/1">Does the hon. Gentleman agree that, whatever our views&mdash;there have been heated exchanges across the Floor and within the parties&mdash;it is crucial that there is clarity and not confusion?

	<p pid="b.1314.4/1">I very much agree with that point.

	<p pid="b.1315.1/1">Not only is the hon. Gentleman right, but that might be the outcome even if the House tried to make such a distinction. The idea that there would be a set of workers who had second-class protection seems unsustainable. Even if that were the will of the House today, I have a feeling that the issue would return here via the courts very soon.</p>
	<p pid="b.1315.1/2">I wish to make further observations about some of the arguments that are used for exempting private members' clubs. The first is that we have some sort of carriage in which people would not have to work. People would presumably have to get in and out of such rooms and smoke goes to and fro. People would also have to clear the glasses in such rooms and sort out any scuffles that might take place. Smoke will remain in such areas, especially if they are sealed, for a considerable time. Without the ventilation found in a jumbo jet&mdash;I gather that it is what it would take completely to purify the air&mdash;there will be residual toxins in the air. The well-being of the workers cannot be protected just by having a partitioned-off room.</p>
	<p pid="b.1315.1/3">We have made progress on the Bill, but clearly we have not gone far enough. There is a balance of liberties to consider. People want to be able to smoke and they will still be able to do so in their own homes and out of doors, but it is the job of the House to protect the liberty of people to work in an environment that does not potentially fatally damage their health. That is why I have argued consistently throughout&mdash;I will again vote for this in the Lobby tonight&mdash;that a total ban is the only proper approach to the issue.</p>

	<p pid="b.1315.2/2">When I and my colleagues on the Health Committee began to consider the issue, we did not know what the outcome would be. It is fair to say that some of us held widely differing views, while others had not yet made up their minds. We did what the House and the Select Committee system asked us to do. We took evidence and heard from witnesses. We heard from doctors, public health experts, the tobacco industry, the hospitality trade, trade unions, the Health and Safety Commission, the chief medical officer at the Department of Health and others. Having heard and read all the evidence, we reached a conclusion without dissent. Labour, Conservative, Liberal Democrat and independent Members signed the report and the subsequent amendment tabled for Report that was withdrawn when the Government tabled new clause 5 and amendments (a) to (d).</p>

Friend the Member for St. Helens, South (Mr. Woodward)</phrase>, made a statement on comprehensive legislation on the matter for Northern Ireland, which will be considered in the House because of the suspension of the Assembly, he said that ventilation did not work. We examined ventilation and found no evidence to support its use. An academic from the university of Wales could supply us with no evidence that air conditioning works.

	<p pid="b.1316.1/2">If, as I expect and hope, this proves to be a good day for Parliament, I suggest that it will also be a good day for the Select Committee system.

Representatives of the industry continued to pursue that line when they gave evidence to the Committee. However, it should not be forgotten that for many years the industry denied in public that direct smoking was a cause of cancer, although its private view was very different. Indeed, action that was taken in the United States meant that it opened its archives, which gave us evidence that it knew about the consequences of direct smoking years ago, but hid those facts.</p>

	<p pid="b.1316.2/1">Will my right hon. Friend acknowledge the work of Sir Richard Doll, who sadly died a year ago at the age of 90? In 1954, he produced the first paper that showed the increased mortality of heavy smokers. He also showed that people could live longer depending on the age at which they gave up smoking.</p>

	<p pid="b.1316.3/1">I acknowledge what Richard Doll did in not only the United Kingdom, but worldwide. His authority on the matter was denied for many years, mostly due to the connivance of the tobacco industry, which tried to hide the fact that deaths were caused by tobacco here and throughout the world.</p>
	<p pid="b.1316.3/2">Using the estimates of risk in the SCOTH report, Professor Konrad Jamrozik calculated in a paper published in the <i>British Medical Journal</i> that exposure to second-hand smoke in the workplace caused about 600 deaths a year, which is about three times the number of people in this country killed in industrial accidents each year. Second-hand smoke is also responsible for thousands of episodes of illness. For example, Asthma UK reports that it is the second most common trigger of asthma attacks at work.</p>
	<p pid="b.1316.3/3">Of course, workers who are routinely exposed to other people's smoke are those who are most at risk. Bar workers are thus top of the list, but we should not forget that the Government's figures show that about 2 million people work in places in which smoking is allowed throughout and that more than 10 million people work in places in which smoking is allowed somewhere on the premises&mdash;that is not a small number. I suggest that there are thus sufficient health and safety justifications for ending smoking in the workplace. I deeply regret that the Bill is seen as a measure of public opinion, rather than a measure to protect people in the workplace, which is how other such legislation that we pass is thought of.</p>

	<p pid="b.1317.0/1">My right hon. Friend and I have been companions in arms on the matter for a long time and have been called a lot of names&mdash;I suppose that &quot;puritans&quot; was one of the nicest. Hon. Members have called the Bill a ban on smoking. It is not a ban on smoking, but a line in the sand that says that we will from now start a new culture in our country in which people realise that smoking kills them, or seriously affects their health.</p>

	<p pid="b.1317.1/1">I could not agree more and will come on to that point.</p>
	<p pid="b.1317.1/2">Health and safety concerns are sufficient reason for resisting the Government's original plans to exempt from smoke-free legislation pubs that do not serve food. Why should workers in such pubs be denied the protection that other workers are to be given? It is nonsense to think that we should pass such a measure in the House. Health and safety concerns are sufficient reason not to exempt membership clubs from the law. Licensed clubs employ bar staff, who are routinely exposed to other people's smoke. The fact that the clubs in which they work are owned by members does not afford them any protection from lung cancer or heart disease. The notion that club members should be able to vote to continue to expose their workers to such risks is unacceptable. I came to the House after working for 18 years in one of the most dangerous industries in the United Kingdom. It would be unacceptable for Parliament to pass legislation on that industry by ignoring fundamental facts, but the Bill attempts to do so on smoking.</p>
	<p pid="b.1317.1/3">It is farcical to suggest that a private members' club is an extension of the home. I have been a member of a club for many years, but clubs are not as private and secluded as my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State suggested on the radio this morning. A member of a club in the Club and Institute Union can affiliate to the wider union for &pound;3 a year, and can go to 2,600 clubs and buy a drink without anyone preventing them from doing so. Royal British Legion clubs, too, are not exclusive&mdash;a member of the British Legion can walk into any of its clubs and be served a drink.</p>
	<p pid="b.1317.1/4"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1476" name="Andrew Lansley">The hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley)</phrase> raised the issue of children. Clubs differ marginally from public houses, because there are often many children inside them. They are family-oriented and many hold weekly discos for young children. They organise Easter bonnet parades, Christmas functions and so on for families and young children, so the proposal to exempt clubs from the smoking ban is ludicrous.</p>
	<p pid="b.1317.1/5">If Members do not believe that it is reasonable and practicable to protect people in the workplace under the Health and Safety at Work, etc. Act 1974, they should wait until the House passes the smoking legislation and see what the no win, no fee lawyers do to clubs trying to secure indemnity insurance. In its evidence to the Select Committee, the Health and Safety Commission clearly recommended that pubs, bars and clubs should be covered by the law in the same way as every other workplace. That view is shared by the TUC, which passed a motion nem. con. in congress in September to ban smoking in all workplaces. The Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers, which represents more than 640 bar workers in clubs, wants a ban, and issued a press release on Friday&mdash;I am sure that Members have seen it&mdash;in which general secretary John Hannett said:</p>
	<p pid="b.1317.1/6" class="indent">&quot;Our members are already reporting that they can get a lot of abuse when asking club members to stop smoking at the bar, which is already illegal&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.1317.1/7">That is not, in fact, illegal in private clubs but only illegal in public bars. Mr. Hannett continued:</p>
	<p pid="b.1317.1/8" class="indent">&quot;So we think this amendment will make sure our members can work free of abuse from customers and free from abuse of their lungs.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1317.1/9">Why should club bar staff have to try to enforce the farcical measure whereby someone is not supposed to smoke near the bar?</p>
	<p pid="b.1317.1/10">When the Under-Secretary of State for Health, my hon. Friend the Member for Don Valley gave evidence to the Health Committee, I asked her about clubs that offer entertainment. If someone is working on the stage, will the Government say that we should stop people smoking near the stage? At a reception earlier today, I was talking to Fiona Castle, the widow of Roy Castle, who we all know contracted lung cancer without ever smoking a cigarette in his life. Many people think that that was because of the secondary smoke that he inhaled in his career as a club entertainer. It is nonsense to think that we can protect people from secondary smoke if exemptions such as the one proposed are made.</p>
	<p pid="b.1317.1/11">Let me offer one more quote from somebody who works behind a bar&mdash;not somebody who goes into a bar by choice, but somebody who gets a living behind a bar. Another of the staff whom USDAW represents says:</p>
	<p pid="b.1317.1/12" class="indent">&quot;If we are exempt from this ban, even more smokers are going to come in, and the smoke will get even worse.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1317.1/13">What have they done to deserve that? If a person can move from a pub in my village to a club over the road to smoke, that will make matters even worse not just for bar workers, but for other people in the club.</p>

	<p pid="b.1319.0/1">Those who argue that private members' clubs should be exempt accept that they should not be exempt from health and safety legislation.

	<p pid="b.1319.3/1">Indeed. I shall come to that, if I do not have to take any further interventions. I am keen to finish my speech because others want to speak.</p>
	<p pid="b.1319.3/2">Labour Members gave a pledge in our manifesto about what we would and would not exempt. As an MP for more than 20 years, I have always taken manifesto commitments extremely seriously and I still do, but we must consider the matter logically and ask whether it would be practical to apply an exemption. The answer is no. It is not practical in respect of pubs that do not serve food or in respect of clubs.</p>

	<p pid="b.1319.4/1">My right hon. Friend makes a powerful case for the full ban and for it to apply to private members' clubs as well, but he recognises that, because of the manifesto position, some people might have thought that the Government or the House would take a different view and that there would be time for them to adjust. Is he rigidly advocating the timetable as previously set out or is there a case for allowing people more time to prepare before the full ban comes in, applying both to bars and to private members' clubs?</p>

	<p pid="b.1319.5/1">That is a matter for the Government. If a comprehensive ban is agreed tonight, it is crucial that it is enforced in a way that means that everybody understands where one may smoke and where one may not smoke. Unfortunately, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1560" name="Stephen Pound">my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, North (Stephen Pound)</phrase> is not with us. I had one or two things to say to him about that.</p>
	<p pid="b.1319.5/2">If hon. Members are not persuaded by the health argument, what about the economic argument? To force some pubs to make a choice between stopping people smoking and stopping serving food would create a gross and unjustified market distortion, as well as making a mess of the Government's alcohol strategy and worsening health inequalities. To force pubs that cease to allow smoking to compete with bars and clubs in the same street that still permit it would be unfair and unreasonable.</p>
	<p pid="b.1319.5/3">Like many other hon. Members, I have received representations not just from the industry, but from local publicans. I have one from Steve Smith and Wendy Edwards of The Thurcroft, a public house in one of the villages in my constituency. I know that public house very well. Five hundred yards down the road is Thurcroft Miners Welfare, and five hundred yards up the road is the Unity club, or the &quot;top club&quot;, as it is known in the village. The income of those people will be threatened directly if the ban suggested in new clause 5 is introduced.</p>
	<p pid="b.1319.5/4">I received a letter from Mr. Jan Sowa, who runs a small company that runs three pubs, one of which is The Blue Bell in Aston, another village in my constituency. That pub, too, will be under threat if smoking is allowed in clubs. I do not want to see small businesses such as pubs close because of what the House does. I hope that other hon. Members do not want to see that either. That is why the British Beer and Pub Association, the British Hospitality Association and many others in the leisure and tourism industry now support comprehensive legislation. They see the dangers to businesses.</p>

	<p pid="b.1320.0/1">I want to underpin what the right hon. Gentleman is saying about the economy suffering. Is he aware that one year after New York's smoke-free air act was introduced in 2003, tax receipts for restaurants and bars had risen by 8.7 per cent.? Over the same period, jobs in bars and restaurants increased by more than 10,000.</p>

	<p pid="b.1320.1/1">I agree with the hon. Lady, who will also know that Ireland's retail sales figures now show that bar sales rose sharply, by more than 5 per cent., in the year to October 2005. Such legislation is good for business.</p>

If the measures suggested in new clause 5 are not introduced, people will either leave his pub to drink elsewhere or he will have to stop serving food.

	<p pid="b.1321.0/1">That is true, but as I have already intervened on that matter, I shall not go any further.</p>
	<p pid="b.1321.0/2">The new clause and amendments (a) to (d) would bring England into line with the law that is soon to come into effect in Scotland, that has now been promised in two votes by the National Assembly for Wales and that the Government have announced for Northern Ireland, on which I suspect we will legislate in the next few months. I hope that hon. Members from all three countries will see no difficulty in joining us in giving the same protection to workers and members of the public in England as the rest of the United Kingdom is getting.</p>
	<p pid="b.1321.0/3">The tobacco industry and its allies often argue that smoke-free laws are an infringement of liberty, but I suggest that, once it is accepted that breathing in other people's smoke is dangerous to health, we will recognise that we are really dealing with a conflict of interest. I recognise people's right to smoke and that tobacco is a lawful product. Smoking may be self-destructive, but it is ultimately a matter of choice. I say to people, including my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, North, that people in the Irish Republic make that choice. They step outside into unconfined spaces and still enjoy drinks and cigarettes as well without affecting other people in the pub, including bar workers. That view is certainly widely shared by the general public. Recent polling shows that about 70 per cent. of the public back comprehensive smoke-free legislation, including all pubs and bars.</p>
	<p pid="b.1321.0/4">Finally, I want to mention the enormous public health benefit offered by smoke-free legislation. One in four adults in our country still smoke, and more than 100,000 of them will die as a result. It is by far the greatest cause of preventable deaths and the biggest single contributor to health inequalities and the difference in life expectancy between social classes. I see that my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, North has found some fun in the matter, but I have great difficulty in making jokes about it.</p>
	<p pid="b.1321.0/5">The Government's figures in the regulatory impact assessment suggest that a comprehensive smoke-free law would reduce smoking prevalence rates by 1.7 per cent. That would mean 700,000 people giving up smoking across England, which would lead as night follows day to thousands fewer dying each year from cancer, emphysema, peripheral vascular disease and other illnesses that can be caused by smoking. Over time, that would decrease health inequalities, which are far too great in many parts of this country.</p>
	<p pid="b.1321.0/6">Last night, the House debated ID cards, including how useful they will be in preventing terrorism and saving lives. Tomorrow, we will debate the Terrorism Bill, and again the question will be how useful the legislation is in saving lives. Tonight, if hon. Members vote for amendments (a) to (d), they will do so in the certain knowledge that the legislation will save lives and drastically improve the health of our constituents.</p>

	<p pid="b.1322.1/1">Amendment No. 8 would delete part 1 of the Bill in its entirety, which would force the Government and&mdash;dare I say it?&mdash;Her Majesty's official Opposition to think again.</p>
	<p pid="b.1322.1/2">This evening, we have heard a series of arguments shot full of inconsistencies. In <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1743" name="Steve Webb">his peroration, the hon. Member for Northavon (Steve Webb)</phrase> said that he would vote for a total ban. Oh no he will not&mdash;a total ban is not on the agenda. If hon. Members on both sides of the House believe that smoking is so bad for one's health, that those who work bars, restaurants and private clubs suffer so much, and that 95 per cent. of the damage done by secondary smoking is done in the home and only 5 per cent. in other locations, surely, without looking too closely at the emperor's clothes, the argument must be that smoking should be banned altogether. People who do not adopt that approach are a little bit pregnant, and they must decide how far they are prepared to go down that ludicrous road.</p>
	<p pid="b.1322.1/3">I do not smoke and I am asthmatic, but I believe that while the law of the land says that smoking is legal, the British public&mdash;the English public&mdash;should have the choice whether to smoke in smoking clubs, pubs and restaurants. They should also have the choices not to smoke in non-smoking clubs, pubs and restaurants and whether to work in such establishments. I do not know a single employee who has had a gun held to their head and been told, &quot;You must go and work in that pub, where they allow smoking.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1322.1/4">There is an answer but it is not on offer, which is why those Members who support amendment No. 8 want to delete part 1 of the Bill and make the House think again. The answer is that every drinking establishment, club, restaurant and pub is licensed to sell alcohol, and it does not take a great leap of imagination to work out that it is possible to licence every pub, club and restaurant to be either smoking or non-smoking. The public and employees would then choose which type of establishment they want to patronise, and they will choose smoke or smoke-free. I have no problem with making the installation of cleansing equipment a condition of obtaining a smoking licence. It has been said in this House this evening that air conditioning does   not work, but we are not talking about air conditioning&mdash;we are talking about air purification. Air purification systems do work. It is eminently reasonable to say that if a publican wants to have a smoking pub he should invest in the machinery that will keep the air clean for the benefit of the staff.</p>
	<p pid="b.1322.1/5">We know perfectly well that the Exchequer could not bear the cost of banning smoking, which is why there will be no smoking ban. We know that prison staff could not control prisons, which is why there will be no ban on smoking in prisons&mdash;it has nothing to do with the health of the prison staff. The debate to date has reeked of hypocrisy, and we need to get some common sense and consistency into it. I urge the House to dismiss this whole package and think again.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-02-14b.1323.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1886" speakername="David Clelland" colnum="1323"  time="017:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060214/debtext/60214-18.htm#60214-18_spnew7">
	<p pid="b.1323.0/1">I support the case for excluding private members' clubs from the ban. I am grateful to Ministers for giving all Members the opportunity to vote for a number of options, but I want to emphasise that clubs are different. That was outlined in the guidance issued under section 182 of the Licensing Act 2003, which states at paragraph 9.2:</p>
	<p pid="b.1323.0/2" class="indent">&quot;The 2003 Act recognises that premises, to which public access is restricted and where alcohol is supplied other than for profit, give rise to different issues for licensing law than those presented by commercial enterprises selling direct to the public.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1323.0/3">It says that those premises include</p>
	<p pid="b.1323.0/4" class="indent">&quot;Labour, Conservative and Liberal Clubs, the Royal British Legion, other ex-services clubs, working men's clubs, miners welfare institutions, social and sports clubs.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1323.0/5">Every one of us has several such establishments in our constituencies. The guidance acknowledges that</p>
	<p pid="b.1323.0/6" class="indent">&quot;the premises are considered private and not generally open to the public&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.1323.0/7">It goes on to say:</p>
	<p pid="b.1323.0/8" class="indent">&quot;The Secretary of State wishes to emphasise that non-profit making clubs make an important and traditional contribution to the life of many communities in England and Wales and bring significant benefits. Their activities also take place on premises to which the public do not generally have access and they operate under codes of discipline applying to members and their guests.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1323.0/9">I am not a smoker, but I do not like smoke blowing in my face from smokers sitting nearby any more than anyone else does. Nor am I opposed to a ban on smoking in private members' clubs. However, I believe that the decision on whether to ban it should be for the members of that club to make. That is the important principle that I wish to pursue.</p>
	<p pid="b.1323.0/10">I do not refute the health arguments, although there is a great deal of exaggeration in that regard, particularly when hon. Members accuse club members of killing their staff. That is a little over <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1873" name="Roger Gale">the top. As the hon. Member for North Thanet (Mr. Gale)</phrase> pointed out, the Bill does not make smoking illegal. Smoking in private will still be legal. Unless we want to take the bull by the horns and ban smoking completely, some of the arguments smack of hypocrisy.</p>
	<p pid="b.1323.0/11">We have long maintained in this country the right of people to form private clubs in which they&mdash;the members&mdash;decide what legal activities go on. Clubs must be allowed to make those decisions for themselves and in their own time. They are democratic, non-profit-making organisations, and many of them are struggling. If this is forced upon them and they cannot make these changes in their own way and in their own time, many will close, and their staff, far from being in a smoke-free environment, will be in a work-free environment.</p>

	<p pid="b.1323.1/1">We have heard that passive smoking in the workplace kills four times as many employees a year as asbestosis. My hon. Friend would not support for one minute a club that refused to remove flaking asbestos that posed a hazard to its staff. That would not be a matter for democratic decision for club members&mdash;it would have to be done. Why does he not apply the same standards to a health hazard that is more dangerous to the staff of clubs?</p>

	<p pid="b.1324.0/1">We are not considering the Health and Safety at Work, etc. Act 1974, but the Health Bill. If the Government want to pursue the issue in the way that my hon. Friend suggests, the health and safety legislation should be amended. I repeat that if smoking is so lethal, it should be banned completely. What is the case for not doing that other than perhaps the case for the Revenue, which is important to any Government?</p>

	<p pid="b.1324.1/1">My hon. Friend said that he was not opposed in principle to private members clubs banning smoking. The Secretary of State said that if an exemption were made for private members clubs, an annual vote would be insisted upon. If such a vote is held annually, should it be conducted by a postal ballot of all club members or at an annual general meeting? In the case of such a vote, should people be able to reverse the decision that they made the previous year? Should they be able to change year after year?</p>

	<p pid="b.1324.2/1">I shall consider the annual vote shortly, but I will not discuss the complexities of how the ballots should take place. That is for another day. Today, we are debating the principle of the matter.</p>
	<p pid="b.1324.2/2">The licensed trade has argued that the Bill will sound the death knell of many pubs because people will move from pubs to clubs. Pubs have open access and far more freedom than clubs to introduce attractions that will bring in the public and lead to their continuing patronage. The bingo clubs and casinos claim that people will flock from them to private clubs. That is nonsense because people who patronise bingo clubs and casinos go for much bigger prizes than any working men's club could offer. They would certainly not be attracted merely by the ability to have a cigarette.</p>
	<p pid="b.1324.2/3">If, as we are told, the non-smoking population is growing and the smoking population is declining, the non-smokers may migrate from the smoking to the non-smoking establishments. Banning smoking in pubs and restaurants may benefit rather than cause problems for those places. I do not therefore accept the trade's arguments. It is worried because it erroneously believes that the measure will give non-profit-making clubs an advantage. It is concerned about its profits, not anyone's health.</p>
	<p pid="b.1324.2/4"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1743" name="Steve Webb">The hon. Member for Northavon (Steve Webb)</phrase> claimed that if exemptions were made, the Rose and Crown might turn itself into a private club. If he believes that, he does not understand the Licensing Act 2003. To become a private club, a pub has to satisfy all the conditions, including becoming a non-profit-making members' club. I do not believe that the Rose and Crown wants to be a non-profit-making establishment, so it is unlikely to become a club.</p>
	<p pid="b.1324.2/5">Many clubs already take action to restrict and even ban smoking on their premises. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1779" name="Chris Bryant">The annual ballot, which my hon. Friend the Member for Rhondda (Chris Bryant)</phrase> mentioned, will accelerate the process. They will have to consider the matter annually and I am sure that the smoking restrictions will continue. Let us not use a good Bill to erode the traditional freedoms of our private clubs and, in too many cases, threaten their existence.</p>
	<p pid="b.1324.2/6">I hope that when my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary responds to the debate she will clarify something that the Secretary of State said earlier. My right hon. Friend appeared to imply in a radio interview this morning, and in an answer that she gave me earlier, that there will be regulations to restrict smoking in any room where there is a bar. Today is the first time that we have heard that. The letter that the Secretary of State sent to clubs when the point was first queried stated:</p>
	<p pid="b.1324.2/7" class="indent">&quot;we will uphold our manifesto commitment to protect employees by prohibiting smoking in the bar area&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.1324.2/8">That is completely different. If we are to impose a ban on smoking in every room in a club where there is a bar, we may as well include clubs in the overall ban.</p>

	<p pid="b.1325.0/1">Does my hon. Friend accept that the complexity and lack of clarity to which he refers are an indication of the problems that will arise unless there is a comprehensive ban?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-02-14b.1325.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1886" speakername="David Clelland" colnum="1325"  time="017:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060214/debtext/60214-19.htm#60214-19_spnew5">
	<p pid="b.1325.1/1">I am not sure what the lack of clarity is. Clubs are dealing with those issues as we speak. There are already restrictions on smoking in the bar area and most club members uphold them. If they do not, they will not be club members for long. Clubs discipline their members if they do not stick to the rules.</p>
	<p pid="b.1325.1/2">I do not oppose&mdash;and I shall support&mdash;a smoking ban in public places, but I cannot accept that we should legislate against private members' clubs in that way. It is against all our traditions. The best answer, as in so many cases, is education rather than legislation.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-02-14b.1325.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1613" speakername="George Young" colnum="1325"  time="017:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060214/debtext/60214-19.htm#60214-19_spnew6">
	<p pid="b.1325.2/1">I want to make an extremely brief speech, as many other Members wish to speak in the debate. It was disappointing that the Secretary of State was unable to share with the House how she plans to vote on this matter. She is the Secretary of State for Health and this is one of the most important public health issues that this Parliament will debate. It would have been helpful if, under the protection of a free vote, she could have indicated to the House what her preference was among the options available to us. She said that she would listen to the debate. I have been listening to this debate for 30 years, and it would be astonishing if some new and decisive argument were to emerge in these two hours to clinch the debate one way or the other. The last time we debated this matter, she put forward a view, constrained by collective responsibility, with which we know she disagreed. Against that background, and with the protection of a free vote, it would have been helpful if she had been able to tell us her views on this occasion.</p>
	<p pid="b.1325.2/2">I want to pay tribute to the work of the Select Committee. It was courageous of the Committee to confront head on a pledge in the Government's manifesto, six months after the general election. The role of the Select Committee has been decisive in this debate and it is a model of what Select Committees should do. It detected an argument that had unsound foundations, exposed it, then produced a clear, unambiguous, unanimous report that has been of enormous assistance to the House.</p>
	<p pid="b.1325.2/3">I want to pick up a point made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1677" name="David Taylor">the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor)</phrase>, and I make no apology for raising the West Lothian question. In the Standing Committee, we had a vote on whether the distinction between pubs that serve food and those that do not should be removed. The Government won by one vote, that of a Scottish Member whose constituents will have the benefit of a comprehensive ban. His vote was decisive at that stage in ensuring that my constituents would not have the benefit of such a ban. At some point, the Government will have to address that issue, because it is going to recur time and again.</p>
	<p pid="b.1325.2/4">I hope that, at the end of this debate, Parliament will send out the clear signal that smoking is a harmful activity that it wishes to discourage. My concern, however, is that we are about to remove one indefensible distinction, namely, the distinction between pubs that serve food and those that do not, with another indefensible distinction, namely, that between pubs and clubs. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1789" name="Kevin Barron">the right hon. Member for Rother Valley (Mr. Barron)</phrase> has just explained in his excellent speech, no public health argument, no employment argument and no public nuisance argument can be used to distinguish private clubs from pubs. He also explained that the barrier between a private club and a pub is a very narrow one&mdash;a &pound;3 subscription will give access to a wide range of clubs. The tobacco industry wants a confused signal to emerge from Parliament that smoking is an activity that can be validated in certain circumstances. It would be much better to send a clear message that people can, of course, smoke in private but that smoking in a public place is something that Parliament wishes to discourage.</p>

Friends who feel that there is something about being in the Conservative party that means that they should not vote for a ban. The Conservative party has a long history of taking public health seriously. Crash helmets were made compulsory for motor cyclists under a Conservative Government.

When the Divisions are called, I shall, without any hesitation at all, vote with the right hon. Member for Rother Valley.</p>

	<p pid="b.1326.4/1">It is always a great pleasure to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1613" name="George Young">the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir George Young)</phrase>. I wish that he had also mentioned the historic connection between the beer industry and the Conservative party, but apart from that he made some excellent points. I do not want to repeat them, but I want to emulate him by being brief.</p>
	<p pid="b.1326.4/2">We should celebrate the fact that this matter is being decided on a free vote. That is good for Parliament. I know that we cannot resist the temptation to revert to type by teasing Ministers about this, but it is good that we should approach issues in this way and that Ministers should, quite legitimately, take different views on a matter of judgment. We cannot both celebrate the free vote and attack Ministers for doing that. The more that we can decide issues in this way, the better it will be for Parliament, and not just because it is sometimes politically convenient.</p>
	<p pid="b.1326.4/3">It is a good thing that we are going to ban smoking in public places tonight, but it is extraordinary that we did not do it a long time ago. It is such an obvious public health measure and Parliament should have turned its attention to it long ago. My only dissent from what is being proposed&mdash;I do not think that it will be tested in the Division Lobby&mdash;is that we could have taken a much simpler approach from the beginning. We should simply have proposed to separate the smokers from the non-smokers. The distinctions that the Government originally introduced were not sustainable. The idea that we should distinguish between pubs that served food and those that did not had no foundation in any public health argument. Nor do I believe that the distinction between pubs and clubs is sustainable. Some hon. Members have argued forcefully about the freedom involved in private members' clubs being allowed to do their own thing, but that argument is trumped by the view that basic protections should be afforded to the workers involved, and that overrides the distinction. Those workers would not have the freedom not to be exposed to other people's smoke.</p>
	<p pid="b.1326.4/4">Those distinctions must fall away, but it would have been easier to carry public opinion with us on this by adopting a simpler approach, such as the introduction of some kind of physical segregation in all kinds of premises between the smoking area and the small non-smoking area. I would have imposed onerous conditions on the smoking area involving physical separation and the sealing of rooms, and allowing no children, food or drink. I might have added provisions about sophisticated ventilation equipment&mdash;</p>

That approach would have carried public opinion with it. What we do tonight must have clarity and enforceability, and it must have public support. There would have been a simpler way of doing this, as I have just outlined, and we must ensure that clarity, simplicity and enforceability are at the heart of these provisions.</p>

I am delighted that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1476" name="Andrew Lansley">my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley)</phrase> is lending his support to it. The amendment has come as quite a surprise to many of my right hon. and hon. Friends, because they did not realise that the coercive powers that the Government are taking under clause 5 include the power to ban smoking in private motor vehicles. It would be wrong in principle to do such a thing, as well as totally impractical. I have yet to hear the Government offer any defence for taking this power, and, in the absence of any such defence, I hope that the whole House will support my amendment.</p>
	<p pid="b.1327.2/2">I also want to address the issue of prisons. The Government line is that smoking is bad for our health and that of those around us.

It strikes me as totally inconsistent to take freedom to smoke away from those who are not prisoners, while allowing it to remain for those who are.

	<p pid="b.1328.5/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1873" name="Roger Gale">My hon. Friend the Member for North Thanet (Mr. Gale)</phrase> referred to amendment No 8, which I support enthusiastically. It seems that those of us who feel as he does about the legislation will have to vote against new clause 5. The important point is that health and safety law already applies to secondary smoke in workplaces, and the Bill is therefore unnecessary if it is designed to look after the health and well-being of people in the workplace.</p>
	<p pid="b.1328.5/3">The market is already operating to provide a range of options for the general public of smoke-free and smoke-filled premises. In a hotel, it is possible to stay in a smoke-filled bedroom or in one that is non-smoking. That shows that the market is working. The tyranny of the intolerant should not be allowed to prevail over the freedoms of the minority.</p>
	<p pid="b.1328.5/4">I have never smoked, and despite the provocation from the Government, I do not intend to start now; but smoking is a legal activity. If hon. Members want to outlaw it, let us have a prohibition Bill. Until that time, let us trust the people and the market.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-02-14b.1329.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1402" speakername="Alasdair McDonnell" colnum="1329"  time="018:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060214/debtext/60214-20.htm#60214-20_spnew12">
	<p pid="b.1329.0/1">I too will be brief, or as brief as I can be. I think we could generate an awful lot of nonsense. Perhaps I should apologise, as someone from Northern Ireland, because the Under-Secretary of State for Nor<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1800" name="Shaun Woodward">thern Ireland, the hon. Member for St. Helens, South (Mr. Woodward)</phrase>, has relieved us of responsibility: he has done the wise thing, and provided for a total ban in a few months' time. I hope that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1613" name="George Young">the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir George Young)</phrase> will allow my vote tonight in favour of a stronger ban to cancel out the irresponsible vote of someone else.</p>
	<p pid="b.1329.0/2">Smoking is a killer. Smoking maims people. Smoking cripples people. There is a whole spectrum of damage that smoking cigarettes&mdash;smoking tobacco&mdash;does to people. It is the single greatest cause of serious morbidity and mortality, and one of the single greatest burdens on the national health service owing to the illness that it causes. Others have spoken on the subject, and I do not want to go into the details of the damage to lungs, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and emphysema. Smoking does even more damage to the cardiovascular system. There is brain damage, stroke damage and all the rest. We could split hairs on whether we stop that a little bit, a bigger bit or completely, which is as far as we can go. By &quot;completely&quot; I mean stopping smoking in public places completely; I do not accept that there can be an absolute ban on smoking, although I should like to see the day when that might happen.</p>
	<p pid="b.1329.0/3">Excuses are being made in relation to private spaces: clubs, private homes and vehicles. I do not think that anyone would suggest that people should be allowed to grow cannabis in their private homes or private spaces, and put it to whatever use they like, including the corruption of younger people. The reality is that smoking is damaging, and we in the House have a responsibility to ensure that the amount of damage it is allowed to do is limited.</p>
	<p pid="b.1329.0/4">Apart from the damage that smoking does to people, the cost to the national health service is awful. Smoking is crippling the NHS. As a result of the smoking that has taken place over the past 25 or 30 years, we shall have a legacy&mdash;a mortgage&mdash;of debt hanging over us for the next 30 years, until we remove smoking, reduce smoking or control smoking.</p>
	<p pid="b.1329.0/5">Before I came to the House I was a GP. Smoking, the damage done by it and the challenges involved in stopping presented me with one of my own greatest challenges. Trying to stop smoking is a difficult issue: it all comes down to individuals. A GP can do anything he likes to help people, but the biggest pitfall is what happens on a Friday or a Saturday night, or at the football match at the weekend. When there is a social occasion, people slip back on to the cigarettes. We must ensure that we give those people as much support as possible.</p>
	<p pid="b.1329.0/6">The southern Irish experience has been extremely positive. Faults can be found in it: there are breaches of the law, and people stand outside bars smoking&mdash;but even that has turned into a benefit, because matches are now being made outside the pub rather than inside. There is a smokers' club outside the door. Let us be serious, however. The Irish experience has worked. Smoking is down, and good public health is rising. It will be many years before that shows its full benefit, but I appeal to Members for God's sake to give people a chance. People are struggling to give up cigarettes. Most sensible people who are smokers want to stop smoking, and want us to help them to stop. We should not put any further obstacles or difficulties in their way.</p>

	<p pid="b.1330.0/1">It is a great pleasure to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1402" name="Alasdair McDonnell">the hon. Member for Belfast, South (Dr. McDonnell)</phrase>, another member of the medical profession.</p>
	<p pid="b.1330.0/2">I pay tribute to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1789" name="Kevin Barron">the right hon. Member for Rother Valley (Mr. Barron)</phrase>, who chaired the Health Committee while it produced two extremely strong and useful reports. I am delighted to see that the Secretary of State has returned. She said that she had not yet made up her mind. I am rat<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1613" name="George Young">her more naive than the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir George Young)</phrase>, and I believe that we could persuade some Members who have the luxury of a free vote to change their mind.</p>
	<p pid="b.1330.0/3">I speak as unofficial, unappointed, unelected medical adviser to the House. Even the youngest Members may have the beginning of coronary artery atheroma, that terrible condition that narrows the coronary arteries and leads relentlessly to heart attacks, usually in later life but often in relative youth. I think everyone knows that the risk factors we recognise are smoking, diabetes, a poor family history and hypertension; but we all know people in none of those categories who, out of the blue, have dropped dead of a heart attack, or have had a severe heart attack. Without those risk factors, each one of us could be sitting on our own particular time bomb.</p>
	<p pid="b.1330.0/4">Those of us who have reached my age do not play squash and the like because it is known that sudden exertion is one of the precipitating factors, but it is not generally known that passive smoking is also an acute precipitating factor. The atheroma builds up over the years. We have in our blood things called platelets, which normally help the blood to clot in the right place; but, according to a booklet from the Royal College of Physicians,</p>
	<p pid="b.1330.0/5" class="indent">&quot;Platelets are very sensitive to the effects of tobacco smoke, and experimental studies have shown that smoking one or two cigarettes per day has a similar effect on platelet aggregation to that seen in non-smokers exposed to environmental tobacco smoke for 20 minutes.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1330.0/6">Platelets aggregate. They lump together. They increase the atheroma, increase the blockage, and possibly cause a complete occlusion. As has been said, the risks of cancer of the lung are linear, but that does not apply to the risks of coronary artery disease. So the ban on smoking in public places must be extended to all workplaces. It is no good saying that 99 per cent., or even 99.9 per cent., of people are protected; the last fraction of a per cent. deserve equal protection.</p>
	<p pid="b.1330.0/7">I want briefly to consider particulates&mdash;the tiny bits held in the smoke exhaled by smokers and, even worse, in the side-stream smoke that drifts away from the end of a cigarette as the smoker wafts it casually in the hand. A particle labelled as PM2.5&mdash;the label denotes its size, which is 2.5 microns&mdash;can get right into the lungs and is responsible for a lot of damage. Dr. Richard Edwards, a senior lecturer in public health from Manchester, told the Health Committee on 20 October about a study in the north-west that compared the level of PM2.5 found on heavy traffic roads with that found in smoky pubs. Some 20 to 50 micrograms per cu m were found on heavy traffic roads, but 1,400 micrograms per cu m were found in smoky pubs&mdash;28 times the former level. He concluded:</p>
	<p pid="b.1330.0/8" class="indent">&quot;So when you are talking about exposure from particles which are known to affect health, and there are plenty of studies to show that particulate matter affects health, some of the places where you get the very greatest exposure is in the indoor environment in smoky pubs&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.1330.0/9">If we exempt clubs, we will drive smokers to them and they will become even more lethal.</p>

	<p pid="b.1331.0/1">I am very grateful to my esteemed medical colleague for giving way on this important point. Does he therefore agree that because ventilation systems cannot remove these particulates in sufficient quantities, simply ventilating a pub's atmosphere will not reduce them to a safe level? He is therefore right to say that a total ban is the only credible way forward.</p>

	<p pid="b.1331.1/1">I thank my hon. Friend&mdash;I will call him my hon. Friend, even though he is on the other side of the House&mdash;for that intervention, with which I entirely agree. The Health Committee heard conclusive evidence to suggest that it is not possible to ventilate pubs in an affordable way. The comparison was made with operating theatres, but they have air conditioning systems with positive pressure, which blows everything out to prevent germs from coming in. Such a system cannot be replicated in pubs and clubs.</p>
	<p pid="b.1331.1/2">I conclude with two quotes. When, at last November's &quot;Britain against cancer&quot; conference, the head of Glasgow university's centre for oncology was asked what his single greatest wish was in respect of cancer prevention, he said:</p>
	<p pid="b.1331.1/3" class="indent">&quot;The key long-term priority is to limit smoking&mdash;everything else is lip service.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1331.1/4">Professor Dame Carol Black, the president of the Royal College of Physicians, told the Health Committee:</p>
	<p pid="b.1331.1/5" class="indent">&quot;There is nothing that this government could do for health that would be better than to actually bring in this ban, absolutely nothing.&quot;</p>

	<p pid="b.1331.2/1">It is a great pleasure to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1949" name="Richard Taylor">the hon. Member for Wyre Forest (Dr. Taylor)</phrase>; I was feeling quite healthy until he spoke.</p>
	<p pid="b.1331.2/2">Once in a political generation, one gets the chance, if one is lucky enough to sit on these Benches, to vote for a public health measure that will affect the health of    thousands&mdash;perhaps hundreds of thousands&mdash;of members of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1613" name="George Young">our society. As the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir George Young)</phrase> reminded us, no political party in this House has a monopoly on such measures. I am thinking here of the public health Acts of the 19th century, of the sewerage legislation, and of the clean air legislation of the 1950s and 1960s. The most successful of the Acts passed by our predecessors ended discussion about that topic for a generation. The legislation was clear and simple and it established a political settlement. We have a similar opportunity before us today.</p>
	<p pid="b.1331.2/3">I share the ambition of the hon. Member for Wyre Forest to persuade the Secretary of State to go that little bit further and to complete what is unfinished business. I hope to speak directly to her today, because the issue is clubs against pubs: should we extend the ban to members' clubs, as well as pubs? We have heard that 150,000 people, if not more, work in members' clubs, and I have always felt that the health of a bar worker in a club is every bit as important as that of a bar worker in a pub. Some Members have suggested that perhaps bar workers should change jobs if they do not like the premises that they work in. That shows a lack of understanding of the bars and clubs in our communities. In some communities, it is not easy for such workers to get another job.</p>

	<p pid="b.1332.0/1">Much has been made of the employee's ability to choose whether or not to work in a pub or a club. If private clubs are excluded from this legislation, when someone who is offered a job in a club refuses to take it, they would rightly be denied any social security benefits whatsoever. So where is the choice?</p>

	<p pid="b.1332.1/1">I agree entirely with my hon. Friend. The House has a responsibility to provide some certainty tonight. If we exempt clubs, we will be faced with years of legal action. Indeed, the Joint Committee on Human Rights suggested that if we distinguish between members' clubs and pubs, we may face legal action from bar workers in clubs, trade unions and so on. Businesses and clubs need certainty.</p>
	<p pid="b.1332.1/2">I have been telephoned, in my role as chairman of the all-party group on beer, by licensees from all over the country. I shall give just two examples, which happen to come from Doncaster and Leicester. The licensee of the Rockingham Arms, in Doncaster, told me that his pub is opposite the Comrades club, which is a social club near Doncaster race course, and that all he wants is a fair bat and ball&mdash;the chance to compete with it on equal terms. Of course, many of his regulars are also members of the club. We have to face the fact that the likely flow of traffic will be smokers shifting from pubs to the clubs of which they are a member. If we pass an exemption for clubs in this House tonight, it will constitute a St. Valentine's day massacre of many pubs. Pubs will close up and down the land and Members will have to face not just their licensees, but the darts team and the football team that has nowhere to go. Some pub charity Christmas raffles will no longer take place. Pubs are a vital part of our local community.</p>

	<p pid="b.1332.3/1">On health and safety grounds alone, we must face the reality of the situation. According to an American study, a non-smoking bar worker in a pub has a 20 times greater risk of developing cancer than a non-smoking bar worker in a non-smoking environment. We must be cognisant of that fact.</p>
	<p pid="b.1332.3/2">I want to address <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1476" name="Andrew Lansley">the remarks made by the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley)</phrase>, in case I can persuade him, as well as my own Front Benchers, of my argument. I have always regarded him as the epitome of modern Conservatism, which involves a belief in simple regulation and market forces. It therefore beggars belief that he is advocating a very complicated regulatory system involving local authority inspectors visiting clubs to see whether children are present, and which will lead to many of our pubs being unable to compete on equal terms with clubs.</p>

	<p pid="b.1333.0/1">Does the hon.

Member for Tewkesbury (Mr. Robertson)</phrase>&mdash;my constituency neighbour&mdash;is that a truly comprehensive ban would reduce demand for smoking overall? The RCP pointed out that the comprehensive ban in Ireland led to a</p>
	<p pid="b.1333.0/2" class="indent">&quot;statistically significant increase in the percentage of smokers who banned smoking in their own homes after the smoke-free law was introduced&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.1333.0/3">So the more comprehensive the ban, the fewer the people who smoke, even at home, which is outside the scope of the ban.</p>

	<p pid="b.1333.1/1">We all know people who, having given up smoking, are tempted to start again every time that they go into a club or a pub. In Dublin and elsewhere in Ireland, the number of households with a smoker has decreased considerably since the ban was imposed. So I appeal to all Members to go the extra step and pass a historic public health measure that bans smoking in all workplaces. I appeal especially to my hon. Friends, who have an instinct towards public health and the protection of staff. Do they really want to go back to their constituencies and say that on one of the only genuinely free votes that we are likely to have in this Parliament, they took the advice of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence&mdash;someone for whom I have great respect? I urge hon. Members to vote for a comprehensive ban and a smoke-free England.</p>

	<p pid="b.1333.2/1">I have thrown away my speech and will aim to speak for less than five minutes. We need to focus on one point. It is accepted that secondary smoke is dangerous. Workers need to be protected from that, so a comprehensive ban is necessary. However, we also accept that workers will be exposed to some secondary smoke, when they go outside pubs to collect the glasses.</p>
	<p pid="b.1333.2/2">Amendment No. 10 is a probing amendment to see whether the Government wish to consider whether it is possible to license, through local authorities, rooms&mdash;I accept that it is not possible to ventilate a whole pub&mdash;that could be ventilated to keep the level of secondary smoke below that outside <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1418" name="Lynne Jones">the pub. Apart from the hon. Member for Birmingham, Selly Oak (Lynne Jones)</phrase>, we accept that people will smoke outside pubs, in the gardens. The question is whether it is possible to bring the level of secondary smoke in a room in the pub below the level found outside.</p>
	<p pid="b.1333.2/3">Unintended consequences will arise from a comprehensive ban. The evidence from Ireland is that the consumption of tobacco fell by some 5 per cent. as a result of the ban. The actual fall was some 9 or 10 per cent. but the trend is downwards anyway. However, smoking is still going on somewhere. By introducing the ban we will move people around, but we will mostly not stop people smoking. If we could achieve a situation in which the concentration of secondary smoke in the atmosphere is below a certain level under certain circumstances&mdash;as we accept it will be outside the pub&mdash;why not allow smoking rooms, on a licensed basis, within the pub?</p>

	<p pid="b.1334.0/1">In November, I wrote to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health and said that I could not in conscience support the then Government position of a partial ban that would not allow smoking in licensed premises where food was served. I sent a copy to my right hon. Friend the Chief Whip. I congratulate both of them on the decision that we should have a free vote on an issue that may be the most important public health decision that will be made by the Government in this Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="b.1334.0/2">I have tried to assess the number of lives that could be lost if we had a partial rather than a full ban. The Jamrozik article in the British Medical J<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1476" name="Andrew Lansley">ournal, mentioned by the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1789" name="Kevin Barron">my right hon. Friend the Member for Rother Valley (Mr. Barron)</phrase>, states that 617 people die from passive smoking in the workplace each year on average and that some 54 of them work in the hospitality industry. If around one in three licensed premises were exempt from a smoking ban, around 20 people would lose their lives every year. That loss of life can be avoided if we choose a full ban.</p>
	<p pid="b.1334.0/3">I have spoken to the Health and Safety Executive to try to make comparisons with other industrial hazards. Some 37 people die each year from falling from a great height, such as building workers falling from inadequately erected scaffolding. A club would not use the freedom of individual members to make a decision to agree to save money by putting up faulty scaffolding, thus putting at risk the lives of people who work for that club. They should not do the same with their employees by permitting smoking to continue.</p>
	<p pid="b.1334.0/4">On the railways, seven workers died in line-side accidents in the most recent year for which I have been able to obtain figures. One would not say that wearing an orange bib and abiding by the railway inspectorate's safety regulations should be a matter of personal choice for a railway company or employee. We have health and safety rules to protect people, and we should protect people working in private clubs in the same way as we propose to protect those working in other licensed premises, such as restaurants and pubs.</p>
	<p pid="b.1334.0/5">To those private clubs that wish to retain the right for people to smoke&mdash;by no means all of them, since two private bingo clubs in my constituency have asked me to support a comprehensive ban&mdash;I would say that they will put off more people coming in through the smoky atmosphere than will be encouraged in by permitting smoking. The legal pressures that are likely to come on club committee members from the families of employees who suffer illness or death as a result of passive smoking should make them think again. I urge all hon. Members, including my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health, to choose a consistent policy, protect employees in restaurants, pubs and clubs in the same way, and vote for amendments (a), (b), (c) and (d).</p>

	<p pid="b.1335.0/1">Amendment No. 36 accepts that there may be a case for banning smoking in certain public places, but excludes pubs, restaurants and clubs and, indeed, the home. I declare that I am a smoker, but I consider myself to be a considerate smoker. I would not want to smoke in anyone's car, house or office, or even in their company, unless they were happy with that or smoked themselves. It is because I am a considerate smoker that I find the proposed measures intolerant, not to mention illiberal and belonging to the nanny state.</p>
	<p pid="b.1335.0/2">I understand the right of people not to inhale the smoke that I exhale, but there is no reason why the rights of both smokers and non-smokers cannot be accommodated. We already have non-smoking pubs springing up all over the place: there are some in my constituency. We have many pubs that are mixed, with smoking areas and non-smoking areas, and we have pubs that are smoking throughout. We hear from hon. Members on both sides that there is a great demand for non-smoking pubs, and if that is so, the free market, which I thought new Labour believed in these days, will deliver those pubs and everybody will be happy.</p>
	<p pid="b.1335.0/3">It is my contention that the person best placed to decide whether or not to have smoking in his establishment is the pub landlord or the restaurateur, with due regard to his staff and customers. I do not accept that a ban would not lead to an increase in smoking at home, and I am disappointed that so much concern is rightly expressed for the welfare and health of workers, but that few of those who make such protestations have talked about the rights of children in the home. Are they not to be protected? I am convinced that more people will smoke at home than at present, but we do not seek to protect the rights of children.</p>

	<p pid="b.1335.2/1">I am sorry, but I do not have time.</p>
	<p pid="b.1335.2/2">Many staff in pubs smoke themselves and many small country pubs will be threatened by the ban. We hear, especially from Labour Members who oppose an exemption for private clubs, that people will flock from the pubs into such clubs. The logical conclusion of that argument is that there is a great demand for pubs that allow smoking, and many of them are small pubs in country areas. Along with the post offices and shops in country areas, they will be under threat. The landlord and landlady of the local inn in my home village of Twyning both smoke. They do not employ any staff, so why should they be covered by the ban? That would be totally intolerant.</p>
	<p pid="b.1335.2/3">The logical conclusion of the health argument is that the Government should ban smoking altogether. Smoking-related diseases cost the NHS &pound;1.8 billion year. That is a fair amount, but rather insignificant when compared with the &pound;8.1 billion that smokers put into the Exchequer every year. That explains the Government's hypocrisy in refusing to ban smoking entirely&mdash;it is due to money.</p>
	<p pid="b.1335.2/4">Of course I share concerns about staff who work in smoky establishments when they do not want to. However, jobs in the catering industry are very difficult to fill. That is why so many illegal immigrants are employed in catering. Other people have the option to go and work elsewhere. We talk about people working in smoky atmospheres, but what about those who work in coal mines or with dangerous chemicals or hazardous waste? Those problems have all been ignored today, and that is because they are difficult to deal with. However, if we were being consistent, we would be considering them as well.</p>
	<p pid="b.1335.2/5">I have been asked to keep my remarks brief&mdash;<i>[Interruption.]</i> It is a pity that Labour Members did not do the same and that their arguments were not more consistent. I shall end by saying that this is a very illiberal and totally unnecessary measure. We can protect people's health without this draconian legislation.</p>
	<p pid="b.1335.2/6">I shall vote against the new clause. If we get that far, I hope that the House will vote for amendment No. 36, which is far more tolerant.</p>

	<p pid="b.1336.0/1">It has been quite a journey over the past eight months or so. This afternoon's debate has paralleled the discussion of the matter that has gone on in the public domain over that period. Speeches have been made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1743" name="Steve Webb">the hon. Member for Northavon (Steve Webb)</phrase>, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1789" name="Kevin Barron">my right hon. Friend the Member for Rother Valley (Mr. Barron)</phrase>, the right hon. Member for New Hampshire&mdash;<i>[Interruption.]</i> I mean <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1613" name="George Young">the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir George Young)</phrase>. In addition, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1478" name="Tony Wright">my hon. Friend the Member for Cannock Chase (Dr. Wright)</phrase>, the hon. Members for Belfast, South (Dr. McDonnell) and for Wyre Forest (Dr. Taylor), and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1807" name="John Grogan">my hon. Friends the Members for Selby (Mr. Grogan)</phrase> and for City of York (Hugh Bayley) all argued that the legislation on restricting smoking in public places should go as far as tonight's votes allow.</p>
	<p pid="b.1336.0/2">However, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1560" name="Stephen Pound">my hon. Friends the Member for Ealing, North (Stephen Pound)</phrase> and for Tyne Bridge (Mr.    Clelland), and the hon. Members for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) and for Birmingham, Yardley (John Hemming), all felt that there should be more compromise on the matter. If I heard them correctly, the hon. Members for Christchurch (Mr. Chope), for North Thanet (Mr. Gale) and for Tewkesbury (Mr.   Robertson) said that there should not be legislation in this area at all.</p>
	<p pid="b.1336.0/3">This is an historic debate. We are celebrating this week the 100th anniversary of the parliamentary Labour party. It is fair to say that many of the most challenging pieces of health legislation over the past century have been introduced in the short periods of Labour government. We hope to serve for much longer in the 21st century, but I am pleased and proud to be here this evening to endorse and put into law for the first time proposals that will restrict smoking in public places. As far as I am aware, the Opposition, despite what they say, had no intention of introducing similar measures if they had won the general election.</p>

	<p pid="b.1336.1/1">My hon. Friend has described the long path that we have followed over the past decade and more. Is she aware that it is 40 years since the lead story in the <i>Daily Mirror</i> was headlined &quot;Shock plan to ban smoking in public&quot;? There was a Labour Government at the time, and there have been at least two others in our progress to this point. It is an historic matter to get from that headline to the public health improvements that the Bill will secure.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-02-14b.1337.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1543" speakername="Caroline Flint" colnum="1337"  time="018:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060214/debtext/60214-23.htm#60214-23_spnew1">
	<p pid="b.1337.0/1">It is another triumph of this new Labour Government.</p>
	<p pid="b.1337.0/2">I turn now to the specifics of the amendments. Amendment (b) deals with specialist tobacconists, for which I said in Committee I was minded to include an exemption. However, that should be tackled in regulations. I reject amendment No. 8, which would remove clauses 1 to 12, as that would effectively kill the premise on which the Bill is based. The view of the public is increasingly that we should take legal measures to restrict smoking in public places.</p>
	<p pid="b.1337.0/3">The hon. Member for Christchurch mentioned prisons. We are working with the Home Office to determine how to make progress in that respect, but I remind the House that some prisons are smoke-free. Prisons are places of detainment and also residence, so we must strike a balance.</p>
	<p pid="b.1337.0/4">The hon. Member for Birmingham, Yardley tabled amendment No. 10, which would permit local authorities to license and designate premises. The Government believe that a piecemeal approach is inappropriate, as we want a national approach to creating smoke-free places. That is the ideal, but I give credit to those local authorities around the country who have campaigned strongly and made their views known to the Government.</p>
	<p pid="b.1337.0/5">Several hon. Members spoke about amendment No. 6, which deals with private vehicles. Six Standing Committee sittings were devoted to the smoking parts of the Bill, and I made it clear that there was no intention to require vehicles in exclusively private use to be smoke-free. Clause 5(2)(d) makes provision for regulations that may exempt classes of vehicles, including private or rental cars hired for private use. The Bill's regulation-making powers are more than adequate to exempt vehicles for private use.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-02-14b.1337.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1543" speakername="Caroline Flint" colnum="1337"  time="018:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060214/debtext/60214-23.htm#60214-23_spnew3">
	<p pid="b.1337.2/1">No, but the hon. Gentleman can see me later. We can talk about the regulations. <i>[Laughter.]</i></p>
	<p pid="b.1337.2/2">Amendment No. 36 is hard to understand. It seems to be intended to limit the premises that may be exempted from smoke-free legislation to those where a person has his home, or licensed premises and membership clubs. I am worried that it would remove the general regulation-making power in clause 3(1), which takes account of the fact that people who, for example, work on oil rigs are not able to smoke outdoors for reasons of safety. Likewise, if the amendment were adopted, no exemption could be made for laboratories concerned with testing tobacco products. That would mean that the tobacco companies would not be able to test their products, as the law requires.</p>
	<p pid="b.1337.2/3">Government amendment No. 24 extends the fixed-penalty notice provisions in part 1 of the Bill to the offence of failing to display no-smoking signs, in accordance with the requirements set out in regulations. However, in light of the responses that we received last year, we will add the option of a fixed-penalty notice for the offence of failing to display those signs.</p>
	<p pid="b.1337.2/4">After the debate in Committee, and as a result of lobbying from various organisations and groups, I am minded to propose that the fines for failing to display no-smoking signs should be raised from a maximum of &pound;200 to a fine not exceeding level 3, which has a maximum of &pound;1,000. I propose to raise the fine for the offence of failing to prevent smoking in smoke-free places from a maximum of &pound;200 to a maximum of &pound;2,500. That sends the strong message to those responsible for enforcing the law that they should make sure that they do so.</p>
	<p pid="b.1337.2/5">The hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire tabled amendment (i), aimed at protecting children from second-hand smoke in private members' clubs. However, I am perplexed by his argument: first he said that the members of those clubs should be able to decide what happens in their space, but then his amendment seemed to want to tell parents what they should do with their children in those private spaces. That is another demonstration of how the Conservatives are all over the place on this issue.</p>
	<p pid="b.1337.2/6">I shall finish by recapping on how the new clause and our amendments will work and the choice they offer Members&mdash;<i>[Interruption.]</i></p>

	<p pid="b.1338.0/1">Order. I am finding it increasingly difficult to hear the Minister against the buzz of conversation, which seems to be growing by the minute. May we please listen to the Minister in the last few minutes of the debate?</p>

	<p pid="b.1338.1/1">Conservative Members were shouting, &quot;Boring&quot;; I suppose that it is boring to try to save lives&mdash;[Hon. Members: &quot;Oh!&quot;] I thought that we were in a new Cameron era that was not about yah-boo politics, but there we go.</p>
	<p pid="b.1338.1/2">We have heard a wide range of arguments about the merits of the various options that the Government have proposed in the new clause and the amendments. I hope that the second reading of new clause 5 will be a formality. We shall then turn to the amendments to the new clause. As it stands, the new clause allows exemptions for membership clubs but not for licensed premises. Members who believe that private members' clubs should also be smoke-free should vote to accept the amendments tabled in my name. Those who want them to be exempted should vote against.</p>
	<p pid="b.1338.1/3">Once the amendments to the new clause have been dealt with, we shall vote on the new clause itself, either as drafted or as amended. Regardless of any amendments that may be passed, the main point of the new clause is to prevent any exemption for licensed premises so if Members believe that all pubs, bars, nightclubs and so on should be smoke-free, they should vote for new clause 5. However, if they support clause 3, they should vote against it. Amendments Nos. 18, 19, 20 and 21 are consequential to new clause 5.</p>
	<p pid="b.1338.1/4">The debate has represented a huge range of views on both sides of the House and has reflected the views held by the public.</p>

	<p pid="b.1339.1/1">We discussed that issue in Committee, and it was felt that it could be dealt with in regulations. We considered whether some areas&mdash;for example, the concourse of a railway terminus&mdash;which are substantially but not wholly enclosed, should be smoke-free. There are other examples, but we felt it right that such issues should be sorted out through regulation. They have been raised with me and others, and we shall look at them case by case.</p>

	<p pid="b.1339.3/1">The hon. Gentleman raised points about substantially enclosed and semi-enclosed premises in Committee, and I am still considering whether some of those areas, including vehicles, should be subject to affirmative resolution. We shall hold full public consultation on all aspects of the regulations, so there will be a chance for everybody in the House and outside to make their views known.</p>
	<p pid="b.1339.3/2">This week, we launched a new advertising campaign to show the impact of smoking on people's lives, especially the relatives of smokers. I am grateful that Trudi and her daughters were willing to take part in our campaign. Trudi is dying from lung cancer and, with her daughters of 17 and 11, is already making plans for her funeral. It is important that we realise that smoking affects not only the individual who smokes but those who have to breathe in their smoke as well as those who suffer the devastation of losing someone because of a smoking-related illness.</p>
	<p pid="b.1339.3/3">The adverts are harrowing and challenging, but alongside them we have launched a series of adverts to bring to our screens examples of two ordinary people who have taken up the NHS &quot;stop smoking&quot; services, which have never previously been available in that form. The Government realise that the issue is not simply about restrictions in public places, but about providing our health service with funds to help people give up in difficult circumstances, because for many of them smoking is an addiction.</p>
	<p pid="b.1339.3/4">I am proud that since 1997 we have not only taken measures to control cigarette advertising but, for the first time, provided, through the health service, opportunities for people to give up not just once but to try again if they fail. Today, we are debating legislation that will make a huge contribution to the public health of our nation. If the Bill is successful in the other place, I look forward to working with every Member of the House to ensure that in every constituency, there will be opportunities for people to take advantage of the restrictions to make choices about changing their smoking habits that will affect not just them but everybody they work or live with and everyone they care for.</p>
	<p pid="b.1339.3/5">Most Members share that aim and there is no doubt that our debates over the past eight months have contributed to a huge public debate, which is good. Often, there is not much discussion in the public domain of what we do in this place, so if that is a sign of positive democracy it is to be welcomed.</p>
	<p pid="b.1339.3/6">However, the task does not end with passing the Bill and introducing restrictions; 95 per cent. of deaths from cancer are among people exposed to smoking in the home. The Bill is not the end of something, but the start of trying to persuade smokers to give up and to give them every possible support.</p>
	<p pid="b.1339.3/7">I am pleased that Members on the Opposition Front Benches have moved on the issue&mdash;<i>[Interruption.]</i> The Tory manifesto was against bringing in legislation, so there has been another period of reflection and consultation. It is always pleasing when the Tories chase Labour to catch up on progressive politics.</p>

	<p pid="b.1354.2/1">We come to a number of minor and consequential amendments. I know that there will be interest in later debates, so I hope we need not spend too long on them but my experience in Committee was that Opposition Members liked a brief Government explanation of the purpose of amendments.</p>
	<p pid="b.1354.2/2">New clause 7 and amendments Nos. 30 to 32 have a simple objective: to ensure full and proper enforcement of the responsible pharmacist provisions. They do so by placing a specific duty on the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain and the Pharmaceutical Society of Northern Ireland to enforce those elements of section 72A of the Medicines Act 1968 that are not subject to an offence as a matter of professional misconduct.</p>
	<p pid="b.1354.2/3">Clause 28, by inserting a new section 72A into the Medicines Act 1968, sets out the detailed provisions in respect of the responsible pharmacist. We debated this at some length in Committee. The responsible pharmacist has a statutory duty to ensure the safe and effective running of the pharmacy for which he or she is responsible. Breach of certain conditions in respect of the responsible pharmacist is an offence, such as the failure to keep a record of who is the responsible pharmacist for a pharmacy at all times.</p>
	<p pid="b.1354.2/4">Other aspects of the responsible pharmacist requirements are less clear. For example, it is less clear where responsibility lies for the content of the standard operating procedures and how those requirements would be enforced. These more readily lend themselves to enforcement by the pharmaceutical societies through professional regulation. The amendments make it clear on the face of the Bill that the pharmaceutical societies have that duty of enforcement, and that it applies wherever the registered pharmacy is located, whether in a hospital or in the community. Furthermore, the amendments to sections 108 for England and Wales, 109 for Scotland and 110 for Northern Ireland of the Medicines Act clarify that the appropriate Minister in those areas does not have a duty to enforce those provisions that are not subject to offences. However, they give the appropriate Minister a right of entry to inspect and investigate in relation to the other provisions in section 72A.</p>
	<p pid="b.1354.2/5">Amendment No. 25 on controlled drugs is minor and technical. Amendment No. 26 on ophthalmic services is a minor and consequential amendment. With those few words of introduction, I hope that the House will be minded to accept the amendments, so that we can move on and spend longer on the more pressing debates later.</p>

	<p pid="b.1355.3/1">I think that the Minister was expecting me to hold forth on the previous group of amendments and I am sorry, especially after our experience in Committee, to disappoint her on this occasion, but it is Valentine's day, after all.</p>
	<p pid="b.1355.3/2">This is an important group of amendments. We discussed health care-acquired infections, particularly MRSA, at some length in Committee, though we were disappointed that the time available did not allow us to explore as fully as we would have liked all the clauses following those related to the ban on smoking. Nevertheless, we covered a great deal of ground.</p>
	<p pid="b.1355.3/3">The Minister is, I expect, acutely aware of the toll that health care-acquired infections take in the United Kingdom. We reckon that about 5,000 people are killed every year and the statisticians tell us that that is more than the number killed on our roads, so it is a substantial problem. In addition, there are the people whose recovery is impeded as a result of health care-acquired infections but who, fortunately, do recover. The cost to the national health service is enormous. Some estimate that it is around &pound;1 billion a year, so this is a big issue, and it is appropriate that Ministers should take the opportunity to try to improve matters in the course of the Health Bill.</p>

	<p pid="b.1356.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend on the words that he has just uttered. Is there not a third category of people who need hospital treatment&mdash;I am thinking of elderly people in particular&mdash;but who are very worried about the reports that they read about MRSA and other hospital-acquired infections? Such people may not pick up any infections, but the stress and strain they undergo as they await their hospital appointment is often intolerable.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-02-14b.1356.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1922" speakername="Andrew Murrison" colnum="1356"  time="019:19:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060214/debtext/60214-28.htm#60214-28_spnew3">
	<p pid="b.1356.1/1">My hon. Friend is correct. Like me, he will have had constituency experience of the worry involved. People who face the possibility of going to hospital often volunteer the fact that they are worried about it. As I pointed out in Committee, I usually go to some lengths to put the matter in some sort of perspective. Although it is a substantial problem&mdash;I hope that the figures that I have given underscore that&mdash;the chances of somebody succumbing to such an infection are small. It is important for those of us who try to be responsible to try to reassure people wherever we can.</p>
	<p pid="b.1356.1/2">The figures speak for themselves, however, and in public health terms, 5,000 deaths a year are significant, so Ministers need to address the problem as a matter of urgency. The way in which they have chosen to do that is to introduce a code. In Committee, we were not particularly happy with the draft code, of which we were heavily critical. I am more than happy to tell the Minister that the version that has been provided more recently&mdash;very recently, I have to say; it was placed in the Library unheralded and unannounced yesterday, where we found it&mdash;is an improvement, and I am grateful for it. When we met a little while ago, the Minister said that she would let hon. Members have the revised copy as soon as possible, and she has at least given us sight of it before this debate. We must be thankful for that, although it would have been nice to have had the opportunity to examine it more closely and at a more leisurely rate.</p>
	<p pid="b.1356.1/3">Last week, we saw some updated figures for MRSA bacteraemia, of which the Minister will be well aware. The raw data for the six-month reference periods since 2001 run at 3,616, 3,584, 3,749 and 3,525. The figure for April to September 2005 is 3,580. The best interpretation of those figures is that there has been little or no change during that period; the level seems to have been pretty well flat-lining. The overall rate per thousand bed days is not entirely clear from the data, only in so far as it is specific for individual trusts. The overall rate for the health service is a little opaque. On the basis of eye-balling the results from trusts, I suspect that the overall rate per thousand bed days would probably give a worse impression of our success or otherwise with MRSA than the raw data that I have just quoted. Sadly, my statistical skills are not quite what they were, so I struggled with the figures presented to me by the Health Protection Agency, but I believe that that is a fair reflection.</p>
	<p pid="b.1356.1/4">The disparity between trusts that is apparent from the Health Protection Agency data is grounds for alarm but also hope, because it suggests that health care-acquired infection, and MRSA in particular, can be controlled. For example, the fact that Cambridgeshire and Yorkshire can do so well against the record in Somerset and London suggests that infection rates will be reduced by the adoption of best practice. Presumably, that is why the Minister has introduced the code, which is the burden of part 2, and it is also certainly the reason for our insistence that the code should be robust.</p>
	<p pid="b.1356.1/5">The question is whether the code is robust. In the short period that we have had to examine it, we have formed the view that while it is better than the draft version, it is not quite as robust as we might have liked. On comparing amendment No. 12 and what we have said in Committee with what has transpired, we have found bits that we would commend and that improve the original draft, on which we congratulate the Minister, although we are disappointed by some elements.</p>
	<p pid="b.1356.1/6">We were pleased to note that one or two of the elements in amendment No. 12 have been reflected. Notably, there are improved lines of accountability, but we note that there is no categorical mention of a board member with specific responsibility for health care-acquired infection control. Perhaps the Minister will clarify that point, as we felt that it was important to nominate at board level somebody with specific responsibility for the matter, perhaps among other duties, and to whom those who carried out hospital policy on health care-acquired infection were responsible. That board-level responsibility is not entirely clear, although we accept that some of the changes in the revised code would improve the prominence of health care-acquired infections at such a level.</p>
	<p pid="b.1356.1/7">We have also noted that the code now refers to pre-admission screening, which we said in Committee was important, as the Minister will remember. Indeed, there is also some reference to post-discharge surveillance in certain circumstances. I imagine that that has been informed by the University College hospital work in the area, which I am happy to say has found its way into the revised draft code.</p>
	<p pid="b.1356.1/8">Other good things have appeared, such as a strong reference to occupational health in hospitals. I freely admit to my interest in the matter, as before I was elected I was a locum consultant occupational physician at the Gloucestershire Royal hospital, so I have a particular interest in occupational health. I am convinced that the health service has traditionally not done particularly well on occupational health, and I am pleased that it has a relatively high prominence in the revised code.</p>
	<p pid="b.1356.1/9">I struggled to find much reference to dealing with locum casual and agency staff in the health service. It relies heavily on such personnel, so it is important that any occupational health service captures them adequately. My experience as a locum is that people often simply come and go, and that occupational health and any control mechanisms do not touch them at all. It is important that we deal specifically with such staff. As I said in Committee&mdash;I was perhaps rather too graphic&mdash;we do not want any Typhoid Marys wandering around the health service, potentially spreading infection through bad practice or whatever. That is an omission from the code, and perhaps the Minister could reflect on it in her remarks.</p>
	<p pid="b.1356.1/10">We remain concerned about the lack of clear standards relating to a model cleaning contract, a point that we raised in Committee. Despite the strengthening of lines of accountability that I have mentioned, we are concerned about the fact that managers are still not clearly and indisputably in charge of everything that happens at ward level. I know that the Minister will regard that as a constant Opposition refrain, but we believe in it strongly. Our experience suggests that we need proper control of what goes on at ward level, and we believe that cleanliness and hospital-acquired infections are all rolled up with the lack of control that sometimes exists in our national health service.</p>
	<p pid="b.1356.1/11">We regret very much the lack of reporting of health care-acquired infections at departmental level. The Minister will remember that we spent some time on these matters, and that I described my personal experience of them. As I recall, we had a slightly light-hearted debate about the cleanliness of doctors' hospital clothing&mdash;their white coats, neckties and so on. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1397" name="Nadine Dorries">My hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Bedfordshire (Mrs. Dorries)</phrase> spoke at some length about nurses' uniforms. Departments are ultimately responsible for health care-acquired infections. The national health service is labour-intensive: it relies on its people. At the end of the day, it is people who are responsible for all the good things that happen in our NHS and, sadly, for those areas in which things are done less well.</p>
	<p pid="b.1356.1/12">Unless we focus on individuals at a level lower than that envisaged by the code, we may miss a trick in identifying less good practice that potentially causes or contributes to a health care-acquired infection, which is why we have insisted that any data should be collected at the lowest possible level, although having read the revised draft code, it does not seem that that point has been adequately taken on board. When we get data, I hope that the report is conducted at a fine level rather than at a macro level, where I suspect that lessons will be lost. I would be delighted if the Minister were to say how she intends to improve that element of the draft code.</p>
	<p pid="b.1356.1/13">We will watch the Healthcare Commission closely, because, having read the code, it seems that it must do a great deal of interpretation. It will, of course, be responsible for benchmarking one trust against another and I hope that it will apply consistent standards across the health service. The working of the code will depend on how the Healthcare Commission decides to use it.</p>
	<p pid="b.1356.1/14">As I have said, some trusts are doing well on health care-acquired infection and some are doing less well. The logical extension of the observation that some trusts are doing well but that others are doing less well is that the Healthcare Commission will act against those that are not doing well. It is reasonable to assume that some trusts are doing less well because they do not comply with good practice, much of which is laid out in the code. The matter is, of course, complicated, and some trusts do less well because of the nature of their work, but it is still reasonable to assume that those trusts that are doing less well are to some extent not applying the best practice laid out in the code. I hope that the Healthcare Commission examines that matter and, where it is necessary to do so, implements the necessary measures to make sure that those institutions improve. We will monitor the situation to make sure that that happens.</p>
	<p pid="b.1356.1/15">Finally, this area is clearly a matter of great concern for a large number of our constituents. It is a pity that the issue has been an also-ran in comparison with the main business of the day, smoking, but that should not disguise the fact that it is important for a large number of our constituents. The Government have chosen to put their store by the code, and, of course, I wish it well and hope that it works. However, I have set out our serious concerns, which I hope the Minister will bear in mind when she comes to revise the document&mdash;as we understand it, the code is a live document that will be revised periodically.</p>

	<p pid="b.1359.0/1">I support the thrust of the amendment, but we have got the law right and are about to get the code right. What is important now is ensuring that the fine words are put into practice in hospital environments up and down the country.</p>
	<p pid="b.1359.0/2">Before Report, I visited Stafford hospital to talk to hospital staff about protection for patients and visitors to hospitals against health care-associated infections. It was heartening to see that some of the measures that we are debating were already being used in practice. For example, amendment No. 12 suggests that a lead person on the board should take responsibility for that matter, which already happens at Stafford hospital.</p>
	<p pid="b.1359.0/3">The director of clinical standards at Stafford hospital, Jan Harry, is also the director of infection prevention and control. The modern matron for surgery, Naeema Khan, takes the lead as the internal champion to develop strategies on infection prevention and control, and she has sent me a note reminding me about one or two things that they are up to at the hospital. For example, the national guidance about the &quot;Clean your hands&quot; campaign has been taken to heart in the hospital, where there is now a network of hand-washing champions, who are role models for staff, visitors and patients.</p>
	<p pid="b.1359.0/4">To gain community involvement&mdash;no doubt this is true of many hospitals&mdash;there has been a competition in schools to design posters for the walls of the hospital. That is a sensible way of trying to capture the public's attention, and hopefully people will consider their cleanliness when they are admitted to hospital or visit other patients. Among the many documents reminding hospitals how they should behave, there is now revised guidance on contracting for cleaning. Naeema has informed me that Stafford hospital will be a pilot site for a new ward-cleaning management system and that the relevant preparatory work is under way now.</p>
	<p pid="b.1359.0/5">In Committee, I discussed capturing information on the level of infection in hospitals, which involves testing and early analysis. Stafford hospital has superb on-site laboratory facilities, so there is the opportunity, with the right guidance, to follow best practice in taking samples, getting assessments, making reports and collecting information. As the hospital has pointed out, however, it could do with some help in its constant fight to keep down health care-associated infections, which requires partnerships that go outside the boundaries of hospitals.</p>
	<p pid="b.1359.0/6">When I visited the hospital, we discussed care homes for elderly people, which provide many admissions to hospitals these days and which, like hospitals, are an environment where we might anticipate a degree of infection unless care is taken. My hospital and its partners, which include residential care providers, are willing to undergo joint screening and to export good practice from the hospital to those homes. Sadly, the hospital has found that there is a cost, and unless people feel particularly motivated, they will not incur it unless they have to. As politicians, we can take the message to potential partners and hospital trusts that there is something that everyone should do.</p>

	<p pid="b.1360.0/1">In many walks of life, best practice is discovered in the variety of ways in which different organisations operate. If the code is too prescriptive, is there not a danger that innovations in cleaning technology, detection and control will be stifled because such matters are dealt with uniformly?</p>

	<p pid="b.1360.1/1">Given his intervention, the hon. Gentleman will probably like the Minister's response. The Minister will say that we should not tie ourselves down with overly restrictive legislation and that a code that can be changed from time to time to keep up to date with innovations and changes is therefore desirable. By informing partnerships beyond the boundaries of hospitals, we are inviting people to take part in the challenge of eradicating those infections. As the hon. Gentleman said, nobody has exclusive possession of the knowledge that will help us to defeat such infections, and I would welcome help from my constituents who want to contribute to the fight. How we engage people outside the boundaries of hospitals in making sure that the incidence of such infections is driven as low as possible is a challenge for us all.</p>

	<p pid="b.1360.2/1">I wish to speak to amendments Nos. 35 and 37.</p>
	<p pid="b.1360.2/2">MRSA rates have doubled since 1997, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1922" name="Andrew Murrison">my hon. Friend the Member for Westbury (Dr. Murrison)</phrase> pointed out. The last time we debated this in the House, the hon. Members for Thurrock (Andrew Mackinlay) and for Wyre Forest (Dr. Taylor) spoke at length about the misreporting of figures. Although current figures suggest that we do not have a massive problem, we still do not know the true position.</p>
	<p pid="b.1360.2/3">However, I am not here to lob grenades across the Table by criticising the Government. I want to look at where we are now and how we can move on to improve the situation. I well remember the NHS in the 1970s under a Labour Government, and in the 1980s under a Conservative Administration. The most fearful bug that we had to deal with in those days was klebsiella, which lived on bars of soap. Things are different now.</p>
	<p pid="b.1360.2/4">I am not naturally a retrospective person, but in the matter of MRSA one has to be. In the 70s and 80s, hospitals were indisputably much cleaner than they are today. However, it is not just a decline in cleanliness that has brought about MRSA in our hospitals; it is also the result of an over-reliance on antibiotics, increased movement of patients within the hospital estate, centrally imposed targets that pressurise hospital staff and administrators to hot-bed patients by getting a patient into a bed before it has gone cold or has even been cleaned properly, and dirty wards and bathrooms. A combination of those factors causes MRSA in hospitals.</p>
	<p pid="b.1360.2/5">There is another factor which causes me, as an ex-nurse, some embarrassment. It is easily preventable. I discussed it with the Minister in Committee and was disappointed to note that it was not addressed in more detail in the draft code of practice. It is the fact that nowadays nurses travel to and from home in their uniforms. We all know that that is the case. How often do we see a nurse outside the school gates picking up her children, going into a nursery to pick up her toddler, or leaning over the vegetable section in a supermarket while getting groceries on her way into work? We cannot blame nurses for that because changing facilities are no longer available as they used to be. One has to ask why that is.</p>
	<p pid="b.1360.2/6">One also has to ask on what this casual behaviour of travelling around in nurses' uniforms is based. Is it based on the premise that nurses believe that the uniform is there to protect them, or doctors, from patients and to keep them clean? If so, that is extremely misguided. The purpose of the uniform is to protect the patient from the nurse or the doctor&mdash;the patient who, as a result of being in hospital for procedures or from illness, needs to be protected from anybody who enters their vicinity, including nurses and doctors.</p>
	<p pid="b.1360.2/7">My amendments relate directly to that situation and are simple and to the point. Hospital staff with direct responsibility for patients should not place them at risk by wearing their uniforms to and from work. That is wrong, and it is undoubtedly a direct contribution to MRSA in hospitals.</p>

	<p pid="b.1361.0/1">I am listening to the hon. Lady with interest. She will surely accept that many staff do not wear uniform, including doctors and, most particularly, consultants. How would she address that situation given that they probably go from one patient to another much more frequently than nurses?</p>

	<p pid="b.1361.1/1">Hospital consultants and doctors wear white coats and tend to put them on when they go into hospital. Having worked as a nurse in the NHS for 10 years, I know that most doctors certainly did so to protect themselves from patients&mdash;consultants perhaps not so much, but they were a law unto themselves at the time. That does not mean that they should be excused from this. The practice of cleanliness in hospitals needs to be upgraded at every level to include nurses, doctors, consultants, hospital staff and everybody who has contact with the patient. Doctors usually wear white coats, and if they do not that is unforgivable.</p>
	<p pid="b.1361.1/2">The practice of nurses wearing their uniforms to work and back and in the home environment indubitably contributes to MRSA, which costs the NHS about &pound;1 billion a year. I received a copy of the draft code of practice this morning. One 10-word sentence on page 6 relates to staff uniforms. It says that they should be clean and fit for the intended purpose. We know full well that bacteria cannot be seen by the naked eye and that we cannot see a virus. If we could, there would be no MRSA in hospitals. We would not have search and destroy policies&mdash;they would be seek and destroy policies because we would be able to see them. As we cannot, how do we know whether a nurse's uniform is clean? How can a ward manager know whether a uniform is clean? How do we know that the uniform that a doctor or nurse comes into hospital wearing was not the uniform that they wore to collect a child from school? How do we know whether that child has washed their hands all day? How do we know that they have not been sick or in contact with another child who has viruses or bacteria? How do we know that the nurse did not collect the child and get into a car that had been used by the family pets? Did the nurse then walk on to the ward in that uniform after collecting that child from school and driving in that car to a patient who is critically ill and in a vulnerable, immune-suppressed state?</p>
	<p pid="b.1361.1/3">As we know, 25 per cent. of hospital infections are brought from communities into hospitals, and there is no doubt that a large proportion of that percentage is brought in by staff who use their work uniforms to go home. If there was an overall stipulation that staff who had direct contact with patients did not travel to and from work in their uniforms, I am sure that the figure of 25 per cent. would reduce dramatically. Prohibiting staff from travelling to and from work in uniform would be simple to introduce. It would have no cost implications for the Government and I am sure that it would save lives.</p>
	<p pid="b.1361.1/4">Amendment No. 37 proposes that washing instructions should be made available to staff with regard to the safe home laundering of uniforms. That is based on my own research. I asked a number of staff who work in hospitals how they launder their uniforms. Replies varied from, &quot;I bung it on a wool wash because it's navy and it runs&quot;, to, &quot;I bung it on a wool wash because it's white and falls to bits on a hot wash&quot;, to, &quot;I'm a member of the Green party and I do all my washing on a cold wash.&quot; According to the guidelines for washing uniforms, none of those is correct. A cold wash is nowhere near sufficient to kill bacteria or viruses on uniforms. Would it not be easy and cost-effective, and would it not save lives, if notices in utility rooms and staff cloakrooms stated the correct washing instructions for nurses' uniforms?</p>
	<p pid="b.1361.1/5">The draft code of practice for the prevention and control of hospital-acquired infections is 28 pages long, and it is an improvement on the original version. Florence Nightingale had no such document when she went to the Crimea, yet she halved the death rate of soldiers from bacterial infections within weeks by raising standards of cleanliness and sanitation. Some things never change. We are facing exactly the same enemy&mdash;mutating bacteria in hospitals.</p>
	<p pid="b.1361.1/6">If we had a policy of search and destroy and effective cleaning solutions that worked when they were used on wards, if we brought back state enrolled nurses and allowed no uniforms to be worn on the way to work, and if uniforms were laundered safely at home with proper instructions, I am sure that that would make a huge difference to MRSA rates. However, that is up to the Government and the Minister.</p>
	<p pid="b.1361.1/7">I end on a note of caution. Yesterday, I met a lady who, unlike everyone else, will not accept the out-of-court settlement that she has been offered for contracting MRSA. She is taking the matter to the High Court. She realises that the cash settlement she gets will be less than that which the hospital trust has offered, but she wants to set a precedent so that others can litigate when they contract MRSA. I hope that the Minister will not let the problem reach the point when people are rushing to the courts.</p>
	<p pid="b.1361.1/8">We can do better than a 10-word sentence about staff uniforms. From speaking to nurses, those who have contracted MRSA and people in the community, I know that they do not want nurses to go home in their uniforms. Nurses do not want to wear their uniforms to and from work and they readily say, &quot;If we were told not to, we wouldn't.&quot; They said that changing rooms were not absolutely necessary. One nurse told me, &quot;I'd go to the cloakroom where I hang my coat and leave my bag.&quot; There is no reason for not imposing such a provision. I hope that the Minister will reconsider the draft code and what happens to nurses, their uniforms and the cleaning of those uniforms at home.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-02-14b.1363.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1458" speakername="Stephen Williams" colnum="1363"  time="020:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060214/debtext/60214-30.htm#60214-30_spnew0">
	<p pid="b.1363.0/1">I should like to have spoken at greater length in the earlier debate on smoking. None the less, I am delighted with the outcome. Clearly, my wise words were not needed.</p>
	<p pid="b.1363.0/2">Four or five years ago, we conducted a major survey in my constituency on health care services in Bristol. The most common spontaneous remarks expressed concern about standards of cleanliness in hospitals. In the verbal surveys about health care that we conducted on the doorstep, people often commented on that, and it is therefore right to raise the matter now. We also discussed it at length in Committee.</p>
	<p pid="b.1363.0/3">Proposed new paragraphs (e) to (j) in amendment No. 12 make sense. Proposed new paragraph (d) is also important because it is obvious that the infection control nurse needs to report directly to somebody, but I wonder whether we need to appoint a separate trust director for that role. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1833" name="David Kidney">the hon. Member for Stafford (Mr. Kidney)</phrase> pointed out, the medical or clinical director of most acute trusts is likely to hold such a responsibility already&mdash;from memory, that is the case in Bristol&mdash;but there may be some merit in making that publicly known.</p>
	<p pid="b.1363.0/4">Let me deal with amendments Nos. 35 and 37, which <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1397" name="Nadine Dorries">the hon. Member for Mid-Bedfordshire (Mrs. Dorries)</phrase> tabled. I wonder on what evidence she based her remarks, because much of it appeared anecdotal. Is there such evidence in the public domain? Perhaps the Minister could comment on that. How widespread are the abuses of standards of cleanliness that the hon. Member for Mid-Bedfordshire described? Has she spoken to representatives of the Royal College of Nursing, Unison or any other representative bodies in the health service?</p>

	<p pid="b.1364.0/1">The hon. Gentleman knows full well that I have not spoken to representatives of the Royal College of Nursing because he asked me yesterday and I told him that I had not. I therefore have no idea why he is asking the question now.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-02-14b.1364.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1458" speakername="Stephen Williams" colnum="1364"  time="020:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060214/debtext/60214-30.htm#60214-30_spnew2">
	<p pid="b.1364.1/1">I thank the hon. Lady for her answer, which I wanted to appear on the record. That is why I asked the question. I thank her for confirming what she told me last night, but I wondered whether she had spoken to the RCN in the intervening 24 hours. It is a shame that she has not.</p>
	<p pid="b.1364.1/2">Has the hon. Lady thought through the implications of her proposals? If nurses should take more care about laundering their uniforms, would it be better if that were done in the hospital? As I understand it, theatre staff are likely to have their uniforms laundered on hospital premises. Would that be a practical solution?</p>

	<p pid="b.1364.2/1">As the hon. Gentleman knows, we discussed the matter in Committee and the Minister rightly gave me the reasons why that could not be done. It would take too long and cost too much money among other reasons. Again, the hon. Gentleman knows that full well. I ask simply for guidelines for nursing staff on the safe and recommended method of laundering uniforms. As a former nurse, I probably know far more nurses than the hon. Gentleman and hold far more conversations about the subject.</p>

	<p pid="b.1364.3/1">I thank the hon. Lady and am pleased to have helped her to place on the record the reasoning behind the amendments. I do not necessarily disagree with her sentiments, but I wanted to clarify some of the reasoning.</p>

	<p pid="b.1364.4/1">I apologise to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1922" name="Andrew Murrison">the hon. Member for Westbury (Dr. Murrison)</phrase> and others if they feel that the new draft code was placed in the Library unheralded. I cleared it for publication at <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1476" name="Andrew Lansley">the weekend and wrote to the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley)</phrase> and all members of the Committee. However, the letters notifying them that the code was available were posted only yesterday at 4.15 pm. I apologise if they have not arrived and I hope that hon. Members will accept my apologies.</p>
	<p pid="b.1364.4/2">I ask hon. Members to be clear and careful with the figures that they use for deaths. It is easy for confusion in the mind of the public to lead to greater anxiety than necessary. I do not suggest that MRSA and health care-acquired infections are not a cause for concern&mdash;they are. However, I am worried about the figure of 5,000 deaths. The only figures on which we rely are those for 2003, which show that 955 death certificates mentioned MRSA. Of those, 321 identified MRSA as an underlying cause of death.</p>

	<p pid="b.1364.5/1">I agree that the issue causes huge confusion. That is why I was at pains to stress that we need to be clear about what we say and maintain a sense of perspective. However, I fear that the Minister fell into the common trap of confusing health care-acquired infections with MRSA. When I spoke briefly earlier, I saw a look of consternation on the Minister's face and I thought that she might be confusing the two. The figure of 5,000 that I cited related to the former, not the latter.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-02-14b.1365.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1690" speakername="Jane Kennedy" colnum="1365"  time="020:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060214/debtext/60214-30.htm#60214-30_spnew7">
	<p pid="b.1365.0/1">I accept that. I probably did not hear exactly what the hon. Gentleman said and I thought at first that he had claimed that 5,000 deaths were caused by MRSA. I would be horrified if that were the case. The figure of 5,000 is often cited but it applies to an American study, which is quite old. It is extrapolated from data that are based on the United States. We are working hard to get the best information possible into the public domain.</p>
	<p pid="b.1365.0/2">I stress to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1397" name="Nadine Dorries">the hon. Member for Mid-Bedfordshire (Mrs. Dorries)</phrase> that we should not make such claims as deaths have doubled since 1997. I am resisting my natural inclination, which is to dive in with both feet and say, &quot;Hang on a minute, let's go further back.&quot; However, I hope that she accepts that we began the collection of the data and the surveillance of MRSA and other infections.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-02-14b.1365.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1476" speakername="Andrew Lansley" colnum="1365"  time="020:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060214/debtext/60214-30.htm#60214-30_spnew8">
	<p pid="b.1365.1/1">One moment the Minister enjoins us to be very precise, yet the next moment she blandly says, &quot;We began the collecting of the data&quot;. That is not true. Nosocomial surveillance began under the previous Conservative Government. It was not carried out on a mandatory basis, but in a number of respects it was commenced under that Government.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-02-14b.1365.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1690" speakername="Jane Kennedy" colnum="1365"  time="020:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060214/debtext/60214-30.htm#60214-30_spnew9">
	<p pid="b.1365.2/1">I accept what the hon. Gentleman is saying, but it was making the surveillance mandatory that led to increased reporting, because the information was required to be reported. That raised the reporting of the infection to a different level.</p>
	<p pid="b.1365.2/2">We need to remember that people who die with MRSA are often already seriously ill with another condition. It is therefore difficult to say with any certainty whether they would have recovered from their underlying condition if they had not acquired the infection. However, none of the brief discussion that we have just had should distract us from the seriousness of the issue.</p>
	<p pid="b.1365.2/3">I am grateful to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1833" name="David Kidney">my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford (Mr. Kidney)</phrase> for taking the time to visit his local hospital. I am pleased to say that the &quot;Clean your hands&quot; campaign to which he referred has had a 100 per cent. sign-up in the NHS. It has been taken up very rapidly. My hon. Friend also described the board level buy-in at Stafford, which is essential if the whole organisation is to take on the change of culture necessary to reduce bacteraemia levels.</p>
	<p pid="b.1365.2/4">My hon. Friend also asked us to consider the relationship between hospitals and care homes, where more screening could perhaps usefully be developed. We accept that screening works, and we are trialling ways of determining how a patient should be managed, having used the screening to identify whether they have a health care-acquired infection. Those trials are taking place in three different trusts, one of which is being sponsored by the Department of Health. We shall get the results in September 2006, and they will enable us to learn a lot about how trusts should respond to screening, having applied it. A study carried out in Oxford showed that more than 90 per cent. of those diagnosed with an MRSA infection had had previous contact with the health care system and might have contracted the infection during their earlier treatment. All of this highlights the complex nature of the problem that we are grappling with.</p>
	<p pid="b.1365.2/5">I am grateful to the hon. Member for Westbury for his acknowledgement of the improvements in the code, and I accept that further improvements could probably be made. However, I want him and his hon. Friends to think carefully before pressing the amendments to a vote if they feel tempted to do so. As we discussed in Committee, amendments such as these would introduce inappropriate detail into the Bill, raising expectations and giving the impression that certain measures were more important than others. For example, hand hygiene and the decontamination of instruments are not mentioned in the amendments, but they are of equal importance. All aspects of infection control must be taken seriously and implemented if the fight against health care-associated infection is to be successful. However, I recognise that the amendments are the result of real concerns and I will try to allay those worries in the course of my speech.</p>
	<p pid="b.1365.2/6">Clause 13 inserts three new sections into the Health and Social Care Act 2003. Amendment No. 12 would add eight new paragraphs to section 47A. The first of these, proposed new paragraph (c), is aimed at ensuring that each trust has a director responsible for</p>
	<p pid="b.1365.2/7" class="indent">&quot;cleanliness and health care associated infection control&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.1365.2/8">While I understand the aim of trying to clarify lines of responsibility, this proposal could compromise the role of the director of infection prevention and control. The code of practice&mdash;hon. Members might like to refer to pages 5 to 7 of the draft&mdash;will require an NHS body to establish appropriate management systems and the appointment of a director of infection prevention and control. As my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford pointed out, most hospitals now do that, and all health care providers will do so as a result of this code and the one that will follow it, which will allow regulation to the same standard that applies in the independent and voluntary sector.</p>
	<p pid="b.1365.2/9">In response to proposed new paragraph (d), which aims to ensure that the senior infection control nurse reports directly to the</p>
	<p pid="b.1365.2/10" class="indent">&quot;Director responsible for cleanliness and health care associated infection control&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="b.1365.2/11">I would like to point out that the draft code already gives the director of infection prevention and control&mdash;that is a long title, but I cannot think of any way of shortening it&mdash;responsibility for the infection control team.</p>
	<p pid="b.1365.2/12">Proposed new paragraph (e) suggests that the code should specify the action that the trust director and board must take concerning ward closures when they receive an adverse report. I genuinely believe that that is too prescriptive. The code, as it is written, will require an NHS body to have criteria for advising closure and have arrangements in place for redirecting admissions. It is not that we think it unnecessary to bear these things in mind, but the amendment is too prescriptive in that sense.</p>
	<p pid="b.1365.2/13">The policy will be developed with input from the infection control team locally, so local policy will reflect local circumstance&mdash; but while it is important for us to have a policy, we do not want to prescribe the content from the centre. I think it was <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1929" name="Adam Afriyie">the hon. Member for Windsor (Adam Afriyie)</phrase> who said that we should resist the urge to be too prescriptive, and I commend his comments to his colleague. People on the ground should be allowed to make such decisions with the benefit of their local knowledge.</p>
	<p pid="b.1365.2/14">Paragraph (f) is intended to ensure that there is pre and post-discharge surveillance for patients undergoing surgical procedures. We agree that both kinds of surveillance are beneficial, and the code of practice will encourage NHS bodies to introduce them. However, we will not make them mandatory at this stage as there are significant technical barriers, with which I shall deal shortly. I direct Members to page 17 of the draft code on surveillance.</p>
	<p pid="b.1365.2/15">Paragraph (g) is linked to amendments that were tabled and discussed in Committee, and I have had a conversation with the hon. Members for Westbury and for South Cambridgeshire about the code. The paragraph implies that it should contain requirements relating to the number of infection control nurses. I do not want to include such requirements in a code dealing with infection prevention and control. I think that infection prevention and control should be everyone's business; it should not be left to a cohort of infection control nurses. Setting a ratio of specialist infection control staff to beds, rather than challenging the culture in the organisation, will encourage people to see the job as one to be performed by those people alone. Appropriate management and clinical governance systems are required, and that will be dealt with by the code of practice.</p>
	<p pid="b.1365.2/16">Paragraphs (h) and (i) suggest that there should be requirements relating to isolation facilities, and that standards relating to cleaning services should be defined. Pages 6 and 7 of the code deal with those suggestions. I can, I hope, reassure the House that the code will cover important matters of that kind. The draft code already requires NHS bodies to ensure that they have adequate isolation facilities to prevent the spread of infection. &quot;Adequate&quot; should not be interpreted as a dismissive term. It means what it says: it means enough to deal with the circumstances that might arise. The draft code also requires NHS bodies to have a cleaning plan giving details of the standards of cleanliness needed in each part of their premises. While I accept the strength of the arguments advanced in Committee and today, I feel that the code strikes the right balance, although we will keep it under constant review.</p>
	<p pid="b.1365.2/17">Paragraph (j) suggests that the code should require hospitals to record infection data by clinical department. We agree that analysis of surveillance by clinical department brings considerable benefit, and we now collect information on MRSA bloodstream infections by specialty in trusts. Enhanced surveillance allows us to do that. The code will encourage the NHS to undertake such analyses in the context of a range of organisms.</p>
	<p pid="b.1365.2/18">We have been criticised for not proceeding with work on post-discharge surveillance. Let me explain the practical problems. Believe it or not, there is currently no agreed definition of wounds. There is a lack of computer access when it comes to visiting patients outside health care institutions, and not all health care providers have full access to patient records. That applies to, for instance, midwives visiting women who have had caesarean sections. Notwithstanding those problems, we are working with experts on plans to improve the position.</p>
	<p pid="b.1365.2/19">I hope that the hon. Gentleman accepts that we take the points that he and his hon. Friends have made seriously. We are working to make the code flexible and proportionate, and also to make it reflect the concerns that have been expressed. Although the amendment expresses reasonable anxieties, I consider it unnecessary and hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept my reassurances.</p>
	<p pid="b.1365.2/20">Amendments Nos. 35 and 37 would also include inappropriate detail about the code of practice in the Bill. Including their requirements in the code would present practical difficulties in relation to enforcement. We have been working hard with the Healthcare Commission to ensure that the code is enforceable&mdash;an issue raised by the hon. Member for Westbury&mdash;and we are concentrating on the outcomes that really matter.</p>
	<p pid="b.1365.2/21">On clothing, the bottom line is that NHS staff have clean, hygienic uniforms. Clause 4(g) of the code as drafted includes the following requirement:</p>
	<p pid="b.1365.2/22" class="indent">&quot;Every NHS Body must ensure that Staff uniforms are clean and fit for the intended purpose&quot;.</p>

	<p pid="b.1368.2/1">&quot;Clean&quot; is a matter of perception. We can say, &quot;You look clean&quot;, but we cannot see viruses and bacteria, as I said earlier. How can a ward manager know whether a uniform is clean and fit for purpose if they do not know what bacteria or viruses are living on it? If it has been worn at home, it could have been worn while the member of staff picked up their child from school or went shopping in the supermarket. How could a ward manager be expected to know that?</p>

	<p pid="b.1368.3/1">The areas of greatest risk are patients who are very poorly and have wounds&mdash;people who are going into hospital for invasive procedures, including something as simple as the insertion of a drip, or for some form of operation. It is appropriate that, in those cases, suitable additional protective clothing be worn. Indeed, such practice is widespread. Plastic aprons and gloves are worn by those who are going to spend some time with such patients, even visitors. The point that the hon. Lady makes about how clean a uniform looks is unarguable and patently true, but including in the code a requirement on the NHS to ensure that uniforms are of a required standard of cleanliness is a very forceful step to take.

	<p pid="b.1369.2/1">Many years ago&mdash;I do not want to say how many&mdash;plastic aprons and gloves were commonplace throughout wards. Before a nurse went to any patient, she would take off her existing apron and put on a new one; indeed, that is what I did. Aseptic technique was drilled into us as nurses. Everything that we did involved aseptic technique, particularly when dealing with patients who were vulnerable and at risk. That same mental attitude toward asepsis and changing gowns and gloves is no longer present in wards; it simply does not happen any more. In the past, the provision of such gowns was prescribed. Would it not be appropriate, therefore, for the code to make reference to the provision of freely available gowns, so that what happened in the 1970s and 1980s&mdash;the constant changing of gowns and gloves&mdash;happens again?</p>

	<p pid="b.1369.3/1">I do not accept the hon. Lady's description of what happens now: I have indeed seen that level of concentration on aseptic techniques, but I hear what she is saying. In my view, we should not strengthen the code in the way that she describes at this point, but I will reflect on this issue. We will have time to take such concerns on board as the Bill progresses&mdash;I hope&mdash;through the other place. I have sought to provide some reassurance on how seriously we are taking these issues, and the requirement that we have included in the code, measured as it will be by the Healthcare Commission, will be sufficient. However, we continue to listen on these issues.</p>
	<p pid="b.1369.3/2">In Committee, the hon. Lady gave a graphic description of a visit to a hospital in which she met a nurse with what she assumed was spaghetti Bolognese over the front of her uniform. As I said in Committee, had I been that nurse's manager, I would have expected her to have washed her uniform, or at least to have worn another one. However, as the hon. Lady says, one cannot always tell whether a uniform is free of germs, even if it has been washed, just as one cannot always guarantee that one's hands are totally free of germs.</p>
	<p pid="b.1369.3/3">I believe that the code as drafted would give NHS trusts a legal duty to ensure that such things do not happen. It would give relevant NHS bodies a legal duty to ensure that their staff had clean uniforms. How they achieve that would be up to them, which is what I meant when I said that the code is outcome-based. I realised that the hon. Lady did not have the benefit of the latest draft of the code, and she is obviously still disappointed with the current version. I hope that the redrafted code addresses some of the concerns and reassures hon. Members. While I approve of the amendment's overall aim of ensuring that staff have clean uniforms, I am afraid that we disagree with the methods proposed to achieve that aim.</p>
	<p pid="b.1369.3/4">Finally, for the sake of clarity, I should make it clear that in the Oxford study that I mentioned earlier, I meant 90 per cent. of the 25 per cent. of patients with MRSA who had been in contact with a hospital. I hope that that is clearer.</p>
	<p pid="b.1369.3/5">For the reasons that I have given, I hope that the amendments will have served the purpose of probing the Government's intentions in bringing forward the code and amending it as we have. I hope that the hon. Member for Westbury will withdraw his amendment, but if he does not I shall have to ask my hon. Friends to resist it.</p>

	<p pid="b.1371.3/1">These amendments seek to amend clause 32, which deals with applications for provision of pharmaceutical services. It may be worth spending a little time on the context of these amendments. As the House knows, following the Office of Fair Trading consultation a couple of years ago, new pharmacies are controlled by something called the control of entry regulations. Any application to open a new pharmacy has to go before the primary care trust or the Assembly in Wales and has to pass certain tests.</p>
	<p pid="b.1371.3/2">It is also worth remembering that pharmacies are private contractors that have a contract with the national health service. Historically, that has been to deliver dispensing services, but that has recently changed with the introduction of the new pharmacy contract. That seeks to extend the role of pharmacists, which is widely regarded as a good thing.</p>
	<p pid="b.1371.3/3">Instead of just relying on dispensing, the contract is divided into levels of service. The standard services are those that all pharmacies should supply, and include services such as dispensing and health promotion. Advanced services are developing gradually and the first, which has been successful so far, is the medicines use review&mdash;or MUR&mdash;which has benefited many patients. So far, so good. The potential exists for enhanced services, such as smoking cessation&mdash;I had to mention that tonight&mdash;and monitoring the progress of disease or providing services to care homes. Commissioning of such enhanced services has been very patchy. Some primary care trusts have been very good and tried to embrace new services, but others have ignored the opportunity completely. Some of the evidence shows that the future of the enhanced services next year looks shaky, to say the least. However, that is probably a debate for another day.</p>
	<p pid="b.1371.3/4">Clause 32 applies only when a primary care trust has two applications before it to provide pharmaceutical services in a similar locality. Each pharmacy must pass the existing test as to whether it is necessary or desirable.</p>
	<p pid="b.1371.3/5">As drafted, clause 32 would mean that an NHS contract could be awarded according to promises made in relation to the commercial part of the business. That is wrong and unenforceable, and various problems arise. I admit that the Government have consulted on the proposal, but most respondents rejected it. All the contractors who were consulted did so, regardless of whether they represented single, independent contractors or large multiples.</p>
	<p pid="b.1371.3/6">The contractors' objections revolved around a few simple propositions. They said that no request for a certain level of medicine pricing could be enforced, as no price could be guaranteed in the long term. Contractors could promise the earth, but how could that be monitored by the PCT on a regular basis? What would happen if circumstances changed? For example, a certain price for over-the-counter medicines might be allowed, but the company or pharmacist involved could renege on the deal.</p>
	<p pid="b.1371.3/7">The best analogy that I can come up with is with the contracts awarded to NHS dentists. Such dentists spend two or three years building up their patient lists, but then decide that they do not want to provide dentistry on the NHS. In those circumstances, the PCT has no control over what happens, and it is the question of control that is important here.</p>
	<p pid="b.1371.3/8">It is difficult to see how a PCT can balance different offers in different applications. For example, one pharmacy might offer a certain price for over-the-counter medicines, while another offers an enhanced delivery service. How can the first offer be compared with the second? Who decides what is best for patients? During the consultation, the concern was raised that the proposal could lead to more application refusals being contested, and therefore to a possible increase in the number of judicial reviews.</p>
	<p pid="b.1371.3/9">What happens if a pharmacy is sold, quite legitimately, to an independent contractor or a different group? The buyer might have different marketing or pricing policies, or want to offer a different range of services. How will that be dealt with?</p>
	<p pid="b.1371.3/10">It has been argued that the proposal will help disadvantaged communities, as they would have access to cut-price medicines. I have worked in such communities, and my experience is that that is not really a consideration. People who live in such areas know that they can get free prescriptions from their GPs, and are happy to do so. As a result, that argument is something of a red herring.</p>
	<p pid="b.1371.3/11">Very often, businesses in disadvantaged communities are run by independent contractors. At first, they might not be able to offer big attractions in respect of cut-price medicines, but their commitment to the community can mean that they choose to plough some of the profits back into developing future services. Traditionally, that is what has happened in pharmacy, but the clause could put a stop to pharmacists' very realistic desire to do the best that they can within the constraints of their budgets.</p>
	<p pid="b.1371.3/12">In short, the clause is unworkable as it stands, being difficult both to monitor and sustain. If the Minister is committed to proceeding with it, I hope that she will at least review the new system after it has been in place for a year or 18 months. In that way, she will be able to see whether any of the problems that I have highlighted are based in reality rather than in fear.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-02-14b.1372.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1690" speakername="Jane Kennedy" colnum="1372"  time="020:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060214/debtext/60214-32.htm#60214-32_spnew0">
	<p pid="b.1372.0/1">We are discussing the narrow focus of clause 32. When determining chemist applications to provide pharmaceutical services, current legislation means that PCTs cannot take into account additional services that the chemist might offer.</p>
	<p pid="b.1372.0/2">When PCTs are looking at competing applications that relate to the same neighbourhood and which individually pass the necessary or desirable tests, clause 32 will allow them to consider the improvements that each chemist would bring to the provision of over-the-counter medicines and other health care products, as well as associated advice.</p>
	<p pid="b.1372.0/3">Our proposal aims to encourage applicants to offer improvements generally to the range and availability of medicines and services to support self-care; for example, through helping people to manage minor ailments and promoting healthier living through better advice and information about such products. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1787" name="Sandra Gidley">The hon. Member for Romsey (Sandra Gidley)</phrase> expressed concern that smaller businesses might not be able to fend off bigger competitors. She also argued that the clause was not sustainable or workable.</p>
	<p pid="b.1372.0/4">I do not share the hon. Lady's pessimism&mdash;or if I did, I would not be proposing the measure. The important point is that although the price of over-the-counter medicines must obviously be a factor, the clause is not simply about price; to a large degree, it is about support and advice to the patient in the management of such medicines.</p>

	<p pid="b.1373.0/1">I understand the possible drivers for persuading applicants to offer extra services, which must be a good thing for patients. However, it is difficult to balance the offer of a low price on medicines against those other services. The consideration should not be purely financial. Although the provision of other services is worthy and could benefit the local health economy, merely to consider the price of medicines seems a step too far.</p>

	<p pid="b.1373.1/1">I hear what the hon. Lady says, but her amendment would prevent PCTs from considering what improvements applicants would bring to the provision of over-the-counter medicines in certain cases, which is specific and narrow. Instead, PCTs would be limited to considering only the provision of advice and a range of other health care products, such as dressings, incontinence appliances or sunscreens. That is important and would be welcomed by everybody, but I do not accept the concerns expressed by the hon. Lady, so I hope that the amendment is a probing one. I appreciate that we are on Report, but there may be further opportunity to consider the matter in another place.</p>
	<p pid="b.1373.1/2">The clause is in line with our policy of opening up and developing community pharmacy services. It will improve the availability of over-the-counter medicines in deprived communities. I hope that the amendment was a probing one and I ask the hon. Lady not to press it to a vote. I will consider her comments and perhaps I can respond at a later date.</p>

	<p pid="b.1373.2/1">I am disappointed that the Minister did not even give us a hint about how the clause will be enforced. As I pointed out, it is unenforceable. If pharmacies decide to change the services that they offer, which may be down to financial constraints, it is difficult to see what teeth the PCT will have. Somebody could promise the earth to secure a contract, but not deliver, and the patient would be the poorer.</p>
	<p pid="b.1373.2/2">It is disappointing that the Minister has not given us any commitments and that she has not said that she will review how the measure works in practice, given the concerns that have been expressed. I shall not divide the House on a technical matter, but I hope that it will be revisited in another place and that the Minister will write to me with reassurances about the points that I have raised.</p>

	<p pid="b.1374.4/1">I will not press the amendment to a vote but very much hope that we will find ourselves in violent agreement with the Government, who have consistently made it clear in Committee and during today's proceedings that they favour the affirmative procedure in respect of regulations, which flow like the Tiber through the Bill. Amendments Nos. 33 and 34 would simply ensure that the affirmative procedure would be applied to clause 5, which clearly deals with vehicles, and clause 2, in respect of which we are particularly concerned about the definitions of what is enclosed, substantially enclosed, not enclosed and so on. The Minister must agree that it is important, given the uncertainly that surrounds such things, that the regulations that the Secretary of State may wish to enforce are subject to the affirmative procedure.</p>

	<p pid="b.1374.5/1">As the hon. Gentleman suggests, under amendments Nos. 33 and 34, regulations made under clauses 2 and 5 would be subject to the affirmative procedure. Clause 2 makes provision for premises open to the public and those used for work to be smoke-free. It applies only to premises that are enclosed or substantially enclosed and enables regulations to be made to define the meaning of the words &quot;enclosed&quot; and &quot;substantially enclosed&quot;. Meanwhile, clause 5 enables regulations to be made to provide for vehicles to be smoke-free.</p>
	<p pid="b.1374.5/2">Those matters have been left to regulations to enable consultation with stakeholders and to allow flexibility to amend requirements if need be, based on practical post-implementation experience without the need to amend primary legislation. Given the possibly technical nature of the regulations that would be made under clauses 2 and 5, we have undertaken to conduct a public consultation exercise with respect to any draft regulation prepared.</p>
	<p pid="b.1374.5/3">The negative procedure was selected for the exercise of those powers, as we felt that Parliament would have no good reason in particular to consider such highly technical matters in such detail that it would warrant taking the affirmative route. However, we discussed such issues in Committee, and I said that I would consider them. The hon. Gentleman has again expressed his wish for the affirmative procedure to be used, and I will listen to the views of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee of the other place when it comes to scrutinise the Bill.

	<p pid="b.1375.3/1" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move, That the Bill be now read the Third time.</p>
	<p pid="b.1375.3/2" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I am proud to move the Bill's Third Reading. I particularly want to thank the Minister of State, Department of Health, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1690" name="Jane Kennedy">my right hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Wavertree (Jane Kennedy)</phrase> and the Under-Secretary of State for Health, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1543" name="Caroline Flint">my hon. Friend the Member for Don Valley (Caroline Flint)</phrase> who have done a superb job in piloting the Bill through Committee and much of the Report stage that we have just had. <i>[Interruption.]</i> Despite some of the sedentary comments by Opposition Members, I also pay tribute to Members on both sides who have adopted a positive and constructive attitude to the elements of a Bill that not only protects public health inside and outside hospital but will further improve the performance and efficiency of the national health service.</p>
	<p pid="b.1375.3/3">Of course, the main focus of our debate and of public attention has been on the Bill's smoking provisions. This evening, the House voted absolutely decisively to introduce a complete ban on smoking in all enclosed public places and workplaces, including all licensed premises and private members' clubs. We have therefore not only delivered on the manifesto promise to ban smoking in virtually all public places and workplaces on which we were elected 10 months ago but have gone additional steps further. That reflects the excellent debate that took place on the smoking provisions in which I and my hon. Friends, who genuinely believed, and always have, that the arguments about private members' clubs were finely balanced, have none the less voted for a complete ban, particularly in the interests of ensuring a level playing field between different businesses such as small pubs and members' clubs. I recognise that there will be some disappointment among at least some members of private clubs at the outcome of the vote, but I nevertheless believe that it was the right one.</p>
	<p pid="b.1375.3/4">The comprehensive ban for which the House has decisively voted will mean, over time, that some 600,000 people, beyond those who would have otherwise given up smoking, will be led to abandon it. The result of that and the protection that we are giving to people from second-hand smoking will be thousands of people's lives being saved and thousands of families being spared the grief of losing a loved one prematurely. That is why I think today's vote and the Bill will be seen as historic legislation on public health equivalent to, for instance, the legislation on seat belts of some decades ago.</p>
	<p pid="b.1375.3/5">I am also delighted that, although it was not debated this afternoon, we have taken power to raise the age for the purchase of tobacco from 16 to 18 following the consultation in which we engaged. I pay tribute to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1385" name="Jeff Ennis">my hon. Friend the Member for Barnsley, East and Mexborough (Jeff Ennis)</phrase>, who has campaigned vigorously and effectively on that issue.</p>
	<p pid="b.1375.3/6">Other vital provisions include the statutory code of practice on MRSA and associated health care infections. It will be very widely welcomed not only by the public, who quite rightly expect every hospital to get down their MRSA and other infection rates, but by staff in both the NHS and the independent sector.</p>
	<p pid="b.1375.3/7">The Bill will also provide for much stronger management of controlled drugs in response to some of the shortcomings identified in the Shipman inquiry and will improve safeguards against the very small minority of people who would divert those drugs for personal abuse, financial gain or even, regrettably, for criminal purposes. It will also help us to continue improving and modernising NHS pharmacy services, ensuring, as my right hon. Friend the Minister of State said, that we can continue expanding the services offered by our pharmacists and make them much more convenient to patients.</p>
	<p pid="b.1375.3/8">I was pleased to read the discussion in Committee during which the provision of ophthalmic services in England was praised. Although there was concern that the Bill would tamper with a service that is already excellent, I hope that hon. Members on both sides are reassured that by removing the restrictions on with whom a primary trust may contract to provide ophthalmic services the Bill will help to increase patient choice and thus continue to improve services. The new framework for ophthalmic services will ensure that we will be able to provide enhanced services in the community of the kind that are often available at present only in hospitals. That will be in line with the direction that we have just spelled out in the White Paper.</p>

	<p pid="b.1377.0/1">We did not have the opportunity to discuss general ophthalmic services on Report. Does the Secretary of State agree with the sentiments of amendment No. 17 that when primary care trusts use their powers to contract general ophthalmic services, they should maximise the choice available to patients? We want to ensure that PCTs will be able to continue to exercise choice on accessing services, so it would helpful if the Secretary of State said whether that is firmly her intention.</p>

	<p pid="b.1377.1/1">I am happy to reassure the House that we want more choice for patients in ophthalmic and other medical services. We want the best possible services to be available in every community, with, of course, the best value for money.</p>
	<p pid="b.1377.1/2">The Bill has important provisions that give new powers to the counter-fraud service, which already does excellent work to ensure that taxpayers' money is used for the purpose for which hon. Members vote&mdash;better patient care. The Bill also responds to the Public Administration Committee's report on government by appointment and reconfirms our commitment to an independent appointments process.</p>
	<p pid="b.1377.1/3">The Bill is a major and historic step forward for public health. It will help us to continue to improve the national health service and will give patients and the public better, faster, more convenient and safer health care. The Bill was good, but it has been made even better by today's votes. I commend it to the House.</p>

	<p pid="b.1377.2/1">I am sorry that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1789" name="Kevin Barron">the right hon. Member for Rother Valley (Mr. Barron)</phrase> is not in the Chamber. If congratulations are being offered on the outcome of the Bill's principal measures on smoking, we must accept that they probably owe much to his work and leadership of the Health Committee. Whatever one's view of the precise details of the final outcome, his approach was clearer and more decisive than any ever taken by the Government.</p>
	<p pid="b.1377.2/2">I am surprised that the Secretary of State has claimed on Third Reading that she has implemented the Government's manifesto because that is the one thing she has not done. On Second Reading, she quoted the part of the manifesto that said that the Government would legislate to ensure that</p>
	<p pid="b.1377.2/3" class="indent">&quot;all enclosed public places and work places other than licensed premises will be smoke-free . . . all restaurants will be smoke-free, all pubs and bars preparing and serving food will be smoke-free.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1377.2/4">She also expressly told us on Second Reading that the Government would consult on whether there should be smoking rooms in pubs&mdash;that has gone. She asserted that it was right to strike a balance and said:</p>
	<p pid="b.1377.2/5" class="indent">&quot;we have made the judgment that the right balance to strike is between banning smoking in virtually every enclosed public space and work space, and exempting the membership clubs and the licensed premises that do not serve food, in order to protect freedom of choice for that minority of people whom nobody is forcing to go into a pub that allows smoking&quot;.&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, 29 November 2005; Vol. 440, c. 156.]</p>
	<p pid="b.1377.2/6">Although we knew what was going to happen, the Secretary of State did not have the courtesy to tell the House how she was going to vote&mdash;if she knew at that stage&mdash;at the start of the debate on new clause 5. However, she and the Prime Minister have voted completely contrary to the exemptions that Ministers presented to the House three months ago. She may congratulate herself and her colleagues on their stewardship of the Bill, but the truth of the matter is that the House was taken in precisely the wrong direction on Second Reading. Additionally, a substantial amount of time was expended on the matter in Committee, although we all knew at that point that Ministers were on an impossible wicket.</p>
	<p pid="b.1377.2/7">On Second Reading, the Conservatives pressed for a free vote, and it was quite obvious that it would have been better for the Government to abandon the distinction between pubs that serve food and those that do not. There are often mutual congratulations on Third Reading, and I shall offer mine in a minute, but I must tell the Secretary of State and the Under-Secretary of State for Health&mdash;the so-called public health Minister&mdash;that the Bill was not well handled. It was one of the most astonishingly badly handled Bills in recent years. It should not have been introduced in the form in which it was introduced, it should not have been pursued in that way, and even if it has produced a solution with which Parliament is happy, that was not by virtue of ministerial design. Ministers should therefore not accept congratulations. <i>[Interruption.]</i> If the Secretary of State is saying that my colleagues voted for a more comprehensive ban, I do not have a difficulty with that. She should perhaps remember that we made it clear on Second Reading that there would be a free vote on the express basis that Opposition Members had distinct views on the judgment that should be made. A free vote was not offered to Government Members. The Government should accept that there was a crass error on their part, for which they should apologise.</p>

	<p pid="b.1378.0/1">As a Conservative candidate, I stood on a manifesto commitment that we would not introduce legislation on this issue.

	<p pid="b.1378.1/1">Our manifesto made it perfectly clear that people must take responsibility for their own health. We made it clear before the election that we would pursue a more vigorous self-regulatory solution. However, if that did not deliver the substantial protection that we sought within three years, so that non-smokers were not exposed to smoke, children not exposed to second-hand smoke and staff protected, we would take legislative powers. I do not wish to disagree with my hon. Friend, as we have discussed the matter and participated in free votes. He should accept, however, that we were committed at the election to public health legislation, which would have included powers on smoking.</p>

	<p pid="b.1379.6/1">I am never churlish&mdash;cross, perhaps, but never churlish.</p>
	<p pid="b.1379.6/2">I agree with the Secretary of State that we have engaged in constructive discussion at every stage in the Bill's progress. That was very true in Committee, w<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1385" name="Jeff Ennis">here the hon. Member for Barnsley, East and Mexborough (Jeff Ennis)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1613" name="George Young">my right hon. Friend the Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir George Young)</phrase> rightly pressed for an increase in the age at which tobacco can be purchased. I am delighted that we have moved in that direction. However, even though I have no doubt that another place will respect the decision of the House on a free vote, and with a significant majority at that, it should consider issues relating to smoking including definitions, what additional places will be specified under the legislation, under what circumstances private vehicles might be specified, and whether vehicles used for work are to be included in the smoke-free provisions. Those are important matters, and some valuable work will no doubt be done in another place.</p>
	<p pid="b.1379.6/3">We have not discussed specialist tobacconists, but I hope Ministers will understand the desire for them not to be put out of business. I should also mention penalties, which we discussed in Committee. I was not entirely happy with the scale of penalties that the Government proposed. In some respects they have been increased, which the Minister thinks appropriate, but I hope that that will be reconsidered in another place and weighed up relative to other legislative penalties.</p>
	<p pid="b.1379.6/4">As our last group of amendments made clear, the nature of the regulatory provisions and how they are to be made is important. In addition to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1922" name="Andrew Murrison">the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Westbury (Dr. Murrison)</phrase>, we suggested in Committee that it might be better for the regulations to be made by affirmative procedure in the first instance, rather than by affirmative procedure in every case. Subsequent technical amendments to the regulations could be made by negative procedure, but the initial regulations, which will contain substance as well as technicalities, might well be made on an affirmative basis.</p>
	<p pid="b.1379.6/5">We discussed infection control previously and had the opportunity to raise some of the issues on Report and in discussions with the Minister in Committee and elsewhere. The issues are important and intractable. As the Minister will acknowledge, the latest six-monthly MRSA statistics do not show the progress that she and we might have wished. That demonstrates the difficulty of making progress and the necessity for the measures described in the code to be implemented effectively. Isolation facilities must not only be appropriate but must follow a risk assessment. We need to work on the design of hospitals and ensure that the necessary facilities are built in from the outset.</p>
	<p pid="b.1379.6/6">Clinical data, which the Minister agreed should be collected by a clinical department, should be used as a performance management tool in hospitals to deliver improved infection control, should be a basis on which health care providers are held to account, and should be used by them better to inform public debate about infection control. One of the central issues that we constantly try to highlight is the distinction between prevalence and incidence. Not all incidents of infection in hospitals are by any means the consequence of infection being contracted in hospital. Distinguishing between the two can make an enormous difference to public understanding. I hope that another place will take a substantial interest in those matters and in model cleaning contracts, nursing uniforms and standards. Committees in another place have done significant work on those aspects in the past, and I hope they will follow it up.</p>
	<p pid="b.1379.6/7">We hope that the pharmacy contract will increasingly be implemented innovatively. Only a few weeks ago, we discussed the White Paper and the desire for greater opportunities for people to be screened for disease and to initiate for themselves more checks on their health status. It is perfectly clear that pharmacies can do a great deal in that direction, and the pharmacy contract always allows that. The issue is whether primary care trusts are contracting for such an approach. One aspect that needs to be followed up is not merely legislating or contracting for such possibilities, but ensuring that the structure of commissioning inside primary care trusts with regard to pharmacies allows for them.</p>
	<p pid="b.1379.6/8">One issue that we have not had a further opportunity to discuss is the span of control of a pharmacist, and I hope that those in another place will pursue it. The professional confidence that we place in pharmacists is important, and the profession itself attaches considerable importance to that. Many pharmacists do not want to move beyond the rule of one pharmacy, one pharmacist, or if they do, it is only in very exceptional circumstances and it must be delineated. I do not think that we have yet arrived at a point at which it is delineated in the Bill, and I hope that that will be pursued further.</p>
	<p pid="b.1379.6/9">On general ophthalmic services, the Secretary of State made it clear that PCTs should pursue the maximum choice consistent with value for money for the Exchequer. That must be true. Many people are wondering precisely what the motivation is for the legislation and what is going wrong in general ophthalmic services that demands such a change. Currently, optometrists and registered opticians can offer services, and patients can use them; they have maximum choice, and there does not seem to be a difficulty with that. If we are to move to a new design, let us ensure that those things continue. Let us ensure that the central funding is clearly set out, either in the legislation or in ministerial commitments for the future, so that the free sight test is available and cannot be compromised by budgetary pressures on individual primary care trusts; that the scope of the sight test can be adapted in line with best clinical practice as we move forward; that optometrists and opticians are able and encouraged to provide sight tests and related tests that not only focus on the basic question of visual field, but go beyond that to try to detect disease to the maximum extent; and that the free sight test itself is not infringed in years to come.</p>
	<p pid="b.1379.6/10">We have spent almost three months on the Bill. In many ways, it has ended up where I suspect many of us thought and said it would, although not necessarily as easily as it should have done. Many parts of the Bill are of a nature that commands consensus across the House. On smoking, many of my colleagues object&mdash;[Hon. Members: &quot;Yes.&quot;] I know that they object to what the House has decided, but frankly, it was always our view that the matter was best dealt with on a free vote. Since we have at last come to that and the House has taken a decision on a free vote, for my part, whether or not I agree precisely with the outcome, I think that that is a fair basis for the House to reach its conclusion. I am content for the Bill as a whole to go to another place in its current form, and I hope that it will be further improved there.</p>

I am sure that the public consultation will be very positive. Indeed, the BBC and Sky conducted two polls immediately before Christmas showing support of about 85 or 90 per cent. for raising the age of sale. I have always regarded the measure as common sense. Before 1997, exactly the same proportion of young people smoked in Guernsey as in the UK, but following the implementation of the measure, the rate in Guernsey fell to 50 per cent. of that in the UK. The measure has been adopted in many European countries as well as in Scotland and Ireland. It has the support of the Trading Standards Institute, which is the enforcement agency that carries out age-of-sale test purchases. A resolution on the issue has been passed at the past two Trading Standards Institute annual conferences.</p>
	<p pid="b.1381.0/3">The measure will bring the age of sale of tobacco in line with that of alcohol and of dangerous knives and airguns, the age limit for which will be increased to 18 by the Violent Crime Reduction Bill.</p>
	<p pid="b.1381.0/4">Most smokers start smoking in their early teenage years&mdash;indeed, most of them start before the age of 16. I am sure that raising the age will not stop teenagers, and young teenagers in particular, from trying smoking. We need to think about introducing a more effective education programme in schools, youth clubs and other settings in which young people congregate. As has happened in Guernsey, I am sure that the measure will impact on the number of young people who smoke with the passage of time.</p>
	<p pid="b.1381.0/5">I pay tribute to my local newspaper, the <i>South Yorkshire Times</i>, which has produced a petition entitled, &quot;Petition to raise the minimum age of smoking to 18&quot;. It states:</p>
	<p pid="b.1381.0/6" class="indent">&quot;The South Yorkshire Times is supporting Mexborough and Barnsley East MP Jeff Ennis in his bid to raise the minimum age of smoking from 16 to 18 with his Age of Sale of Tobacco Bill. Sign below to show your support for this measure to improve the health of our young people.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1381.0/7">As I said in Committee, I want to single out a campaigning journalist with the <i>South Yorkshire Times</i>, Lee Siggs, for his help. The <i>South Yorkshire Times</i> placed the petition in not only all the local newsagents, but the local further education college, Dearne Valley college. The vast majority of signatories to the petition are young people aged 16 to 25 from not only my constituency and places such as Greaseborough and Swinton, which are in the constituency of the Financial Secretary to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1918" name="John Healey">the Treasury, my hon. Friend the Member for Wentworth (John Healey)</phrase>, but Denaby and Conisbrough, which are in the constituency of the Under-Secretary of State for Health, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1543" name="Caroline Flint">my hon. Friend the Member for Don Valley (Caroline Flint)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.1381.0/8">I pay tribute to the Minister of State, Department of Health, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1690" name="Jane Kennedy">my right hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Wavertree (Jane Kennedy)</phrase> and the Under-Secretary of State for Health, my hon. Friend the Member for Don Valley for the way in which they took the Bill through Committee and improved it.</p>
	<p pid="b.1381.0/9">Since I discussed the issue in Committee, I have received a letter from one of the tobacco companies, which are often portrayed in this place as b&ecirc;tes noires. The letter, which came from Phillip Morris, was very positive. It stated that in that company's opinion the age of sale is a matter for the Government and that as far as it is concerned smoking is an adult activity that is not for children, which shows that tobacco companies can be responsible. It is therefore appropriate to pay tribute to tobacco companies as well as criticising them.</p>
	<p pid="b.1381.0/10">In conclusion, I am glad that the whole House has supported this common-sense measure, and I look forward to the age of sale being raised to 18 and incorporated into the Bill at the end of the public consultation period.</p>

	<p pid="b.1383.0/1">The whole House will congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1385" name="Jeff Ennis">the hon. Member for Barnsley, East and Mexborough (Jeff Ennis)</phrase> on pursuing an issue and seeing it through to the point at which the public and the industry will be consulted and the House can form a view through affirmative resolution. When we debated the programme motion, I said that it was an important issue that warranted a debate. As I predicted, we did not get it. Very few people in the House&mdash;the hon. Member for Barnsley, East and Mexborough was one of them&mdash;knew what was happening when the Speaker called for new clause 6 to be added to the Bill. Such an important issue should have got an airing so that we could think it through further. At least the House has a chance to come back to it.</p>
	<p pid="b.1383.0/2">It is always a good day when a Liberal Democrat manifesto policy is implemented. Of the manifestos of the three major parties, only the Liberal Democrats' contained a total ban on smoking, so my colleagues and I am delighted by the outcome of today's vote. It goes further. Of the three Front-Bench speeches that opened our debate, only one&mdash;modesty forbids my saying which&mdash;unequivocally argued for a total ban, which is what the House overwhelmingly concluded, no doubt persuaded by the oratory. To sway the House, on a free vote, to a majority of more than 200 is one of my early parliamentary highlights but no doubt not the last.</p>
	<p pid="b.1383.0/3">I congratulate the Committee members who assiduously went through the Bill. I was about to say some nice things about the Under-Secretary of State for Health, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1543" name="Caroline Flint">the hon. Member for Don Valley (Caroline Flint)</phrase>, but she has left. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1476" name="Andrew Lansley">The hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley)</phrase> was uncharacteristically ungenerous in his remarks about her, because she dealt with all the smoking aspects of the Bill in Committee, although I am not sure that one praises someone for arguing for something that they do not wholly believe in. She was obviously committed throughout to a full ban, and it was poetic that she tabled the amendment that brought it in. That seems only right and proper.</p>
	<p pid="b.1383.0/4">I agree with the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire that the Bill has not been well handled by the Government. In a sense, the Under-Secretary inherited a compromise. It is good that, through the evolution of the provisions, we have ended up with a clearer position. I was just discussing signage with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1458" name="Stephen Williams">my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, West (Stephen Williams)</phrase>. Presumably we no longer need to put up signs saying that people cannot smoke in these places because it is now the law of the land that one cannot smoke in an enclosed public place, wherever it is. That is one example of how much cleaner, simpler and more effective is the total ban that the Bill now contains. I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, West, who served on his first health Bill Committee with me and made an important contribution to the debates.</p>
	<p pid="b.1383.0/5">Although the debate was predominantly about smoking, we also heard about MRSA and related issues. My hope would be that, although we have yet another initiative or taskforce&mdash;a code of practice, in this case&mdash;it will have real teeth. The record so far is disappointing. The Minister of State, Department of Health, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1690" name="Jane Kennedy">the right hon. Member for Liverpool, Wavertree (Jane Kennedy)</phrase> said that the most recent set of figures on MRSA were disappointing in that they are no lower than they were 12 months ago. I join the Government in hoping, if not with a great deal of confidence, that the code of practice will bite and that we will see real changes. That is what we all want.</p>
	<p pid="b.1383.0/6">In the event of a maverick vote&mdash;I do not know whether one is planned&mdash;I will, with great pleasure, encourage the serried ranks of my colleagues to support the Bill's Third Reading.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-02-14b.1384.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1833" speakername="David Kidney" colnum="1384"  time="021:28:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060214/debtext/60214-35.htm#60214-35_spnew2">
	<p pid="b.1384.0/1">I, too, participated in the Second Reading debate and served on the Standing Committee. It is right to praise the Ministers who steered the Bill through proceedings in this House and the Members who served on the Committee. Ministers listened to concerns expressed on Second Reading and acted in Committee. An example is the changes made on ophthalmic services. Ministers listened to cogent arguments put forward by my hon. Friends in Committee and acted on Report to make changes, the best example being on the minimum age for buying tobacco.</p>
	<p pid="b.1384.0/2">All those Members&mdash;I hasten to add that I was not one of them, so I am not praising myself&mdash;who diligently chipped away, day after day, at the arguments about the distinction between public houses that did and did not sell food have had their day. They exposed the weaknesses of that distinction and forced hon. Members to make a starker choice between the status quo and a complete ban. A pretty convincing opinion has been expressed in the House on a free vote.</p>
	<p pid="b.1384.0/3">The proceedings have therefore been a success so far. One half of the process has been completed and the Bill will be off to the other place. However, as a postscript, I want to mention my disappointment about the process in this place. Through a spark of ingenuity, I persuaded House officials to accept that amendments about breast feeding came within the Bill's remit. By a stroke of good fortune, the Committee Chairman selected them for debate. Alas, I was struck down by the timetable that was imposed on our deliberations in Committee. My new clauses on breast feeding probably constituted the one issue of substance that was never considered in Committee. The Speaker did not select them for debate today. They will not be considered in the context of the Bill in the House of Commons, but I believe that they raised important issues of public health and discrimination, which must be left for another day.</p>
	<p pid="b.1384.0/4">I do not know whether the same spark of ingenuity can strike twice and enable me to find another way to raise those important matters in the near future, but I look forward to the guidance on breast feeding from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence later this year because we have a poor record in this country&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="b.1385.0/1">The Bill is a good measure, which was improved this afternoon. It deserves a Third Reading and, in the event of a Division, I shall be pleased enthusiastically to vote for it.</p>
	<p pid="b.1385.0/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1661" name="Philip Hollobone">My hon.

Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley)</phrase> proudly to observe that he had voted in accordance with the requirements of the previous Conservative election manifesto, which specifically pledged that the Conservative party, if it formed the Government, would not introduce smoke-free legislation.

	<p pid="b.1385.2/2">The House secured an advance this afternoon. It was frequently but wrongly suggested that the House had to choose between freedom and the nanny state. That is a perfectly honourable view, but I believe it to be mistaken. My judgment is that we had a choice between acting decisively in the interests of public health and burying our heads in the sand, ignoring the evidence and declining to do our public duty. I am glad that the House voted by such an overwhelming margin in support of a complete ban on smoking in public places.</p>

	<p pid="b.1385.4/1">In a moment.</p>
	<p pid="b.1385.4/2">There are of course colleagues who, if pressed, would probably favour banning smoking per se altogether. I think that they would be wrong. There are certainly colleagues who believe that the law should not have been changed at all. They are entitled to that view, but I think that they, too, are wrong. The bulk of the argument today focused on variations on a theme of two main options, each of which was honourable, and between which we had to decide. The options were a partial ban, of one form or another, or a total ban.</p>
	<p pid="b.1385.4/3">My view is that the Bill has been improved this afternoon because a partial ban would have been undesirable. A partial ban based on a distinction between pubs that serve food and those that do not struck me as risible. It would certainly have been inequitable as between one employee and another, and it would unquestionably have been unfair to children. It would also have been a source of legal challenge, and it would demonstrably have been conducive to unfair competition between different outlets. That does not mean that it was a dishonourable proposal, but it would have had all sorts of hazardous consequences. Most Members, irrespective of party allegiance, believe that we have a duty to legislate in terms that are simple to understand, readily accepted as fair, and capable of straightforward enforcement, and I do not think that that proposal would have satisfied those criteria.</p>
	<p pid="b.1385.4/4">The alternative approach was to introduce a partial ban of the type that characterised much of this afternoon's debate, namely, a ban on smoking in pubs, clubs and restaurants, with the exception of private membership clubs. I could not for the life of me see a justification for the creation of that special, untouchable category of private membership club. We seemed to be facing an unholy alliance between the devotees of gentlemen's clubs in and around St. James's, and those who are dedicated to the continued privileges of their&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="b.1386.1/1">The House has made the right decision, and I am delighted to have got my point on the record, Madam Deputy Speaker. I know how keen you are that I should focus on the contents of the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="b.1386.1/2">I believe that the Bill's smoke-free provisions are manifestly in the interests of public health. We do not have to look into the crystal ball when we can read the book. If we look at the evidence of what has happened in Ireland, we can see an improvement. We can observe what has taken place in New York, and recognise that it has resulted in a betterment of public health. It would have been curious if we had not done what we did this afternoon. After all, Scotland is to enjoy smoke-free legislation, as is Wales, and the Government certainly intend that Northern Ireland should do so. It is very much in the public interest that England should do so as well.</p>
	<p pid="b.1386.1/3">This provision is good news for smokers and non-smokers alike. I believe that those who suggested that a ban would be bad news for smokers and their families are wrong. The overwhelming likelihood is that significant numbers of smokers will be encouraged, as a result of the passage of the Bill, to give up their habit. The notion that they would simply smoke in private houses in front of their children on any significant scale seems profoundly misconceived. Parents care about their children, and I do not believe that they would do that.</p>

	<p pid="b.1386.3/2">The great benefit of the Bill for non-smokers is that the threat of a massively increased chance of contracting either heart disease or lung cancer has been removed. This is a good Bill. One of the best and most pithy speeches in support of it was made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1613" name="George Young">my right hon.

I believe that if I owned a pub or a restaurant, I should be able to decide whether people are allowed to smoke on my premises on the basis of feedback from my customers and my employees. I do not see the need for any more nanny-state Government interference. I know that Labour Members pretend to support the free market, but although they now say they support it, I do not think that they understand it. If so many people had wanted a ban on smoking in pubs, restaurants and bars, the free market would have delivered it. Businesses survive and thrive by delivering what their customers want&mdash;that is how businesses prosper.</p>

	<p pid="b.1387.4/2">When an employer offers someone a job, he will say &quot;These are the working hours, this is the pay that you will be given, and this is the environment in which you will work.&quot; I believe that people are intelligent enough to decide for themselves whether they want to apply for and accept that job. Those on the other side of the argument appear to feel that they are far too dim to make the decision themselves, and that the Government must decide for them.</p>

	<p pid="b.1388.0/1">I believe that before he was elected the hon. Gentleman worked for Asda, which has bacon-slicing machines in its workplaces. Does the hon. Gentleman believe that, in a reputable company such as Asda, if a bacon-slicing machine was not guarded it would be up to the individual to decide whether to take a job working with that unguarded machine, thereby risking cutting off his fingers, or does he believe that there should be legislative protection&mdash;as there is, and as I believe there should be?</p>

	<p pid="b.1388.1/1">I knew that it was a mistake to give way to the hon. Gentleman. I was nervous about doing so. I am not entirely sure that his point has any relevance to the issue of smoking.</p>
	<p pid="b.1388.1/2">What worries me about the Bill is this: where will it stop? Where will it lead to? The health fascists and the zealots will not stop here&mdash;they will carry on until they have banned everybody from smoking and from eating fish and chips. There are an awful lot of dangerous jobs out there. Are we going to ban people from doing any of them? I understand that it is very dangerous to join the Army. Perhaps we will ban people from doing that.</p>

	<p pid="b.1388.11/2">Although I fear that employees will now have more harm done to them walking to work and breathing in car fumes than they ever would have suffered by breathing in tobacco smoke at work, I will conclude my contribution, Madam Deputy Speaker, given your earlier ruling. The Bill's smoking provision marks an incredibly sad moment for someone such as me, who believes in individual liberty and freedom. However, although it is sad it is not disappointing, in that it is consistent with this, the most authoritarian, illiberal and intolerant Government whom we have seen in many a year. For all the good things that may well be in this Bill, because of this intolerant, illiberal and authoritarian measure, I am unable to support it tonight.</p>

	<p pid="b.1393.2/1">I dedicate this debate on the commercial Canadian seal hunt to the memory of Tony Banks, an extraordinary campaigner for animal welfare. Today, I received a letter supporting us in the debate from Sally Banks, who has taken up the baton. She says:</p>
	<p pid="b.1393.2/2" class="indent">&quot;Tony's passionate opposition to this barbarous hunt is the reason that I have pledged to continue his work.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1393.2/3">Sally says that the issue was close to Tony's heart, so perhaps it is appropriate that on Valentine's day we are holding a debate on the massacre of seal pups for their fur&mdash;appropriate as long as we win the argument and achieve the ban that we all want.</p>
	<p pid="b.1393.2/4">Last year, the Humane Society of the United States witnessed and filmed the killing of harp seals to the north of Prince Edward island. This morning, I watched the film again; it does not make for easy viewing. It starts with a seemingly endless shot of a seal pup gurgling slowly to death in its own blood. I challenge anyone to watch that film and not be sickened, and not to want to do all that we can to stop such barbaric slaughter. The main contribution that we can make in this country is to block the trade in seal products that fuels that slaughter. I shall discuss the legal case for such a ban, but first I shall set out the arguments for a ban and, secondly, the Government's opposition to the seal hunt, which has already been expressed in a previous Adjournment debate in 2003.</p>
	<p pid="b.1393.2/5">The callous routine brutality used by those who kill the seals must be seen to be believed. In that film, the sealers can be seen running from seal to seal, hitting as many as they can, as quickly as they can. They do not even stop to see whether the seals that they have hit are dead. Those in the film show as much regard for the rules as they do for the seals.</p>
	<p pid="b.1393.2/6">The Canadian Government&mdash;I have a letter to this effect&mdash;claim that the hunt is humanely conducted, but I have detailed quotes from two experts who viewed the film footage. Dr. Donald Broom, professor of animal welfare at Cambridge university, notes that many of the seals were still conscious after being clubbed. The chief veterinary officer of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, Dr. Steve Cheetham, was appalled and talks of pain and suffering and the incompetence of the sealers, but that is clear to anyone who looks at the film, the end shot of which shows a seal struggling, exhausted, in a pool of blood and icy water.</p>
	<p pid="b.1393.2/7">The conduct of the hunt is partly due to the way in which the Canadian Government design the quota system. An overall limit is set, so the sealers race around to kill as many seals as they can individually and by boat until the total is met. The hunt is inherently cruel. Many people, probably most people, do not even realise that the hunt still happens each year. They think that it ended back in the 1980s, but in fact twice as many seals are killed today as back then and it is the largest, most brutal slaughter of marine mammals anywhere on the planet.</p>
	<p pid="b.1393.2/8">In 1983, a long time back, the European Economic Community banned the import of furs and products made from whitecoat seals&mdash;new-born harp seals until they begin to moult when they are just 10 days old&mdash;and bluebacks, which are young hooded seals. The sealers now cynically wait a few days until the harp seals are approximately four weeks old&mdash;still pups, unable to swim and have never eaten a solid meal. In the United States, it is illegal to trade in marine mammal products and there is no Canadian market, but those clubbed seal pups have moulted, so their skins are legally imported into the European Union and the United Kingdom. The crux of tonight's argument is to stop that trade.</p>
	<p pid="b.1393.2/9">The last time that the Canadian seal hunt was debated in the House was on 4 November 2003, when the then Minister for Trade and Investment&mdash;now the Solicitor-General&mdash;stated that the Government</p>
	<p pid="b.1393.2/10" class="indent">&quot;do not accept the need for any seal cull.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1393.2/11">He continued,</p>
	<p pid="b.1393.2/12" class="indent">&quot;we do not accept that clubbing is acceptable.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1393.2/13">He said that it</p>
	<p pid="b.1393.2/14" class="indent">&quot;does Canada's reputation a great deal of damage.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report,</i> 4 November 2003; Vol. 412, c. 219&ndash;21WH.]</p>
	<p pid="b.1393.2/15">He also said that the Canadian Government had been asked to consider a total ban on the commercial seal hunt. Since that debate, more than 600,000 seal pups have been clubbed to death or shot on the ice floes of eastern Canada during two more years of the commercial hunt. I will not quote the horrific description of a seal being skinned alive while still conscious, given by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1829" name="David Amess">the hon. Member for Southend, West (Mr. Amess)</phrase> in that debate a couple of years ago. Many seals escape from being shot to die in agony from their injuries.</p>
	<p pid="b.1393.2/16">It is abundantly clear that the Canadian Government continue to ignore our Government's overtures, as well as public opinion, including that of the majority of their own citizens who want an end to the hunt, according to a survey commissioned by the International Fund for Animal Welfare in Canada in 2005. The Canadian Government also ignore evidence on conservation and biodiversity issues. I have here a review by Professor Stephen Harris, who shows that the Canadian modelling of the seal population and quotas is unsafe and that there is a serious threat to the survival of the seal population.</p>
	<p pid="b.1393.2/17">To get to the heart of the matter, what should our Government do? What are we asking? What action do we want? Part of the problem with the United Kingdom's position is that by continuing to allow the import of seal products that come from the hunt, the Government are sending out a mixed message to Canada. On one hand, they say that they disapprove of the hunt, while on the other, they are saying that it is okay to trade in the products. It is not, and until we ban the import and trade in all the hunt's products, we too have the seals' blood on our hands.</p>

	<p pid="b.1394.0/1">I pay tribute to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1593" name="Vernon Coaker">my hon. Friend and to my hon. Friend the Member for Gedling (Mr. Coaker)</phrase> for the tireless work that they have done on this issue. Is she aware that, if we were to implement some sort of trade ban, it would be widely supported in Canada? I say that as someone who lived in Canada for nine years and has extensive links there. In fact, I am a Canadian citizen, as well as a UK citizen. What happens is absolutely horrifying. I am sure that there would be widespread support in Canada for a trade ban.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-02-14b.1395.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1373" speakername="Judy Mallaber" colnum="1395"  time="022:02:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060214/debtext/60214-39.htm#60214-39_spnew0">
	<p pid="b.1395.0/1">I thank my hon. Friend for that extremely helpful information.</p>
	<p pid="b.1395.0/2">The trade has been banned in the United State since 1972. Greenland, which carries out its own indigenous seal hunt, recently stopped all imports of seal skins from Canada. I understand that that happened just after pictures of the Canadian seal hunt were broadcast on national TV there. If the film that I watched this morning was shown on our television, the Minister would be inundated with requests to ban hunting, although I am not sure that our television companies would wish to show such horrific filming.</p>
	<p pid="b.1395.0/3">Earlier this week, the Italian Government announced a temporary ban on the import of seal products and announced their introduction of a Bill to end the trade permanently. Mexico decided last week to prohibit the trade in all marine mammal products, and Belgium now has a licensing scheme for imports, but has made it clear that no licences will be issued and that it will also bring in comprehensive legislation.</p>
	<p pid="b.1395.0/4">The case for banning the import of, and trade in, seal products is now overwhelming. A recent opinion poll commissioned by Respect for Animals found that 79 per cent. of people in Britain want the seal hunt to be banned and that 73 per cent. agree that the Government should act to ban the import of seal products. I pay tribute to Respect for Animals, which has provided me with information for this debate. It is based in <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1593" name="Vernon Coaker">the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Gedling (Mr. Coaker)</phrase>. If he did not have to act as a Trappist monk as a Whip, I know that he would wish to be up here introducing the debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.1395.0/5">I specifically wish to ask my hon. Friend the Minister to confirm that he has seen the legal opinion obtained by Respect for Animals and IFAW and given by Philippe Sands QC, one of the world's leading experts on international law and European trade. It shows in great detail the legal basis for his clear and strong view that the UK, under World Trade Organisation rules, can legally ban the import of harp and hooded seal products.</p>

Friend the Member for Gedling (Mr. Coaker)</phrase> and to many others in Respect for Animals who have campaigned on this issue. Is she aware of the similar debate on the ban on cat and dog fur imports in which the European Commissioner responsible said that, in his view, it was a matter for national Governments to decide whether they would prevent the import of such products? We do not need to be concerned about that aspect of the issue.</p>

	<p pid="b.1395.2/1">That is extremely helpful; it confirms one of the points that I was about to come to. I am well aware of all the work that my hon. Friend has done on the issue.</p>
	<p pid="b.1395.2/2">I ask my hon. Friend the Minister to confirm that he has seen the legal opinion and to say whether he has a preliminary opinion on it&mdash;I know that it is still out with the lawyers&mdash;and when he expects to respond. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1462" name="Nick Palmer">my hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe (Dr. Palmer)</phrase> said, some are trying to persuade the Minister that the United Kingdom does not have competence and that this is a matter for the European Union. The fact that that point was not accepted in the case of cat and dog fur products is extremely helpful.</p>
	<p pid="b.1395.2/3">The legal opinion that I have specifically states:</p>
	<p pid="b.1395.2/4" class="indent">&quot;The adoption of a unilateral extension of the current ban by a Member State would raise substantively the same issues as a matter of WTO law (but not as a matter of European Community law)&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.1395.2/5">The opinion that Philippe Sands gives, which is about the basis for the extension of a ban by the European Union, also applies in exactly the same way to member states. He argues:</p>
	<p pid="b.1395.2/6" class="indent">&quot;It is strongly arguable that an extension by the EU&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="b.1395.2/7">and therefore by member states&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="b.1395.2/8" class="indent">&quot;of the current ban, to cover older harp and hooded seals will be compatible with the rules of the WTO on the basis that, although it would almost certainly constitute a restriction on trade . . . it could be justified under Article XX(a) on the grounds that it is a measure necessary to protect morals. We also consider that, in the alternative, there may also be good arguments that the measure may be justifiable under Article XX(b) as a measure necessary to protect the health of animals and/or under Article XX(g) as a measure relating to the conservation of exhaustible natural resources&quot;.</p>

	<p pid="b.1396.0/1">The Canadian Government often argue that this barbaric practice continues in order to protect fish stocks and the recovery of those of Atlantic cod. However, recent global studies show that marine mammals very rarely conflict with the fish that are commercially fished. There is relatively no overlap, so that argument does not hold water.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-02-14b.1396.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1373" speakername="Judy Mallaber" colnum="1396"  time="022:02:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060214/debtext/60214-39.htm#60214-39_spnew8">
	<p pid="b.1396.5/1">I absolutely agree. Unfortunately, the Minister has to be able to counter all the legal arguments that have been made on why we cannot enforce a ban, so we are trying to prove that we can. We have a legal opinion that shows that we can do that in the primary argument made by Philippe Sands about protecting public morals.</p>
	<p pid="b.1396.5/2">The ethical argument for banning the seal hunt is made comprehensively and with great authority by Rev. Professor Andrew Linzey in the pamphlet &quot;Public Morality and the Canadian Seal Hunt&quot;. He talks about how the activity is devoid of moral justification and his detailed conclusions have been endorsed by more than 70 leading academics, theologians and philosophers from 14 countries. The other aspects of the legal opinion by Philippe Sands are detailed and comprehensively argue why, under several strands of the WTO rules, it would be completely possible for us to go ahead with the ban.</p>
	<p pid="b.1396.5/3">The matter is more critical than ever this year because the melting of the ice will present a real threat to seals' whelping areas in Canada. Will the Minister call on the Canadian Government to respond to the situation by banning the hunt this year as a matter of emergency? I urge him to accept the legal arguments to which I have referred and ban the appalling trade.</p>
	<p pid="b.1396.5/4">The Canadians will say that they are arguing for their sealing community. Sealers are fishermen who make a small sum by killing seals for just a few days a year. The activity is dangerous, dehumanising and provides them with less than 5 per cent. of their annual income. Some 1,200 sealers have died during the history of the seal hunt and two died as recently as 2002. The Canadian Government already have measures in place on fishing diversity and compensation for fishermen that could be applied to the sealing industry, so their argument does not hold water.</p>
	<p pid="b.1396.5/5">The ban in other countries has not been challenged, so I do not think that a ban that we enforced would necessarily be challenged. I know that the Minister will be given endless arguments by civil servants and lawyers about why it would be legally impossible to enforce a ban, but we have strong legal advice that suggests that it would be possible. We will have to bite the bullet, go ahead with a ban and challenge the Canadians on the matter. They have not taken it up with other countries, so there is no real reason to expect them to do that with us. We should thus go ahead with a ban.</p>
	<p pid="b.1396.5/6">Two early-day motions before the House refer to the seal hunt. Early-day motion 237 has been signed by 182 Members. It notes that trade data show that thousands of seal skins were imported into the UK between 1995 and 2003 and calls on the Government to prohibit the import of all seal products into the UK.</p>
	<p pid="b.1396.5/7">Early-day motion 1416, which was tabled more recently&mdash;in only the past month, I believe&mdash;already has 118 signatures. It honours the life and work of Tony Banks. At the time of Tony's death, he had started a new initiative and was working with Respect for Animals to encourage people and retail outlets to boycott Canadian seafood products. I understand that most of the trade into this country goes straight out again to other European countries, so we probably cannot create pressure as easily as we could through a consumer boycott. The Government must thus put the main pressure directly on the Canadian Government through a legal ban. They must also try to persuade other European countries to go ahead with a ban.</p>
	<p pid="b.1396.5/8">Early-day motion 1416 also calls on the Government to ban the trade in harp and hooded seal products. As Sally Banks wrote to me:</p>
	<p pid="b.1396.5/9" class="indent">&quot;the most fitting tribute to Tony is to achieve a ban of this vile Hunt.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1396.5/10">We have put forward arguments on how the Minister can achieve that. On behalf of the hon. Members who signed the early-day motions and those who would like to sign them, but cannot because of their ministerial positions, on behalf of the British and Canadian public&mdash;<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1937" name="Rob Marris">my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris)</phrase> mentioned Canadian views&mdash;whose attitude has been shown in opinion polls both in Canada and this country, on behalf of simple human decency and, finally, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1443" name="Brooks Newmark">the hon. Member for Braintree (Mr. Newmark)</phrase> pointed out, on behalf of the seal cubs that are brutally clubbed to death each year and have no voice of their own, will the Government take the simple legal and effective step of banning the import of all harp and hooded seal products?</p>

	<p pid="b.1398.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1373" name="Judy Mallaber">my hon. Friend the Member for Amber Valley (Judy Mallaber)</phrase> on securing this debate. This is a subject of long-standing public interest and one about which many hon. Members feel strongly. In addition to my hon. Friend, I acknowledge <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1462" name="Nick Palmer">the interventions by my hon. Friends the Members for Broxtowe (Dr. Palmer)</phrase>, for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor) and for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris), and by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1443" name="Brooks Newmark">the hon. Member for Braintree (Mr. Newmark)</phrase>. I acknowledge, too, the interest shown in <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1593" name="Vernon Coaker">the debate by my hon. Friend the Members for Gedling (Mr. Coaker)</phrase>, for Carlisle (Mr. Martlew), for Dudley, North (Mr. Austin) and for Eccles (Ian Stewart), and by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2012" name="Thomas McAvoy">my right hon. Friend the Member for Rutherglen and Hamilton, West (Mr. McAvoy)</phrase>. No doubt many more hon. Members would wish to contribute if this were a longer debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.1398.0/2">The strength of opinion on this issue is reflected in early-day motions 237 and 1416. Early-day motion 1416 recognises the great work in the field of animal welfare carried out by the late Tony Banks, and calls on the Government to prohibit the trade in all harp and hooded seal products in the UK as soon as possible. I am sure that hon. Members would want me to join my hon. Friend the Member for Amber Valley by endorsing the contribution made to the House by our former colleague and paying tribute to the passion and humour that he brought to the causes for which he fought.</p>
	<p pid="b.1398.0/3">I assure the House that the Government make their opposition to the seal hunt known to the Canadian authorities on a regular basis. We maintain an active interest in issues surrounding conservation and sustainability, animal welfare and control of the trade in seal products. I met Mark Glover and Nicky Brookes from Respect for Animals, together with their colleague, Rebecca Aldworth from the Canada section of the Humane Society of the United States, on 15 June last year, and we had an informative exchange on these subjects. Officials from the Foreign Office have since had regular contact with both organisations. I am aware of the results of the opinion poll conducted on behalf of Respect for Animals on attitudes towards the seal hunt in the UK, to which my hon. Friend referred and which clearly indicate that a majority of the people interviewed for the survey believe that the hunt should not be allowed to continue. Almost three quarters were in favour of a ban on seal products in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="b.1398.0/4">The UK and Canada have common traditions and attitudes. We share close historical links and a strong relationship, which involves working together in a number of international forums. Canada is a liberal country with values similar to ours. The association between Canada and seal clubbing clearly does the reputation of Canadians no good at all. We hope that they will recognise that soon and end all commercial seal hunting. We will continue to press the Canadian Government on that issue. As hon. Members are aware, the hunt focuses on two main species&mdash;the harp seal and the hooded seal. The Canadian Government argue that the commercial seal hunt quota is based on sound conservation principles to maintain a sustainable seal population. They state, too, that the hunt provides valuable income to a large number of sealers and their families in Eastern Canada. They argue that the harp seal population has almost tripled since 1970 and their most recent estimate puts the north-west Atlantic stock of harp seals at 5.9 million animals. As my hon. Friend said, the Canadian seal hunt is regulated by quotas set by the Canadian Government and based on the total allowable catch&mdash;TAC in the terminology of the fishing industry&mdash;which hon. Members may find inappropriate or offensive given what happens in the hunt. The TAC for 2003&ndash;05 was set at 975,000 harp seals to meet the Canadian Government's plan to reduce the current population of harp seals from 5.9 million to 4.7 million by 2006.</p>

	<p pid="b.1399.1/1">I am well aware of those different views, which is why I made it clear that the estimate was made by the Canadian Government, who believe that the hooded seal population is 470,000. A new population survey was conducted last year, but the results are not yet available. The 2006 TAC for hooded seals is 10,000, and the figure has been set at that level for a number of years. With respect to hooded seals, however, it is our understanding that a total of only about 500 have been taken in Canada since 1999.</p>

Is my hon. Friend the Minister aware of the strength of feeling on the matter among hon. Members?

	<p pid="b.1399.3/1">I shall come to that in a moment.</p>
	<p pid="b.1399.3/2">The methods used in hunting seals have long been mired in controversy. Canada's Royal Commission on Seals and Sealing found that those methods compared favourably to those used to kill any other wild or domestic animal. Despite that, it is alleged that thousands of seals are killed each year inhumanely. Respect for Animals claims that in 2005, 40 per cent. of the seals were skinned while still alive.</p>
	<p pid="b.1399.3/3">The Canadian Veterinary Medical Association claims that 98 per cent. of seals taken during the seal hunt are killed in an acceptably humane manner. Even if that figure is accurate&mdash;it is the subject of much dispute&mdash;this still means that a significant number of animals are not killed effectively. We fully support continued attention being paid by the veterinary profession to the conduct of the seal hunt. If seal hunts are to continue, it is vital that the Canadian Government closely regulate and monitor the hunt to ensure that no seals suffer improper treatment or are killed inhumanely.</p>
	<p pid="b.1399.3/4">My hon. Friend the Member for Amber Valley referred to the European seals directive, which was introduced in 1983 and extended in 1989 prior to the entry into force of the World Trade Organisation agreement on 1 January 1995. As she knows, it protects harp and hooded seals from over-exploitation but requires member states only to prohibit the commercial importation of skins and other listed products of certain harp and hooded seal pups. The prohibition, rightly, does not apply to seal products resulting from traditional hunting by the Inuit people, as it recognises that that forms an important part of their traditional way of life and economy and does not have a negative impact on seal populations.</p>

	<p pid="b.1400.1/1">If the hon. Gentleman will forgive me, I have only a few minutes in which to answer questions on the legal matters raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Amber Valley.</p>
	<p pid="b.1400.1/2">The seals directive was transposed into UK legislation by means of the Import of Seal Skins Regulations 1996. The regulations prohibit the commercial importation of raw, tanned or dressed furskins, and other products from whitecoat harp and blueback hooded seal pups. I should explain that a whitecoat pup is a harp seal up to approximately two and a half weeks old, and a blueback is a hooded seal up to approximately 16 months old. As my hon. Friend pointed out, the issue is that sealers wait longer than two and a half weeks and are then free to take the animals.</p>
	<p pid="b.1400.1/3">We are aware that a number of non-governmental organisations and members of the public are calling for an extension of the directive to cover products from all harp and hooded seals, not just whitecoat and blueback pups. However, the view of the European Commission is that there is currently no scientific basis to warrant an extension of the seals directive on conservation grounds. According to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources' red list of threatened species, neither the harp nor hooded seal species are classified as endangered.</p>
	<p pid="b.1400.1/4">We understand that there is evidence that ice conditions this year in the Gulf of St. Lawrence are extremely poor, and that a recent ice map of the area compared to the same time last year shows considerably less ice, which is generally thin and broken up. This is cause for concern and we will continue to monitor the situation closely.</p>
	<p pid="b.1400.1/5">My hon. Friend mentioned the situation in Belgium. It is my understanding that the Belgian Government have introduced a licensing requirement for the importation of seal, cat and dog fur products, but that is not a ban on the importation of seal products; it merely imposes a requirement to apply for a licence on anyone wishing to import such an item. They have a royal decree that proposes to introduce a labelling requirement for cat, dog and seal fur products, but it is still at a fairly early stage. I have asked officials to look into the approach that is being adopted in Belgium. It appears, however, that the Belgian Government have concerns about whether a ban could be justified under both European Union and World Trade Organisation rules. I shall talk to officials about the matter.</p>
	<p pid="b.1400.1/6">My hon. Friend raised the question of the legal opinion commissioned by Respect for Animals and the International Fund for Animal Welfare on the EU member state ban on the importation of seal products and its compatibility with the WTO agreement. I have seen the opinion. I am not legally qualified, and it is currently being considered by officials. We acknowledge that there are arguments both for and against WTO compatibility of any extended important ban. As the opinion itself notes, determining WTO compatibility would turn on the nature and scope of the precise measures. I am happy to have further dialogue with hon. Members, NGOs and interested parties on the legal opinion.</p>
