	<p pid="a.1633.6/1">The current financial mechanisms to incentivise renewable electricity are the renewables obligation and the feed-in tariff scheme. We are currently undertaking reviews of the RO banding and the FIT scheme, and the renewable heat incentive is due to go ahead this year.

However, despite the fact that we all recognise that such projects are vital to our efforts to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels, they often struggle to raise sustainable funds. Will the Secretary of State tell me how he expects projects such as the green investment bank to help support community renewables projects such as these?</p>

	<p pid="a.1633.8/1">Access to finance is clearly a major issue for projects such as those in my hon. Friend&#8217;s constituency, and the green investment bank will certainly play a role eventually. Our FIT scheme reforms have focused on ensuring that money goes to community schemes rather than City speculators. The banks are increasingly taking a favourable attitude to this matter and finance is increasingly available from the high street banks. I am pleased therefore to confirm that yesterday the Treasury opened a consultation on the provision of other finance and on ensuring that enterprise investment</p>
	<p pid="a.1633.8/2">schemes and venture capital trusts investing in FIT schemes through community-interest companies, co-operative societies and community benefit societies continue to qualify for improved support, as will those generating electricity from micro-hydro schemes. I hope that this change will focus investment on schemes that benefit local communities.</p>

One of the main issues it has raised has been the need for clear guidance for planners on how to deal with small wind systems. Will he tell me what discussions he and his ministerial colleagues have had with the Department for Communities and Local Government on this issue? In particular, would any guidance include specification of acceptable noise levels for these small&#8212;less than 50 kW&#8212;wind systems?</p>

	<p pid="a.1634.3/1">I respect the right hon. Gentleman for standing up for his constituency&#8212;I would expect nothing less&#8212;but the responses to the FIT consultation were not as binary as he suggests. People did not give yes or no answers. We had to take a decision on the FIT programme for a simple reason, which was that, unfortunately, the planning that went into the announcement assumed that there would be no large-scale solar projects for three years. If the right hon. Gentleman, who was a Minister in the previous Government&#8212;as I well remember&#8212;is prepared to take responsibility for those assumptions, I would be very pleased, but sadly I am not. We have had to amend those assumptions and ensure that we have an affordable scheme that can provide steady growth&#8212;</p>

We also see the ambient temperature of Ministry of Defence buildings, such as the one in my constituency near Corsham, at 25&#176;, which means that civil servants have to sit with their jackets off, because otherwise it would be too warm.

As I mentioned previously, we have a working group with BIS looking exactly at what help is necessary for the energy-intensive industries. It is also worth pointing out that, particularly when we are emerging from such a deep recession, it is jobs in new industries, rather than merely the recovery of the old industries, that tend to drive the overall recovery. That was the story of the 1930s: we did not regain our prosperity by reversing the declines that had happened in the old industries that had caused the recession; we built entirely new industries.

	<p pid="a.1644.5/1">The big six seem very quick to put prices up, but they act much more slowly to reduce their prices when wholesale prices fall. There are alternatives out there, such as the social enterprise Ebico, which supplies energy on a not-for-profit basis. What more can the Secretary of State do to make customers aware that they do not need to stick with the big six if they are being ripped off?</p>

We have seen these huge price increases, and customers are rightly confused and angry, so what is the Secretary of State going to do right now to tackle this problem? The electricity market reform is all very well, but we could deal with issues relating to doorstep selling and smart meters. There is action that he could take now, so I would like to hear what he is planning to do to help consumers today.</p>

That means that we will be providing a legal underpinning for the scheme which will help our poorest consumers and those most at risk in fuel poverty. We are also moving on energy saving and moving to increase competition in the market. We are trying to provide assurance and an increased ability to switch, and to simplify tariffs. That is quite an agenda, and none of it was being undertaken by the previous Government.</p>

	<p pid="a.1652.6/1">In relation to the Humber ports, the Minister talked earlier about the &#163;60 million that is available for the development of green energy on the portside, but that was an announcement by the previous Labour Government of course.

	<p pid="a.1652.7/1">The difference we have made is that that funding is linked specifically to manufacturing projects, rather than to speculative improvements in ports. In addition, &#163;70 million has been brought forward in Scotland, and there will be perhaps more in Wales, so we are very keen to see specific projects. Siemens is looking at the opportunities on the north side of the Humber in Hull, where very good progress is being made, and there will be a fixed formula for establishing exactly how much Government support is going to be available for private sector investment.</p>

	<p pid="a.1652.9/2">The fact that it is looking at re-establishing itself in the UK is enormously encouraging, and we are in conversations with the company. Clearly, Sheerness as a site is not an assisted area and therefore would not benefit from the subsidies that have been found for assisted areas, but it has other advantages, of which I am sure Vestas is well aware from its discussions with my hon. Friend, and I very much hope that it takes that decision to go forward.</p>

Many of the barriers to the green deal and take-up of energy efficiency are not just financial but involve practical measures such as clearing the loft. A community response to overcoming those barriers is often the very best way. My officials will be working to see how we can spread the expertise of GreenWin right across the country.</p>

The terrible pain that they must still feel will be shared across the House. That anyone could have tried to exploit their raw grief to sell newspapers shows exactly why yesterday&#8217;s debate was so important.

When will we have a statement setting out how the inquiry will be established, who will chair it and what its powers will be? Can we be assured that it will cover the culture and practices that led to what happened, the nature of regulation, and the relationship between the police and the media?</p>
	<p pid="a.1657.3/4">Can we have an urgent statement from the Home Secretary? The Prevention of Corruption Act 1906 makes it an offence for anyone to pay money to a police</p>
	<p pid="a.1657.3/5">officer or for any officer to receive it. The House wants to be assured now that whatever the current investigation reveals, including on the allegation that the Prime Minister&#8217;s former director of communications sanctioned payments to police officers while he was at the</p>
	<p pid="a.1657.3/6" class="italic">News of the World</p>
	<p pid="a.1657.3/7">, this practice is no longer happening anywhere. The Home Secretary has so far been conspicuous by her absence. It is time she came to the House to answer questions.</p>
	<p pid="a.1657.3/8">Can we have an urgent statement from the Secretary of State for Culture, Olympics, Media and Sport on the BSkyB bid? It was clear yesterday that the House will no longer accept the course of action that he has been intent upon. In the light of what has been revealed about the activities at News International, this matter must now be referred to the Competition Commission.</p>
	<p pid="a.1657.3/9">Last week, I asked for a statement by the Secretary of State for Transport on the award of the contract to build 1,200 Thameslink train carriages to Siemens. It turns out that at the same time as the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions was in Madrid telling British employers to give British jobs to British workers, his Cabinet colleagues were having to explain why they had given a contract for British trains to German workers. Instead of blaming the procurement process, the Ministers who took this decision need to explain what they propose to do, given that this week Bombardier announced that 1,429 skilled workers in Derby, long the proud home of train manufacturing in Britain, will lose their jobs. So much for all the Government&#8217;s empty words about British manufacturing.</p>
	<p pid="a.1657.3/10">In welcoming the &#163;38 million in British aid announced this week to help the millions facing starvation in the horn of Africa, may I ask for a debate on the food crisis affecting our fellow human beings there? The world cannot make it rain, but we can and must lend a hand.</p>
	<p pid="a.1657.3/11">May we have a statement on housing benefit from the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government so that he can explain the letter that he authorised his private secretary to send to the Prime Minister&#8217;s office in January? It revealed that the Government&#8217;s housing benefit plans could make 40,000 people homeless, cut house building and end up not saving money but costing it. Yet while raising those &#8220;very serious practical issues&#8221; in private, the Communities Secretary was saying in public that he backed what the Government were doing.</p>
	<p pid="a.1657.3/12">The House also wants to know which Minister knew what and when about that information, which was clearly available back in January but was not revealed during the passage of the Welfare Reform Bill. Here is another policy that just has not been thought through. Only Conservative Ministers could come up with a housing policy that makes people homeless and costs taxpayers more.</p>
	<p pid="a.1657.3/13">Finally, may we have a debate on prime ministerial authority? Asked two weeks ago about the threat by his Tory MEPs to oppose tougher carbon emission targets, the Prime Minister promised the House that he would &#8220;work on&#8221; them. What happened? Such is his diminished influence that a majority of them simply ignored his pleas and voted against a binding 30% reduction this week.</p>
	<p pid="a.1657.3/14">I have a suggestion that might help. The next time Tory MEPs are rebelling on climate change, perhaps the Communities Secretary could offer to assist. Famous for his lecturing of local government about belt-tightening,</p>
	<p pid="a.1657.3/15">it seems that he has recently replaced his &#163;20,000 fuel-efficient ministerial Prius with a &#163;70,000 Jaguar. Perhaps he could offer to drive over to Strasbourg and remind his Tory colleagues just how important it is to cut carbon emissions.</p>

	<p pid="a.1659.0/1">I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman. The Deputy Leader of the House and myself travel almost everywhere by bicycle, so we are making our contribution to energy saving, and we have a very small carbon footprint between us.</p>
	<p pid="a.1659.0/2">May I begin with the serious issue that the right hon. Gentleman raised? Yesterday&#8217;s debate marked a sea change in the House&#8217;s perception of certain sections of the press, which I think reflects a much broader change in how the public now view the allegations. They have been made even worse by the allegations in the press today that the families of soldiers who have fallen had their phones tapped. It was a good debate, because the mover of the motion and many others who spoke from throughout the House understood and recognised that it was not a party political issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.1659.0/3">The Government are now looking at two inquiries. The first is on the specifics of the original police investigation and why it did not uncover some of the allegations that are now emerging, and the second is on the wider issue of media ethics, to which the right hon. Gentleman referred. There is a relationship between those two inquiries, which means that we will have to give careful thought to their terms of reference and their relationship with the ongoing police investigation. We will consult widely on the terms of reference, including with the Joint Committee on privacy, party leaders and the Cabinet Secretary. We want to get this right, and we plan to make an announcement to the House before Parliament rises for the summer recess. I will pass the right hon. Gentleman&#8217;s questions on to the Home Secretary, who will be in the House today for Second Reading of the Police (Detention and Bail) Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.1659.0/4">On BSkyB, as the right hon. Gentleman knows, the Secretary of State for Culture, Olympics, Media and Sport is acting in a quasi-judicial way, and it is quite right that he carries out his role in that manner without any interference from anyone else in the Government. As the right hon. Gentleman will know, my right hon. Friend was on the Treasury Bench for the debate yesterday and will have heard what the House said. Yesterday&#8217;s debate was about newspapers not being above the law, and it is quite right that Ministers are not above the law either.</p>
	<p pid="a.1659.0/5">On Bombardier, the right hon. Gentleman sought to dismiss the way in which the procurement process was designed and initiated by the previous Government. As I have just said, newspapers are not above the law, but Ministers are not above the law either. We are bound by the criteria that the previous Government set out, and we must continue with the decision that has been made according to those criteria. Of course, any job losses are regrettable, but Bombardier had previously advised the Government that it expected to make 1,000 redundancies at this time, regardless of the outcome of the Thameslink procurement, as several of its existing orders had reached completion. Derby is a priority area for the European regional development fund under the east midlands</p>
	<p pid="a.1659.0/6">programme. I understand that a large amount of the &#163;6.6 million ERDF funding available for Derby to use for suitable projects is still available, and there are six bids from Derby for the regional growth fund.</p>
	<p pid="a.1659.0/7">Turning to the Department for International Development, the shadow Leader of the House will have seen the written ministerial statement by the Secretary of State for International Development on <phrase class="date" code="2011-07-06">6 July</phrase>. He is holding a briefing on the horn of Africa at 5 pm this evening in room 15 and will update colleagues if they go along. The shadow Leader of the House will have seen in the ministerial statement that the Government have contributed help with food for 1.3 million Ethiopians for three months as well as helping to tackle the problem of hundreds of thousands of starving children.</p>
	<p pid="a.1659.0/8">The Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government has replied to the shadow Secretary of State and placed the letter in the Library. The letter deals with all the questions raised by the shadow Leader of the House. I note in particular that Secretary of State says that</p>
	<p pid="a.1659.0/9">&#8220;since it was written, the Government has said it will be looking at transitional arrangements for particularly hard cases. We are putting in a series of policy measures to assist local authorities with that transition, and to provide considerable financial support to tackle homelessness.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.1659.0/10">He goes on to say:</p>
	<p pid="a.1659.0/11">&#8220;I&#8230;hope Her Majesty&#8217;s Opposition can support&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.1659.0/12">the benefit cap,</p>
	<p pid="a.1659.0/13">&#8220;not least since it was in the Labour Party&#8217;s general election manifesto.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.1659.0/14">The matter of Conservative MEPs and climate change was covered in the exchange that just took place in Department of Energy and Climate Change questions. Of course, we are disappointed about the European Parliament vote, but I am sorry that when it came to voting on the amended report as a whole, Conservative MEPs mostly voted in favour, and Labour MEPs largely voted against.</p>

	<p pid="a.1660.0/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2011-05-12">12 May</phrase>, the House tasked the Members&#8217; Allowances Committee to review the Parliamentary Standards Act 2009. I welcome the Leader of the House&#8217;s support in doing so, but there is a motion on today&#8217;s Order Paper that suggests, on the face of it, that the remit of the Committee should be restricted to looking at expenses. It looks that way, but I feel sure that that is not what the Leader of the House is seeking to do, and that he wants to ensure that a full review takes place. I just invite him, to save time this afternoon, to make it absolutely clear that the motion will not restrict the Committee from conducting a full review into all aspects of the 2009 Act.</p>

	<p pid="a.1660.1/1">Following the debate that my hon. Friend initiated, we had informal discussions with him, and I tabled a motion earlier this week that, as I understood it, met all his concerns and provided the right remit. I was very sorry that the motion was blocked on two occasions, and of course, amendments to it have been tabled, which automatically blocks it. I cannot undertake to find time between now and the end of the Session to debate this particularly important issue. I very much hope that those who blocked the motion or tabled amendments to it will think again, and enable us to make progress and set up the Committee as it was originally envisaged.</p>

	<p pid="a.1661.4/1">The Leader of the House has been extremely supportive in my many and varied disputes with the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority and I am genuinely grateful to him for that. I copied him into my recent letter complaining that my constituency office rent for the last quarter of 2010, which was submitted in December, has still not been paid. Since then I have been asked by IPSA, on two occasions, to resubmit the same claim each with a different and fictional date attached so that the computer can cope with it. The situation is descending into a cross between a &#8220;Carry On&#8221; movie and a Kafka novel. If the Government are so keen to clean up the so-called mess left behind by the last Government, he could do an awful lot worse than clean up the mess that is the failed and failing organisation that is IPSA?</p>

	<p pid="a.1661.5/1">I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman has been diverted from his serious duties of representing his constituents in this House by the issues that he has just described. I will raise it with IPSA later today and see whether we can resolve it. I draw to his attention, and to the attention of the House, the National Audit Office report on IPSA, which was published today and, I hope, will provide the basis for a more satisfactory relationship between the House and IPSA. The report refers to the &#8220;adversarial relationship&#8221; that has developed between IPSA and many MPs, and I hope that some of the recommendations in the report will enable us to move on to a more harmonious basis.</p>

	<p pid="a.1663.5/1">I agree that we should do all we can to support the UK film and media industry, which is one of our success stories. There will be an opportunity a week today to raise this issue with the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, in either an oral question or a topical question, but in the meantime, I will draw the hon.

	<p pid="a.1672.4/1">Last week, the Deputy Prime Minister made the following announcement at a conference in Birmingham:</p>
	<p pid="a.1672.4/2">&#8220;We will localise&#8230;business rates. No ifs, no buts, no maybes.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.1672.4/3">The localisation of business rates is a key policy change that could make the difference to the city of Salford of a loss of &#163;36 million, while the City of London could gain &#163;550 million. May we therefore have an urgent debate on the Government&#8217;s intentions for local government finance, so that Members can ask the questions that they should have been able to ask last week?</p>

	<p pid="a.1672.5/1">If the hon. Lady looks at the coalition agreement, she will see a clear statement of our intention to make local government finance more independent of central Government. We will be consulting in due course on the specific issue of business rates.</p>

	<p pid="a.1672.6/1">I am saddened to tell the Leader of the House that the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Hull branch is due to close because of funding problems. May we have a debate on the big society and its practical implications for the vast parts of this country that are poorer and more deprived and do not have the same access to funding and resources as other parts?</p>

The RSPCA has one of the broadest bases of funding in the country. It is a very well supported and well respected organisation, and I was sorry to hear about that particular decision. As I said a few moments ago, we have made available</p>

The Committee of the whole House will then follow until no later than 5 o&#8217;clock, with a final hour for the remaining stages, to be completed by 6 o&#8217;clock. The motion also provides for programming of the later stages of the Bill in this House on consideration of Lords amendments, should there be any. I fully recognise that today&#8217;s timetable is a tight one. None the less, given the very specific issue that the House is being asked to consider, I am satisfied that the House, and in due course the other place, will have sufficient time to scrutinise this short Bill properly.</p>
	<p pid="a.1675.1/78">As I indicated in my oral statement in the House last week, it is imperative that we act speedily to put an end to the uncertainty created by the recent judgment of the High Court in the case of Hookway. As I then explained</p>
	<p pid="a.1675.1/79">to the House, that judgment is having a direct and immediate impact on the police&#8217;s ability to investigate offences and protect the public. The view of the Association of Chief Police Officers, which we share, is that we cannot wait until the outcome of the Supreme Court&#8217;s hearing of the appeal on <phrase class="date" code="2011-07-25">25 July</phrase>.

	<p pid="a.1678.1/1">I am sure that these matters will be covered in the Second Reading debate. I set out in my statement last week why it had not been possible to act until the written judgment had been properly considered and until we had received formal advice from the Association of Chief Police Officers that it wished us to proceed in this way. In that regard, I should like to quote the chief constable of Essex, Jim Barker-McCardle. On this issue, he has said:</p>
	<p pid="a.1678.1/2">&#8220;It was only when ACPO received the written judgment on <phrase class="date" code="2011-06-17">17 June</phrase>, and a number of senior people were able to spend some significant time considering the issue, that the seriousness of this became apparent. As the ACPO lead on this issue, I was not going to advise Ministers that the police service needed, in exceptional circumstances, fast track legislation until I had satisfied myself first that the legislation was necessary and that the police service could not operate effectively in light of this judgment, beyond the very short term.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.1678.1/3">We acted: within two hours of receiving that written advice, I was here giving a statement to the House announcing that we would introduce emergency legislation. The suggestion that we did not act swiftly flies directly in the face of what ACPO is saying about how it wishes this matter to be considered. Opposition Members do not have the backing of senior police officers for their contention that we acted too slowly in this respect.</p>

However, the circumstances we face are such that the Government have been right to act and to bring the procedure forward in this way. I have looked at the concerns of the House of Lords Committee, but it seems to me that the procedure advocated for today is necessary and appropriate, so long as in the subsequent debate, the House can be satisfied that what the Government are seeking to do is to put the law on the footing that we all thought it was on in the first place. They should not make changes to the law without much more detailed and careful consideration. We should support the programme motion and ensure that Ministers can satisfy us that what they are doing is putting the law back to what we thought it was. If changes to the law are advocated, that should be done through a legislative process that allows consideration at greater length.</p>

	<p pid="a.1680.0/1">I wholeheartedly agree that we need to move as swiftly as possible with this legislation, but we should always note whenever emergency legislation is going through in one day that it has to be an extraordinary process because, in the ordinary course of events, the House should have an opportunity after Second Reading to table amendments that could then be considered on Report on a different day. When everything is truncated into one day, it is impossible to do that. I recognise that the Government tabled a business motion&#8212;and we agreed it earlier this week&#8212;that allowed the tabling of amendments before today.

	<p pid="a.1680.1/1">I feel a slight sense of responsibility for the position we are in today as it is the district judge in Salford, Judge Feinstein, who made the original decision. I support the proceedings today, as I think we need to resolve the issue and get clarity. Judge Feinstein does a tremendous job in Salford in the local criminal justice system and has been particularly effective in dealing with antisocial behaviour. He construed the law as he saw it at that time. His judgment was upheld in the High Court; we await to see what the Supreme Court will do in relation to the appeal. Clearly, he was carrying out his duty in making the decision he did. That said, I entirely support the need to ensure that the police have the powers and the clarity they need to deal with defendants in these circumstances. I support the programme motion.</p>

	<p pid="a.1681.2/1" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move, That the Bill be now read a Second time.</p>
	<p pid="a.1681.2/2" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">Since the Police and Criminal Evidence Act came into effect in January 1986, it has been widely recognised by the police and the courts that time spent on bail does not count towards the maximum permitted period of detention without charge. That is entirely right and proper. Being held in custody in a police cell is clearly not the same as being free on police bail, even with conditions attached.</p>
	<p pid="a.1681.2/3">For more than 25 years, the sensible interpretation of the law has enabled the police to investigate crimes and keep the public safe, but on <phrase class="date" code="2011-05-19">19 May</phrase>, in a judicial review, Mr Justice McCombe gave an oral judgment that it was his view that a district judge&#8212;as we have just heard from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40517" name="Hazel Blears">the right hon. Member for Salford and Eccles (Hazel Blears)</phrase>, Judge Feinstein&#8212;had been right to refuse a routine application for a warrant of further detention of Paul Hookway, a suspect in a murder investigation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1681.2/4">I should stress to the House that at the time of the oral judgment on <phrase class="date" code="2011-05-19">19 May</phrase>, it was not at all clear what the implications of this case would be. Indeed, in his oral judgment, Mr Justice McCombe himself said that &#8220;the consequences&#8221; of this ruling</p>
	<p pid="a.1681.2/5">&#8220;are not as severe as might be feared in impeding police investigations in the vast majority of cases&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1681.2/6">At that time, it was not clear whether the ruling was restricted to the details of the Hookway case alone, whether it had a limited application or whether it was restricted to warrants of further detention beyond 36 hours. It was not until the complex written judgment was received on <phrase class="date" code="2011-06-17">Friday 17 June</phrase>&#8212; and considered in detail with the advice of counsel&#8212;that it began to become clear that this case had wider implications for police detention and bail.</p>

	<p pid="a.1682.2/1">The hon. Gentleman asked me the same question earlier this week when I appeared before the Home Affairs Committee. The issue has also been raised by a number of other Opposition Members, who are doing their best to suggest that there was a delay. There was no delay. It was necessary for all the parties concerned to examine in detail the judgment that had been made available on <phrase class="date" code="2011-06-17">17 June</phrase>. Professor Michael Zander is well respected in this field, in which he has considerable expertise, but I think that if I had come to the House and proposed to the Opposition that the Government introduce emergency legislation on the basis of an article that had appeared in a journal, the Opposition would have rightly told the Government that they should take a rather more professional approach.</p>
	<p pid="a.1682.2/2">The Supreme Court&#8217;s decision on Tuesday not to grant a stay in the case has made the legislation all the more vital and all the more urgent.

	<p pid="a.1682.3/1">It is clear to me, at least, that the Government acted with alacrity, but perhaps the Home Secretary can help me by explaining earlier events involving Greater Manchester police. Why, despite the discussion following the judgment, did they not apply for a certificate for an appeal on <phrase class="date" code="2011-05-19">19 May</phrase>, and why did it then take so long for that to happen?

	<p pid="a.1683.0/1">The answer to the question about the written note is that we were waiting for the judge who had made the decision to produce his own written judgment, so that it would be absolutely clear to us what we would need to interpret. What Greater Manchester police were dealing with was the oral judgment that had been delivered on <phrase class="date" code="2011-05-19">19 May</phrase>. As I have just said, Mr Justice McCombe himself indicated that he did not think that the consequences would be especially severe. Only after further consideration did Greater Manchester police conclude that it would be necessary to appeal against the judgment.</p>
	<p pid="a.1683.0/2">It is important to understand that it was not simply a question of looking at the legal judgment. It was for the police to consider, in operational terms, whether they were able to work within that judgment. When the written judgment was made available to them, the operational implications became clear. It is those operational implications that give cause for concern, and they are the reason for the Bill that we are introducing today.</p>

	<p pid="a.1683.2/1">The right hon. Lady has already raised a number of questions relating to this matter, including the question of the stay of judgment. She has claimed that there was a considerable delay before we came to the House, but, as I said earlier, one hour and two minutes after we received the formal and final judgment from ACPO on the basis of advice from the two QCs whom it had been consulting, my right hon. Friend the Minister for Policing and Criminal Justice made his statement here. As for her previous question about why the Home Office did not join the police in requesting a stay, the answer is simple: we had no locus standi. We were not part of the initial legal proceedings, and it was not open to us to be party to that request.</p>
	<p pid="a.1683.2/2">Let me add&#8212;just in case the right hon.

However, it is now clear, both from the decision that the Supreme Court issued earlier this week and from what has been said by leading legal commentators such as Joshua Rozenberg, that it is not even certain that the Supreme Court has the power to order a stay in relation to such an appeal.</p>

	<p pid="a.1683.3/1">Did the Attorney-General consider joining the case for both the appeal and the stay as soon as he was made aware of the position? In the end the Supreme Court asked him to do so, but did he consider doing so as soon as he was told, and when was he told?</p>

	<p pid="a.1683.4/1">I thought I had made the position clear to the right hon. Lady. Those who were party to the initial legal proceedings were able to grant a stay, and Greater Manchester police were able to make a decision&#8212;which they did at a certain point in the timetable&#8212;on whether to apply for one.</p>
	<p pid="a.1683.4/2">If the right hon. Lady is trying to play party-political games with the question of the application for a stay, she should consider the comments that have been made and the decision of the Supreme Court, which, as I have just said, suggests that there is considerable doubt not about the timetable for a stay, but whether the court even has the power to order one in this case. The right hon. Lady should think about that very carefully.</p>
	<p pid="a.1683.4/3">I think it important that the Home Affairs Committee has had an opportunity to scrutinise the Bill and also, fortuitously, an opportunity to ask me questions about it during the evidence session that I held with the Committee on Tuesday. I also note the support of leading legal figures such as Professor Michael Zander&#8212;who was mentioned earlier&#8212;and Liberty, which has said:</p>
	<p pid="a.1683.4/4">&#8220;Liberty supports the Government&#8217;s intention to amend the law as proposed. In our view the proposed reform is clarificatory and would do nothing more than return the law to the original intention of Parliament and the way in which it has been interpreted&#8212;by judges, prosecutors and defence lawyers&#8212;for the best part of 25 years.&#8221;</p>

	<p pid="a.1684.0/1">I fully support the Bill, but may I take the Home Secretary back to the last session of Home Office questions and her surprisingly dismissive comments about the Joint Committee that had been considering her proposals for emergency legislation in relation to pre-charge detention? The Committee had described those proposals as unsatisfactory and unreliable.</p>
	<p pid="a.1684.0/2">In the light of the experience of the last few days, is the Home Secretary beginning to revisit her views on the role of emergency legislation in dealing with pressing and urgent issues?

Indeed, I have not been dismissive of its views because I have made it clear that we are accepting one of the points it raised on the emergency legislation, and I hardly think accepting one of its points can be described as being dismissive of its views.</p>
	<p pid="a.1684.1/2">The Bill seeks to restore the law on police detention to the position as it has been understood for the last 25 years. The Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 set out the rules governing detention and bail prior to charge.</p>

	<p pid="a.1684.5/1">The right hon. Gentleman is trying to tempt me to debate hypothetical situations. It is right that we are introducing this legislation today, precisely</p>
	<p pid="a.1684.5/2">so that it can be debated on the record and, we hope, receive Royal Assent before the House goes into recess. The right hon. Gentleman knows full well about the debates we have had on the emergency legislation for pre-charge detention and what would be applicable and possible for Parliament to do during a recess, and I am sure we will continue to have such debates. As I have said, I have accepted one of the Joint Committee&#8217;s points on this issue, and that can hardly be described as dismissing its views.</p>
	<p pid="a.1684.5/3">As I was saying, PACE set out the rules governing detention and bail prior to charge. It provides that once a person is arrested and brought to a police station, that person must not be detained for longer than 96 hours in total without being charged with an offence. Within the overall maximum permitted 96-hour period, continued detention must be authorised by a police officer of at least the rank of superintendent after the initial 24 hours, and by a magistrate after the initial 36 hours, with fresh warrants required at 36-hour intervals.</p>
	<p pid="a.1684.5/4">There are numerous other safeguards. For example, ongoing detention must be subject to periodic review, and an individual can challenge their detention at any time by bringing an action for habeas corpus in the High Court. The idea some have put forward that this judgment means the police should in some way just &#8220;work quicker&#8221; to gather evidence ignores the reality of policing and the necessity of the police being able to, for example, take forensics tests, and identify, contact and interview witnesses. The judgment effectively takes away police time in which to do such things.</p>
	<p pid="a.1684.5/5">The Bill seeks to reverse the effect of the High Court&#8217;s ruling, but it only seeks to reverse that. It amends PACE to make it explicit that in calculating any period&#8212;whether a time limit or a period of pre-charge detention&#8212;any periods spent on bail shall be disregarded. The Bill also amends PACE to make it clear that periods of police detention before and after a period of bail are to be treated as if they form a single continuous period. This is an important safeguard that the High Court judgment had overturned, and, again, it restores the position to what it has been understood to be for the past 25 years.</p>

	<p pid="a.1685.0/1">The Home Secretary clearly regards police bail as an important tool for bringing people to justice. It often applies to people accused of serious crimes, and they can be required to live at locations well away from their home address so that they do not mix with any associates who might be involved in crime. Will the Home Secretary therefore explain why in the terrorism Bill that has just left Committee she is proposing that the restrictions for those suspected of being involved in terrorism should be weaker than the restrictions in this Bill for people suspected of being involved in serious crime who are on police bail?</p>

	<p pid="a.1685.1/1">The right hon. Lady is asking me to talk about a Bill that is entirely separate from the one we are addressing today. As I think she knows, in replacing control orders with the terrorism prevention and investigation measures&#8212;TPIMs&#8212;we have put together a package that includes both the measure itself and increased funds available to the Security Service and the police for surveillance. That is the basis on which we are going forward with that measure and that Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.1685.1/2">The Bill before us today provides that the amendments to PACE should have retrospective effect. That means that they are deemed always to have had effect, despite the High Court&#8217;s judgment in the Hookway case.</p>

	<p pid="a.1686.0/1">I support the Bill, but the purist in me is slightly anxious about the concept of retrospective legislation.

	<p pid="a.1686.1/1">My hon. Friend sneaked in with his intervention as I was nearing the conclusion of my speech. Perhaps I use the term &#8220;retrospective&#8221; a little loosely. This is not retrospective legislation in that it merely corrects the decision that has recently been made and puts the situation back to what it had been understood to be. That is supported by Liberty, which has said:</p>
	<p pid="a.1686.1/2">&#8220;We do not believe that the proposals are retrospective in their nature as they do not seek retrospectively to create a criminal offence, sanction or other burden. They would, in our view, not fall foul of Article 7 of the European Convention on Human Rights or the common law rule against retrospective penalties.&#8221;</p>

	<p pid="a.1686.3/1">I am not aware of such figures, but the right hon. Gentleman&#8217;s question gives me an opportunity to comment on remarks that some lawyers and others have made as to whether the original judgment is in some way a response to a problem that had been getting worse. I am not aware of such a problem. The rules that we are restoring are those that the police have been operating under for the past 25 years. I say to those who have suddenly raised this issue that if they did feel there was a problem they should have raised it sooner. I also say that this Bill is merely restoring the situation to what it been understood to be for the last 25 years, and that I do not think it is an appropriate vehicle for doing any more than that. We have a task to perform today. The Bill achieves that task, and it is right that it is restricted to that.</p>

	<p pid="a.1686.4/1">I am not necessarily opposed to restoring the position to what it was before the court judgment, but I am always anxious about our rushing through all the stages of a Bill, as we are doing today. The Home Secretary has been very dismissive of critics, but my view is that if there was more time, those critics, who may or may not have a very reasonable case, would be able to put their case to Members and there would be further deliberations before we rushed into making law. I have many hesitations in my mind because, as the Home Secretary herself has admitted, when we have previously rushed through legislation, it has not always proved to be useful.</p>

	<p pid="a.1686.5/1">I understand the point that there have in the past been occasions when emergency legislation has been felt to have had consequences other than what was intended. This is a different kind of emergency legislation however, in that it simply reinstates the situation to</p>
	<p pid="a.1686.5/2">what it was understood to be for the past 25 years in terms of the operation of PACE and detention and bail. I say to the hon. Gentleman that the Government have done what we can to ensure that there has been an opportunity for the Bill to be considered. I made the draft Bill available to Members and others on Monday, and it was formally introduced on Tuesday. We therefore made it available early so that people would have an opportunity to look at it. It is a very short Bill, and it does not need to be more than a short Bill because, I repeat, it is simply reinstating the situation to what it has been for the past 25 years.</p>
	<p pid="a.1686.5/3">The judgment in the Hookway case significantly impairs the police&#8217;s ability to investigate offences and protect the public. I am not prepared to stand by and ask the police to fight crime with one arm tied behind their back. The Bill will restore vital powers to the police that they have operated under, without complaint from the courts, for the past 25 years. I commend this Bill to the House.</p>

	<p pid="a.1687.0/1">We should take the opportunity to pay tribute to the victims of the 7/7 bombings and to their families, as the anniversary is today.</p>
	<p pid="a.1687.0/2">The Labour party supports this legislation, as it is needed to overturn the judgment made on <phrase class="date" code="2011-05-19">19 May</phrase> in the case of Greater Manchester police and Paul Hookway. The Home Secretary has set out the judgment&#8217;s implications for policing practice and the difficulties of suddenly treating time spent on bail in the same way as time spent in custody, which was clearly not Parliament&#8217;s intention when the legislation was drawn up and is clearly not the intention of this House today. The judgment does cause serious problems for policing operations, for ongoing investigations and, potentially, for the delivery of justice and, most seriously of all, for the protection of victims and witnesses. We should pay tribute to the chief constables, the custody sergeants, the other officers and police staff, who are having to deal with this situation as the professionals that they are.</p>
	<p pid="a.1687.0/3">The situation does mean that the police are not able to recall people from police bail if they have been bailed for more than four days, unless they have new evidence that allows them to re-arrest. It also means that the police are constrained in enforcing bail conditions if the period of up to four days from the initial arrest has elapsed&#8212;that has serious implications, especially as 80,000 people are on police bail right now.</p>
	<p pid="a.1687.0/4">Currently, the police will routinely bail people in ongoing investigations but may need them to return to the police station for further interviews, even where there is no new evidence since the original arrest. They might need them to return for an identity parade or for clarification of a victim&#8217;s statement, pending advice from the Crown Prosecution Service. There are many such cases where, in practice, there is no new evidence since the time of the original arrest.</p>
	<p pid="a.1687.0/5">The situation also raises serious issues in terms of the application of bail conditions, particularly in domestic violence cases, as these conditions can include important protection for the victim. Such conditions could include someone being prohibited from going to their ex-wife&#8217;s</p>
	<p pid="a.1687.0/6">workplace, to the family home or to their children&#8217;s school. Bail conditions are an extremely important part of protecting the safety of victims and witnesses, and if they cannot be enforced, protection is put at risk.</p>

	<p pid="a.1688.1/1">My right hon. Friend makes an extremely important point, as we are rightly discussing this measure because of the seriousness of the situation and the need to protect people. In police bail cases, that need often applies in respect of particular individuals&#8212;victims and witnesses. In the kinds of terrorism cases that she is talking about, the risk may be much wider and may involve a much wider group of people, so we would expect that additional and even greater protection might be needed. It raises concerns if the security services and police do not have the ability and the powers to provide that protection. She is right in what she says and I know that she is continuing to raise that issue as part of the debate on the other legislation.</p>

	<p pid="a.1688.3/1">There are cases where police bail can, of course, be used and there ought to be cases where we should explore that. Our view remains that there are also cases where that is not possible, which is why we need control orders, the son of control orders or whatever we are calling these things now&#8212;we need some other kind of safeguard. Clearly, where more traditional aspects of the criminal justice system can be used instead, they should of course be used. Control orders are always a last resort and should be used only in those circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="a.1688.3/2">We have seen some worrying cases across the country, and this goes to the heart of why emergency legislation is needed now. Hon. Members are right to say that we should bring in emergency legislation only on the basis of very serious consideration; we should never do this lightly and there are always risks involved. However, Parliament also needs to balance the risks, and there are risks to the public and to the course of justice if we do not legislate now.</p>
	<p pid="a.1688.3/3">The National Association of Probation Officers has warned of a case where a suspect who is already on a 12-month suspended sentence for assault and who has five previous convictions for offences against the same partner was arrested again for assault. He was bailed while drugs found upon his person were sent off for analysis, but that may take a week and the 96 hours have expired. His victims are deemed at physical risk and it is hugely important, in those circumstances, that bail conditions should be able to apply. Another case</p>
	<p pid="a.1688.3/4">involves the harassment of a former girlfriend by a suspect who has been arrested and released on bail. His phone and computer were taken for analysis, which takes time&#8212;far more time than 96 hours. He is not due back on bail until later this month, but his conditions are not enforceable if the current legal state of affairs persists. I have been told of other cases by police officers, including that of someone arrested as he was accused of sexual assault on women he was supposed to help in the course of his work. Further investigations are under way, but his bail conditions included a requirement that he should have no unsupervised contact with women in his professional capacity and, again, those conditions cannot now be enforced.</p>
	<p pid="a.1688.3/5">In many cases, bail conditions were used to give people a time and date for returning to the police station for further interview once further evidence was expected to be in place. Now, even though that further evidence might subsequently have been gathered, the police will still have to go out to look for the suspect and take that extra time to bring them in. So, in addition to the risks to justice and to the victims, this situation is placing considerable extra burdens on police time and resources, causing additional pressures for them, too.</p>

	<p pid="a.1689.0/1">My right hon. Friend is making a powerful case for the situation that existed prior to the court judgment, and I do not dispute what she is saying in any way, as public safety is absolutely essential and nobody in this House is going to challenge that view. We are dealing with the substance of the matter, so does she not have a concern about the amount of time that a person can be endlessly bailed for as they return to the police station and that happens again? Would it not be far better, as far as is possible, for charges to be brought as quickly as possible where there is sufficient evidence to do so?</p>

	<p pid="a.1689.1/1">We are talking about wider issues here and, if I may, I will deal with those later. If my hon. Friend wishes to intervene then, I will be happy to take a further intervention from him. I wish to finish the point that I am making and then deal with his point.</p>
	<p pid="a.1689.1/2">The case for rapid action to resolve the situation is extremely clear. Nevertheless, it is important that we set it out in the House to make it clear to the courts what our view and judgment are. The costs and administrative burdens for the police in trying to manage this interim situation should also not be underestimated. There is also a significant risk that clever defendants or defence lawyers might use that interim period as a way to get off on a technicality, which would mean that justice would not be done, the House and Parliament not having clarified the situation for the police and the courts.</p>
	<p pid="a.1689.1/3">It would be irresponsible for Parliament to wait longer to deal with the situation. It is not possible for Parliament to take the risk of waiting for the Supreme Court hearing on <phrase class="date" code="2011-07-25">25 July</phrase>, as thousands of domestic violence victims alone need the protection of enforceable bail conditions right now, not in several weeks&#8217; time. So we do support the legislation, as I explained in Parliament on a point of order within hours of learning about the issue eight days ago.</p>
	<p pid="a.1689.1/4">However, we should reflect on some genuine concerns. We have not proposed any amendments, even probing ones, because we think that the most important thing</p>
	<p pid="a.1689.1/5">today is to get the legislation on to the statute book and to restore the position for the police and crime victims as soon as possible. However, the House should also have concerns about the possibility of the use of endless police bail. There are cases, and there have been cases, where people have been left on police bail, including with conditions, long after another suspect has confessed to the offence. There are other cases where investigations have run dry but action was not taken to end the bail arrangements. Long bail can sometimes mean that delays are allowed to develop, and they eventually become counter-productive in securing justice.</p>
	<p pid="a.1689.1/6">Therefore, we should, in due course, have a wider debate about the appropriateness and proportionality of different lengths of police bail and what safeguards are needed. If Parliament, the Government and the police do not have those debates about what we think is appropriate, we risk the courts making those decisions for us. It is important that the police have the powers and the flexibilities to pursue those investigations, but we need to give them support in doing that, and make sure that that is properly reflected in the arrangements that we have. There are issues to do with the fact that the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 has been amended many times and clarity might be needed on wider matters, too. It would be helpful if the Home Office and ACPO considered more closely when, how and for how long police bail is used and whether the current framework is appropriate or needs amending.</p>
	<p pid="a.1689.1/7">In the meantime, the most important thing is to restore to the police the ability to operate in the way in which they have operated, and with the framework with which they have operated, for several decades.</p>

	<p pid="a.1690.0/1">I accept my right hon. Friend&#8217;s point about not tabling any amendments, but given what she has said about the application of bail conditions, is there not a persuasive argument for having a sunset clause in this emergency legislation so that we deal with the immediate problem but have proper time to debate the issues she mentions?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-07-07a.1690.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40427" speakername="Yvette Cooper" colnum="1690"  time="012:59:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110707/debtext/110707-0002.htm#11070745001278">
	<p pid="a.1690.1/1">That would have been one way to do it. When the issue came to light last week, we suggested that one option might be to introduce emergency legislation with a sunset clause before considering the subject more widely. The most important thing, given the time we have available, is that the Government have proposed a way to restore the system, and the whole House should support it. I hope that the Government will have further discussions with ACPO about whether any other developments are needed.</p>
	<p pid="a.1690.1/2">As several hon. Members have said, we should never legislate lightly when it takes retrospective effect. Changing the law retrospectively is, in general, undesirable and creates great uncertainty. It threatens natural justice if people end up breaking a law when they did not know of its existence, when it did not exist at the time the act was committed and when they could not have been expected to know that it would exist.</p>
	<p pid="a.1690.1/3">I have thought very carefully about the question and I know that members of the Government have, too. I am clear that a retrospective clause is justified in this case. Indeed, I urged the Minister for Policing and Criminal Justice to include a retrospective clause when I</p>
	<p pid="a.1690.1/4">discussed the issues with him last Thursday. In this case, we are simply restoring the law to what we in Parliament thought it was, to what we intended it to be and to that which the police, the CPS and others have been following in good faith for many years. We have made clear our intention and so in this period of uncertainty the police, suspects and others should know what Parliament intends. If we had not made our intentions clear, we would have opened the police and victims up to considerable uncertainty about the prospects for individual cases, especially those under investigation at the moment. It would be deeply wrong for a victim to be denied justice and for the offender to escape on a technicality simply because the crime was committed in the limbo period between <phrase class="date" code="2011-05-19">19 May</phrase> and Royal Assent and the police interviews did not comply with the temporary legal position owing to any confusion.</p>
	<p pid="a.1690.1/5">An even more troubling possibility is that historic cases, in which the standard practice was followed in good faith by the police and CPS, could end up being overturned or dragged back through the courts because of the Hookway judgment. In such circumstances, we should legislate retrospectively but we should be clear that we are doing so because we have considered the seriousness of the issue and that we have made the judgment after serious consideration rather than lightly.</p>
	<p pid="a.1690.1/6">I have some concerns about the process and about why we are doing this now, in such a way. I am concerned about the initial judgment. My right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40517" name="Hazel Blears">the Member for Salford and Eccles (Hazel Blears)</phrase> mentioned the judgment of the judge in Salford, which was confirmed by the High Court judge. Judges, not Parliament, interpret the law and it was the role of the High Court judge to come to a view on what the legislation meant. The fact that the judge came to a new view on the interpretation of the law or a different view from experts, such as Professor Zander QC, is still part of the judicial process. It is possible for us to disagree with the judge&#8217;s decision while respecting his constitutional role in making such decisions.</p>
	<p pid="a.1690.1/7">My greatest concern is about the final paragraph of the High Court judge&#8217;s judgment, which the Home Secretary quoted. He does not simply interpret the law but makes a practical assessment of the impact of his judgment:</p>
	<p pid="a.1690.1/8">&#8220;It seems to me however...the consequences are not as severe as might be feared in impeding police investigations in the vast majority of cases. This is simply because in the usual case a suspect returning on bail will either be released because the evidence is not sufficient to warrant a charge or he will be re-arrested under statutory powers because new evidence has come to light.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.1690.1/9">I strongly disagree with that practical assessment and the evidence of cases that the police have to handle at the moment disproves it.</p>

	<p pid="a.1691.0/1">That does not tally well with the right hon. Lady&#8217;s earlier suggestion that the Home Secretary and others have acted in a dilatory fashion, because the judge himself said in his oral judgment that he did not think that the judgment would have those consequences. Was it not right, therefore, to wait for the written judgment and find out what the consequences would be?</p>

	<p pid="a.1692.0/1">No, I disagree. I think that the judge was wrong in that aspect of his judgment. There are serious questions about the fact that there is no sign that he considered any extensive evidence on the practical application of his judgment and about why he did not consider making clear that the judgment should be stayed pending appeal and consideration of the wider evidence. However, that does not go to the heart of the role of the Home Office and the Home Secretary. The Home Office could have done considerable things between the oral statement and the written judgment, rather than simply hoping for the best, which is what it appears officials have done.</p>
	<p pid="a.1692.0/2">Let me turn to the Government&#8217;s response. The oral judgment was given on <phrase class="date" code="2011-05-19">19 May</phrase> and Home Office officials were informed soon after that&#8212;certainly before the end of May. The Home Secretary and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40456" name="Michael Ellis">the hon. Member for Northampton North (Michael Ellis)</phrase> have claimed that they had to wait for the written judgment, and of course the written judgment brings the decision into effect and can provide further clarity, but that does not mean that everybody has to suspend action and judgment until the written judgment is available. Given what Home Office officials should have known from the oral judgment, they should immediately have notified the CPS and the Attorney-General. The Home Secretary did not explain when she discussed the decision with the Attorney-General or at what point the Attorney-General was made aware of the seriousness of the case.</p>

	<p pid="a.1692.1/1">Does the right hon. Lady not appreciate that, at the time of the oral judgment, it could have related only to the instant case before the judge in question? It was only clear later that it would have a wider-reaching effect.</p>

	<p pid="a.1692.2/1">The point is that the Home Office should have prepared. Immediately after the oral judgment was issued, it was possible that there would be concerns and Professor Zander knew enough about the judgment to write a considered view in <i>Criminal Law and Justice Weekly </i>on <phrase class="date" code="2011-06-17">17 June</phrase>.

	<p pid="a.1693.0/1">Evidence was given to the Select Committee on Home Affairs on Tuesday that a note was written by counsel for Greater Manchester police, which could have alerted officials to a possible issue, but my right hon. Friend would need to have the opportunity to read that note.</p>
	<p pid="a.1693.0/2">The point I wanted to make was that there is the Treasury Solicitor&#8217;s Department, which is headed by the Attorney-General and the Solicitor-General, so there are resources that could have allowed this issue to be looked at when ACPO was taking advice from Clare Montgomery and Steven Kovats. Does my right hon. Friend agree that that is relevant for the future and that, if alarm bells start ringing again, there is machinery in Government to allow the Home Secretary to have the kind of advice we are talking about?</p>

	<p pid="a.1693.1/1">My right hon. Friend is right. He makes his points diplomatically, but the complacency of Home Office Ministers is worrying. They seem to think that they have done everything right in this case, that there have been no delays and that everything has moved as rapidly as possible, but that clearly is not the case. I hope that they will learn lessons for the future from this incident because there clearly has not been rapid movement every step along the way. Whether that applies to what Home Office officials should have done when they received the note on this case, what work they should have done, or what further information they should have sought either from the judge in question or through legal advice at that point, it is their responsibility to prepare options for Ministers, so that Ministers can take rapid judgments, know what their options are and move very fast. That is especially true given the significant risks from this case to the operation of police work and to justice.</p>
	<p pid="a.1693.1/2">My right hon. Friend&#8217;s point about the role of the Treasury Solicitor&#8217;s Department is important. The point of having the Attorney-General and those solicitors is to be able to seek additional legal advice from them. The Home Secretary said that it is not normal practice for the Government to confirm whether and when they have sought legal advice, but in fact it is very common for Ministers to say that they have had legal advice from the Attorney-General or others. They might not reveal the detailed content of that advice but in this case the Home Secretary is not even confirming whether she has had or sought separate legal advice or whether the Attorney-General provided any such advice to set out options, so that the Government could move fast and deal with this matter considerably faster than has been the case.</p>

	<p pid="a.1693.2/1">Will the shadow Home Secretary accept that the Government and the Home Office were not parties in the proceedings? We can see from the judgment that counsel for Greater Manchester police were asked at the end of the oral judgment whether they would like to apply for a certificate in relation to an appeal. To the extent that questions have to be asked, surely they should be addressed to Greater Manchester police about why they did not apply to the judge for a</p>
	<p pid="a.1693.2/2">stay or for a certificate despite having been specifically asked about doing so. We should be addressing those questions to Greater Manchester police, who are party to the case, rather than trying to twist this in relation to the Home Office.</p>

	<p pid="a.1694.0/1">The hon. Gentleman is right that there are issues for Greater Manchester police in terms of how fast they respond and react and whether they apply for appeals and stays, but the issue for the Home Office is that, in the end, it matters to the Home Office if policing practice and the protection of victims right across the country are jeopardised. His point goes to the heart of my concerns about the way in which the Home Office and Home Office Ministers have responded. There seems to be an attitude that &#8220;We&#8217;ll let Greater Manchester police and ACPO do their bit; we&#8217;ll just sit back and wait until it all comes to us.&#8221; Ministers finally acted only when ACPO said that emergency legislation was needed, rather than Ministers and the Attorney-General recognising that they would have to take responsibility for the consequences. Even if Greater Manchester police did not take the first steps, there was still a responsibility on the Home Office and the Attorney-General to go and talk to Greater Manchester police about whether they had applied for a stay of judgment or appeal. That is where there have been delays and, frankly, incompetence in the way the Home Office has responded.</p>

	<p pid="a.1694.1/1">I have sat and listened very carefully to the debate. I am no lawyer but it strikes me that the Government have tried to act as fast as they can. We are having this emergency debate at speed because we have to make sure that when a judge makes a wrong decision we put the law right&#8212;first, to protect the public and, secondly, to allow the police to proceed properly.

	<p pid="a.1694.2/1">We do have that responsibility, but my reason for continuing to press this point is that these things will come up again because that is the nature of home affairs and Home Office work. There will inevitably be judgments and other issues that cause problems and suddenly raise difficulties in the criminal justice system. We have dealt with them previously, sometimes through emergency legislation and sometimes through other responses. These things happen and the question is whether, when they happen, the response is fast enough or active enough. My concern is that, if the Home Office continues to be complacent about how it has responded, there will be further difficulties in future.</p>
	<p pid="a.1694.2/2">It is worth considering the time line. We are now seven weeks from the original judgment, three weeks since the written judgment was put in place and two weeks since Ministers were informed. That gap alone between Home Office officials&#8217; being informed of the written judgment, the written judgment&#8217;s being published and Ministers&#8217; being told puts Ministers in a deeply difficult position. I have considerable sympathy with the position they were put in when the written judgment came out and was commented on almost the same day by Professor Michael Zander, who said:</p>
	<p pid="a.1694.2/3">&#8220;This is a very unfortunate decision if it is not quickly overturned on appeal it will need to be speedily reversed by legislation.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.1694.2/4">That criminal expert came out with that statement, the written judgment was published and it was still a week</p>
	<p pid="a.1694.2/5">until Home Office Ministers were even told there was a problem. I think that is of concern and that the Home Office should recognise it is of concern.</p>

	<p pid="a.1695.1/1">My hon. Friend makes an extremely important point. Given the number of Back Benchers who have leapt up to mention, as part of their intervention, &#8220;the speedy action from Ministers&#8221; and &#8220;the fast response from Ministers&#8221;, one might think that a Whip&#8217;s note has gone around saying that that might be the phrase to put into every intervention, whatever the point might be.</p>
	<p pid="a.1695.1/2">Our first concern is about the initial delay before the Home Office got the written judgment. I am very clear that more work should have been done between the oral judgment and the written judgment. Then, once the written judgment arrived, there should have been very fast advice to the Home Secretary and the Minister for Policing and Criminal Justice about the risks in this case. Instead, the Home Office seems to have sat on this for a week before Ministers were informed. Once they were informed, it was then important for them to accelerate action because the Home Office clearly had not been acting fast enough before then.</p>
	<p pid="a.1695.1/3">What did happen once Ministers were informed? We still do not know when the Home Secretary discussed the matter with the Attorney-General and we still do not know why it has taken so long for there to be support via the Attorney-General, working with Greater Manchester police and the Supreme Court, to get an expedited hearing for a stay of judgment. I recognise the point that the Home Secretary made about the stay of judgment. Clearly, a series of different issues are relevant, some of which the Supreme Court has raised in relation to its powers. The Court also raised the issue of timeliness because by the time it was considering a stay of judgment, that judgment had been in place for many weeks. Timeliness is always a factor when the Supreme Court takes decisions and those delays might well have made it harder for the Court to bring in that stay of judgment.</p>

	<p pid="a.1696.0/1">The hon. Lady might think that the speed with which the Home Office has responded is okay, but I think it demonstrates a worrying level of complacency that might cause problems in future. The reason for making that important point about the delays we have seen is that such delays cause risks for victims and the judicial process. At the heart of the matter is the question of whether the Home Office is prepared to take responsibility for justice in this way, or whether it will just sit back and leave it to the police and ACPO.</p>
	<p pid="a.1696.0/2">The Policing Minister has told us that the Home Office waited for ACPO to conclude that emergency legislation was needed. When he responds, will he state at what point Ministers asked for draft legislation to be prepared, even if only on a contingency basis, because that is important? Ministers should have commissioned emergency legislation on a draft basis as soon as they were informed of the problem and saw the clear advice from Professor Zander that emergency legislation might be needed. Instead, they appear to have waited for ACPO to commission legal advice twice, but it is not just a matter for ACPO. Inevitably, ACPO will always try to make existing legislation work&#8212;they are the police and that is their job&#8212;but the job of the Home Secretary&#8217;s officials was to contingency plan and get emergency legislation on stand-by, yet there is no sign that they did that. Also, they appear to have made no effort to start discussions with the Opposition through the usual channels on how we could get the legislation in as fast as possible. After the Home Secretary was made aware of the situation, it took her a week to raise it with the Opposition and ask whether we would support emergency legislation if needed. The usual channels could have started making contingency plans a week before and we could have had this debate earlier. In the end, the reason for making this point is that in these cases every day matters, because the risks to people who rely on bail protection are considerable and persistent. Therefore, every day matters in how fast we can get this legislation in place.</p>
	<p pid="a.1696.0/3">We support this legislation, will give it a fair wind through the House today and hope that it gets through the House of Lords as rapidly as possible, but I must say to the Home Secretary that it is important when things go wrong and she has to respond that lessons are learnt so that the same mistakes are not made again. There have been a catalogue of delays at every stage of the process, things could have been done faster and we could have moved to resolve this earlier. Unless the Government recognise those delays, I worry that we will see further problems and risks. The Home Secretary cannot always pretend that everything in her Department is perfect; it will not be, and we all know that. A little more recognition when failings take place and learning from them would help us to have a more effective Home Office and a better criminal justice system for the future.</p>

	<p pid="a.1696.2/1">I am delighted to have caught your eye for a second time in the past hour, Mr Deputy Speaker.</p>
	<p pid="a.1696.2/2">We are debating this emergency legislation today because accepted police practice of more than a quarter of a century has been challenged. The legislation is not only vital, but urgent for maintaining the ability of our police forces across the country to do their job of catching criminals and protecting the public they serve. The ruling by High Court judge Mr Justice McCombe on <phrase class="date" code="2011-06-17">17 June</phrase>&#8212;that time spent on police bail over any period should count towards the maximum 96-hour limit for pre-charge detention&#8212;has destabilised our police and the very heart of our criminal justice system. In the words of the chief constable of West Yorkshire police, this has left officers</p>
	<p pid="a.1696.2/3">&#8220;running around like headless chickens... wondering what this means to the nature of justice.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.1696.2/4">As a Member of the Home Affairs Committee, I was fortunate to hear from some of the most senior police officers in the country about the negative effects that this ruling has on the police and the criminal justice system. A staggering 80,000 people in pre-charge bail cases would be affected by the ruling. In Lancashire, where my constituency is, 2,227 suspects would be affected on pre-charge bail. This Tuesday the Committee heard from Steve Bloomfield, a Metropolitan police commander and the lead in the fallout of this case, and Jim Barker-McCardle, the chief constable of Essex police and the ACPO lead in this area. These professionals, who are truly eminent in their field, outlined the detrimental effects of suspects who would normally be released on bail being detained for longer. They were asked whether the police would have sufficient cell capacity as a consequence of the judgment? Chief Constable Barker-McCardle said that they would have the capacity in the short term&#8212;for the next few weeks&#8212;but that over a period of months they would cope but with some difficulty.</p>

	<p pid="a.1697.0/1">On that point, does my hon. Friend also accept that in the case of mass demonstrations and the arrests that accompany them, it is often physically impossible to detain everyone necessary?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-07-07a.1697.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40551" speakername="Lorraine Fullbrook" colnum="1697"  time="013:33:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110707/debtext/110707-0002.htm#11070745001300">
	<p pid="a.1697.1/1">My hon. Friend is absolutely right that the fallout from the judgment would be exacerbated by mass arrests resulting from public order incidents. Without this urgent and necessary legislation, we will need more cells than we currently have. Otherwise, suspected criminals will be set free until they commit a further crime. As my hon. Friend has said, the fallout from mass arrests as a result of public order incidents would increase.</p>
	<p pid="a.1697.1/2">This judgment also puts victims of crime and the general public at greater risk. Chief Constable Barker-McCardle was asked by the Home Affairs Committee whether this was an issue of public safety, to which he responded that it undoubtedly was. He said, &#8220;unhesitatingly, unqualified &#8211;yes&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1697.1/3">I was astounded to hear that under the judgment a situation could arise in which a perpetrator of domestic violence would be perfectly able to revisit the home of the initial crime, breaching a bail order, and the police would not be allowed to detain such a person for the breach unless a new offence was committed. Under these circumstances, the perpetrator cannot be detained until a further violent incident occurs. We have a responsibility to victims of domestic violence to ensure</p>
	<p pid="a.1697.1/4">that this madness is not allowed to continue and that we allow the police to do their job and protect the public from crime.</p>
	<p pid="a.1697.1/5">I am glad that the Bill is retrospective, which will prevent people taking action in the courts. The judgment prevents the police doing their job and puts victims at greater risk. I am delighted that the Government have introduced the Bill so speedily and with such urgency. I am sure that it will be supported by Members on both sides of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.1697.1/6">The judgment by Mr Justice McCombe has upset the balance in our criminal justice system. For 25 years the police have been relied upon to catch criminals and we entrust the courts to ensure that justice is served. This emergency legislation redresses that balance by giving the police the assurance that they can continue to operate in the way they have for many years&#8212;protecting the public. I am sure that the House will give the police that assurance today by passing the bill, which is essential to put things right.</p>

	<p pid="a.1698.0/1">I, too, will support the emergency legislation, but two questions seem to have been raised: first, what happened; and secondly, what are the implications of the legislation itself? On the question of what happened, there seem to be two different versions of events. The Government version suggests that they acted within one hour and two minutes, and we have heard a lot of support for that view, with Members telling us about the speed of events. Another version suggests that the clock started ticking on this issue on <phrase class="date" code="2011-04-05">5 April</phrase>, when the judgment was made in the Salford court, and that it has been going on for three months. There has been a crucial judgment, albeit after a 25-year gap, about the interpretation of a piece of parliamentary legislation that identifies a drafting error that no one appears to have spotted in 25 years, which I find slightly strange.</p>

It seems that no one has really suffered apart from the police, who have had to manage the situation, and that now we require to put the matter right. If the public have not been put at risk, that is great, and if the police have been able to manage, that is good, too, so let us get the legislation through as fast as we can.</p>

	<p pid="a.1699.4/2">It can be argued that what happened on <phrase class="date" code="2011-04-05">5 April</phrase> led to people thinking that they were dealing with a little local difficulty, because that is a perfectly reasonable conclusion to draw, but it is reasonable also to say that, when the judgment was made on <phrase class="date" code="2011-05-19">19 May</phrase>, people should have started to think that it had wider implications and alarm bells should have started to ring.

	<p pid="a.1699.4/3">On <phrase class="date" code="2011-06-24">24 June</phrase>, by which time the written judgment was available, no one thought it sufficiently important to be dealt with on the Friday afternoon. The Home Office received it on <phrase class="date" code="2011-06-24">24 June</phrase> and waited until the Monday&#8212;the whole weekend&#8212;before starting to consider its implications.</p>
	<p pid="a.1699.4/4">The Home Secretary was dismissive of my comments on Michael Zander&#8217;s article, but here was a respected legal expert giving a clear warning on his concerns about the judgment.

	<p pid="a.1700.1/1">Presumably, one reason why that guy is one of the country&#8217;s leading legal experts is that he, rather remarkably, anticipated such a judgment and was able to give some advice and guidance on what might be necessary if it were so. I am not therefore too concerned with that point.</p>
	<p pid="a.1700.1/2">Are we seriously being asked to believe that Ministers and officials sit in the Home Office and wait to see whether the police have any concerns, and that if the police do have concerns, they e-mail, phone or send a carrier pigeon to the Home Office at which point Ministers suddenly start to take their responsibilities seriously? If that is what we are being asked to believe, I have a suggestion for the Home Secretary: why does she not make some cuts by sacking some of her useless officials, rather than police officers? It sounds as if they are not serving her particularly well.</p>

	<p pid="a.1700.3/1">The hon. Lady may remember that during the same evidence session the police officer concerned referred to 5,000 as opposed to 80,000, but under further examination we discovered that he was talking about the Met police area rather than the whole country.</p>
	<p pid="a.1700.3/2">I plan to support the legislation, because we are where we are and I do not want to make the job of the police any more difficult. The Government&#8217;s police cuts, in what looks like a concerted attack on Britain&#8217;s policing institutions, are making their job hard enough, and I have no desire to make it any worse, but I do not accept the Government&#8217;s version of the events that brought us here.</p>
	<p pid="a.1700.3/3">I have a question about how the emergency legislation has been framed. Earlier, the Home Secretary cited Liberty as an organisation that supported it, and I think I am right that Justice is one of the others, but Liberty makes an interesting case about the lack of safeguards in the legislation and a persuasive case for a sunset clause, whereby we deal with the immediate problem</p>
	<p pid="a.1700.3/4">but then, at a more leisurely pace, look at the wider issues. Given that the problem went undetected for 25 years, that may be a worthwhile route to pursue.</p>
	<p pid="a.1700.3/5">On the retrospective nature of the legislation, I agree that it is necessary in order to deal with those 80,000 cases&#8212;and probably even more so in order to deal with what happens between now and <phrase class="date" code="2011-07-12">12 July</phrase>, when it comes into effect. However, our law&#8212;I think this is the point that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40142" name="Julian Huppert">the hon. Member for Cambridge (Dr Huppert)</phrase> was alluding to&#8212;relies on citizens being able to predict in advance when the act of a public authority will be lawful. Introducing a retrospective clause, albeit for understandable reasons, creates a situation whereby something that someone was doing yesterday, reasonably assuming it to be lawful, could be unlawful tomorrow, so that retrospectively they could suffer the consequences. That has major implications for the way in which citizens should view their relationship with the state. I do not object to the retrospective aspect, but it leads to an argument for a sunset clause so that we could have an opportunity, at some point in the future, to consider the implications of having to make such judgments.</p>
	<p pid="a.1700.3/6">Members have mentioned the problem of the length of time for which people may be held on police bail, particularly where it has conditions attached. The shadow Home Secretary used the example of bail restrictions designed to protect the victim from the alleged offender in domestic violence cases. I can understand that. However, I can think of a case in my constituency where a constituent had a bail order applied to him for over 12 months, and one of its restrictions was that he could not use his bank account because the case involved a fairly complex fraud. As a result, he had immense difficulty in meeting his daily living expenses. In the end, all the charges were dropped and he was never brought to court for anything at all. There is already a provision in PACE whereby, when the police apply for an extension, they have to give assurances that they will not take undue time in dealing with the matter and having excessive periods of bail.</p>
	<p pid="a.1700.3/7">These provisions raise once more the issue of bail conditions. We are putting through legislation to deal with a very particular crisis, but in the course of examining it we are opening up wider questions that would merit a much broader debate at some point in the future. Even at this stage, the Government could consider a sunset clause. They are getting absolute co-operation today in dealing with the immediate problem that we face: whether that is partly their own fault or entirely the fault of the courts is a matter of debate. In return for that, the emergency legislation should be used only very sparingly. It is not unreasonable for Parliament to say that the issues that are raised while emergency legislation is being passed should be subject to much greater debate and scrutiny in future.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-07-07a.1701.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40152" speakername="Tom Brake" colnum="1701"  time="013:53:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110707/debtext/110707-0002.htm#11070745001319">
	<p pid="a.1701.0/1">Let me start, Mr Deputy Speaker, by apologising to you and to other Members for my brief absence from the Chamber. I had to attend the Programming Sub-Committee on the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Bill. I must say that the process that took place therein would not have been out of place in a &#8220;Carry On&#8221; film.</p>
	<p pid="a.1701.0/2">As Members will know, we are having this debate because the High Court has ruled that suspects cannot be bailed for longer than four consecutive days, or 96 hours. That decision comes after a ruling from Salford magistrates court that the police could not detain suspect Paul Hookway again because his &#8220;detention clock&#8221; had been running while he was on bail&#8212;a ruling that has immediate effect. It is clear that the damage that this would have done to police investigations had we not taken the action that we are taking would have been very substantial in stopping the police being able to keep track of a suspect while they continued their investigations, collected new evidence, and so on. Given that that would have affected more than 85,000 people across England and Wales, it was clearly necessary for us to debate emergency legislation and implement it as soon as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.1701.0/3">However, I would like to take this opportunity to raise some concerns. Liberty&#8217;s briefing, which I support, includes the perhaps understated comment that it is</p>
	<p pid="a.1701.0/4">&#8220;somewhat surprising that this appears to be the first time that the issue has arisen in the 25 years that the PACE Act has been in force.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.1701.0/5">Indeed, other Members have made that point. It is concerned about having a requirement to stick to a consecutive 96-hour period, stating:</p>
	<p pid="a.1701.0/6">&#8220;Unduly limiting the period for which a suspect may be bailed by police could have the effect of encouraging premature or inappropriate charging with all the injustices that would flow. It could also have the effect of encouraging police to detain for the maximum (96 hour) period in circumstances where a suspect could be released earlier thereby supporting prolonged detention rather than release on bail.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.1701.0/7">Those are genuine concerns which have been supported in other representations that I have received. Although the action we are taking is necessary, there is no possibility today of our debating and perhaps amending these clauses to reflect some of the concerns about the use of police bail. Liberty goes on to say:</p>
	<p pid="a.1701.0/8">&#8220;While 96 hours may well be too short a limit to allow effective further investigation in more complicated cases, it should not be the case that police bail can go on forever.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.1701.0/9">It also notes that</p>
	<p pid="a.1701.0/10">&#8220;police bail can have attached to it a number of highly onerous conditions.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.1701.0/11">I should like to refer to a couple of anonymised cases that highlight some of the issues of police bail and, in some cases, its very extended use. A barrister contacted me to say that he was aware of a serious fraud case where certain suspects were on bail for a period of two years and 10 months, and released from it only recently when a trial of some of the other suspects in the same investigation ended with acquittals or a hung jury. He referred to another case in which he was instructed where the period was 18 months&#8212;from December 2007 to the point of charge in June 2009. He accepts that investigations will sometimes take a long time to progress, particularly in cases involving high-value frauds, as in the two that he cited, which I have now put on the record. He goes on to highlight the pernicious impact of police bail, particularly regarding the obtaining of restraint orders for the assets of the accused. He says that although there will be occasions where such restraint orders are justified, perhaps to ensure that criminal assets are not dissipated, their impact is substantial and</p>
	<p pid="a.1701.0/12">can sometimes affect the ability of the accused to pay their mortgage, for instance&#8212;and of course such people often remain unconvicted.</p>
	<p pid="a.1701.0/13">It is legitimate, in the limited time available to us, to raise those points and to flag up the fact that while emergency legislation is necessary, we need to be careful about the implications of police bail and its uses and to ensure that it is not abused. Liberty says in its briefing that we might at some point&#8212;it suggests in the Protection of Freedoms Bill&#8212;want to consider a statutory time limit on the use of police bail. It suggests that the statutory limit for pre-charge bail should be set at six months. I am not sure whether I support that contention&#8212;I suspect that in fraud cases, in particular, it would be rather hard to deliver and perhaps insufficient&#8212;but it might be appropriate for us to debate the subject at a later date.</p>

	<p pid="a.1703.0/1">A potential solution to that issue would be the imposition of a time limit in most cases, unless there was a particular element, for example fraud, which would bring the applicants back to court to apply for an extension.

As well as supporting a length of time for which pre-charge police bail applies, it is keen that the police should admit people to pre-charge bail only when it is necessary. If people voluntarily accept that they must attend, it may not be necessary to put pre-charge bail conditions in place.</p>

I thought he was very generous in saying that we would have until 3 o&#8217;clock to complete our debate, because everyone who has spoken so far has said that they agree absolutely with everything that the Government are doing, as do I. I shall learn from my own lesson by speaking as briefly as I can.</p>
	<p pid="a.1703.4/4">I thank the Home Secretary for showing great courtesy to the Home Affairs Committee. She promised us a copy of the draft Bill by 6 o&#8217;clock on Monday and we received it. She then appeared before the Select Committee on Tuesday. This may seem like d&#233;j&#224; vu because there are so many members of the Select Committee here. In fact, we could adjourn the House and straight away be quorate. This is a model not just for emergency legislation, but for the way in which the Government should deal with Select Committees.

	<p pid="a.1704.1/1">I am sure that there would be a vote against it, probably led by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40627" name="David Winnick">the Member for Walsall North (Mr Winnick)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.1704.1/2">It is important that Parliament is kept informed. The fact that this legislation had to be scrutinised in this way meant that the Home Secretary&#8217;s presence this week was very helpful.</p>
	<p pid="a.1704.1/3">Government Members need to be mindful of the fact that Opposition Front Benchers are supporting the Government on this matter. Government Members were a little unfair to the shadow Home Secretary. It is right that she is able to raise issues concerning the time line. Select Committee members from both sides of the House necessarily raised that issue with the Home Secretary on Tuesday, and indeed with the chief constable of Essex and the commander in the Met who deals with these matters. I commend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40551" name="Lorraine Fullbrook">the hon. Member for South Ribble (Lorraine Fullbrook)</phrase> and my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40087" name="Stephen McCabe">the Member for Birmingham, Selly Oak (Steve McCabe)</phrase> for their speeches. Although they disagreed on issues concerning the time line, there was absolute agreement with what the Government propose, just as there is unanimous support for it in the Select Committee.</p>
	<p pid="a.1704.1/4">I want to raise two issues with the Home Secretary. The first relates to the position of the Attorney-General and the importance of Law Officers being involved in this process. As the Home Secretary said and as I know from being a Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Attorney-General and the Solicitor-General and a junior Minister in the Lord Chancellor&#8217;s Department in the last Government, advice given by the Attorney-General or Solicitor-General is by its nature confidential to the Government. However, when this case was first decided on in Salford, I think it was incumbent on Greater Manchester police, who had conduct of this matter, to inform Home Office officials about it, and I am sure that they did. I have not checked the time line, but I am sure that is what they said they did. The Home Office officials should then have consulted the law officers. After all, the Attorney-General and Solicitor-General</p>
	<p pid="a.1704.1/5">have superintendence over the Director of Public Prosecutions, whose role is extremely important in these matters.</p>
	<p pid="a.1704.1/6">I am sure that if <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40502" name="Mark Reckless">the hon. Member for Rochester and Strood (Mark Reckless)</phrase> catches your eye, Mr Deputy Speaker, he will talk about the role of ACPO in this matter. Of course we are interested in the role of ACPO, because under the new landscape of policing, ACPO will be reformed. In making this legislation, we are putting a lot of faith in the advice given to ACPO by two Queen&#8217;s counsel, and in the advice that it gave Ministers. The chief constable of Essex clarified after the evidence session that he finally told the Minister for Policing and Criminal Justice last Thursday that it was time to go back to the House to pass legislation, which is what the Minister told the House last Thursday. The chief constable had originally told the Committee in open session that it was the day after when he finally made up his mind.</p>
	<p pid="a.1704.1/7">I do not think that these issues ought to be left to ACPO. They are serious issues that ought to occupy the time of Home Office officials. I hope that Home Office officials in this case did alert the Law Officers. I am not asking for a time line from the Minister when he replies, but it would be nice to know whether that happened. I believe that the Law Officers and the Treasury Solicitor&#8217;s Department have a role in this, because at the end of the day, it is they who have to go to the courts to represent the Government. I accept what the Home Secretary says and that she has no locus standi in these matters, but this needs to be kept under review. If we look to the future rather than the past, and accept that what the Government have to do, as outlined by the Home Secretary, is the right approach, we should be aware that these things may well happen in the future. I know about the points made by Professor Michael Zander. I have not put down a parliamentary question to ask whether <i>The Criminal Law Review</i>, where he wrote his article, is standard reading in the Home Office or the Law Officers&#8217; Department.</p>

I am sure that with his immense experience at the Home Affairs Committee, he will accept the role that ACPO had, not only in seeking its own legal advice, but in looking at the operational implications.

	<p pid="a.1705.1/1">The Home Secretary is absolutely right; the operational decisions have to be taken by ACPO. I just say to her that in her new landscape, ACPO&#8217;s role will change. She may therefore want to consider whether this area should be led by whatever ACPO becomes or whether it should be another part of the new landscape. This issue might happen again. I want to make it absolutely clear that none of this is the fault of Ministers.

	<p pid="a.1706.0/1">It is a pleasure to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40358" name="Keith Vaz">the right hon. Member for Leicester East (Keith Vaz)</phrase>. As always, I agree with much of what he says, if not quite all.</p>
	<p pid="a.1706.0/2">I rise, of course, to speak in support of the Bill. It has yet to be made entirely clear to me exactly how it could have been thought appropriate to put public safety at risk for the sake of a literalist interpretation of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 that flies in the face not only of the intentions of Parliament in passing the Act in the first place but of a full quarter-century of practice and interpretation of it by police, defence lawyers and judges up and down the country. Surely if <i>Hansard</i> could not have acted as a guide, case law might have served that purpose. I accept that sections 41 to 44 of the Act may leave the point unclear on the face of it, but given that parliamentary debates show the clear original intention that a suspect should be detained and questioned for 96 hours in total, rather than for only 96 hours following arrest, not to mention the precedent of 25 years of criminal law, one would have hoped for a little common sense, especially considering the stakes at hand.</p>
	<p pid="a.1706.0/3">As has been stated, Mr Justice McCombe was of the opinion that the consequences of his judgment were</p>
	<p pid="a.1706.0/4">&#8220;not as severe as might be feared&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1706.0/5">I am afraid that, as has also been pointed out, that was not the view of the chief constable of Essex, who is the ACPO lead on police bail, or of Commander Steve Bloomfield of the Met, who gave evidence to the Home Affairs Committee on the subject on Tuesday. They are of the opinion that not only does the ruling throw into disarray the investigation and case management of the more than 80,000 suspects in this country who are currently on police bail, but it renders any conditions attached to that bail all but unenforceable.</p>
	<p pid="a.1706.0/6">That has deeply worrying public protection implications for victims and witnesses of violent crimes, and particularly for victims of domestic abuse. Suspects who have been arrested for domestic violence-related offences and released on bail are likely to have conditions attached to that bail, designed to protect their victim. In the absence of those conditions, the police have lost not only part of the time needed to investigate and build solid cases against violent offenders, but a tool used to protect victims and witnesses while they do it.</p>
	<p pid="a.1706.0/7">I know that ACPO has issued guidance to police forces on how to protect victims and witnesses in the short time that remains until the Bill is passed, but will the Minister give the House an assurance that the Home Office is doing everything it can to offer additional support to ensure that victim and witness protection is in no way compromised by this irresponsible judgment?</p>
	<p pid="a.1706.0/8">It is entirely appropriate, in this case, that the Bill is retrospective. In almost every other instance retrospective legislation would be controversial, but in this case I believe the Bill is intended merely to create continuity, not to create new taxes or offences. As I understand it, the retrospective nature of the Bill is necessary to ensure that no criminal cases or convictions that have proceeded in the gap between the initial judgment and the passing of the Bill are rendered unsafe. I wonder whether, in his winding-up speech, the Minister might be able to confirm that.</p>
	<p pid="a.1706.0/9">From looking into this issue, the only area of the bail system that seems to me to need further consideration that will be impossible within the context of the Bill is the issue of time limits and overly onerous conditions. At the moment there are no statutory time limits on bail, and there are uncertain guidelines for magistrates as to appropriate conditions to be placed on bail. As a result, a suspect could theoretically be left on bail indefinitely. Although I am aware that the Crown Prosecution Service must charge someone suspected of a summary offence within six months, it seems to me that the current system of indefinite bail should be considered in the context of wider policing and justice reforms in future.</p>
	<p pid="a.1706.0/10">I will close now, so that we can make progress. Needless to say, I think it is entirely appropriate that this emergency legislation has been brought forward today, to make it absolutely clear that the detention clock may be stopped by bail. It is not just a matter of convenience for the police; it is a matter of justice and public protection.</p>
	<p pid="a.1706.0/11">Bailing suspects while police continue investigations ensures that police are not pressured into premature or inappropriate charging that could result in all manner of miscarriages of justice. It means that police are not tempted to try to detain people for the maximum 96 hours needlessly, when release on bail would be more proportionate to the offence and would not pose any risk to the public. Most importantly, bailing suspects with conditions means that victims, witnesses and potential victims of violent offences can be better protected by the police while the case against an offender is investigated and a conviction secured. The Bill will help the police do their job better and keep the public safer, and as such it has my full support.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-07-07a.1707.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40319" speakername="Frank Dobson" colnum="1707"  time="014:14:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110707/debtext/110707-0002.htm#11070745001330">
	<p pid="a.1707.0/1">It is the anniversary of the bomb outrages of <phrase class="date" code="2011-07-07">7 July</phrase>, and the bulk of the people who were killed and maimed in those outrages were in my constituency. That is one reason why I would not want anything to happen that made life and work more difficult for our police service. Like the ambulance service and the fire service, the police are different from the rest of us. When something disastrous occurs, the rest of us prudently run away. The police, like the firefighters and ambulance crews, rush in the opposite direction to offer aid and assistance. Nothing that I say should be interpreted as being against the police.</p>
	<p pid="a.1707.0/2">I welcome the Bill and accept the need to clarify the law so that it is what everyone thought it was when it was passed by the House 25 years ago. If there was any ambiguity in it, I think I am the only guilty party present in the House today. I was a Member at that time, and I do not think anyone else here was.</p>
	<p pid="a.1707.0/3">Clearly, being on bail is better than being in jail, but being on bail is being not quite free. A considerable number of people are released on police bail and eventually turn out not to be guilty of anything. We need to remember that bail is applied to our fellow citizens, and we need to try to protect them from what is unreasonable. I have had cases drawn to my attention in the past few years of people on greatly protracted periods of bail. I do not believe that that is acceptable.</p>
	<p pid="a.1707.0/4">It seems to me that there has been a gradual build-up of protracted periods of bail. My understanding is that neither the Home Office nor the police have the faintest idea whether that is true, because they do not have any figures. I urge the Minister to accept that it would be a sound idea for the Home Office to start collecting such figures, so that we have a measure of the problem. Clearly, given the need to clarify the law urgently, we do not have the opportunity now to consider properly what constraints might be put in place to protect people against unjustifiably protracted periods of bail, but we need to consider introducing such constraints.</p>
	<p pid="a.1707.0/5">There might be objections to making the extension of bail subject to a judicial process, because in at least some cases the police might not wish to disclose publicly at that point what evidence was available to them. However, we do need some constraints, and I wonder whether the Minister will accept that if he takes advice from ACPO, he might also give it some advice so that the chief police officers take more seriously the problem of protracted bail. We could say, for instance, that if bail goes beyond a year, it has to be renewed with the specific personal consent of the chief constable of the area concerned. That might turn out to be a useful management tool, because it would draw to the attention of the chief constable how many cases were particularly protracted.</p>
	<p pid="a.1707.0/6">I hope that we can at least agree in principle that in future, we need some measurement and logging of protracted periods of bail, and some constraint on them. We owe that to our fellow citizens. It is always worth remembering that all the people who are on bail are innocent until charged and found guilty. They are our fellow citizens, and we need to remember that.</p>
	<p pid="a.1707.0/7">I strongly support the Bill, but I hope that we will consider the problem much more seriously and at greater length, and perhaps with a little more sympathy for people who are out on bail, in the near future. It is not something that we can knock forward for another 25 years.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-07-07a.1708.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40197" speakername="Gareth Johnson" colnum="1708"  time="014:19:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110707/debtext/110707-0002.htm#11070745001331">
	<p pid="a.1708.0/1">It is a pleasure to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40319" name="Frank Dobson">the right hon. Member for Holborn and St Pancras (Frank Dobson)</phrase>. I am sure that he would agree that the reason for this debate is a surprising decision by the High Court that clearly needs to be overturned. The decision highlights the problems that can occur when courts use the literal rule when interpreting Acts of Parliament, and do not look closely enough at Parliament&#8217;s intention. It is regrettable that in this case, Parliament&#8217;s intention did not prevail over the literal interpretation of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984.</p>
	<p pid="a.1708.0/2">The Hookway case effectively prevents the police from bailing someone for more than 96 hours. Clearly, that situation cannot be allowed to prevail. I spent many years working in the criminal justice system, and I have dealt with a number of warrants for further detention. In my experience, they are not rubber-stamped by the magistrates courts, but very carefully considered. They are also fairly rare, and even rarer when the suspect has previously been on bail. However, the decision in Hookway has clear implications far beyond that case, hence what was previously a necessary intention to change the judgment because of a narrow interpretation of the case very rapidly became an urgent necessity, because of the wider implications that we now know exist in Hookway.</p>
	<p pid="a.1708.0/3">One area where that judgment will have the greatest impact is, I believe, identity parades. Suspects are often released on bail so that they can return for ID procedures to be carried out. They are booked into custody for that to happen, at which stage the detention clock recommences. The Hookway case actually prevents that from happening &#8212;it has stopped a perfectly logical ID parade procedure from taking place in future&#8212;and undermines all the work that has taken place to provide effective ID parades.</p>
	<p pid="a.1708.0/4">The case also affects procedures when suspects are bailed more generally, because they are usually placed temporarily and technically back into custody when charging takes place. That cannot now occur without adequate revision of the Hookway case, which the Bill seeks to implement.</p>
	<p pid="a.1708.0/5">During the debate, it has been said a number of times that the police can detain initially for a 24-hour period after the custody sergeant has given his authorisation. That is correct, but it is also the case that it is subject to a review by an inspector after a six-hour period, and then twice more after successive nine-hour periods have elapsed. The checks and balances that we want to see in place exist while a suspect is in police custody, and indeed thereafter.</p>
	<p pid="a.1708.0/6">I therefore support the Bill. The only danger is that it could be misinterpreted&#8212;the police might believe that there is no longer a requirement for them to act in an expeditious manner. I sincerely hope that the police will not see the Bill as some sort of green light to keep suspects on bail for an inordinate period before any charging decision is made. That was the point that my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40555" name="Robert Buckland">the Member for South Swindon (Mr Buckland)</phrase> tried to make&#8212;he came up with some suggestions on how we can ensure that there is adequate provision to prevent that from happening, and to ensure that there is a greater degree of certainty than is currently in place. Liberty is suggesting that a period of six months should be the maximum. Like my hon. Friend, I am cautious about having a prescribed period, but there needs to be clear justification when suspects are kept on bail for lengthy periods. We would all agree that that situation helps neither the suspect nor the victim of the crime.</p>
	<p pid="a.1708.0/7">I have dealt with numerous situations in which people have been bailed for the inordinate periods that my hon. Friend mentioned. There is little recourse for those people, other than making a lengthy and costly judicial review application to the High Court. They simply have to suffer that inordinate delay and return again and again to the police station, waiting, and sometimes hoping and pleading, for a decision to made in their case.</p>
	<p pid="a.1708.0/8">One positive aspect of this situation is the opportunity it has given to us to look at the issue of the length of police bail and the issues that surround it. I hope that we can look for some improvements in future.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-07-07a.1709.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40142" speakername="Julian Huppert" colnum="1709"  time="014:25:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110707/debtext/110707-0002.htm#11070745001332">
	<p pid="a.1709.0/1">I shall try to be brief, so that we can conclude the debate. I support the Bill, for the reasons that have been set out admirably by right hon. and hon. Members on both sides of the House. I am concerned about any form of exceptional legislation&#8212;it is something that we should always be extremely guarded about, whatever the reason for it is&#8212;but this is exceptional legislation, and I understand</p>
	<p pid="a.1709.0/2">absolutely why we need it. There is no issue with that, but I have a number of concerns about police bail in its wider sense, as has been discussed. I shall therefore not focus on the legal niceties of the Hookway case&#8212;that has been discussed already&#8212;but I want to say a few things about police bail in the wider sense.</p>
	<p pid="a.1709.0/3">First, the Bill is clearly a necessary clarification of the law&#8212;there is no doubt about that. Looking at previous legislation, it is clear that the Hookway case is a matter of interpretation. The best thing to do is to make its interpretation easier for judges and lawyers in future. I am tempted to talk about how legislation is drafted in this country&#8212;we do not always seek to avoid such problems&#8212;but I will restrain myself from doing so in any great detail.</p>
	<p pid="a.1709.0/4">My one concern is the retrospective nature of the Bill and saying that the amendments are</p>
	<p pid="a.1709.0/5">&#8220;deemed always to have had effect&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1709.0/6">I should like to place on record my gratitude to the Home Secretary for clarifying that in her earlier remarks, but I want to flag up now that we should be very cautious and careful in examining anything that purports to be retrospective. We should not allow it to sail past, but carefully ask questions about the rationale for such measures.</p>
	<p pid="a.1709.0/7">One question that I did not put to the Home Secretary, but to which the Minister for Policing and Criminal Justice will perhaps respond, is on a topic in which I am not normally interested: the royal diary. Are we clear exactly when we will get Royal Assent to the Bill?</p>
	<p pid="a.1709.0/8">There is urgent need for wider reform in this area, and I hope the Government return to it, and that they do not end with this Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.1709.0/9">My second point is that it was absolutely right for a number of leading lawyers, including a former Solicitor-General, to today raise concerns about some of the abuses of police bail. I do not agree with their comments on the Bill&#8212;they called for it not to go through, but I believe that it is absolutely necessary&#8212;but the Home Secretary needs to introduce greater safeguards to prevent abuse of such wider powers.</p>
	<p pid="a.1709.0/10">The Bill returns us to a position in which there is no statutory time limit, as we have already discussed, and the police can impose a number of conditions. That means that police bail can be very oppressive. I am particularly concerned about that in the context of peaceful protest. In the past couple of years, we have seen a number of cases of the use of pre-emptive arrest before planned, legal and peaceful protests. In 2009, 114 environmental protesters were arrested at the Iona independent school in Sneinton, Nottingham. They were arrested shortly before a planned protest at an E.ON power station. They were then released without charge on police bail, which prevented them from getting involved with the protest. Potentially, restrictive police bail conditions give police the cumulative power to extinguish the right of peaceful protest&#8212;especially for time-sensitive demonstrations&#8212;which we should all wish to see supported. There was a similar case of police bail during the occupation of Fortnum &amp; Mason on <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-26">26 March</phrase> this year, which I have discussed in the Home Affairs Committee.</p>
	<p pid="a.1709.0/11">I agree with Liberty and other hon. Members who say that we should consider a time limit. That time limit should be proportionate both to the complexity and the</p>
	<p pid="a.1709.0/12">severity of the case. This is not the Bill to do that, as obviously we could not use it to do the issue justice, but I hope that we could consider it in the plethora of other Home Office Bills before Parliament. It would be simple to do it via the Protection of Freedoms Bill or the Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures Bill. One could also look at the issue of bail for immigration in that context, because there are some questions about that that need to be looked at.</p>
	<p pid="a.1709.0/13">There is a slightly bizarre lacuna, introduced by the last Government, in the police bail powers, which is that pre-charge police bail is not allowed in terrorism-related cases. It is important to mention that today, the sixth anniversary of the London bombings, because we have made a mess of how we deal with terrorism cases. We have warehoused people under a system outside the normal legal framework. I have argued that we should use the police bail system, which offers similar restrictions and controls to what is proposed in control orders and the Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures Bill. It differs in detail, of course, but it does fit within the normal legal framework. I was delighted by the comments of the shadow Home Secretary&#8212;in stark contrast to the shadow Minister on the Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures Bill&#8212;when she agreed that police bail should be explored where it can be used for terrorism offences. That is a great step forward. It may not be appropriate in every single case, but we should have a system&#8212;with appropriate safeguards, via the Home Secretary&#8217;s applications, as I outlined in the Bill Committee&#8212;so that police bail could be used when possible for terrorism cases. That would help to move us towards a normal legal process.</p>
	<p pid="a.1709.0/14">I well understand the urgency behind the Bill and I do not wish to detain the House any longer. I urge the Home Secretary to consider all the issues that have been raised and the importance of getting police bail right, when the rush is over. We need to ensure that we safeguard peaceful protest, improve our national security and restore our liberty. It would be great to do all that at once. If we controlled police bail better, we could use it in terrorist cases to give us due legal process, security and liberty, as well as more of the normal rule of law.</p>

	<p pid="a.1711.0/1">The liberty of the individual should be a matter for this place first and foremost, so the fact that this is emergency legislation should not be a cause of embarrassment or shame&#8212;it should be welcomed. Judges have an important role in interpreting the law. Their role is primarily to interpret rather than to enact. That is why I am entirely content that it is this place that will make the important decision about the ambit of police bail. It is not a matter for shame, but nor is it quite a matter for celebration, bearing in mind the fact this House is a busy place and we have a lot of work to do.</p>
	<p pid="a.1711.0/2">It should perhaps be a matter for quiet reflection that it is the primacy of the legislature that matters when it comes to fundamental issues of liberty&#8212;that is what we are dealing with today&#8212;and the constant balance that we have to maintain between liberty and the public interest in being protected from crime and its consequences, however minor or serious. I was glad to be reminded by</p>
	<p pid="a.1711.0/3"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40319" name="Frank Dobson">the right hon. Member for Holborn and St Pancras (Frank Dobson)</phrase> about the sad anniversary that we have reached today.</p>
	<p pid="a.1711.0/4">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40197" name="Gareth Johnson">the Member for Dartford (Gareth Johnson)</phrase>, in his excellent contribution drawn from years of experience as a criminal practitioner, made some important practical points about the problems that would quickly come about if the House did not take swift action. The examples that he gave&#8212;including the identification procedure problem&#8212;were well made and do not need repeating by me. However, on a more fundamental level, one aspect that perhaps we have not emphasised today is the interests of the victims and witnesses of crime. In many cases, they give the police statements and then have to wait an inordinate length of time before they know the outcome of the case or are called to court to give evidence. That is one of the main problems encountered day in, day out by courts across the land when dealing with some of the delays caused by readmission to police bail by suspects, sometimes for an inordinate length of time.</p>
	<p pid="a.1711.0/5">The debate comes at an opportune moment because it gives us a chance to look at the whole ambit or spectrum of police bail, not only from the point of view of the suspect or the defence lawyer, but from the point of view of the victim of crime, the complainant or witness, waiting anxiously. In many cases, I have seen the frustration of judges when they hear that decisions about charge have been put off time and again, causing witnesses to lose heart or to lose interest. Sometimes cases fail at that final stage in court, and that is unforgiveable from a variety of perspectives, but most of all from the public interest perspective. That is why the points made today about limits on police bail were well made and deserve serious consideration as we proceed.</p>
	<p pid="a.1711.0/6">The challenge facing the court in Salford was one that the learned judge himself described in paragraphs 18 and 19 of his judgment as being of &#8220;limited application&#8221;. That was the view of the learned High Court judge, and it was a view that, on examination by Professor Zander, was challenged. A debate then began. Professor Zander is an eminent academic and has enjoyed a peon of praise today from hon. Members on both sides of the House&#8212;I am sure that he is enjoying every minute of it. It is thoroughly deserved, but I think that he would agree that to elevate his article to advice status would overplay it. In my view, he opened a welcome debate on the effects of the judgment. It is a debate that Mr Justice McCombe put himself on the other side of by dint of his remarks in paragraph 18 and 19. With respect to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40427" name="Yvette Cooper">the right hon. Member for Normanton, Pontefract and Castleford (Yvette Cooper)</phrase>, it is a little trite to suggest that the consequences of the decision were set in stone some weeks ago. The position only became clear when that debate was initiated, and I think that the Government are to be congratulated on taking effective action.</p>
	<p pid="a.1711.0/7">The Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 was seminal legislation. It was not drafted on the hoof, but put together after many months of careful work and input from all sections of those interested in the criminal justice system. It was a game-changer in so many important ways. It was progressive legislation that, at a stroke, made clear and transparent certain procedures that had often seemed in the police station obscure and frankly worrying not only to suspects but to police officers themselves. It was a Conservative Government&#8212;the</p>
	<p pid="a.1711.0/8">noble Lord Brittan was Home Secretary and his Minister of State was the noble Lord Hurd&#8212;who steered that excellent legislation through the House. It has stood the test of time admirably.</p>
	<p pid="a.1711.0/9">As with all legislation scrutinised by the House, however, the 1984 Act might be found to be only human. I am reminded of the remarks of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40472" name="Nicola Blackwood">the Member for Oxford West and Abingdon (Nicola Blackwood)</phrase>. She was right to say that the Act was silent on the effect of section 44. We all have to concede that. After Royal Assent, however, practitioners and everybody concerned with the process came to the assumption&#8212;the right assumption, I think&#8212;that the clock would stop and start as long as the suspect was in police detention, and that the concept of time was not absolute but relative to the time spent in detention. That was well understood by everybody in the system. For 25 years that assumption will have been made by practitioners from the humblest junior solicitor to the highest of High Court judges. They need make no apology for having done so.</p>

	<p pid="a.1713.0/1">To be clear, is it not the case that that assumption arose not out of thin air or a desire for convenience, but out of the fact that that was the intention made clear in parliamentary debates at the time?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-07-07a.1713.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40555" speakername="Robert Buckland" colnum="1713"  time="014:31:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110707/debtext/110707-0002.htm#11070745001335">
	<p pid="a.1713.1/1">That is indeed the case, as was helpfully set out in Professor Zander&#8217;s article, where he took the trouble to remind himself of the case of Pepper <i>v.</i> Hart, which allows judges to look at <i>Hansard</i> if there is any ambiguity about the intention of the legislature. Unlike the judge in the decision in question, he examined <i>Hansard</i> and found buried in the debates in what were then called Standing Committees&#8212;the predecessor title, as it were, of Public Bill Committees&#8212;a clear understanding on the part of all parties. It was the former Member for Birmingham, Ladywood, Miss Short, who tabled an amendment designed to ensure that the suspect would be detained for no more than 96 hours, and the then Minister of State, now the noble Lord Hurd, who responded. It was quite clear from that debate that there was an understanding that time would stop and start according to when the suspect was in detention.</p>
	<p pid="a.1713.1/2">With respect to the learned High Court judge, that debate would have assisted him in his deliberations and given him great comfort and support in coming to what we would all have regarded as a purposive decision&#8212;that is, a decision that would have given purpose to the intention of the legislators and reinforced a quarter of a century of practice. Sadly, we know that that was not the case, although we should hesitate before rushing to criticism of our judges. They have a tough job to do. They have to make decisions day in, day out. They are presented with a range of different scenarios and cases. I do not think that anyone should rush to criticise the judiciary in that respect because of one difficult case. However, I return to the point that I made at the beginning of my speech. I am glad that it is this place&#8212;this House&#8212;that is reinforcing and reiterating the law as we have all understood it to be, and which will now, in my submission, be put beyond any doubt whatever.</p>
	<p pid="a.1713.1/3">I know that voices outside this place have urged caution on us in rushing this legislation through, although a lot of their concerns have been addressed in the remarks made by other Members today, which I will</p>
	<p pid="a.1713.1/4">not repeat. I have made some suggestions about the potential limitations on police bail&#8212;for example, in cases that do not involve a large amount of documentation or serious fraud&#8212;but I want to return to straightforward examples of cases involving violence or assault, where far too often, over-cautious lawyers have waited before charge for all the evidence to be gathered, including medical evidence. Frankly, my suggestion to them is to remember how we used to do it. We would charge and then gather the evidence as quickly as possible, to ensure that we did not lose the interest, enthusiasm and participation of prosecution witnesses along the way.</p>
	<p pid="a.1713.1/5">The coalition Government quite rightly restored the decision-making power for certain offences to the police. That was a wise decision, which I believe will allow minds to be focused in the police station when dealing with a range of less serious offences. That will leave more serious offences to be dealt with by the Crown Prosecution Service as part of the advice-before-charge procedure. At that stage, everybody needs to remember what we have said today in this House and elsewhere about the need for expedition and the need for good judgment to be exercised, even though all the evidence might not have been gathered.</p>
	<p pid="a.1713.1/6">I will draw my remarks to a close. I support giving the Bill its Second Reading, and I think that we as a House should be glad that such decisions are falling to us.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-07-07a.1714.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40105" speakername="Tobias Ellwood" colnum="1714"  time="014:43:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110707/debtext/110707-0003.htm#11070745001336">
	<p pid="a.1714.0/1">It is important that we should have this debate. There has been a lot of discussion about why this has been rushed through in the way that it has. We are here to amend the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. The sole purpose is to clarify the distinction between periods of detention and periods of police bail. I want to add my concern about rushed legislation and fast-tracking Bills. It was before my time, but I can certainly remember the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 going through&#8212;as well as legislation to deal with handguns&#8212;at a time when Governments wanted to be seen to be doing something, rather than amend the law in a correct and measured way. It is important when we debate legislation to ensure that there is time to digest the impact, make amendments and allow the public and other interested groups to comment on what is going on.</p>
	<p pid="a.1714.0/2">This, however, is a simple and straightforward Bill. In fact, I have never seen such a short Bill. It consists of one page containing two clauses, the second of which simply deals with the geographical reach of the measure and confirms the Bill&#8217;s full name. Indeed, the explanatory notes are longer than the Bill. It is none the less an important Bill. It looks at periods of detention in England and Wales, wherein a suspect can be detained initially for up to 24 hours, and for a further 12 hours if approved by a senior officer such as a superintendent. Detention for a further 36 hours can be applied for through a magistrates court, which can then be added on, giving a total cap of 96 hours, at which point the detention clock, as it has been labelled, stops.</p>
	<p pid="a.1714.0/3">At that point, the police have the option either to charge the suspect or to release them, or to place them on bail. We previously assumed that the detention clock paused when that bail was imposed, and restarted after the bail period was complete. However, we now face a new interpretation of the 1984 Act. Following the murder</p>
	<p pid="a.1714.0/4">case involving Paul Hookway, Salford magistrates court has thrown a different light on the provisions. That has led to the police detention period and the bail period being capped at a total of 96 hours. That decision has been upheld in the High Court and, as a consequence, we are now having to rush this legislation through today.</p>
	<p pid="a.1714.0/5">The Opposition have called for temporary legislation or a sunset clause to deal with this, but I think that that is unnecessary on two counts. First, we are a legislative body, and if we eventually find that this legislation is inappropriate, we can come back and amend it through primary legislation at any time. Secondly, this is not new law. It will simply take us back to the status quo.</p>
	<p pid="a.1714.0/6">There has clearly been some confusion since the new interpretation of the law was confirmed, and I have a number of questions for the Minister. During the period of confusion before the Bill gains Royal Assent, what will be the impact on the 80,000 or so people who are on bail at the moment? Given that bail conditions are designed for the protection of victims, will there be any consequences for victims who need to be protected during this period following the reinterpretation of the law? I also want to ask&#8212;not flippantly; it is a serious point&#8212;whether the Home Office has scoured the remaining sections of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act, or indeed the Bail Act 1976, to ensure that no other loopholes are likely be discovered by an eagle-eyed magistrate, resulting in our having to do something similar to this in future?</p>
	<p pid="a.1714.0/7">I very much welcome the Bill, despite the expeditious nature of its passage through the House. It does nothing but change the law on paper, and it will allow the courts to continue to interpret the law in the spirit that the 1984 Act originally intended.</p>

	<p pid="a.1715.0/1"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40319" name="Frank Dobson">The right hon. Member for Holborn and St Pancras (Frank Dobson)</phrase> began his speech by reminding the House of the impact of 7/7, on this, the anniversary of that atrocity. My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary also paid her tribute to the victims of that crime this morning. It is a sobering reminder of the continuing importance of public protection, which is what we are debating today. I am grateful that right hon. and hon. Members on both sides of the House have supported the need for this emergency legislation. Certain issues have been raised, and I shall try to deal with them briefly now. It is important to note, however, that there was no dissent over the principle behind the legislation. It is widely accepted that there needs to be a correction to the rather extraordinary judgment of the High Court, which overturned 25 years of practice and legal understanding.</p>
	<p pid="a.1715.0/2">The Government are grateful to all parties for the support expressed, particularly the official Opposition for their support in enabling this emergency legislation to go forward, and I am also grateful for the support of Liberal Democrat Members. There is unanimity on the need to deal with this situation as swiftly as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.1715.0/3">I begin by clearing up one or two of the more technical issues. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40142" name="Julian Huppert">the Member for Cambridge (Dr Huppert)</phrase> asked a specific question about when the Bill could be expected to receive Royal Assent. Subject</p>
	<p pid="a.1715.0/4">to the Bill being approved by both Houses, we aim to secure Royal Assent before the other place rises on <phrase class="date" code="2011-07-12">Tuesday 12 July</phrase>. The legal change will then come into effect immediately. I hope that that answers the point.</p>
	<p pid="a.1715.0/5">For the record, I would like to clear up issues raised by the shadow Home Secretary, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40427" name="Yvette Cooper">the right hon. Member for Normanton, Pontefract and Castleford (Yvette Cooper)</phrase>, and by the Chairman of the Home Affairs Committee, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40358" name="Keith Vaz">the right hon. Member for Leicester East (Keith Vaz)</phrase>, about the role of the Law Officers in this matter. Although the right hon. Member for Normanton, Pontefract and Castleford said&#8212;I hope I quote her accurately&#8212;that it is common for Ministers to say whether they have had advice from Law Officers, page 447 of &#8220;Erskine May&#8221; states:</p>
	<p pid="a.1715.0/6">&#8220;By longstanding convention observed by successive Governments, the fact of, and substance of advice from, the law officers of the Crown is not disclosed outside Government&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1715.0/7">I hope that that helps to clarify the matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.1715.0/8">It is nevertheless important to reassure the House that the Crown Prosecution Service was involved in discussions with ACPO and officials soon after the written judgment was received. I hope that the Chairman of the Select Committee&#8212;he is not in his place at the moment&#8212;will be reassured when he reads what I had to say. The CPS has certainly been involved in trying to assess the legal implications at the same time as ACPO was trying to assess the practical implications.</p>

	<p pid="a.1716.0/1">The issue of the involvement of the Attorney-General is important. It is not simply about whether the Government might be prejudicing their case in a trial, which has been the traditional reason why the content of legal advice is not disclosed; it is about whether the Government did the right thing in response to a very pressing situation. The Minister really needs to confirm whether the Attorney-General intervened in the case in the hearing before the Supreme Court, which the Supreme Court gave him the opportunity to do. Did he do that earlier this week or not? Given that, according to Lord Goldsmith in his evidence to the Constitutional Affairs Committee, the Attorney-General has the power to bring or intervene in other legal proceedings in the public interest, did the Attorney-General consider whether he could intervene in the public interest by a request for a stay of judgment?</p>

	<p pid="a.1716.1/1">The right hon. Lady continues to seek to make what appears to me to be political hay out of this situation when the Government are doing everything they can to redress it. I noted yesterday that she made the absurd suggestion that somehow there had been a delay regarding the Supreme Court&#8217;s refusal to grant a stay of execution, which might have explained why it refused the stay. On her own analysis, the Supreme Court would have granted a stay of execution&#8212;or might have done so&#8212;when the implications of this judgment were not clear, yet for some reason it decided not to grant the stay of execution when the implications were made clear. The right hon. Lady takes a whole set of completely inconsistent positions simply because she wants to make political points that are inappropriate when we are seeking to address a serious political matter.</p>

	<p pid="a.1717.1/1">I want to make some progress, if the right hon. Lady will forgive me, as I have only five minutes left.</p>
	<p pid="a.1717.1/2">Specific questions were raised by my hon. Friends the Members for Oxford West and Abingdon (Nicola Blackwood) and for Bournemouth East (Mr Ellwood). The police have assured us that they are doing all they can to ensure that public safety is not compromised, and are taking interim steps to manage the situation in its current form given the current state of the law as expressed by the High Court. However, they are anxious for the law to be restated in the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.1717.1/3">My hon. Friend the Member for Oxford West and Abingdon rightly raised the issue of the protection of victims and witnesses, which is at the centre of our approach. The police service shares our concern about the issue. The chief constable of Essex, Jim Barker-McCardle, has written to all chief police officers repeating his assurance that the service remains completely focused on doing all it can to protect the public, who, of course, include victims and witnesses.</p>
	<p pid="a.1717.1/4">Three substantive issues were raised by Members in all parts of the House. First, it was asked whether we should take the opportunity provided by the Bill to engage in what the shadow Home Secretary called a wider debate about, for instance, whether time limits on the use of police bail would be necessary. The right hon. Member for Holborn and St Pancras raised the issue of protracted bail periods, and my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40197" name="Gareth Johnson">the Member for Dartford (Gareth Johnson)</phrase> said that we should not give the green light to the keeping of suspects on bail, by which I assume he meant inappropriately.</p>
	<p pid="a.1717.1/5">My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary responded on that issue, but let me add that I do not think it appropriate to amend emergency legislation that seeks simply to restore the status quo ante by introducing limits on the use of police bail that have not applied for 25 years without proper consideration. As I said last Thursday, as far as I am aware no representations have been made to the Government about the inadequacy of police bail. Although in recent days some have suggested that it has been a cause of growing concern, I believe that they should set out that concern in a proper manner and on the basis of evidence. We need to have a proper debate about the issue, and were the Government to conclude that changes were needed, there would have to be proper consultation. Such provisions cannot be introduced in the emergency legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1717.1/6">It appears to me that opportunities are being taken to make statements that are not necessarily correct. For example, I noticed that the press release that accompanied this morning&#8217;s call by members of the legal profession for a delay in the legislation included the following statement by a spokesman from Mary Monson Solicitors, a firm that was involved in the original case:</p>
	<p pid="a.1717.1/7">&#8220;The legislation is being rushed through now without proper debate to widen police powers&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1717.1/8">It does not &#8220;widen police powers&#8221;; it restores to the police powers that they have had for 25 years. That is a serious misrepresentation of what the Bill seeks to do.</p>

	<p pid="a.1718.3/1">I am all in favour of evidence-based policy, but I think that rather than its merely being asserted that there is a problem, such a problem, if it exists, must be properly presented and, of course, backed up with data.</p>

A sunset clause would create further uncertainty, which is exactly what the police do not want. We do not want it either. This is a straightforward piece of legislation that restores the previous position. We also believe that the retrospective action that is being taken is necessary, because if it were not taken, hundreds of thousands of people would potentially have a claim for false imprisonment at any time over the past six years, which is the limitation period. Liberty has said:</p>
	<p pid="a.1718.3/3">&#8220;We do not believe that the proposals are retrospective in their nature as they do not seek retrospectively to create a criminal offence, sanction or other burden.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.1718.3/4">This is a sensible piece of legislation which was designed to correct an unusual judgment and restore 25 years of legal practice, and I commend it to the House.</p>

	<p pid="a.1718.4/1">On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. As Members will be aware, News Corporation&#8217;s proposed acquisition of BSkyB is now a matter of great public importance and interest. Rumours are circulating, and briefings are coming from the Department for Culture, Media and Sport that the Secretary of State intends to delay his decision for a minimum of three months. On an issue of such importance, and on the day when we hear that the phones of the families of brave men and women who died fighting for this country in Iraq and Afghanistan were hacked, the least the Secretary of State should do is come to the House as a matter of urgency this afternoon and make a statement.</p>

	<p pid="a.1718.5/1">As you know, Mr Lewis, it is not up to the Chair to demand that Ministers come to the House to make statements. It is very much up to Ministers to make that decision for themselves. Mr Speaker allowed an emergency debate yesterday on the phone hacking issue. I agree that it is a fast-moving and significant issue, but I have not been notified that any Minister intends to come to the House to make a statement today. If that changes however, the House will be told immediately in the usual way.</p>

	<p pid="a.1719.6/1">Perhaps I should explain to Members who were wondering why I was not standing up to speak that I was trying to give others a chance to make a contribution. Some of what I say may appear to repeat aspects of the debate we have already had, and although I do not mind being subjected to barracking, I hope I will not be subjected to barracking over and above what one might normally expect.</p>
	<p pid="a.1719.6/2">As we have now moved into Committee, let me go into a little more detail. To be fair to the Minister, a few moments ago he could have done with a little more time to address some of the measures he is trying to rush through. Clause 1 is essentially the Bill, so it is almost as if we are repeating Second Reading, but let me say again from the outset that we support the provisions in clause 1. We absolutely agree that we need to fast-track the Bill, and the reasons for that are well set out in the explanatory memorandum.</p>
	<p pid="a.1719.6/3">Earlier, the shadow Home Secretary was trying to elicit from the Government answers to two key questions on fast-tracking and the legal advice and preparation&#8212;or lack of it&#8212;that the Home Office made in introducing the Bill. First, our understanding is that the Attorney-General was asked by the Supreme Court to intervene in the public interest in the application for a stay of judgment. Did the Attorney-General intervene and support the Government? Was he involved in seeking that stay of judgment in the Supreme Court? As I say, we support the fast-tracking of the Bill, but secondly, will the Minister tell us when the Home Office commissioned officials to draw up draft legislation? It would be of interest to us all to know when that advice was commissioned, so that we could have greater clarity about the Bill and the speed with which the Home Office acted. Our view is that it did not act as quickly as it might or should have done.</p>
	<p pid="a.1719.6/4">We do not, in any way, underestimate the importance of and need for speed in this matter, as 80,000 individuals are currently on police bail. If hon. Members have not had the opportunity to look at the submission from The Trade Union and Professional Association for Family Court and Probation Staff&#8212;NAPO&#8212;I urge them to examine it. That body has put together some case studies that illustrate some of the difficulties that have arisen as a result of the judgments. I shall just discuss one of its examples, which relates to a 24-year-old man arrested on suspicion of an alcohol-fuelled assault and affray. He was held in cells overnight to sober up, and it is believed that that counts towards the 96 hours. His interview was then delayed for a further two hours to</p>
	<p pid="a.1719.6/5">wait for the duty solicitor. He was then bailed on condition that he avoided the victim and the pub, and the police are now collecting witness statements and forensic analysis from the site. Five days have already passed since the incident, and so the bail conditions will fall. NAPO&#8217;s submission contains other examples, which are set out for the Committee. Those case studies are extremely important and they show why the Government have introduced this fast-track Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.1719.6/6">In the previous debate the Minister started to respond to some of the questions posed by hon. Members from both sides of the House. If we examine what Liberty, Justice and many hon. Members have said about the Bill, we find that everyone accepts the need for it to be fast-tracked. However, we need to consider what my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40087" name="Stephen McCabe">the Member for Birmingham, Selly Oak (Steve McCabe)</phrase> was saying, as it goes to the heart of the matter. As he set out, the Bill contains no sunset clause and, irrespective of whether or not that is the right way to proceed, that does not mean that the Government should not consider some of the issues that people have raised. The fact that everyone accepts the need for it to be fast-tracked does not mean that we should not address the issues relating to time limits for how long somebody can and should be able to remain on police bail, and those concerning some of the conditions that are attached to bail.</p>
	<p pid="a.1719.6/7">I believe that the Minister said earlier that the system had been operating for 25 years without anybody raising such issues and so there was not previously a problem. I do not mean to misquote him, and apologise if I am doing so, but the fact&#8212;or not&#8212;that these issues have not been raised before does not mean that the Government should not consider examining those that have arisen as a consequence of the judgment. There needs to be a debate. Given that the Bill contains no sunset clause, will the Minister say whether he feels that there is a need for a debate about time limits and the application of conditions in police bail, just to see whether any change to the guidance should be made? They may well be no need as a result of that debate to make such a change, but all this throws up an opportunity for us to discuss with the police and others whether any change is needed.</p>

	<p pid="a.1720.0/1">I do not think that I have heard either on Second Reading or during this debate whether someone who decides to leave this country, which at the moment they are perfectly entitled to do, will be subject as of <phrase class="date" code="2011-07-12">12 July</phrase> to the retrospective conditions. Presumably it would cost quite a lot of money and time to try to bring that person back. Is that the kind of problem about which my hon. Friend is concerned? There is a category of people who would be perfectly at liberty to leave the country now because no controls apply to them, but whom we would want to contact and bring back because they are engaged in potentially quite serious offences.</p>

	<p pid="a.1720.1/2">The hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington&#8212;it might have been <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40142" name="Julian Huppert">the hon. Member for Cambridge (Dr Huppert)</phrase>&#8212;mentioned the use of police bail. Do we need to consider that? Is it totally appropriate? Are we sure that it works in the way that we would want in all circumstances?</p>
	<p pid="a.1720.1/3">One of the things about a fast-tracked Bill is that the information that comes to us is fast-tracked, too. Some Members were sent just this morning, when it was published, the report on police detention and bail by the House of Lords Select Committee on the Constitution. I do not know whether all Members have managed to see it. Although the Committee does not oppose what the Government are doing, it has raised one or two questions. It wonders whether, because the Bill is being fast-tracked with limited opportunity for amendment, the Government will need to return to consider some of the matters that might otherwise have been debated. It is important to consider the detail now we are in Committee, and the Constitution Committee raises the constitutional issue of the fact that Parliament is legislating before the Supreme Court has made a judgment. The Constitution Committee does not necessarily say that there is anything wrong with that, but states:</p>
	<p pid="a.1720.1/4">&#8220;We are concerned that asking Parliament to legislate in these highly unusual circumstances raises difficult issues of constitutional principle as regards both the separation of powers and the rule of law. We have noted the constitutionally important distinction between legislative and adjudicative functions before. We are concerned that, in the understandable&#8221;&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="a.1720.1/5">note the word &#8220;understandable&#8221;&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="a.1720.1/6">&#8220;rush to rectify a problem which the police have identified as being serious and urgent, insufficient time has been allowed for Parliament fully to consider the constitutional implications of what it is being asked to do.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.1720.1/7">The Committee says that it will return to the matter later in the year to consider what</p>
	<p pid="a.1720.1/8">&#8220;the effect of Parliament legislating in advance of the Supreme Court hearing may be on the Court when it hears the case on <phrase class="date" code="2011-07-25">25 July</phrase>.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.1720.1/9">Can the Minister tell the Committee the Government&#8217;s view? I appreciate that the Government might have seen the report only relatively recently and I am unsure whether the Minister will have had time fully to consider it. If the Minister has not had time to do that, he might need to ensure that there is a full discussion and debate in the other place.</p>
	<p pid="a.1720.1/10">The Minister has dealt with the issue of retrospection. I think that all hon. Members are concerned about retrospective legislation, and that concern is understandable in this regard. Will the Minister confirm that the Bill will apply only to cases after <phrase class="date" code="2011-05-19">19 May</phrase>&#8212;I think he said that it restores the law to what it was before the judgment&#8212;or will it impact on anything that happened before that judgment? We should be sure that we understand the extent to which the Bill will act retrospectively, so it would help the Committee if the Minister confirmed that point.</p>

	<p pid="a.1721.0/1">One of my concerns is that the decision might mean that the rule was ineffective going back 25 years and that a collection of people who believe that they were wrongly treated during that period might bring claims for compensation. There is some</p>
	<p pid="a.1721.0/2">detail about that in the explanatory note and my reading of the clause is that the retrospective effect rules out any such potential issue. Does the hon. Gentleman agree with that and welcome it?</p>

	<p pid="a.1722.0/1">I think so, but we are in Committee and I would need the detail in order to understand what legal advice the Government have had about retrospective effect before I could properly answer the hon. Gentleman. I thought that either the Minister or the Home Secretary had said that all this will apply only as far back as <phrase class="date" code="2011-05-19">19 May</phrase>, when the initial judgment was made. I seek to clarify whether it is possible to apply such provision to cases from the past 25 years. There will be a legal opinion on that and I suppose it will be either one thing or the other.</p>
	<p pid="a.1722.0/2">I have only a few brief points to make, because of course we all agree with the Bill. Clearly, we all want the Bill to become law as soon as possible and certainly before Parliament goes into recess. In answer to the very important question about Royal Assent, the Minister said that the Government aim for the Bill to become law on completion of its passage through the House of Lords, which is on Tuesday. Will he confirm that what he actually means is that Royal Assent will be given at the end of that day? Are the Government aiming for that, or will it definitely be given then? We all want absolute and firm assurance on that, because every Member of the House supports the Bill and will want to know, 100%, that Royal Assent will definitely be in place before the House rises for the summer recess. Of course, that is assuming that the Bill is passed by both Houses.</p>
	<p pid="a.1722.0/3">With those few brief comments and detailed points I will sit down and wait for the Minister&#8217;s response or to hear what other Members have to say.</p>

	<p pid="a.1722.1/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr Evans. I should like simply to expand a little further on the point I made in my intervention on <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40269" name="Vernon Coaker">the hon. Member for Gedling (Vernon Coaker)</phrase> about the potential for retrospective effect. We have seen, in relation to other issues earlier this year, how concerned the public are about any possibility of compensation being paid to people who are guilty of offences and are, perhaps, now being denied their right to vote. I expect the public would be incredibly concerned if people who have been through what was thought to be due legal process now had some chance of compensation, no matter how little, because that process, despite having been believed by everyone to be right, might have been ruled technically out of order by one judge in a verdict with which no one seems to agree. I accept the fact that, as is made clear in the explanatory notes, making the Bill&#8217;s provisions retrospective, right back to 1984, is an attempt to address that.</p>
	<p pid="a.1722.1/2">My concern is that to some extent we are in this mess because Parliament was not clear enough about its intentions when it passed the 1984 Act. It would be helpful if Parliament was entirely clear about what we mean when we give retrospective effect and if the Minister made explicit the intention, as set out in the explanatory notes, that these powers will be restored to what we all understood them to be for 25 years so that the courts will not allow any compensation claims. The explanatory notes are clear that that is what the Bill is attempting to do.</p>
	<p pid="a.1722.1/3">To try to clarify the point that the hon. Member for Gedling made, if he looks at page 9 of the explanatory notes, he will see that paragraph 36(c) states:</p>
	<p pid="a.1722.1/4">&#8220;Unless the Bill is given retrospective effect, it is possible that a very large number of people could bring claims for damages for detention occurring before the judgment, even though that detention was in accordance with what was honestly thought to be a long-understood legal position.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.1722.1/5">There could be a huge number of claims and a large amount of money at stake, and it would be very generous to think that some claims-handling firms would not go around trying to find people to make those claims and test the process.</p>
	<p pid="a.1722.1/6">I want to ask the Minister two questions. First, will he make it absolutely clear that the Government&#8217;s view, and Parliament&#8217;s intention, is that no compensation would be due? Secondly, will he address the point about whether it would be wise to add a separate subsection to the Bill that makes that absolutely explicit so that if and when such claims are brought there is no doubt that our intention is that no compensation should be due?</p>

	<p pid="a.1723.0/1"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40269" name="Vernon Coaker">The hon. Member for Gedling (Vernon Coaker)</phrase> and my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40043" name="Nigel Mills">the Member for Amber Valley (Nigel Mills)</phrase> have raised a number of concerns that I will try to answer, but first I wish to return to the Opposition&#8217;s general allegation about delay. It is simply not the view of senior police officers that there has been inappropriate delay in the matter. The Opposition are claiming something that does not have the support of those most affected by the judgment&#8217;s implications.</p>
	<p pid="a.1723.0/2">I attended the ACPO conference in Harrogate this week, which the hon. Gentleman joined for the last day, and talked with the chief constable of Greater Manchester police, the force originally affected. He said that at the time of the oral judgment his force could not believe that a single judgment in Salford could affect all the cases across the country and overturn something that had been operating since 1986. The police force affected did not appreciate at that stage the potential wider implications of the court&#8217;s decision. The High Court judge, Mr Justice McCombe, said that the consequences would not be</p>
	<p pid="a.1723.0/3">&#8220;as severe as might be feared&#8221;,</p>
	<p pid="a.1723.0/4">a view with which the shadow Home Secretary disagrees. As I noted earlier, the ACPO lead on the issue, the chief constable of Essex police, Jim Barker-McCardle, has said:</p>
	<p pid="a.1723.0/5">&#8220;It was only when ACPO received the written judgment on <phrase class="date" code="2011-06-17">17 June</phrase>&#8230;that the seriousness of the issue became apparent.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.1723.0/6">The chief constable of the force concerned did not appreciate the wider implications, the High Court judge said that the consequences were not severe and the ACPO lead said that their seriousness was not appreciated until <phrase class="date" code="2011-06-17">17 June</phrase>, and yet the Opposition appear to know differently and apparently, with astonishing clairvoyance, saw the need for action in May. Neither the police, nor the High Court judge saw the need for action, but the Opposition apparently did. This simply is not a credible position for the Opposition to take. I repeat that the Government acted as fast as we could. In particular, once we received formal advice from ACPO that it believed that emergency legislation was necessary, we acted very fast indeed.</p>
	<p pid="a.1723.0/7">I say to the hon. Member for Gedling&#8212;this is an important point&#8212;that the Opposition could take a different approach. He may remember that, in 2008, when the Supreme Court ruled on witness anonymity and against the common law understanding of the issue, the then Government decided to introduce emergency legislation and we supported them. I know that we did so because I led for the then Opposition. I did not claim that the Government of the day had in any way delayed, yet that emergency legislation was introduced to almost exactly the same timetable as this legislation after the written judgment had been received. We also hope that this legislation will be on the statute books sooner than that one was, so there is no need to strike such a partisan stance on the matter, given the cross-party agreement that it is necessary to do something. I am sorry that, when we need to consider the substance of the issue, the Opposition have continued to make political points, but I hope that deals with the issue of delay.</p>
	<p pid="a.1723.0/8">The hon. Gentleman also asked whether the Government felt there should be a debate about time limits. My point on Second Reading was that, if there are believed to be problems with the operation of police bail, and if the suggestion is that bail is being extended for too long a period or over-used, those who believe that to be the case should assemble their evidence and present a serious case, at which point I am sure that hon. Members on both sides will debate and consider it carefully.</p>
	<p pid="a.1723.0/9">Such points were made, it seems to the Government, at a very late stage and only when the High Court judgment came in, so we do not think it appropriate to amend the emergency legislation. That does not preclude sensible debate about the matter in future, but I gently point out to the hon. Gentleman that the Opposition did not raise them before that point, either. The House did not appear to be aware of a concern&#8212;if, indeed, there is widespread concern, and I do not presume that there is&#8212;about the operation of police bail.</p>
	<p pid="a.1723.0/10">The Government certainly do not have a closed mind to the issue, and of course we should pay the closest attention to a proper case, should one be made to us, but we will not arbitrarily and in a rushed manner set limits on the operation of police bail without proper evidence, proper understanding of the problem, proper consultation and proper consideration of the impact of such limits. That is a responsible position to take.</p>
	<p pid="a.1723.0/11">The hon. Gentleman asked also about the Government&#8217;s response to the Lords Constitution Committee report, which he correctly said we received just this morning, and in particular our response to its conclusion that there is an issue of constitutional principle regarding the separation of powers and the rule of law, because Parliament is introducing emergency legislation when an appeal is pending to the Supreme Court.</p>
	<p pid="a.1723.0/12">The Government do not see that the decision to legislate in advance of an outcome to that appeal raises any constitutional issues. The sovereignty of Parliament means that it is entirely open to Parliament to legislate at any time in response to a court judgment, and that is what we are doing.</p>
	<p pid="a.1723.0/13">The hon. Gentleman also raised the important issue of retrospection, about which my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40043" name="Nigel Mills">the Member for Amber Valley (Nigel Mills)</phrase> was also concerned in relation to compensation claims. The hon. Member for Gedling wanted in particular to know whether the retrospective nature of the Bill meant it went back only</p>
	<p pid="a.1723.0/14">to the original judgment on <phrase class="date" code="2011-05-19">19 May</phrase>. That is not the case, because the High Court judgment itself applied to all cases going back to 1986. The Court, owing to its different understanding of the Bail Act, stated that any cases prior to 1986 may have involved unlawful detention, so this legislation must go all the way back as well. That is why if hon. Members read clause 1(3) they will see the following wording:</p>
	<p pid="a.1723.0/15">&#8220;The amendments made by subsections (1) and (2) are deemed always to have had effect.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.1723.0/16">That is particularly important because we need to create legal certainty. As I said on Second Reading, it is important that we do not permit what might otherwise be the bringing of a rash of legal cases.</p>

	<p pid="a.1725.0/1">The Minister is providing helpful clarity in responding to what <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40043" name="Nigel Mills">the hon. Member for Amber Valley (Nigel Mills)</phrase> and I said. Without having the legal support that the Minister does, it was not immediately obvious to me that that was the case, and I was worried about it.

	<p pid="a.1725.1/1">I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s support, although I did it almost all on my own without the legal support that he claims. Nevertheless, that is the effect of the Bill, and that is important because it means that there is no doubt about the matter. Any claim based on what the High Court has said since the May judgment would not succeed because Parliament is stating clearly that the original understanding of the legislation should apply. I am happy to put on record that the Government&#8217;s, and I believe Parliament&#8217;s, intention is not to allow compensation claims that may have arisen as a consequence of this judgment. It is expressly our desire to prevent such claims, which would be improper and unwarranted in the circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="a.1725.1/2">The hon. Member for Gedling asked me a specific question about the Home Office&#8217;s preparedness for legislation&#8212;that is, did we prepare on a contingency basis before ACPO came to us with its formal request on the necessity for emergency legislation? ACPO presented its case to me on the morning of <phrase class="date" code="2011-06-30">Thursday 30 June</phrase>, and I made my oral statement less than two hours later. The Home Office had already studied the judgment, considered possible legislative vehicles, and prepared instructions to parliamentary counsel that were sent on the same day in time for a first draft of the legislation to be received later that day. We acted explicitly and swiftly. Of course, the drafting was not complicated because this is a straightforward Bill that simply restores the status quo ante.</p>
	<p pid="a.1725.1/3">The hon. Gentleman asked whether it was merely our aim that the Bill should receive Royal Assent next Tuesday or whether it would receive Royal Assent next Tuesday. Of course, that is a matter for the other place, but it is very much our hope and expectation that we will have Royal Assent on <phrase class="date" code="2011-05-19">19 May</phrase> once the other place has considered the Bill. <i>[</i> <i>Interruption.</i> <i>]</i> I am sorry&#8212;I should have said <phrase class="date" code="2011-07-19">19 July</phrase>. There is always a danger in reading things without my glasses. As I have said, the Bill will take effect once Royal Assent is received. I hope that that answers the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s specific questions.</p>

	<p pid="a.1728.4/1">The motions would amend the terms of reference of the Committee on Members&#8217; Allowances, in advance of its review of the operation of the Parliamentary Standards Act 2009. Earlier, Madam Deputy Speaker, you may have heard my right hon. Friend the Leader of the House say in business questions that he would find it very difficult to find additional time to debate the matter before the recess, but by happenstance we now have adequate time to do the job today. I am extremely pleased that that is the case.</p>
	<p pid="a.1728.4/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2011-05-12">12 May</phrase>, the House gave an instruction to the Committee on Members&#8217; Allowances to review the 2009 Act,</p>
	<p pid="a.1728.4/3">&#8220;giving due consideration to ensuring:</p>
	<p pid="a.1728.4/4">(a) value for money for taxpayers;</p>
	<p pid="a.1728.4/5">(b) accountability;</p>
	<p pid="a.1728.4/6">(c) public confidence in Parliament;</p>
	<p pid="a.1728.4/7">(d) the ability of Members to fulfil their duties effectively;</p>
	<p pid="a.1728.4/8">(e) fairness for less well-off Members and those with families; and</p>
	<p pid="a.1728.4/9">(f) that Members are not deterred from submitting legitimate claims.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.1728.4/10">The debate was initiated through the Backbench Business Committee by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40661" name="Adam Afriyie">the hon. Member for Windsor (Adam Afriyie)</phrase>, who I am pleased to see in his place. Following a good debate, the House agreed to the instruction without a Division.</p>
	<p pid="a.1728.4/11">Since May, the Government have been in discussion with colleagues in the House on changes to the terms of reference of the Committee on Members&#8217; Allowances, given its change in remit. I express my gratitude to my long-suffering right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40621" name="John Randall">the Member for Uxbridge and South Ruislip (Mr Randall)</phrase> for his efforts in seeking consensus on a sensible approach.</p>
	<p pid="a.1728.4/12">One of the Government&#8217;s proposals following consultation was that the Chair be removed from the list of Select Committee Chairs receiving an additional salary, which was approved by the House on <phrase class="date" code="2011-07-05">Tuesday 5 July</phrase>. There are two outstanding motions that have previously been objected to and remain to be approved. Motion 9 would amend the Standing Order relating to the Committee by changing its name to the Committee on Members&#8217; Expenses. That terminology reflects the fact that the current scheme, operated by the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority, is an expenses-based system, not an allowances-based one.</p>

	<p pid="a.1729.0/2">The instruction issued to the Committee on <phrase class="date" code="2011-05-12">12 May</phrase> was that it review the 2009 Act, which does not relate directly to expenses. My concern is that calling it an expenses Committee and limiting its remit would in some way prevent it from doing its work of reviewing the 2009 Act. If the Deputy Leader of the House can confirm that the change will in no way narrow the Committee&#8217;s ability to do its work of reviewing the Act and producing recommendations, there will be very little to detain us.</p>

	<p pid="a.1729.1/1">I am extremely grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that intervention. Let me make it absolutely clear to the House that the change in wording in no way restricts the ability of the Committee to consider the issue of allowances as it relates to the review of the operation of the Act. The Committee will be free to consider the issue of allowances and to make recommendations as it sees fit. The Government have no intention of seeking to restrict the Committee&#8217;s remit in the way that is feared.</p>

Of course, I have no idea what the Committee will decide, but for instance&#8212;for the sake of argument&#8212;if it were to recommend that the current expense-based system on living away should be replaced by a flat-rate allowance, would that be perfectly in order?</p>

	<p pid="a.1730.1/1">Indeed, it can make any recommendations based on the considerations into which it has entered. It would be a very odd restriction on a Committee if it were to be told that it cannot make recommendations when it has considered a matter. Of course, such recommendations would be the end result if the Committee so chooses.</p>
	<p pid="a.1730.1/2">Motion 9 also brings the Committee&#8217;s terms of reference up to date. The Committee has a number of specific functions, set out in <phrase class="standing-order" code="152G(1)(a)">Standing Order No. 152G(1)(a)</phrase> to (d), in relation to the old allowances regime that was administered by the House until the election last year. They include, for example, approving practice notes for the now-defunct fees office. Clearly, those specific powers are no longer relevant&#8212;they are, in effect, spent&#8212;and the motion provides the House with an opportunity to replace them with a more general power to consider any matter related to Members&#8217; expenses that the House might choose to refer to it.</p>

	<p pid="a.1730.4/1">I hope that the Deputy Leader of the House can reassure me. He said that the motion brings the Standing Order up to date because the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority is operating an expenses-based scheme, not an allowances scheme. I have looked at the Parliamentary Standards Act 2009. It mentions the word &#8220;allowance&#8221; or &#8220;allowances&#8221; 37 times. Therefore, the authority under which IPSA operates&#8212;the Act&#8212;provides for allowances. It does not provide any authority to operate an expenses scheme. Can he clarify that for me?</p>

	<p pid="a.1730.6/1">I am grateful to the Deputy Leader of the House for being as open as he thinks he can be, but I am still not quite clear. The 2009 Act could not be clearer. The words &#8220;expense&#8221; or &#8220;expenses&#8221; are not mentioned anywhere&#8212;I just searched a PDF copy of the Act and found that those words are mentioned nowhere in it&#8212;but the words &#8220;allowance&#8221; or &#8220;allowances&#8221; are mentioned 37 times. How can it be that IPSA operates a scheme that it thinks is in line with the Act if it ignores the terms of the Act? That is what I simply do not understand.</p>

	<p pid="a.1730.7/1">It is probably not helpful for me to rehearse the subject matter of considerations that will clearly take place in the Committee. I do not speak for IPSA, but it has made it very clear that the current system is</p>
	<p pid="a.1730.7/2">one of expenses, whereby Members are reimbursed for costs that they can prove they have incurred. The previous, discredited scheme was one of allowances, whereby Members were allowed to claim, in many cases, with no proof of actual expenditure. I repeat that changing the title of the Committee would not prevent it from proposing that IPSA should introduce a new system that includes an element of allowances, but it would be better if the Committee&#8217;s title actually reflected the scheme that is in operation rather than one that is not in operation.</p>

That date allows the views of the Committee to be considered to a time scale that fits in with the next annual review of the expenses scheme by IPSA, which is expected early next year. A delay in reporting risks the ability of IPSA to consider, consult on and implement in an orderly way any changes that may be proposed. I gather that we may not now have a Division on the</p>
	<p pid="a.1731.5/3">amendment, which I am very pleased about. Otherwise, we might have a delay that would obstruct the work of the Committee.</p>
	<p pid="a.1731.5/4">The House agreed on <phrase class="date" code="2011-05-12">12 May</phrase> that a review of the operation of the Parliamentary Standards Act 2009 should take place. The Government are keen that the Committee is set up without any more unnecessary delay and gets on with the important work that the House has tasked it with, and I commend the motions to the House.</p>

	<p pid="a.1732.0/1">The Opposition welcome the fact that these motions are being debated today, and welcome even more that the House appears to be moving towards some consensus. It is of course a matter for Back Benchers to decide, but it is important that we get this Committee set up and running as soon as possible, because the scheme clearly needs amendment.</p>
	<p pid="a.1732.0/2">I see <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40266" name="Edward Leigh">the hon. Member for Gainsborough (Mr Leigh)</phrase> in his place. Like me, he sits on the liaison committee with IPSA and we spend a lot of time trying to iron out problems in the scheme. It is imperative therefore that we reach a sensible position that both maintains public confidence in the scheme and does not use up too much of the time of hon. Members, who are fast becoming the highest paid data input clerks in the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.1732.0/3">Anyone who has read the National Audit Office report published today&#8212;I have had the time to read only some of it&#8212;will be clear that much work needs to be done on the scheme. The NAO quantifies the amount of time it is taking for Members and their staff, and actually puts a monetary value on that. It also comments on the repetitive nature of much of the information that is required. We clearly need to have a transparent expenses system. I do not think that anyone in the House would suggest anything else. However, we need to have one that facilitates the work of hon. Members and does not get in the way of our much more important work of representing our constituents. I am grateful to hon. Members involved for their work in setting up the Committee, which I hope can play a major role in ensuring that the scheme we have works properly and in the best interests of our constituents and the House. I look forward to the Committee being set up and being able to get on with its work as soon as possible.</p>

	<p pid="a.1732.1/1">I apologise, Madam Deputy Speaker, for not having been here at the outset, but I was chairing Westminster Hall and it was not possible to get a substitute as quickly as I had hoped.</p>
	<p pid="a.1732.1/2">I hear from my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40661" name="Adam Afriyie">the Member for Windsor (Adam Afriyie)</phrase> that much progress has been made during this short debate. I am certainly pleased to hear that. There is a lesson here: if the Government table motions on the Order Paper that are inconsistent with a resolution of the House agreed to as a result of a Back-Bench debate and do not discuss their reasons for tabling the motion, it creates a climate of suspicion. That climate of suspicion was confirmed yesterday, when the Committee of Selection was set up to confirm the membership of the Committee on Members&#8217; Allowances but at the last minute did not deal with the business at</p>
	<p pid="a.1732.1/3">hand. I understand that it has been confirmed during this debate that there will be a special meeting today of the Committee of Selection to set up the Committee so that the latter can organise itself to meet next week. I do not know whether that interpretation is correct, but I understand that that is what has been agreed.</p>
	<p pid="a.1732.1/4">Why did we have to go through all this? It is regrettable that this adversarial attitude has been created over an issue that everybody on both sides of the House takes very seriously&#8212;IPSA&#8217;s administration of our allowances system. Yesterday, I went on to the IPSA website to make a claim for the past month&#8212;it was my first claim for a month&#8212;and I found that four previous items that I claimed for had been sent back. I will not go into the details except to say that after more than an hour on the telephone all those matters were resolved. However, it should never have taken so long. It was a matter of process dominating common sense and reality. The person from IPSA wasted more than an hour on the telephone. I had to waste more than an hour on the telephone. There were lots of delays and as a result one member of my staff was not paid as quickly as they should have been. That is why it is important that this Committee is set up with the terms of reference that we are debating this afternoon.</p>

	<p pid="a.1733.0/1">My hon. Friend can be reassured because we have had a categorical reassurance from the Deputy Leader of the House that there will be absolutely no restriction on what the Committee can decide or recommend. I have the greatest faith in our Front-Bench team&#8212;as far as I am concerned, their word is their bond.</p>

	<p pid="a.1733.1/1">I am sure that my hon. Friend is right. I hope that when the Committee of Selection meets, he will be selected as a member of the Committee, with my hon. Friend the Member for Windsor as its Chairman. With those two on the Committee, I have little doubt that it can do some effective work. However, I still do not understand why it has taken so long to set it up. It was resolved on <phrase class="date" code="2011-05-12">12 May</phrase> that it should be set up, but it is now almost <phrase class="date" code="2011-07-12">12 July</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.1733.1/2">I see that quite a few members of the Treasury Bench are in their places. I hope that they will learn a lesson from this&#8212;that we should be much more open with each other about these issues instead of creating or facilitating a climate of suspicion. It is possibly only because today&#8217;s business collapsed more than two hours early that we have had the chance to have this open and frank discussion on the Floor of the House on this important issue. When the report&#8212;or reports&#8212;come back from the Committee, I hope that the Government will again be open and frank, and allow us to ensure that the recommendations are debated and carried into action. That way, there will be no need to spend even more parliamentary time trying to get the Government to do what was agreed by the Prime Minister as long ago as before last December, as I recall, when he made it clear that if something did not happen by April, he would ensure that pressure would be put on IPSA to get its act together.</p>
	<p pid="a.1733.1/3">All&#8217;s well that ends well&#8212;I hope. In that respect, I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Windsor for briefing me on what transpired earlier in the debate. I hope that it will be confirmed in the response to this</p>
	<p pid="a.1733.1/4">debate that the members of the Committee will be appointed by the Committee of Selection today, so that they can get down to their work first thing next week.</p>

	<p pid="a.1734.0/1">I shall be very brief. I am delighted by the Government&#8217;s reassurances, although I share the disappointment that it has taken since the resolution was passed in May to get to the point of setting up the Committee. If something had been decided that our constituents expected would happen, but then six or seven weeks later it had still not happened, we as Members would be advocating hard on their behalf. I am therefore glad that the decision has finally been made.</p>
	<p pid="a.1734.0/2">I want to make one point about the National Audit Office report that was published this morning, to which <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40633" name="Helen Jones">the hon. Member for Warrington North (Helen Jones)</phrase> referred. I have had a look at it, and I think that it looks fairly reasonable. I know that one or two Members who have looked at it are slightly disappointed that it does not appear to tear IPSA limb from limb. However, given what had taken place&#8212;the MPs&#8217; expenses crisis and the response that came forth with the new legislation&#8212;IPSA has done its best. We know that there is still further to go, and my hon. Friend the Deputy Leader of the House drew attention to the terms of reference&#8212;the need for improved public confidence, better accountability and better value for money, and not deterring legitimate claims. We all know that legitimate claims have been deterred, that we need to get value for money and that there is still some work to do, so I am delighted that the Committee can now proceed with its work.</p>

	<p pid="a.1734.1/1">I am most grateful to colleagues who have participated in this brief debate. I do not think that any of us seek to minimise the difficulties that have on occasion arisen over the last year in the operation of IPSA. As we all know, there are numerous bodies trying to iron out the problems and produce a more user-friendly, but at the same time rigorous approach to the whole subject. The Committee that we are setting up&#8212;that the House has asked to be set up&#8212;will go a long way towards dealing with the more fundamental review of the legislation, to ensure that it is fit for purpose, and coming up with recommendations.</p>
	<p pid="a.1734.1/2">I have to say to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40171" name="Christopher Chope">the hon. Member for Christchurch (Mr Chope)</phrase> that if he had doubts about the wording of the Government motions, we would all have been delighted to discuss his concerns with him and allay any fears. As I mentioned earlier, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40621" name="John Randall">the right hon. Member for Uxbridge and South Ruislip (Mr Randall)</phrase> has spent quite some time discussing with interested Members the implications of the Government amendments, and to a large extent was able to reassure those who had a fundamental interest in the establishment of the Committee that their fears were groundless and that this was a real attempt to facilitate its setting up.</p>

	<p pid="a.1734.2/1">Does the Minister accept that, if those fears had been allayed, my hon. Friends the Members for Windsor (Adam Afriyie) and for Gainsborough (Mr Leigh) would not have had to table the amendments that are being debated today? How is what he has just</p>
	<p pid="a.1734.2/2">said consistent with the Government&#8217;s action yesterday in withdrawing from the business of the Committee of Selection the appointment of the members of this Committee?

	<p pid="a.1735.1/2">It would clearly have been entirely inappropriate for the Committee of Selection to pre-empt the decision of the House, and the House was prevented from taking a decision by the fact that amendments had been tabled that would have been treated as an objection to the order unless we could find time to debate it. Happily, we have had time to do so today, and I hope that I have been helpful to colleagues. I know that the Committee of Selection will be eager to meet at the earliest opportunity in order to make recommendations, which will then have to go before the House, to enable the Committee to be set up.

	<p pid="a.1736.1/1">This is my first time presenting a petition in this place, and I did not expect to be doing it at this particular hour. I was hoping to do it a tiny bit later, because waiting for me in the Pugin Room are four Daventry councillors who are enjoying their afternoon tea while mine goes cold. However, this is a very important petition.</p>
	<p pid="a.1736.1/2">In the beautiful village of East Haddon in my constituency, there is a wonderful pub called the Red Lion. The talk of the town in East Haddon is not windmills, although we have plenty of them around the place, and they are the talk of the town in other parts of my constituency; nor is it High Speed 2, although the people who live in the village of Byfield will most certainly be talking about that in the pub. The talk of the town in East Haddon is the Barnett formula. A number of my petitioners, perhaps over a nice cold dry white wine one evening, got very excited about the Barnett formula, and about the fact that English people are being hard done by in regard to a fair and equal per capita distribution of taxpayers&#8217; money across my constituency. They are therefore petitioning the House of Commons. Dr Angus Walker has put this together, and I hope that I can do him justice here today.</p>
	<p pid="a.1736.1/3">The petition states:</p>
	<p pid="a.1736.1/4">The Petition of residents of Daventry,</p>
	<p pid="a.1736.1/5">Declares that the Petitioners believe that the use of the Barnett Formula in the distribution of Government funds should be replaced with an equal per capita distribution for all races in the United Kingdom; notes that the Petitioners believe it to be iniquitous that some parts of the United Kingdom are discriminated against because of race; and further notes that the Petitioners consider that it is wrong to permit such discrimination to be exempted in law.</p>
	<p pid="a.1736.1/6">The Petitioners therefore request that the House of Commons urges the Government to discontinue the use of the Barnett Formula in the distribution of Government funds and replace it with an equal per capita distribution for all races in the United Kingdom.</p>

	<p pid="a.1737.2/1">I do not know whether it is something in the water, but Enfield has recently produced constituents whose cases are of high national importance, which are challenging legislation, international treaties and guidance. I refer, of course, to my constituent Gary McKinnon, to Andrew Symeou in the neighbouring constituency, and to Ian Puddick, the subject of this Adjournment debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.1737.2/2">I do not wish to entertain the House with the salacious details of this case, which are at times complex and at other times bizarre and, frankly, quite frightening. I wish to explore the principles and practice involved in the case, about which the whole House will no doubt be concerned, as they are fundamental. My primary concern, which again the whole House doubtless shares, is with the principle of equality before the law&#8212;the principle that money and wealth should not be used to warp the course of natural justice and that equality should not be eroded in the age of the internet and super-injunctions, which have seen in recent times.</p>
	<p pid="a.1737.2/3">It is only right for me to start by explaining some of the details of my constituent&#8217;s case. In June 2009, Mr Puddick became aware that his wife was having an affair with her employer, who is a board member of a large reinsurance firm. He found on her phone explicit text messages from this man, which then led to his wife&#8217;s confession that the affair had been ongoing for some 10 years. In his emotional state, my constituent began calling clients of this large firm, informing them that their manager had used company expenses to fund an affair with another employee. When the manager concerned became aware of this, he hired a private security firm, linked to his organisation, to discredit my constituent and to build a case of harassment against him. Mr Puddick received a phone call from the chief executive of the security firm, who reportedly said, &#8220;Our pockets are deep&#8230;we will bury you&#8221;. How was he buried?</p>
	<p pid="a.1737.2/4">In August the same year, my constituent&#8217;s home, office and his company accountants were raided by 16 officers from the City of London police counter terrorism and major crimes directorate. They removed his personal computers, his mobile phones, laptops, digital cameras and even his personal sat-nav and sent all this equipment to a high-technology crime laboratory for testing.</p>
	<p pid="a.1737.2/5">My constituent was subsequently arrested and decided not to have a lawyer. He then gave a full and frank confession that he made those phone calls to clients and he apologised for it. He was then charged and stringent police bail conditions were attached. On the first occasion he attended court, the bail conditions were relaxed as it became immediately apparent that my constituent was a man of good character and not likely to commit any act of violence or to make any threats. The court realised that the case needed to be dealt with proportionately.</p>
	<p pid="a.1737.2/6">I understand from my constituent that, to the surprise of the magistrates, when the officers were asked about the evidence that provided the basis for this case of harassment, it became clear that my constituent&#8217;s wife had not even provided a statement. Despite all the</p>
	<p pid="a.1737.2/7">extreme, disproportionate and expensive investigations that had gone on, which seemed to suggest a major crime, the one witness statement that one would have expected to have been brought forward did not materialise. Any right-minded person listening to the debate&#8212;and certainly those listening at the back of the court at which Mr Puddick first came into the public gaze&#8212;would have questioned why this was happening.</p>
	<p pid="a.1737.2/8">A trial was set for April the following year. Before that date the man who had had an affair with Mr Puddick&#8217;s wife resigned from his position, and the case was dropped. One might have thought that that would be the end of it, and that there would simply have been complaints to the Police Complaints Authority Independent Police Complaints Commission&#8212;as, indeed, there were&#8212;which would have been processed in the usual way.</p>
	<p pid="a.1737.2/9">If the case had ended in that way we would not have ended up discussing it here at 4.15 on a Thursday afternoon, but Mr Puddick was rightly appalled by what had happened, and particularly concerned about the disproportionate actions that he felt had been taken by the police. For reasons of his own, which one may understand and with which one may feel a great deal of sympathy, he set up a blog&#8212;<a href="http://www.ianpuddick.com">www.ianpuddick.com</a>&#8212;to which he uploaded a love letter that had been sent to his wife, as well as a video describing the disproportionate response of the police and questioning the actions of the private security firm. Entries to the website <a href="http://www.policeexpenses.com">www.policeexpenses.com</a> and other similar addresses were redirected to the original blog.</p>
	<p pid="a.1737.2/10">What then happened, in May 2010, seemed to my constituent to have come out of nowhere. He was arrested again, this time not by local detectives but by the City of London police murder squad. He was told by investigating officers that he could not put that information on the internet. He replied, &#8220;I am just putting out information that is true.&#8221; The response from the police, which might be considered chilling by anyone concerned about freedom of speech, was, apparently, &#8220;Even if it is completely true, you have committed a criminal offence.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.1737.2/11">Mr Puddick was subsequently charged, again, with harassment, but on this occasion on the specific grounds that he had created and distributed three websites which were designed to discredit an individual both professionally and personally. He denied all the allegations, and the case went to the magistrates court in June this year. It was put to the magistrates that Mr Puddick was guilty of harassment through Facebook, Twitter and his websites, and it was partly because of those extra allegations that the case made national headlines. However, it was proved in court through cross-examination at an early stage that there had been no use of Facebook or Twitter.</p>
	<p pid="a.1737.2/12">I understand that an officer from City of London police offered the explanation that the counter-terrorism and murder squads had been called because of the level of distress that she believed my constituent was causing through his websites. One can only speculate, looking at other websites, on whether such distress constitutes grounds for using the precious and important resources of the counter-terrorism and murder squads. I am glad that the Minister for Policing and Criminal Justice, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40047" name="Nick Herbert">the Member for Arundel and South Downs (Nick Herbert)</phrase> is present to note my concern in that regard. My constituent was finally found not guilty of the charge of harassment on <phrase class="date" code="2011-06-17">17 June</phrase> this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.1737.2/13">Having listened to that extraordinary tale, some may believe that it involves a purely operational issue which really belongs on the pages of the tabloids&#8212;where it did indeed appear in this instance&#8212;rather than in the Chamber. However, as I said at the outset, there is a key point of principle: the principle of equality before the law. As my constituent has stated on numerous occasions, if this could happen to him, it could happen to anyone.</p>
	<p pid="a.1737.2/14">I want to raise two key points with the Minister. The first is the apparent influence of wealth and authority on the implementation of the law. It seems clear that had it not been for the well-connected private security company and the high profile of the business involved, my constituent would not have experienced such a disproportionate use of force and response. If there is another reason, no one is aware of it. Indeed, it is interesting that the man who had the affair with Mr Puddick&#8217;s wife was even advised by police in Sussex&#8212;the county where he lives&#8212;that this was a civil, not a criminal, matter, and anyone looking at this case would say that that seems to be a very reasonable judgment to make. Despite that, City of London police were approached and the raid in May 2009 followed. My constituent argues that the second raid almost a year later, following the publication of the blog and website, was also based on information that came from the private security firm and outside interests.</p>
	<p pid="a.1737.2/15">We can go back into history&#8212;indeed, all the way back to AD 43, when there was the first recorded mention of equality before the law, by Pericles, and we can then eventually go on to the Magna Carta and other important integral documents in our constitutional law that establish that equality before the law is an important principle. Pericles stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.1737.2/16">&#8220;If we look to the laws, they afford equal justice to all in their private differences&#8230;class considerations not being allowed to interfere with merit&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1737.2/17">Those words and our fundamental principles based on the Magna Carta and established through international law and treaty obligations would seem to be all but forgotten when the 16 counter-terrorism officers from City of London police raided a residential property because, from the point of view of my constituent, who is a mere plumber, that seemed to be in the interests of more powerful and wealthy business interests, which were concerned about the effects on reputation and sought to challenge the concepts of free speech and the truth.</p>
	<p pid="a.1737.2/18">One could take a view about the appropriateness of how my constituent went about this matter. One could criticise that and say that it was not right, but questions have to be raised about the fact that those actions were criminalised to the extent that they were, and that the police decided to act in the way they did and used the resources they used, which is why the matter has come to this Chamber. This is a fundamental issue in the wider context of our legal system. As a practising lawyer, I have concerns, but this should be of great concern to all Members.</p>
	<p pid="a.1737.2/19">I do not need to remind the House of the recent super-injunction controversy and the complexity added to that by Twitter and the open-platform social media that provide a forum. The key issue in that debate was not merely the affairs and the scandals, but the fact that</p>
	<p pid="a.1737.2/20">our legal system sought to support, or some would say protect, those individuals of some privilege who were able, through wealth and influence, to seek to protect their reputations and their future incomes, regardless in some respects of the consequences and the human collateral damage.</p>
	<p pid="a.1737.2/21">It appears that my constituent&#8217;s experience is not an isolated one, since having secured this debate I was contacted by Dr Howard Fredrics, who is similarly charged with harassment because of a website exposing misconduct by officials at Kingston university. Even though, as I am also informed, Kingston police found no evidence of harassment, the Crown Prosecution Service went ahead with a case against Dr Fredrics, just as the CPS decided not to take account of Sussex police advice and a case was mounted against Mr Puddick. In both cases the common factor seems to be people and institutions of influence, and one would have to say that the concept of the rule of law has been challenged. Those are two examples, but there may be more, which might have gone unnoticed because of the under-reporting of magistrates court cases. The reason for this debate is that they should not go unnoticed by this House or the Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.1737.2/22">The disproportionate response to my constituent&#8217;s case raises fundamental questions, and we cannot cast them aside as an operational blip. The reaction casts a shadow over the way in which we respond to issues, not least issues of free speech. These issues are becoming much more complex, but they are so important. That applies to matters on the internet and online, and matters outside and offline.</p>
	<p pid="a.1737.2/23">The issues raised by my constituent&#8217;s case, which relate to free speech and the way in which the prosecuting authorities deal with enforcement, particularly in respect of the internet, are important and of wider significance. When dealing with cases of cyber-stalking or online harassment, it is important to consider how enforcement is applied and how the guidance really does affect these issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.1737.2/24">We need to recognise that there is no suggestion that Mr Puddick&#8217;s comments on his website were untrue. The prosecution because of his comments relied on the argument that the repetition and spreading of the factual points amounted to harassment. It is important for me to make it clear that I entirely agree with the Government&#8217;s policy and approach to this issue. The case law and policy make it clear that harassment is illegal online as much as it is illegal offline. We learn of some awful cases of cyber-stalking, and they should properly be prosecuted and punishable with the full force of the criminal law. If an individual persistently contacts or attempts to contact a victim and the court concludes that that conduct constitutes harassment, the police need to follow through proportionately to where the evidence leads them and a prosecution needs to follow, where appropriate. That should happen regardless of whether such behaviour occurs in person or through online social media.</p>
	<p pid="a.1737.2/25">I recognise that sound guidance is in place on dealing with cyber-stalking and harassment. I invite the Minister to consider, after this debate, whether that guidance is fit for purpose and whether it is appropriate, particularly given how it seems to have been wholly misapplied in the case of Ian Puddick. The Government are rightly examining areas of vulnerability in respect of young people and those with disabilities, who need particular</p>
	<p pid="a.1737.2/26">protection when it comes to dealing with the internet. We need to recognise that we have a particularly strong duty to those people, and it is right that the Government, in applying the guidance, are examining those areas. We also need to ensure that the fundamental principle of the equality of the law is applied across the board.</p>
	<p pid="a.1737.2/27">As is clear from the account that I have given, it is clear that the proper guidance and way to apply that guidance is far removed from what happened in Mr Puddick&#8217;s case. He was told that he was not allowed to put up his website because it, in effect, damaged the reputation of another individual and that that damage amounted to illegal harassment. Since this case has reached the public gaze, several commentators have remarked that if Mr Puddick had been found guilty, the floodgates would have been opened for a number of other such claims.</p>
	<p pid="a.1737.2/28">I am sure that other hon. Members, perhaps in an unguarded moment, would be tempted by the possibility of prosecuting the odd blogger who wrote an article about them with which they disagreed. I have had an attack website constructed against me. It is dedicated to opposing me and, some would say, to damaging my reputation, and colleagues would doubtless be able to give examples of different actions that have taken place. However, many of us would also recognise that there is a role and place for the law, including the civil law&#8212;there is no doubt that the law on libel and defamation has a role to play. I welcome the Government&#8217;s review into super-injunctions, which is examining how we can properly ensure that our approach to these whole areas of privacy, and libel and defamation are made fit for the modern-day purpose. I would also welcome a proper look at the current Crown Prosecution Service guidelines and how they apply in all the different circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="a.1737.2/29">I am calling for a level playing field&#8212;the level playing field that has been established over many years and that this country, rightly, is proud to promote and apply. I hope that my constituent&#8217;s case will set a precedent or at least be a marker to suggest that such websites and blogs should be properly considered in the context of an appropriate and proportionate application of guidance in both criminal and civil law. It is important that, as online technology develops rapidly, we ensure that the Government also allow for proper clarity in their guidance so that we do not face situations such as that which sadly caused detriment to Mr Puddick.</p>
	<p pid="a.1737.2/30">We also need to be particularly watchful when criminal law is involved. Cases such as Mr Puddick&#8217;s might be rare&#8212;we do not have the exact numbers&#8212;but we need to recognise that when there is enforcement by the police, liberty is lost and other consequences arise, we must be ever watchful and mindful of the serious repercussions and how they can chip away at, or even take a chunk out, of the fundamental principles that we all hold dear.</p>
	<p pid="a.1737.2/31">In conclusion, the issue in this case is not the affair that some people might have been interested in reporting on, and it is not about my constituent and his phone calls to clients. This is not about the man or the affair. The issue is whether Ian Puddick has made the case that large companies and private security firms have an influence that has led to a taxpayer-funded police force following what some might suggest was a taxpayer-funded crusade. Indeed, it was called Operation Bohan&#8212;I am not sure why it was named after Bohan, the son of</p>
	<p pid="a.1737.2/32">Rueben&#8212;and the whole operation was dedicated to this case, seemingly to silence his accusations because they might harm financial interests.</p>
	<p pid="a.1737.2/33">One could argue that if the complaint had been made to the City of London police by an ordinary member of the public&#8212;say, a plumber like my constituent&#8212;the estimated &#163;1 million would not have been spent investigating and prosecuting the case. It would, I imagine, have been dealt with as a civil matter, worthy, if the police had been involved, of a quiet word from them. I say that the &#163;1 million is an estimated figure, and Mr Puddick has been asking questions to find out the true costs. If possible, I would be interested in hearing at some point&#8212;I know the answer will not be available today&#8212;how much the police operation and prosecution cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.1737.2/34">Without any further information, it would seem that Operation Bohan flew in the face of the key principle of equality before the law by seemingly putting the interests of wealthy organisations above the free speech and basic rights of the everyday citizen. I do not say those words lightly. I have been a criminal solicitor for 14 or so years and have great respect for the rule of law, for our system of justice and for how it is properly applied day in, day out, by police officers and prosecuting authorities. When we see cases that seem exceptional and that are exceptional in their application of power, we must stand up for our constituents. It is worse for everyone, not just my constituent, that the operation was funded by the taxpayer. My tax-paying constituents&#8212;all of them&#8212;played their part in paying for the anti-terrorist officers, the high-technology laboratory and the extensive surveillance. Indeed, they also played a part in the Crown Prosecution Service&#8217;s seemingly doomed attempt to prosecute Mr Puddick.</p>
	<p pid="a.1737.2/35">My constituent is concerned about what he would call an apparent perversion of natural justice that must be identified, addressed and appropriately challenged by Ministers. The Government and the Minister are rightly big on accountability and I fully support that, but we also need to recognise that there must be accountability for the actions of the police and the prosecuting authorities. They must be brought to account in cases such as Mr Puddick&#8217;s so that we can ensure that another innocent member of the public is not awoken by an armed counter-terrorism unit acting, perhaps, on the whims of wealth and power.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-07-07a.1742.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40047" speakername="Nick Herbert" speakeroffice="The Minister for Policing and Criminal Justice"  colnum="1742"  time="016:35:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110707/debtext/110707-0003.htm#11070745001399">
	<p pid="a.1742.0/1">First, let me congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40248" name="David Burrowes">the Member for Enfield, Southgate (Mr Burrowes)</phrase> on securing the debate, which it is a pleasure for me to respond to on behalf of the Government. I know of his long-standing interest in these issues, particularly on ensuring that freedom of expression is protected and I fully understand why he seeks to raise his concerns about the case of his constituent, Mr Ian Puddick. I appreciate that my hon. Friend seeks to put the case for his constituent very forcefully, which he has certainly done.</p>
	<p pid="a.1742.0/2">I know that my hon. Friend understands that Ministers do not have a role in commenting on or interfering in specific cases, but it is important to restate that point. In this country we have a principle of operational independence for the police and it is very important that Ministers do not seek to direct police investigations or to comment on them improperly. However, it is also very important</p>
	<p pid="a.1742.0/3">that we have a proper system of accountability for the police and their actions in relation to the law and more widely. I will return to that point. I am afraid that I cannot therefore comment on the legal aspects of this individual case, but I understand that the City of London police took the allegation of harassment against Mr Puddick very seriously and that it was investigated in line with national procedures.</p>
	<p pid="a.1742.0/4">I also understand that the City of London police received a complaint last September relating to the conduct of officers involved in Mr Puddick&#8217;s arrest on suspicion of harassment in August 2009. Following a thorough internal investigation the force&#8217;s professional standards directorate found no misconduct. Mr Puddick was informed of that decision last December and had the right to appeal to the Independent Police Complaints Commission. I do not know whether he has pursued that course, but my hon. Friend might wish to contact him and help him in that regard. We have a formal complaints procedure whereby the conduct of police forces can be properly investigated precisely to deal with situations in which people feel they have been improperly treated by the police. Having the IPCC means that such complaints and police forces can be independently investigated quite separately from Government, as is proper, but there might be reasons why Mr Puddick has not taken that course.</p>

	<p pid="a.1743.0/1">I am grateful for the Minister&#8217;s response and I will certainly follow up the details of my constituent&#8217;s complaint. My presumption is that the progress of his complaint was subject to the fact that proceedings were ongoing, but they have recently been concluded and he will now be able to pursue many avenues. The problem he has probably encountered is that his complaint is not like usual complaints about how people have been treated in detention or on arrest, but is more of a systemic issue about an operational decision that was taken, and so he might find it harder to get to the truth. I therefore invite the Minister to make inquiries into why, given the facts of the case, the decision about Operation Bohan was taken.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-07-07a.1743.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40047" speakername="Nick Herbert" colnum="1743"  time="016:35:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110707/debtext/110707-0003.htm#11070745001401">
	<p pid="a.1743.1/1">My hon. Friend is seeking to draw me into precisely the sort of comment about individual investigations that I am prohibited from making. Nevertheless, I will say that it strikes me that this case would merit an appeal to the IPCC. I might be wrong about that and will ensure that I follow up the debate by sending him formal advice on whether that remains an option for Mr Puddick.</p>
	<p pid="a.1743.1/2">My hon. Friend referred to the involvement of counter-terrorist officers in the case, which the media also reported on. I can confirm that the investigation was run by the force&#8217;s major investigation team, which, although it was set up primarily to deal with major crime, occasionally deals with cases outside its remit to relieve pressure on other departments within the force. The team sits within the force&#8217;s serious crime and counter-terrorist directorate, which might explain the confusion and the suggestion that counter-terrorist officers were involved in the investigation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1743.1/3">I know that my hon. Friend will agree that, when the police receive an allegation of a crime, they should consider it properly. Indeed, they are required within</p>
	<p pid="a.1743.1/4">the rules set out to record it. The offence of harassment can cause the victim great distress, and the police are committed to responding in a timely manner when they receive such reports. My comments in this respect are not to be taken as an endorsement of the police action in this case, but I think that we would all agree with the general principle that it is proper for the police to respond to and investigate such claims.</p>
	<p pid="a.1743.1/5">The internet has hugely enriched our lives and every Member of the House is fully aware of its potency, but it can also be a useful tool for those seeking to abuse and intimidate their victims, and it is a source of particular concern to the Government that a new opportunity for crime has been created through cyber-bullying, cyber-stalking and such harassment of victims. The abuse can continue for long periods, with no refuge for the person on the receiving end of the harassment, and can involve a much bigger audience, with more people becoming accessories to the harassment by forwarding offensive messages and images, making it difficult to identify the perpetrator. For all those reasons, the Government are very concerned about the growth of this form of criminality and are seeking to deal with it.</p>
	<p pid="a.1743.1/6">Let me be clear that we have no plans to block legal internet content or websites. Our view on published material is that it is important to strike a balance between freedom of expression and protection of the public and that it should be proportional to the potential harm that might be caused. In other words, it is important that the action we take, and indeed the action of those who enforce the law, is proportionate, which is precisely the word my hon. Friend used. We are making progress in this area and there will be a ministerial seminar next week on personal harm on the internet, which will focus on the two key themes of cyber-stalking and hate crime. It is important that we continue to make progress in this area. Nevertheless, I strongly agree with the principle of equality before the law, as my hon. Friend set out. It is important that police forces in this country are impartial and act without fear or favour, and he is right to restate that principle.</p>
	<p pid="a.1743.1/7">My hon. Friend is correct to say that I am big on accountability, and so are the Government. We seek to ensure that police forces are accountable&#8212;of course&#8212;to the law for their actions, and they are in the case before us. I mentioned recourse to the IPCC, and should Mr Puddick believe that the police behaved unlawfully in his case he also has recourse to legal action. I make no comment on whether that is the case, but the police are not above the law.</p>
	<p pid="a.1743.1/8">The police should also be accountable for their actions, and we seek to strengthen the democratic oversight of policing, but that does not extend to interference in operational independence, because that principle must remain. We are, however, going to give directly elected police and crime commissioners an important role in the oversight of police complaints&#8212;not to receive complaints directly, because that will still be a matter for the IPCC, but to ensure that forces generally deal with complaints properly.</p>
	<p pid="a.1743.1/9">I regret that that measure will not be applicable to the City of London police, because it is the one force to which we will not be introducing directly elected police and crime commissioners, but I am sure that the force itself and the authority that holds it to account will watch carefully the developments in our legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1743.1/10">On the cost of the investigation, my hon. Friend cited the sum of &#163;1 million. I am not sure whether he thought that that was the cost of the police investigation and the Crown Prosecution Service investigation, but the City of London police state that the &#163;1.5 million cost that was ascribed to the investigation, was very wide of the mark. I am not able to respond to his suggested cost for the combined operation of the police and the CPS, but I am happy to ask that the City of London police and the CPS provide that information to my hon. Friend. Importantly, the CPS would of course have had to agree to the charges that were brought before the courts and, in doing so, have taken the view that a prosecution was in the public interest, so the actions that were taken were a matter not just for the police, but for the CPS.</p>
	<p pid="a.1743.1/11">Without trespassing further on the detail of the case, I fully understand my hon. Friend&#8217;s concern about the matter and, indeed, respect the fact that he has brought it to the attention of the House. I hope he understands that I cannot interfere, but I hope also that I have provided some useful information.</p>

	<p pid="a.1745.0/1">I am grateful for the Minister&#8217;s response. He will be aware, because I have raised the matter with him before, and agree that what is needed among other things in our justice system is information. Indeed, in the words of the Victims Commissioner, relentless information is a real driver of change and of accountability, and one aspect of that is the reporting of magistrates court cases, which often go unnoticed. I have raised two examples, but in that area as in others the benefits of more information will raise the stakes on accountability and ensure that Ministers are as aware as others of whether there is a prevalence of such cases and of the actions that could lead to criticism and to operational changes.</p>

	<p pid="a.1746.1/1">I strongly agree about the importance of transparency. The criminal justice system is relatively opaque, but this week the Government have announced further moves to increase transparency. One area in which we wish to do that is the criminal justice system, and I am working on such proposals because I believe that justice must be seen to be done. I hope that my hon. Friend will take a continuing interest in that and will encourage us in our efforts.</p>
	<p pid="a.1746.1/2">I am grateful to my hon. Friend for supporting our action on hate crime, and I know that he understands the importance of dealing with it. In respect of this case and the issues that my hon. Friend raises, it is very important that we and the law strike the appropriate balance. Free speech is an important freedom that must be protected to the greatest extent possible, but it cannot be permitted if harm is done to others. The law exists in order sometimes to curtail the operation of free speech where such harm may be done. That is why we have a harassment law. It is right that our law enforcement agencies focus on areas where people may be bullied, harassed or subject to intimidation and threats, and that includes through the new medium of the internet. It is appropriate that our law enforcement agencies take action according to the laws that have been set out by Parliament. It equally behoves those agencies to behave in a proper and proportionate manner.</p>
