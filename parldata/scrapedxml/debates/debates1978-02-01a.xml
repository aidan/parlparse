<p>There are problems with this fairly lengthy piece of proposed road. As the hon. Member knows, it is 42 miles in all, and there are problems in deciding the route at either end.

<p>Will the Minister think again about the problems of all rural areas?

<p>Does the move by British Rail to raise fares by 16&#x00BD; per cent. not worry the Secretary of State at all? Has he no regard for the views of the Price Commission, the Chancellor of the Exchequer and even the Prime Minister on this departure from the 10 per cent. rule?</p>

<p>I am very concerned about rising rail fares, as every reasonable man must be. I am sorry that fares in London and the South-East have gone up more than in other parts of the country. We have discussed this matter often in the House. The real problem is that of making sure that fares do not rise at a time when the House does not want the subsidy to rise, either. Also, the hon. Member must consider the case for comfort and convenience in services which the Chairman of British Rail is anxious to improve if he can.</p>

<p>Does my right hon. Friend not find the attitude of some Conservative Back Benchers somewhat opportunist, in view of the speech of the Shadow Chancellor in Chatham on Friday night, when he told commuters that they could expect no hand-outs from a future Conservative Government? Many of us who represent commuter constituencies are far happier with this Government's commitment to the continuation of subsidies than we are with claims of the right hon. and learned Member for Surrey, East (Sir G. Howe) that subsidies are not necessary. If the subsidies are abolished, how much can we expect fares to increase?</p>

<p>My hon. Friend is right to note the speech made by the right hon

and learned Member, who speaks on these matters more frankly than do many of his Conservative colleagues. The House will also recall that in voting against the Second Reading of the Transport Bill only 10 days ago, the Opposition cast a vote against continuing the rail subsidy for the next year. [<i>Interruption.</i>] Conservative Members may not like it, but there is a great deal of ambivalence in their attitude.</p>

<p>Does the right hon. Gentleman agree that the present situation is difficult for commuters, such as those in my constituency, because they are having to pay higher fares for a reduced service, since many of their trains have been reduced in length and this is causing serious overcrowding in peak periods?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1978-02-01a.432.1" hansard_membership_id="8153" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/20187" speakername="Mr. Rodgers" colnum="432" time="">
<p>I agree that there is a problem, and I have a great deal of sympathy with the difficulty experienced by commuters and the extent to which they are committed in respect of where they live in the travel-to-work areas. I do not minimise that consideration, but I must point out that there are no easy answers. It appears that some Conservative Members are anxious to have it both ways, namely, to keep fares down and to cut the subsidy.</p>

<p>Does my right hon. Friend agree that at the heart of the commuter problem is the fact that too many people work too far from where they live? Will he have words with the Secretary of State for the Environment with a view to reversing the new policy of the Location of Offices Bureau and restoring the old policy of dispersing office employment from central London?</p>

<p>I am not sure that I can make the promise that my hon. Friend seeks, but I know that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for the Environment will note that point. It is true that many of our travel problems have arisen because major planning decisions made over the years have not taken account of the cost and time spent in travelling.</p>

<p>Is the right hon. Gentleman aware that what worries corn-minters is not the Opposition's stand on the totally inadequate Transport Bill but the fact that in the last three years commuters have experienced the biggest series


of rail fare increases in history? Will he now consider the suggestion made in the <i>Evening Standard</i> and elsewhere that employers should not be prevented by public policy from offering their staffs new travel-to-work schemes? Is that not a constructive way forward?</p>

<p>I can understand the search for an easy way out of this complex problem, but commuter problems do not arise only in the South-East travel-to-work area. They arise in all parts of Britain and it is difficult to find a scheme that meets everybody's requirement. It is certainly unreasonable to expect people in other parts of the country to put their hands in their pockets to help those in
the South-East.</p>

<p>Will the Minister now answer the question that I put to him? It does not require taxpayers to put their hands in their pockets; it is a constructive suggestion that may lead to progress. Surely the Secretary of State must realise the difficulties. Will he please take the suggestion seriously?</p>

<p>I am taking it seriously, but the hon. Gentleman must face the fact that the suggestion that he has in mind would be a breach of the pay policy and would affect some people and not others. We must try to arrive at a policy that is fair as between individuals and groups.</p>

<p>Later today we are discussing these matters. Some are so complex and important to the industry that I am hesitant to give a quick reply, which may lead to misunderstanding elsewhere.

<p>Will my right hon.

<p>No, I do not agree. The operators have difficulties already in meeting their existing obligations without our seeking to put upon them the onus of bringing in concessionary fares.

<p>The hon. Gentleman is exaggerating. We are all aware&#x2014;I hope that the hon.

<p>I am not sure what the hon. Gentleman means by "flexibility".

My instinct is to agree with him. I ought to say that it is one of those matters on which there are two arguments. There are those who would argue that at the moment there is too great a variety of fares on British Rail. This causes confusion in the minds of passengers. A balance must be struck. Certainly local views should be taken into account.</p>

<p>I understand my hon. Friend's concern about this. Indeed, he is right. There have been real problems with the London Country Bus Service. It inherited an old fleet and inadequate maintenance facilities. This is only very slowly being put right. Whether the struc

<p>Does the Secretary of State realise that that reply is


insufficient for hon. Members on both sides of the House? Does he appreciate that the Didcot centre has been set up now for three years and that during that time it has had only two ill-fated train cargoes of cars from Cowley, which was one of the prime reasons for its being set up in the first place? Does the Minister appreciate that Sid Weighell has described the situation as madness, and that the loss of jobs by British Rail workers in recent years is very unsatisfactory indeed? What does he have to tell the House?</p>

<p>I agree that the Didcot depot is under-used. [<i>Interruption.</i>] If hon. Members choose to look into this matter, they will find that it is not wholly or even mainly because of this dispute. As for the dispute itself, I totally accept the fact that there is concern on both sides of the House, and I hope very much that the dispute will be resolved. However, it is not basically a reflection on any dispute about road or rail; rather, it is a reflection of the concern felt by many people about the movement away from our ports and to inland depots of one kind or another.</p>

<p>Is my right hon. Friend aware that Didcot is not an isolated case? There are many other cases where this has happened. Is he also aware that it is a question not of encouraging rail freight but of attacking

<p>My hon. Friend has expressed his views forcibly before and I am glad to hear them, because he reflects a strong body of opinion and concern on both sides of the House.

<p>Does my right hon. Friend agree that while it is helpful to have knowledgeable and learned advice from hon.

<p>I know that my hon. Friend wishes to be helpful, and he has made an important point. We should look at this from both sides. Of course the House is right to be concerned.

<p>Will the right hon. Gentleman reconsider his reply?

<p>It is certainly not the case that a dispute of this sort, however displeasing, makes fair competition between rail and road impossible.

<p>Does my right hon. Friend agree that when there are changes in the pattern of working, in whatever area, the people involved, who may believe their livelihoods to be in danger, are likely to react and that exchanges in which hon.

Is it not better for those directly concerned, as well as for the overall national interest, for the unions to get together to sort things out? Emotive exchanges do not help.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend puts the matter in a sober perspective. As I have said, it is a symptom of industrial change, which produces dislocation in the lives of many workers, though not primarily in the lives of the rail workers. The dispute has its origins in the problems in our ports.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend is right. As my hon.

<p>I am aware of the hon. Gentleman's point, especially in terms of the problems that have arisen both on country roads and on motorways in the Midlands generally. As I said, we are trying to maintain the level of spending on road maintenance as a whole. Spending has declined in recent years, but it has now, I think, bottomed out. We are also trying to ensure that we properly monitor what is going on. The annual surveys of the condition of roads are a most important innovation.</p>

<p>Is the hon. Gentleman aware of the Transport and Road Research Laboratory's finding that 28 per cent. of accidents are caused by road defects? Will he give us an assurance that the monitoring will apply to local authority roads as well?

<p>The surveys will cover local authority roads as well as motorways and trunk roads.

<p>With your permission, Mr. Speaker, and that of the House, I wish to make a statement on airports policy.<br/>
The White Paper "Airports Policy" is published this afternoon. Its main objective is to establish a framework within which airport developments throughout Great Britain should be considered. It assesses the future demand for airport capacity and how this might be met during the period to 1990 and outlines the airport options to be considered for the longer term. The White Paper also considers the noise and other environmental effects of airport development.<br/>
Forecasting the future demand for air transport is inherently uncertain How ever, the forecasts suggest that airport capacity presents a problem only in the South-East. In the London area the range is from 66 million to 89 million passengers a year in 1990, with the most probable outturn in the lower half of the range, compared with 31 million passengers in 1976.<br/>
Our policy for the London area envisages the provision of a fourth terminal at Heathrow, which is to be the subject of a public inquiry later this year, but the rejection of a fifth terminal; the construction of a second terminal at Gatwick, subject likewise to planning procedures, but the rejection of a second runway; improvements to the terminal at Luton to increase capacity to 5 million passengers a year, but no development beyond that point; and additional terminal facilities to cater for 4 million passengers at Stansted.<br/>
Elsewhere, I believe that our efforts to shift the balance away from the South-East will be assisted by a policy of concentration which should make it more economic for airlines to provide services away from the South-East and make it more attractive for passengers to use them. The White Paper identifies Manchester as the major international airport outside the South-East. It identifies Newcastle, Leeds-Bradford, East Midlands, Birmingham and Cardiff as principal


regional airports. Other airports will continue to cater for local needs and to meet the demand for general aviation.<br/>
In Scotland the Government's devolution proposals place responsibility for airports on the Scottish Assembly. Decisions in respect of these airports will be left to the Assembly.<br/>
Environmental considerations, including especially aircraft noise, are a vital factor in the development of airports policy. The White Paper announces two decisions about subsonic jet aircraft which do not meet the requirements for noise certification. United Kingdom operators will not be allowed to use newly acquired aircraft of this type after 30th September this year. All such aircraft on the United Kingdom register will be banned from 1st January 1986. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for the Environment will emphasise to local authorities the need to avoid the building of houses in those locations experiencing most noise. He will also be proposing modifications to the Town and Country Planning General Development Order designed to bring major developments at British Airports Authority airports within the normal planning controls.<br/>
For the longer term, additional capacity will almost certainly be required for the London area, but no decisions have been taken on how this might be provided.<br/>
The options include a new airport and major development of Stansted beyond the 4 million passenger capacity indicated in the White Paper or the conversion of a military airfield to a civil airport. It is proposed that all three options should be examined within an appropriate formal structure which will be discussed with the local authority associations.<br/>
I believe that the White Paper provides a sound framework for the future development of our airports. Of course, we are dealing with a fast-moving industry, and the Government will continue to develop the policy in consultation with those concerned.</p>

<p>Is the Secretary of State aware that we have had up to two years now to consider the consultative documents instead of the six months that was originally intended and less than an hour in which to read the resulting White Paper? It seems to us, at a very first

reading, to be nothing more than a restatement of the consultative documents. As the White Paper takes us into the 1990s, I think that we need rather more than an hour to give a considered judgment on it.<br/>
Is the right hon. Gentleman aware that our first impression is that the proposals may suffice to meet traffic demands until about 1984&#x2013;85, but that the White Paper begs the major issue of what happens beyond that date when the problems of accommodating international traffic will begin to tell? Once again, it looks as if the major decision will fall to us.</p>

<p>I understand perfectly the hon. Gentleman's wish to have time to study the White Paper. His main point is that the White Paper begs decisions after 1984&#x2013;85. I emphasise that the White Paper takes the situation up to 1990. It is not sensible that, in the light of the rapidly changing forecasts in a downward direction that we have seen over the past few years on the amount of traffic that is likely to be generated to the South-East, we should commit ourselves to vast public expenditure before it is necessary. According to our estimates and judgment, the decisions taken here suffice up to 1990. Certainly further decisions will have to be taken beyond that time, but it is better that they be taken in the light of firmer information regarding traffic trends.</p>

<p>The proposed fourth terminal at Heathrow is the subject of a planning inquiry. Subject to that, I must emphasise the necessity for the fourth terminal. However, we reject a fifth terminal. I think that that will be of some

<p>Does the Secretary of State accept that the consultation process started with a major part of the purpose being to shift the balance of traffic away from the South-East to the regions and that the White Paper indicates that that purpose has not been achieved? Will he confirm that the proportion of total traffic coming to the South-East in 1990 on present forecasts will be about the same as it is now and that, if so, and no further shift is made, all the options beyond 1990 will be deeply unattractive?</p>

<p>It is certainly true that we are assuming that there will be the same balance between the South-East and the rest of the country in 1990 as there is now. To that extent we have certainly not succeeded in finding ways of achieving major shifts of traffic away from the South-East. However, it is our judgment&#x2014;this is argued in the White Paper&#x2014;that the best hope of developing traffic outside the South-East, and therefore enabling people to travel from airports outside the South East, is to concentrate development on a number of specific areas. The White Paper declares those decisions. In that way we maximise the hope of increasing the amount of traffic outside the South-East, but I do not pretend that that will be an easy achievement.</p>

<p>I thank my hon. Friend for his comments about Cardiff. I am sure that many people will welcome these decisions. I emphasise the importance of the principle of a concentration of services. That does not mean that other airports will not serve important local needs and have expanding traffic.</p>

<p>Does the Secretary of State accept that there will be a general welcome of his desire to shift the emphasis from the South-East to the regions? Is he further aware that the people of Hertfordshire and Bedfordshire cannot under

take to accept, let alone support, his decision of a 4 million expansion at Stansted or a 5 million expansion at Luton?

<p>That was certainly an eloquent minority report. Although an expansion to a capacity of 5 million is projected for Luton, the White Paper states that that is the limit. In those terms it is likely to be acceptable to many people in that area. It is sensible to use the resources at Stansted. I believe that that is the view of the South-East Economic Planning Council as well as of others. Developments beyond that point are in no way foreclosed by my statement today. There are other options which will be seriously considered.</p>

<p>I do not think that my hon. Friend is right to say that Bristol Lulsgate is treated shabbily. There will be an expansion of passenger capacity at Bristol, but Cardiff has better facilities and there were certain objections about noise in the Bristol area.

<p>I am not ignoring my responsibilities. Aberdeen has already been transferred to the British Airports Authority. It is an airport which is in increasing use. There is no question of an abrogation of responsibility.

<p>Am I correct in saying that the decision to limit Heathrow to a four-terminal airport will effectively limit the passenger capacity to about 53 million? Am I correct in assuming that that will make inevitable a rapid development of Gatwick up to its single-runway, twin-terminal capacity of 25 million but that beyond there for future development in the 1990s&#x2014;which is only 12 years away&#x2014;there is only one option&#x2014;a new airport which could not be ready in time, or the substantial expansion of Stansted beyond the 4 million mark?

<p>The hon. Member for Chingford (Mr. Tebbit) has obviously not had time to look at the White Paper. The fourth terminal limits the capacity at Heathrow to 38 million, not 50 million. It is true that a second terminal at Gatwick, which will raise its capacity to 25 million, will he needed. Beyond that the White Paper states three options&#x2014;a major development at Stansted beyond the 4 million capacity, a new airport, or the conversion of a military airport.

The hon. Member says that an entirely new airport would be ruled out by the time factor. We do not accept that. In any case there is the other option of converting an existing military airport.<br/>
If the hon. Member looks at the forecast for air travel in the London area, starting with Roskill down to the forecasts in this White Paper, and considers the changes in economic circumstances and fuel prices since Roskill, he will be by no means persuaded that the forecasts are of a kind which should commit any Government to development anywhere in the London area by way of a new airport or by a major development at Stansted or anywhere else. At this time that would be an unwise commitment in the light of the information at hand.</p>

<p>I can give my hon. Friend that assurance. I am against compulsion in this respect. The White Paper makes perfectly clear that any such transfer would take place with the voluntary agreement of the local authority concerned.

<p>The hon. Member can interpret it in any way he likes, but the point is that it would not be sensible in the light of current forecasts to make now


the sort of decision he seems to think ought to have made. It is better to make that sort of decision on the basis of firm information, and I invite him to do what I invited his hon. Friend to do.

<p>Since the White Paper speaks in paragraph 113 of Manchester being faced with a difficulty over the runway and of Liverpool airport having a very good runway, and since at the same time it is predicted that Manchester will have between 2&#x00B7;5 million and 6 million passengers while Liverpool Airport will have only 1 million, is it not disappointing that Liverpool has not received greater support in the White Paper?

<p>There will be expansion at Liverpool as a local airport.

<p>Will the Minister accept that the decision he has announced on Luton and Stansted represents a double kick in the teeth to the people of Hertfordshire, especially those in my constituency who live under the flight path

As his White Paper acknowledges that Luton Airport has the largest number of night flights of any airport in the kingdom, will he toughen up the statement of intent rapidly to reduce the number of night flights from Luton? Did he not consider using the stick on the charter operators who bring in the largest number of such passengers arriving in the South-East, to compel them, if they will not do it voluntarily, to make better and fuller use of regional airports, as much to help local industry as to spread tourism?</p>

<p>I understand the hon. Gentleman's concern about Gatwick and the concern of the people in the area. Undoubtedly these decisions will have an adverse effect on noise at Gatwick in the short term. However, as a result of the other decisions&#x2014;in the White Paper and elsewhere&#x2014;we are making about noise, the noise position at Gatwick should certainly be improved by 1990. I recognise that that is a long time off, but the development of Gatwick has to be an element in this programme. However, Gatwick also has the assurance of a limit on development there, imposed by one runway and two terminals.</p>

This is, again, a matter of choice. We do not agree with the Stratford Committee, which avoided the choice.

<p>The answer to the last question is "Yes".<br/>
I do not think that there is a justification for further airport development at Severnside. I think that Cardiff Airport has the facilities required for a regional airport for that area. My hon.

<p>I beg leave to make a statement about meetings in Brussels of the Council of Ministers on 30th and 31st January on agriculture and fisheries, at which I represented the United Kingdom.<br/>
At the beginning of the Fisheries Council on 30th January I raised the question of the devaluation of the green pound which had been blocked by three delegations the previous day. Accordingly, the Danish President called a special meeting of the Agriculture Council for 31st January.<br/>
In the Agriculture Council the German delegation confirmed that it did not wish to make a link between the devaluation of the green pound and the fisheries negotiations. However, the German, Netherlands and Belgian delegations explained that they saw some connection between


the devaluation and the negotiations on common price levels for 1978&#x2013;79. I explained the United Kingdom attitude to the negotiations on farm prices in terms identical to those I have used on many occasions in this House.<br/>
Eventually it was agreed that the green pound should be devalued by 7&#x00BD; per cent., according to the following timetable; for beef and pigmeat, a devaluation of 5 per cent. on 2nd February; the additional 2&#x00BD; per cent. for these commodities and 7&#x00BD; per cent. for milk and milk products to take effect when the Council's decision on prices and other measures for 1978&#x2013;79 enters into effect; for all other commodities, the full 7&#x00BD; per cent. to take effect at the beginning of the marketing year for each commodity.<br/>
I regard this as a very satisfactory outcome. It implements the decision of this House to seek a devaluation of 7&#x00BD; per cent. It gives substantial immediate help to the pig and beef sectors, which need it, and it defers the adverse effects on consumers of a devaluation for as long as possible. I estimate that the saving to British consumers as a result of the Council decision, by comparison with an immediate across-the-board devaluation, amounts to some &#x00A3;50 million over the next six months&#x2014;or about &#x00A3;3 on average for every family.<br/>
In the Fisheries Council agreement was reached authorising the Commission to continue negotiations with third countries on fishing opportunities for 1978.<br/>
There was less progress in discussions on the internal regime, and none of the major issues was resolved. It was clear early in the meeting that agreement on a definitive common fisheries policy would not be possible, and accordingly attention was focused on the arrangements to apply in the meantime.<br/>
The Council was unable to agree to a United Kingdom proposal that the existing standstill arrangements should be continued for a further short period. For my part, I could not agree to an alternative proposal to adopt, on a provisional basis, the Commission's latest proposals on quotas, conservation and enforcement, which would have left aside the basic issue of coastal preference and other important issues. I maintained the Government's position that the elements of the

common fisheries policy need to be considered as a whole and not adopted piecemeal.<br/>
In the absence of agreement, the Community's so-called standstill arrangement lapsed at midnight last night. Other member States declared their intention to observe, for the time being, the Commission's proposal on quotas and conservation. I made clear the Government's intention to take action in accordance with agreed procedures to maintain existing conservation measures. Our right to take further appropriate unilateral conservation measures is, of course, unimpaired.<br/>
I also made clear the Government's intention to continue to work for a settlement which would meet the United Kingdom's essential requirements.</p>

<p>The right hon. Gentleman will remember that he said in the House on 23rd January that he accepted the decision of the House. Why, then, did he not insist on its being carried out in full in the Council of Ministers, at least for all livestock products, as he must be aware that postponement of action on dairy products in particular is an invitation for a further large quantity of totally unwanted imports of butter?<br/>
Secondly, does not the right hon. Gentleman feel that this indicates a likelihood that when future proposals for a devaluation of green currencies are made, if they come from this country, they will be singled out for specially adverse treatment?<br/>
Lastly, is the right hon. Gentleman aware that we wholly support the stand he has taken on fisheries, although I rather regret that he did not take our advice and attend Friday's meeting in Berlin, because doing so might have avoided his being faced with a <i>fait accompli?</i></p>

<p>It may be for the convenience of the House if I deal first with


those questions that concern fisheries. Of course I shall keep the House fully informed. I think that the right hon. Gentleman will acquit me of any desire at any time not to keep the House informed on this and all other matters.<br/>
I would have expected the whole House to be with me on the question of Friday's meeting in Berlin. It is not simply a matter of meetings being deferred for a few days. From that point of view we got to exactly the same points. It was a question of what I considered to be&#x2014;I think that the whole House is with me, including, I hope, the right hon. Gentleman&#x2014;an attempt to force upon the United Kingdom issues which the United Kingdom had every right to consider at its leisure. It was for that reason that I did not go to Berlin.<br/>
I turn now to the green pound questions. First, the right hon. Gentleman has it slightly wrong. The House decided, and the Government accepted, that there should be a 7&#x00BD; per cent. devaluation. In the winding-up speceh from the Opposition Front Bench the Conservatives asked that that should be immediate for all commodities. I have had a look at the various motions. The right hon. Gentleman might re-read them. The Government amendment, the Conservative motion, the Liberal Early Day Motion&#x2014;all of them&#x2014;singled out the livestock sector and in particular beef and pig-meat. How the right hon. Gentleman thinks one benefits the beef and pigmeat sector by increasing the cereal price I do not know. Obviously, it had to be staggered.<br/>
On an objective economic basis&#x2014;and that was all: the question of the cost to the consumer and the industry's need&#x2014;the Commission said over and over again during the discussions that the right figure was not 7&#x00BD; per cent. but 5 per cent.</p>

<p>The right hon. Gentleman must try to answer my questions. He must also try to be fair. I told him last Thursday that we did not object to his phasing where cereals were concerned. What I am now asking him is this: does he not think it very undesirable to have avoided action for a matter of months on dairy products, because there will be a further large increase in imports of butter, and they are not wanted here?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1978-02-01a.474.0" hansard_membership_id="10169" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/20635" speakername="Mr. Silkin" colnum="474" time="">
<p>I shall try to be fair. If the right hon. Gentleman is concentrating on the dairy sector, I must tell him that that was not the sector&#x2014;[<i>Interruption.</i>] The right hon. Gentleman mentioned the dairy sector specifically and therefore I must deal with it. The fact is that we are dealing with a sector in which output is at a record level, the highest in our history. It is not in urgent need, and it never was. It remains capable of looking after itself.<br/>
I agree that large amounts of butter will be coming into this country. That was bound to happen. There is a great deal of butter in this country at present. But we must also weigh the fact that the consumer will benefit from that, and the producer will receive his 1&#x00BD; per cent. deferred devaluation from last year, to which the right hon. Gentleman did not object at all at the time. The producer will receive that on 1st April, and he will receive 7&#x00BD; per cent. on 1st April or 1st May, whenever the price negotiations finish. He will receive a 9 per cent. increase in price, and I think that that is worth waiting for.</p>

discussions should be continued. I hope that the discussions will bear fruit very soon.</p>

<p>Is the right hon. Gentleman aware that the devaluation of the green pound will certainly be welcomed by beef and pig producers, although no doubt they will look for more? Is not the situation in the fishing industry extremely serious? Is it not the case that there seems to be no progress being made and no likelihood of making progress? While we totally support the right hon.

<p>I have already stated the position on conservation measures, and they are the most likely measures to be considered. I intend to have discussions with the industry about how it might practise self-discipline&#x2014;as has happened with mackerel fishing&#x2014;in the next few months in particular. It is obviously too early for the right hon. Gentleman to know this, but it is worth considering what progress has been made. If he looks at what the other eight countries have agreed to do&#x2014;I hope that they will carry out that agreement among themselves&#x2014;although they do not go far enough, the proposals are a considerable move towards the position of the United Kingdom. The exception is that of quotas, and even those are much larger for the United Kingdom than appeared to be the case a few months ago. I hope that the final moves will take place within a measurable time.</p>

<p>Is my right hon. Friend aware that, since he became the responsible Minister, he has begun to sound more and more like the football manager on television with a team in the relegation zone? Does he not appreciate that it is no good playing in these foreign leagues?

<p>A lot of my time and energy is spent in dealing with my colleagues in the Council of Ministers in Europe, and I have not enough energy left wholly to deal with my hon. Friend.

In due course my hon. Friend might give me what he considers to be the answer. Does his point of view mean that a British Minister in the Council of Ministers should simply sit back and let every single thing be done against this country? Whatever may be a British Minister's view, should he not stand up for the nation?</p>

<p>In answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Weston-super-

Mare (Mr. Wiggin) the Minister said that he thought that the Continental countries would have to consider their reasons for opposition to devaluation of the green pound. Will he now consider the reasons for the opposition&#x2014;namely, that his policy of resisting it for so long, and therefore allowing the other countries to provide our food from their resources, has resulted in the fact that they are reluctant to lose our markets? Will he take that lesson to heart and in future not so stubbornly imagine that it is in the interests of the consumers falsely to hold down food prices for ever at the expense of our own farmers?</p>

<p>I note what the Conservative Party's policy on food prices is. If the Conservative Party does not want to give it all the publicity that the hon. and learned Gentleman apparently wants to give it, I am happy to give it publicity on my own.

It was not Denmark that objected.</p>

Finally, will my right hon.

<p>That was my way of making up my mind. On the other questions raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdare (Mr. Evans), it is undoubtedly true that the common agricultural policy as at present constituted does not properly serve the interests of the people of the European Community. For that reason we advocate a radical change in it. Although there are several aspects to it, to my mind that change has as its greatest point the fight against the price levels for commodities in structural surplus.</p>

To that end could the right hon. Gentleman point out to his colleagues in the Community and in the German Government, in particular, that the proposition that the prospective Common Market price review should lead to further price increases for those products which are in structural surplus&#x2014;cereals and milk&#x2014;would make a total nonsense and would run contrary to deeply held opinion throughout the House?</p>

<p>I have said to the House on several occasions, and I have said in Brussels, that one attends price review meetings to examine everything on its merits, but I have said also that I believe that the merit of having a higher price policy for commodities at present in structural surplus escapes me.</p>

<p>My right hon. Friend reported to the House this afternoon that there is a lot of butter in the Common Market countries at present.

<p>I have often made plain the feeling which I believe to prevail throughout the House about that sort of transaction. It is ludicrous. But this question serves to re-emphasise two points. First, let us examine and tackle the question of the price of commodities in structural surplus, butter being a good example. Second, until we have got it totally in its form, was not the United Kingdom right last March and April to insist that we had a butter subsidy?</p>

<p>I beg to ask leave to move the Adjournment of the House, under Standing Order No. 9, for the purpose of discussing a specific and important matter that should have urgent consideration, namely,
<q>the need for an inquiry into the disclosure in the Press of secret matters affecting national security.</q>
The matter is specific in that there is a report in today's Press that last summer the identity was disclosed of a man working in a top job in Downing Street who was said to be a Soviet agent. The story goes on to disclose a reference in a conversation with journalists to the&#x2014;</p>

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. On a number of occasions I have been told by the Table that, by established practice and by the rules of the House, no hon. Member may raise anything which is in any way of a secret nature. Anything of that nature must not be revealed, debated or mentioned.<br/>
If the hon. Member for Blackpool, South (Mr. Blaker) is raising something which he says is secret, I should like to know whether we shall in future be allowed to raise matters which are secret, since, frankly, I have been barred many times on that.</p>

<p>In view of his long experience in the House, I pay great respect to what the hon. Gentleman says, but all that the hon. Member for Blackpool, South (Mr. Blaker) has done so far has been to refer to what is in the Press today. That is not a secret. I think that we ought to hear what the hon. Member has to say.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1978-02-01a.485.0" hansard_membership_id="3040" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/12463" speakername="Mr. Blaker" colnum="485" time="">
<p>I confirm, Mr. Speaker, that it is not my intention to raise any matters which are secret.<br/>
The story goes on to disclose a reference in a conversation with journalists to the fourth man in the Philby affair. It continues by saying that the civil servant involved had been the subject of an inquiry and had been cleared.<br/>
Whether or not that last point is correct is not my concern today, important though it is. My concern is that this is not the first time that stories revealing what must be secret matters affecting the security of the country have appeared in the Press in recent weeks. Only last Monday stories were published which brought into question the efficiency and impartiality of the security services.<br/>
I believe this to be a new departure in the way we deal with security matters in this country and one which has serious implications. I urge that it would be right for the Prime Minister to set up an independent inquiry into how these allegations came to be made public and the facts surrounding them. The exact terms of reference of the inquiry would, of course, be a matter for discussion in the debate.<br/>
The matter is, therefore, specific in that it involves the need for an inquiry into the reports in the Press today and on Monday.<br/>
The matter is important because these revelations reflect on the way in which responsibility for security has been and is being exercised. The efficient working of our security services is vital to the country's interests, and, at least, these stories must have damaged the morale of the security services. Moreover, it seems to me that today's story, like Monday's, involves the disclosure of official secrets.<br/>
The subject should have urgent consideration, because today's story suggests that what is involved is not simply one occasion but several occasions on which secret matters have been ventilated to and in the Press. For all I know, there may be more to come.<br/>
The many serious and, indeed, alarming questions to which this matter gives rise should be cleared up as soon as possible. Not only is it important that the morale of our security services should be maintained, but it is important that public confidence in them should be preserved. The House should have the opportunity to express itself on the subject as soon as possible.</p>

As the House knows, under Standing Order No. 9 I am directed to take into account the several factors set out in the Order, but I have not to decide whether there ought to be a debate on the matter. I have to decide whether there shall be a debate tonight or tomorrow.<br/>

<p>I beg to move,
<q>That leave be given to bring in a Bill to require the Secretary of State for Defence to set up an inquiry to examine the prospects for improving defence from potential terrorist attack by the provision of missile and other defence systems for installation on British merchant ships and oil rigs; and for connected purposes.</q>
Everyone in this House detests terrorism and its spreading evil. It has struck in the air and in cities, and in time it may strike at sea. There are three reasons why I am bringing forward the Bill calling for a radical inquiry into the defence of merchant ships and oil rigs. Such an inquiry is needed urgently.<br/>
The first reason is that the world oil trade around the Cape has risen from 0&#x00B7;8 million barrels a day in 1965 to 18 million barrels a day in 1976&#x2014;that is more than a 20-fold increase in a decade. It is a greater increase than in any other trade route. Therefore, as a terrorist target it is more inviting than ever before.<br/>
Secondly, parts of the African coast have fallen into potentially hostile hands, and more could do so in future. There are numerous inlets along the coast where terrorists could hide out and from which small boats could be launched to carry mines out to sea.<br/>
The third reason is that, after a period of phenomenal growth since 1962, the Russian navy already has obsolescent equipment. Some of this could be sold or could fall into the wrong hands. Missile systems such as the SSN2 on OSA class ships are said to be being phased out in favour of improved versions. We have seen Russian arms used world-wide from Vietnam to Ethiopia and there is no reason why their surplus naval arms could not be used by terrorists at sea.<br/>
These three factors&#x2014;the vast increase in oil trade round the Cape, new hideouts along the African coast, and the surplus of naval equipment available&#x2014;combine to make terrorist action against merchant ships more likely in the future than in the past.<br/>
In October 1976 the French Admiral Labrousse said that a total of 665 super tankers sailed the routes away from the

oilfields of the Middle East&#x2014;ships that are too large to use the canal. France alone needs 120 million tonnes of oil a year, three quarters of which comes from the Persian Gulf. Britain's 2,000 merchant ships&#x2014;the youngest merchant fleet afloat&#x2014;include the largest number of refrigerated ships and many modern tankers, which could be a prime target.<br/>
Any threat to tankers is likely to be associated with a threat to the oil rigs. The Select Committee on Science and Technology commented on this in paragraph 121 in its 1974 report on offshore engineering. It said:
<q>Offshore oil and gas installations represent a major defence requirement.</q>
It went on:
<q>We recommended that Ministers should initiate an inquiry to establish the requirements for the protection of offshore installations.</q>
It is not only oil that is carried by ships but food and minerals and the protection of these also deserves an inquiry. Our aim must be to protect not the thousands of miles of sea routes but the ships on them and to find out how this can be done without spending more than we can afford.<br/>
The inquiry should consider the economic systems of self-defence for merchant ships; deck fittings for simple helicopters, and the employment of light naval boats or hovercraft for dealing with mines. It could also examine the possibility of using balloons for observation and light defensive missile systems.<br/>
Nothing in any of these suggestions is contrary to our traditions in the past. In times of peace throughout the centuries of piracy merchant ships have been equipped to protect themselves. Legal difficulties should not arise. Article 51 of the United Nations Charter enshrines the right of self defence. It says:
<q>Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self defence.</q>
The manning of anti-terrorist equipment should not be too difficult. There could be volunteers among the crews under a Reserve officer and training could be given by the Royal Navy. Naturally the patriotic sentiments of the shipping companies would make them wish to help.<br/>
This equipment might prove as well to be a source of export sales to our


NATO allies if the system proved successful in British merchant ships. This would help to create jobs in the good cause of security.<br/>
We should not discredit or fail to examine the re-introduction of old ideas. The self-defence of ships in modem times could gain much from ideas of the past. We cannot forget that in 1917 submarine sinkings had brought us near to defeat and a reversion to the old idea of convoys saved us. That idea was resisted by the Admiralty, backed by wrong statistics to the Cabinet. Old ideas in new forms have saved us before and may do so again. Before the Second World War it was a a widely held view that the submarine menace had been overcome. How wrong that was proved. All fresh ideas must be considered. We must be ready for terrorism to extend to the seas in the same way as we have seen it extend with the Cuban mercenaries across Africa.<br/>
Perhaps I may remind the House of an article written by Patrick Beesley in "Navy International" in October 1977, in which he said:
<q>As long, however, as our maritime forces remain so shamefully reduced as they are at present, improvisation and ad hoc measures will have to fill the gap at sea, and the enthusiastic amateur may perhaps still be able to put on a show that no professional could provide.</q>
The need for a high level inquiry is urgent, and it should include scientists of originality and distinction as well as senior officers of the Armed Services, shipping, oil and other industries involved.<br/>
If we strengthen our capacity to meet the threat of terrorism at sea, that terrorism is less likely to arise and the ideal of peaceful trade will be made safer. I am grateful, in asking leave of the House to bring in the Bill, to have the support of distinguished Members who have given much careful thought to the defence problems of our nation.</p>

<p>New Clause 4 and the other new clause and new schedule which we are to debate with it raise important constitutional issues, not all of which are related directly to the subject of devolution and the method of devolution put to the Committee by the Government. Therefore, I very much hope that when considering these new provisions, right hon. and hon. Gentlemen will not do so from an entrenched position reflecting their basic view on this legislation but will consider them in a rather separate sense, particularly when I stress that these provisions in no sense seek to wreck the Bill. They reflect a particular view as to the way in which devolution should operate, if devolution takes place. I repeat that they are not aimed at wrecking the Bill and there is no reason why, if they are passed, those who favour the Bill should feel unduly discomforted. Equally, if they are passed, there is no reason why those who are against the Bill should feel that they have in any way lost out. I suggest that these provisions should be considered on their merits.<br/>
The purpose of these new clauses and the new schedule is to provide Scotland


with a Bill of Rights. The rights and freedoms that will be protected if this Bill of Rights new clause is passed are those set out in the European Convention of Human Rights to which the United Kingdom is already a signatory, with slight alteration reflecting the fact that some are not applicable to a devolved Scotland because of the limitation on the powers of the Scottish Assembly and the Scottish Executive.<br/>
If this Bill is to pass, we are in effect providing a written constitution for Scotland, and virtually every such constitution which has been promulgated from that of the United States onwards has included a Bill of Rights. We therefore believe that it is only right that the people of Scotland, if they are to have a devolved system of government, should also have the benefit of a Bill of Rights that is characteristic of written constitutions and of systems of government of this kind.<br/>
Personally, I wish that the United Kingdom as a whole had the benefit of a Bill of Rights as part of the law of the land. But we are not legislating for the United Kingdom as a whole in these proceedings and nothing that we do in Committee can provide by means of this Bill a Bill of Rights for the United Kingdom as a whole. That does not seem to me to be a reason for Scotland not to enjoy the benefits of a Bill of Rights.<br/>
I would say to those hon. Gentlemen who favour the cause of a Bill of Rights for the United Kingdom as a whole that I can think of nothing that would advance further and give greater reality to that cause than the promulgation of a Bill of Rights for Scotland as a first step.</p>

<p>Will the hon. Gentleman say who will interpret the Bill of Rights? Will it be interpreted by the judges, will it increase their power, and where will this put Parliament in respect of this legislation? In other words, who will determine what is the law and what is not the law, and who will determine how one makes the law under this kind of system?</p>

<p>I shall cover these points a little later. If I fail to do so, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will intervene later. I want to carry him with me on these matters.<br/>
The answer in such a succinct form at this stage is that it involves judicial interpretation, but no more judicial interpretation than is already involved in the Bill. Parliament will in no way be affected. The sovereignty of Parliament will not be diminished by one jot or tittle. That is the short answer, but I shall elaborate a little later in my remarks.<br/>
I believe that those who favour a Bill of Rights for the United Kingdom as a whole will find that the passage of this Bill of Rights for Scotland in particular would greatly further the cause of a Bill of Rights for the United Kingdom as a whole.<br/>
At the moment legislation has been proposed to that effect from the Liberal Benches in the House of Lords and is being considered by a Select Committee of that House. Other distinguished figures have come out in favour of a Bill of Rights for the United Kingdom. I believe that if Scotland is given a Bill of Rights in the first instance that would be a case of Scotland acting as a pioneer leading to the acceptance of a Bill of Rights for the United Kingdom as a whole.<br/>
I also wish to make it clear that this proposal is in no sense meant to imply that the devolved Assembly and the devolved Scottish Executive would in any way be more likely to infringe the rights that are protected by a Bill of Rights than would the United Kingdom Government or this Parliament. Instead, I would argue that in a devolved Scotland ordinary citizens should be provided with the machinery and the legal means of protecting and enforcing those rights which we do not have in the United Kingdom as a whole but which I personally would like to have.</p>

<p>I endorse every word my hon. Friend said. The effect of the passage of these provisions would be that action taken by a Scottish Assembly and Executive would be void if it infringed the Bill of Rights. That would mean&#x2014;this picks up the point made by the hon.


Member for Liverpool, Walton (Mr. Heffer)&#x2014;that an individual citizen would have the right to redress in the ordinary courts of the land if the Scottish Assembly or Executive acted in that way. It is absurd for anybody to suggest that that could never happen. It is in no sense a criticism of the future conduct of the Scottish Assembly or Executive to suggest that it might happen because it certainly could happen. I suggest that in the case of the United Kingdom Government, as we now stand, there have been many occasions on which infringements of the Bill of Rights which are equivalent to a European convention have been alleged against the United Kingdom Government and action has had to be taken to deal with the situation.

<p>On a point of order, Sir Myer. I heard the hon. Lady referring to ballot rigging in relation to the vote that took place last Thursday evening. I

understood that a number of hon. Members of the Scottish National Party, together with Whips from the Labour Party were having an argument and holding up the legitimate vote of the House of Commons. If any accusations are to be made, they should be made against the people who were trying to deprive the House of Commons of the opportunity of carrying out a legitimate vote at that time and of discussing and voting upon a legitimate amendment following the vote. I would, therefore, ask that Members of the SNP should keep to the rules of this Committee and not accuse people of ballot rigging when they themselves have indulged in a most reprehensible activity.</p>

<p>I was saying that there have been many occasions on which we in the United Kingdom have had to deal with alleged infringements of the Bill of


Rights. The point of the Bill of Rights, though, is not to punish Governments, whether it is the United Kingdom Government that one is talking about or the devolved Scottish Government. The purpose of the Bill of Rights is to prevent there being infringements of the rights that it is designed to protect. Therefore, it seems to me that it is desirable on that ground as well.<br/>
If one is saying that alone, of all Governments, the future Scottish Government will be incapable of perhaps accidentally infringing the Bill of Rights in a way that every other Government from time to time find themselves accused of doing, the proposition is absurd. I operate on the assumption that the Scottish Assembly and the Scottish Executive in respect of the Bill of Rights would behave in a way that is on average no better and no worse than that of any Government. I take the view that all Governments ought to be limited by a requirement to observe fundamental rights of the kind that are enshrined by international agreement in the European Convention, which is reflected in the Bill.</p>

<p>Would my hon.

<p>We have felt obliged to alter our position as a result of the decision of the European Court because we are signatories to the European Convention, and the court has adjudged against us in that particular case.<br/>
Nothing done by the passage of a Bill of Rights for Scotland would alter that situation. If anything, it would reduce the number of circumstances in which that is likely to occur, for reasons which I shall come to later. The chances of that happening would be substantially diminished rather than increased.<br/>
The extent to which that is likely to occur would not be affected one jot or tittle by the passage of a Bill of Rights. It has occurred because of our being a

signatory to the treaty and not because of any legislation. It would not be altered by legislation.<br/>
Questions were asked about the contents of the documents. I answered, in response to an intervention, that it reflects, with small changes and small diminutions, the contents of the European Convention to which we are already a party. The convention contains a variety of provisions, both general and particular. By way of example, I refer to a very general one in Article 7:
<q>Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence.</q>
However, Article 5.3 is something quite specific. It says:
<q>Everyone charged with a criminal offence has the following minimum rights:
<ol><li>(<i>a</i>) to be informed promptly, in a language which he understands and in detail, of the nature and cause of the accusation against him;</li>
<li>(<i>b</i>) to have adequate time and facilities for the preparation of his defence;"</li></ol></q>
and so on.<br/>
We could argue about what the contents of a Bill of Rights should be. It is certain that if the House of Commons or a Committee of the House sought to reach agreement on what the Bill of Rights should be, we would never reach agreement, because some Members on one side of the House would argue strongly in favour of extensive, libertarian rights of freedom of speech and freedom of expression, and some Members from other parts of the House might argue in favour of incorporating in a Bill of Rights provisions protecting property rights. Therefore, there would not be agreement. That might very well be an insuperable objection to a Bill of Rights.<br/>
However, very fortunately, before those matters became as controversial as they are today, the United Kingdom Government became a signatory to the European Convention, to this particular package of rights. The history of it dates back very far. I understand that the basic documents from which the European Convention ultimately emanated were largely of British creation, as it happens.<br/>
Be that as it may, it is right to say that the United Kingdom Government are signatories to that convention. Both major political parties have had their turns in Government since that was the case, and


neither political party has sought to renounce the convention or to express any doubts about it. It goes beyond that.</p>

<p>The hon. Member asks what has changed. I am coming to that in a moment. What both political parties have done is to incorporate the convention in the law of the United Kingdom. That means that if it is found that we are in breach of the convention through any legislation or Executive act, the matter has to be taken to the European Commission and then to the European Court. The British courts have no jurisdiction in the matter at all. Absolutely nothing can be done here.<br/>
Every time there is any allegation of an infringement, we have to wash our dirty linen in public. That is exactly what happened in the Ireland situation, and it is happening now about the Isle of Man. What I am saying in support of the new clause is that this is a unique opportunity to enact a Bill of Rights for Scotland. There are problems about doing that.</p>

<p>I am not a lawyer.

<p>Faced with an abstract proposition of that kind, I cannot say that there are no legal difficulties in doing that, because the nature of the legal difficulties has not been put to me.

ing, which seems to suggest strongly that any difficulties that there might be are not insuperable. In answer to a general proposition, I would not like to say that there are no problems at all, but I cannot believe that there are insuperable difficulties of that kind.</p>

<p>If this became the law and someone in Scotland chose to take a case to court in Scotland and received a judgment with which he was perhaps unhappy, and he then used his rights as a United Kingdom citizen to take it to the European Court and possibly achieved a contrary judgment, what would the position be? Would the judgment in Scotland run, or would it be the judgment of the European Court?</p>

<p>I hesitate to answer propositions of law in the presence of the Lord Advocate. However, I know that I shall be corrected if I am wrong. As I understand it, the position concerning the law of Scotland and, indeed, the law of the United Kingdom, would be that the judgment of the Scottish court would stand, but concerning international law and our international obligations, the decision of the European Court would be the law.<br/>
But then what would have to happen would be that the Council of Ministers would have to consider the matter, and pressure would be put on the United Kingdom Government to make their law conform to the European Court's decision, it having been found that, contrary to the decision of the Scottish court, there was a breach of he Convention. I see that I am not corrected by the Lord Advocate, and I draw some comfort from that on this occasion.<br/>
As I see it, there is a unique opportunity to enact a Bill of Rights in Scotland. As I have said, I think that it ought to be enacted for the United Kingdom as a whole, but I readily concede that there are problems about doing that, and they are problems to which reference has already been made. There is the problem that it is thought that the enactment of a Bill of Rights in the United Kingdom would be inconsistent with the sovereignty of Parliament. That would certainly be true if what was suggested was that the Bill of Righs should be entrenched in any way&#x2014;in other words, if there was any suggestion that subsequent legislation which was in


breach of the Bill of Rights would be something that he House of Commons and Parliament could not pass.<br/>
Various ways of dealing with that problem have been suggested, such as having a Bill of Rights which was not entrenched but would be regarded as a canon of statutory construction rather than a limitation on Parliament subsequently. Unfortunately, however, that is not a problem that we have to consider because we are considering not a Bill of Rights for the United Kingdom but a Bill of Rights for Scotland.<br/>
Concerning Scotland, in the Bill that the Government have placed before us the Scottish Assembly's powers are already very carefully and narrowly defined. If the Scottish Assembly or the Scottish Executive act outside those powers, they are acting <i>ultra vires</i> and the Assembly Act is of no effect and is void. The Acts of the Executive can be restrained, and they can also be declared void.<br/>
Therefore, in including in this Bill of Rights further limitations on what the Scottish Assembly and the Scottish Executive can do, we are in no way acting inconsistently with the basic principle of the Scotland Bill, which is absolutely chock-a-block with limitations on what the Scottish Assembly and the Scottish Executive can do. For example, if we can have in the Bill a provision that says that the Scottish Assembly can legislate for the protection, improvement and maintenance of salmon and freshwater fisheries but it cannot control fish diseases, it seems to me that we are prescribing in a fairly close way the limitations on the powers of the Scottish Assembly, and perhaps quite rightly so.<br/>
The only difference between the limitations in the Bill and the limitations that the new clauses seek to introduce is that whereas the limitations in the Bill are in a real sense limitations on the governmental and legislative powers of Scotland, the new clauses are primarily concerned with giving rights to individuals. Therefore, it seems to me that it is entirely apt to include a Bill of Rights as a limitation, but a positive limitation, in the Scotland Bill. If it is right that government generally should be limited by obligations of this kind, it seems that there is a strong case for using this opportunity.<br/>
However, there are those who question, none the less, whether it is right that a Bill of Rights of this kind should be included for a devolved legislature. All I would say is that I do not see why not, provided that it is made quite clear that the reason for doing it is not out of any disrespect, hostility or suspicion as to what the Scottish Assembly might do, but because we have opportunity here, with a written constitution and with a devolved Government, to do something which the doctrine of sovereignty does not, in my view, prevent, although it at least creates problems concerning the United Kingdom as a whole.<br/>
As it happens, this problem has been considered by a most authoritative body, the Standing Advisory Commission on Human Rights in Northern Ireland, which has produced an extremely telling, thorough and well-researched document on the protection of human rights by law in Northern Ireland. That goes far beyond the mere question of Northern Ireland and the particular situation there. It throws a lot of light on this question generally. At paragraph 6.15 in page 60, the report says,
<q>Although we are firmly of the opinion that the best way to provide comprehensive protection for human rights in Northern Ireland would be to incorporate the European Convention into the domestic law of the United Kingdom as a whole, we would not rule out the introduction of a Bill of Rights limited to Northern Ireland in all circumstances. We believe that in the event of the return of devolved legislative and executive functions to a new government in Northern Ireland (either before or after the incorporation of the European Convention into domestic law), it would be desirable for the enabling legislation to include a clear and enforceable charter of rights for Northern Ireland.</q>
That is exactly what we are proposing to do for Scotland. The basic decision whether any of Scotland, Northern Ireland, England or Wales should be limited in any way is one that has been taken in the international sphere. This does not involve any diminution of the sovereignty of Parliament, but&#x2014;</p>

<p>I am sorry, but it does not, because Parliament is as able as ever to pass an Act which is an infringement of the Bill of Rights. In doing so, it is not in any way bound or limited by any constitutional barrier. What it would be doing is putting the United Kingdom in


breach of its international obligations, but it can very well say "We are limiting the powers of the Scottish Assembly in all sorts of respects, and one of the respects in which we are doing that is that it shall not act in breach of the Bill of Rights."</p>

<p>Before the hon. Gentleman leaves the question of the Standing Advisory Commission's report on Northern Ireland, will he also reflect that in paragraph 3.01 the report says,
<q>The obligations of the United Kingdom Government under international treaties (especially the European Convention) and the corresponding rights and freedoms which they confer apply to the entire territory of the United Kingdom.

<p>But that is the subject of the paragraph that I read. That is not fair. The hon. Gentleman is doing less than justice to his normal standard of fairness, because what he was ignoring was that what the report is saying is that as long as there are no devolved institutions in Northern Ireland, there is no case for treating Northern Ireland separately from the point of view of the Bill of Rights. The Minister may disagree with the document, but it clearly says, not only in paragraph 6.15 but in its summary, that if there is to be devolution to Northern Ireland of substantial legislative and administrative powers, it favours the enactment of a clear and enforceable charter of rights for Northern Ireland, whether or not there is such a charter for the rest of the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>I did not realise that the Minister was not saying that the report did not say what I claimed it said, but rather that he disagreed with the document.<br/>
There is a clear distinction to be made. With devolution we are handing over a

new constitution and the right to make laws. Even in a federal system, which provides for the right to make laws of all kinds, there is always a Bill of Rights. We are saying that there are all sorts of limitations on the Scottish Assembly and that it is entirely reasonable that one of those limitations should be that the Assembly may not act in breach of the Bill of Rights to which the United Kingdom is a signatory and by which it is bound internationally.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman seems to have glossed over the point about the constitutional limitations on the powers of a legislature. Normally, a Bill of Rights is entrenched by putting it to the people and any change in the Bill can occur only if it is approved by the people. The Scotland Bill will be put to the Scottish people and will become entrenched in a way in which our legislation is not normally entrenched. We can overturn tomorrow what we pass today. Of course the referendum is consultative, but this matter will be put to the Scottish people as a Bill of Rights and will surely present a constitutional barrier and a restriction on the legislature.</p>

<p>It will not be a constitutional barrier to the United Kingdom legislature, because what is proposed is that the Scotland Bill should be put to the Scottish electorate. If the Bill of Rights is included in the Scotland Bill, the people of Scotland may say that they want the scheme of devolution and the Assembly with the powers proposed for it and the limitations on those powers.<br/>
The limitations can be found in Schedule 10 of the Bill which goes into the most minute detail on this question and sets out the statutes which can or cannot be amended. Therefore, we are saying that the Scottish Assembly will be able to operate only within certain confines. If we accept the Bill of Rights, we shall be adding to the limitations on the Assembly, but, taking the more positive view, we shall also be giving an opportunity to the citizens of Scotland to have rights in respect of the Assembly and Executive which they do not have in respect of the United Kingdom Government exercising comparable functions now.<br/>
I believe that such a move would lead comparatively quickly to a Bill of Rights


for the United Kingdom. The House is all too well aware of my position on this legislation, but why should we not, for once, extract some good from bad and allow the Assembly to act as a trailblazer for the United Kingdom as a whole?</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman is right to be concerned about all these matters, but the only answer to those problems is to defeat the Bill. We share a view on that, but if the Bill goes through, my proposal would be a limitation on the Assembly and Executive in favour of the citizen of Scotland. The power of the Assembly and Executive will otherwise be unfettered.<br/>
That is why, in a curious way, this argument is one that should attract supporters and opponents of the basic concept of devolution as propounded by the Government. It is not just a question of arguing the case for a Bill of Rights. As I have already pointed out, our position is fundamentally affected because we are signatories to the European Convention Anyone who says that we should not have

signed that convention or that it should be renounced must argue that at the appropriate time, but no Government of political party has said that we ought not to have signed it.<br/>
Not only are we signatories to the convention, but we have accepted the right of individual petition. The United Kingdom is bound in international law by that convention and there are important consequences flowing from that fact. It is a powerful argument in favour of the enactment of a Bill of Rights for Scotland.<br/>
If such a Bill were not passed and the Scottish Assembly or Executive did something in breach of the convention, it would not be Scotland which would be internationally liable, it would be the United Kingdom. Scotland would have no international existence in that sense and the United Kingdom would have to carry the can for what the Assembly and Executive had done, in exactly the same way as we are facing difficulties over the situation in the Isle of Man. I would not dream of prejudging or expressing a view on that case and it is irrelevant whether we are found to be in breach or not. What is relevant is the truly ludicrous sight of a British law officer going to the European Court and saying that Britain is defending legislation with which it totally disagrees since, because of the constitutional position of the Isle of Man, there is nothing we can do about it.<br/>
I do not want us to be placed in the same position in respect of the Scottish Assembly and the Scottish Executive. It would be uncomfortable, diplomatically unnecessary, internationally embarrassing and domestically a major source of irritation between the United Kingdom Government and Scotland.<br/>
Before responding to an intervention, I deal with the point that I suspect the Minister of State will make in reply. It is right to say that if any legislation that that Assembly passes is, in the opinion of the Secretary of State, in breach of our international obligations&#x2014;from the Minister of State's smile I assume that I have guessed the point.</p>

<p>At any rate, under Clause 20 (1) the Secretary of State has power not to allow Assembly law to be an Act


of the Assembly. That is also the position under Clause 37(2). If it is an Act of the Executive, the Secretary of State can have it declared null and void in the first place. That would apply to obligations under the European Convention as well as any other conventions. That is because they are international obligations to which we are a party.<br/>
I say to the Minister of State that the position is exactly on all fours with that of the Isle of Man. As I am sure the hon. Gentleman knows, or as he would be advised, we as a sovereign Parliament have the right to legislate for the Isle of Man. That is the position if we want to do so, and it might come to that if the court decision goes a certain way. I am saying that it would be more damaging and far more full of conflict to require the United Kingdom Government in the shape of the Secretary of State to intervene under Clause 20 and to refuse to enact or to allow a Bill to be enacted than for the matter to be considered by the courts of Scotland.<br/>
A political intervention to the effect that we cannot allow that to be done because it is in breach of the European Convention and therefore, in breach of our international obligations, would be far more unacceptable to the Scottish Assembly and the Scottish Executive than an adjudication by a Scottish judge. Therefore, we should make it clear that the convention is part of the constitution of a devolved Scottish Assembly rather than require a United Kingdom Minister to intervene.<br/>
The distinction is not so much between action being taken by an executive politically and action being taken judicially. The distinction is between action being taken by the United Kingdom Government and action being taken within the Scottish system in the Scottish courts.</p>

<p>There are three lawyers on the Front Benches and I wish to ask a factual question as a layman. Is it the fact that at Strasbourg counsel for the Home Office said that the British Government, in common with every other

European country, disapproved of birching? It was left to another member of the United Kingdom delegation, in this instance the Manx Attorney-General, to defend the practice of birching, which he did with enthusiasm. Does it follow that in a similar situation it would be left to a Solicitor-General, Lord-Advocate, or whatever law officer is to be called in the Assembly, to be part of the United Kingdom delegation at Strasbourg and to argue a different case from that put forward by the United Kingdom Government? Is that the fact of the situation?</p>

<p>Yes, unless the Secretary of State exercised his powers under Clauses 20 or 37 and said to the Assembly or Scottish Executive "Although this is within your legislative competence, your executive competence, we are not allowing it to be done because it is in breach of an international obligation."<br/>
I am saying that the political consequences of an intervention of that sort by a United Kingdom Minister, thereby stopping the Assembly or Executive from doing something because of a juridical or judicial matter&#x2014;namely, the application of the Convention&#x2014;would be far more damaging to good relations between the United Kingdom and Scotland, and far more subversive in that sense, than a Scottish court deciding the fact in the ordinary course of Scottish litigation.</p>

<p>I do not find that a telling intervention. Whether it is called a Bill of Rights or the European Convention is purely a matter of words, and I do not care which form of words is used.

If I had sought to alter the European Convention, he would have said that the rest of the United Kingdom is to be bound merely by the European Convention internationally, but that that is not good enough for poor old Scotland, which has to have more restrictions because the wicked English think that the Scots will misbehave themselves.

<p>May I draw attention to one other difference between my hon. Friend's proposal and that of the European Convention? As I understand it, the convention, in so far as it relates to individual petition, is accepted by this country on a voluntary basis for a period of years, which expires in 1981. That is the longest period for which we have renewed it. On previous occasions it has been less than five years. Whereas with the European Convention we are dealing with a much shorter time span, which might be considered experimental, I understand that what my hon. Friend is proposing is permanent.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1978-02-01a.513.5" hansard_membership_id="1643" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/11535" speakername="Mr. Brittan" colnum="513" time="">
<p>It is not permanent in the sense that it is enshrined in an Act of Parliament. Although the right of individual petition expires in 1981 on the basis of our present accession, that is not true about our adherence to the Convention generally, which I understand is of a more permanent nature. If at some future time we wished either to renounce the

Bill of Rights in the form of the European Convention or to modify it, or if it were to be renegotiated, Parliament as a sovereign body would be entitled to make the corresponding deletion, alteration or diminution from the Bill of Rights as it affects Scotland.<br/>
I do not think that my hon. Friend need be troubled on that score. If we decided that the burdens of the convention were unacceptable, we should not renew the right of petition. We should seek some way out of the convention and it would be the easiest thing in the world for the House of Commons, which in any event would have to be involved, to pass the corresponding amendment to the Scotland Bill.<br/>

<p>I return to the Isle of Man case. In that case the Attorney-General, who is a Member of the Isle of Man Parliament, was arguing on behalf of that Parliament, but any Scottish Law Officer would not be an elected Member of the Scottish Assembly. He might be, but it is unlikely. We would have a situation in which a Member of the House of Commons would have to act as defence counsel for a Scottish Assembly, with which he might totally disagree. Does not that raise a horrific concept?</p>

<p>I think it does.<br/>
I turn now to the objection that I anticipate will come from the Minister, because analogous objections have been put forward on other occasions. The enactment of this Bill of Rights would involve the courts in controversial political matters. There are those who do not wish judicial intervention or involvement in controversial political matters and feel that the courts are inappropriate to deal with such matters.<br/>
There are two answers to that objection. The first is that such hon. Members should be opposed to the Bill altogether, because the courts will be absolutely in the heart of controversial political matters in considering whether the Scottish Assembly or Executive has acted <i>ultra vires.</i><br/>
For example, in Schedule 2, paragraph 8, we find an increase in the powers of the Scottish Assembly. That provides that


the paragraphs in the preceding part of the schedule
<q>do not prevent any provisions from being within the legislative competence of the Assembly if those provisions&#x2014;</q>
<q>(<i>a</i>) are necessary or expedient for making other provisions effective or for the enforcement of other provisions".</q>
It would be difficult to think of a more touchy political question than whether particular provisions
<q>are necessary or expedient for making other provisions effective or for the enforcement of other provisions".</q>
Yet that is the kind of question that the courts will have to consider.<br/>
The Minister has worked extremely hard, but I think it would be a bold man who would say that the definition of what is or is not within the power of the Scottish Assembly is so precise that there will not be occasions when difficult and acute questions arise whether the Scottish Assembly and/or Scottish Executive has exceeded its powers.<br/>
Such questions will be in form judicial and in form a matter of statutory interpretation, but in reality they will amount to judicial intervention of the most acute and anxious form in the political process.<br/>
The provision in the Bill is for involvement at two stages. First, before the Bill becomes law, the Judicial Committee can be asked whether it is within the powers of the Scottish Assembly. Secondly, the Judicial Committee or other courts can be asked whether, in accordance with the provisions of Schedule 12, a particular Bill or Act of the Executive is beyond the powers of the Scottish Assembly. That is what courts do now in the sense of interpreting Acts of Parliament. But to intervene in considering whether a devolved Assembly is exceeding its powers is clear judicial intervention in the political affairs of that Assembly.<br/>
I am totally in favour of that process, but I submit that we cannot, on the one hand, have this kind of judicial intervention and, on the other hand, keep the courts out of it. The courts are into it up to the neck.<br/>
The Minister will recall that in earlier versions of the Government's proposals the courts were not involved to nearly the same extent as they are now. The hon. Gentleman, in response to criticism, accepted that the courts had to be

involved. Therefore, it will be a matter of statutory interpretation whether the courts find that the Scottish Assembly or Executive acted in breach of the Bill of Rights that forms part of the Scotland Bill if the new clauses go through.<br/>
First, the courts are there already. Secondly, apart from the Scottish or United Kingdom courts, as my hon. Friend the Member for Withington pointed out, the right of individual petition means that in any event the courts are involved because an individual, whether in Scotland, England or the Isle of Man, can claim that there has been a breach of the European Convention and take the matter, first, before the Commission and ultimately before the European Court. Therefore, without these new clauses, the individual citizen can test whether there has been a breach of the Convention by the devolved Scottish Assembly and Executive.<br/>
In opposing the new clause on those grounds the Minister will be saying "It is all right for a foreign court to look into these matters, but it is unacceptable to take them before a Scottish or a United Kingdom court. We do not mind the individual going to the Commission and then going on to the European Court and arguing his case there, but we shall not allow him to come to the Scottish courts first".<br/>
I suggest that it is infinitely less humiliating and embarrassing, as long as the United Kingdom is a signatory to the convention, to have these matters looked at by the domestic courts of Scotland and of England instead of by the European Court.<br/>
It is right to say that, as has been pointed out, if the individual citizen is not satisfied with the answer given by a Scottish court, he can still go on to the European Court. But I believe that the Scottish and English courts would be capable of interpreting the Bill of Rights in a way that would accord with the European Court and the job would be done within the British Isles. That seems to be more commensurate with our dignity as a nation than to be alone among the signatories to the convention in refusing to allow our domestic courts to touch the matter.</p>

<p>If that is the position&#x2014;I know that I am about to use an argument that my hon. Friend the Minister of


State will use against me later&#x2014;what is to stop the Scottish Executive legislating and passing a Bill of Rights in the same terms as in the schedule? Surely that would meet the operational argument put forward by the hon. Gentleman. What is to stop the Scottish Assembly giving to Scottish people the protection of a Bill of Rights?</p>

<p>The answer is twofold. First, such a Bill of Rights passed by the Scottish Assembly would encounter the same problem&#x2014;namely, the sovereignty of the Scottish Assembly&#x2014;as we would if we tried to enact a United Kingdom Bill of Rights. In other words, the Scottish Assembly, having passed it, could repeal it. However, if we, as the constitution makers and the creators of the Scottish Assembly, create a Bill of Rights for Scotland, it cannot be repealed in that way.<br/>
Secondly, if the Scottish Assembly does not choose to do that, we are still responsible in the same way as in the Isle of Man.</p>

<p>I should have to consider that question. I cannot give a positive answer. I think that it probably is, but I should not like that to be taken as my considered opinion.<br/>
These new clauses are not designed in any shape or form as a hostile act towards the Scottish Assembly or Executive. It is no secret that I am opposed to this form of devolution. It is not primarily because of that opposition that I bring forward these new clauses. It seems to me that, great as the mischief of the Bill and great as the damage that it is likely to create is, in one respect, and in one respect only, it provides us with an opportunity to act in advance of the United Kingdom as a whole. It would be a tragedy if, for reasons of suspicion or prejudice, we failed to take that opportunity. It is in that spirit that I commend the new clauses to the Committee.</p>

<p>It is unfortunate, to say the least, that New Clauses 2 and 9 were not selected. The clauses that we are discussing cover the same

issues but in a less specific way. I am disappointed that they do not go further. All that they do is to transfer powers which already exist from the European Court to the Scottish courts. I should have been happier if there had been an attempt to include more specific and, in some areas, more important rights. I suspect that we should enter areas of difficulty and controversy if we tried to do that but we should try to grapple with these problems rather than merely transfer existing powers.<br/>
The arguments for devolution or independence have two strands. One strand is the allocation of resources and the other the method of Government. The new clauses and new schedule involve both those strands, although the sections dealing with the economic problems are shorter.<br/>
The economic argument about devolution is totally unacceptable to me and my constituents. If devolution brings Scotland extra resources and that is at the expense of the rest of the United Kingdom, it is not on for me or for my constituents.<br/>
Many people say that if Scotland is to have the lion's share of United Kingdom assets, such as the oil, it must be prepared to carry the lion's share of United Kingdom liabilities. It should have responsibility for the national debt and possibly for our NATO commitment. Northern Leland is closer to Scotland than it is to England.</p>

<p>We should treat the people of the United Kingdom equally and not indulge in squalid squabbling.<br/>
It is suggested that there should be free commerce. The economic argument that Scotland should have extra resources will be totally discredited. Devolution should be opposed if people argue in that manner. The only justification for devolution is if it involves an attempt to reform and improve the method of government. That is why I am disappointed with these new


clauses. They do not get down to reforming and improving the method of government. The only way in which a valid case for devolution can be made out is by arguing that it would improve the quality of government and give ordinary people more control over the factors which affect their lives. We should be questioning the Bill on these grounds and asking how far the legislation improves the rights of individuals.<br/>
One of the major frustrations for my constituents and for the people of Scotland is that the United Kingdom Government do not control many of the things that they would like to control. We accept that the Government cannot control the weather&#x2014;although many people blame them for it&#x2014;but people feel that the Government have not enough power over jobs, multinational companies and world prices.<br/>
The truth is that the United Kingdom Government cannot devolve powers which affect many people, because they have not got the power to devolve them. We cannot expect the Assembly to be able to take over those matters which cause frustration to individuals. The proposed devolution will not improve the situation. I firmly believe that devolved government could make a major contribution towards improving government for many people if the new Assembly looked at those areas which cause frustration.<br/>
I checked through my correspondence this morning. I have letters about jobs, housing, tax and social security. Half of those letters involve complaints about decisions. Most of them deal with the frustration experienced by those who cannot obtain clear answers or information and from those who do not know what is their position. We must attempt to improve government in that area. We must make government more understandable and acceptable to individuals. We should not concentrate on the rules.</p>

<p>To most of my constituents it does not make much difference whether they have to come to London or go next door to find a bureaucrat, although it may save them money. What is important is to get away from the bureaucratic process. It will not make much difference whether one transfers powers from London to Edinburgh or from one office in Edinburgh to another. The important thing is the way in which the powers are carried out and the amount of information that the bureaucrats are prepared to give.<br/>
Both the Bill and the new clauses lay down powers and restraints, but they offer little positive guidance about how the new Assembly should work. That is the key issue&#x2014;not whether it has power or restraints.<br/>
From discussions on earlier clauses I know that the Minister of State believes that the good sense of the people of Scotland should decide how the Assembly should work. He believes that it is inappropriate for the United Kingdom Parliament to suggest how it should work, perhaps because we are so inept and inefficient. On the other hand, because of our experience we could make constructive suggestions. Before the Bill becomes law, we should set out how the Assembly should function in practice. Unless the basic standing orders of the Assembly are set out before the referendum campaign how will the Scottish people know how the Assembly will work and how it will affect them? They could end up with an Assembly which is unacceptable to them.<br/>
As the Bill stands, 40 per cent. of the Scottish people must approve devolution, but only 30 per cent. of the people might vote in the first election. In practice, the party in control of the Assembly could poll only 15 per cent. or 20 per cent. of the vote. What are the safeguards for the 80 per cent. of people who did not vote or who voted for a party which does not control the


Assembly? Many of those people who have a vote for the Assembly might want a devolved government if they knew its powers.<br/>
In new Clauses 2 and 9 we have tried to set out some of the positive things that should be done. Once the Assembly is set up there is a danger that it will have to deal with political hot potatoes. It will want to act to deal with them and it will be reluctant to spend a long time deciding on standing orders. It will not be sympathetic to trouble makers from an opposition party. There will be pressure to race on with the standing orders. It could race ahead by imitating Westminster. But it could, knowing that Westminster is unsatisfactory, race into a set of alternatives which are equally unworkable and impractical.<br/>
The amendments list a whole series of fundamental rights, but those rights already exist. All we are talking about is transferring the rights from the European Court to Scotland. However, we should be putting into the Bill at this stage fundamental rights of the greatest importance. The most important are, that the public should have access to all official documents, that the Press and public should have the right to attend all meetings of the Assembly and that every member of the Assembly has to sign a statutory declaration of interest before being permitted to speak in the Assembly.<br/>
Those rights are not at present available at Westminster. It is difficult for the Westminster Government to make easy access to all documents available to members of the public because of the security problem. Such a problem would not exist with a devolved form of government. The Scottish Assembly will have very little responsibility for security matters. It will be possible therefore for the Bill to set out these fundamental principles of open government, and not to leave them for the Scottish Assembly to devise afterwards.<br/>
We should be saying that we here at Westminster are involved, as a Parliament, in improving the form of Scottish government, that we admit that the present system of government is not successful in communicating information between governors and governed, and that we want to improve this process and therefore will make a firm commitment to open government. I hope that the Minis

ter will say what is being done in Scotland to prepare standing orders for the Assembly, and will explain what pressure he is putting forward to get the new Assembly committed to a form of open government which guarantees rights of access to all documents, gives equal access to information for all members of the Assembly, sets out the rights of the Press and the public to attend meetings, and provides for a statutory declaration of members' interests. He should say, if he is not writing those points into the Bill, that he is doing preparatory work so that proposals along those lines can be put to the Assembly.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend the Member for Cleveland and Whitby (Mr. Brittan) invited us to take an unentrenched view of this amendment. So unentrenched am I that I shall not be following him into the Lobby. The clause is a grave mistake. It is not true that the Conservative Party is committed to the idea of a Bill of Rights, and I do not believe that we should become so committed by the kitchen door.<br/>
It is somewhat naive of my hon. Friend&#x2014;I do not wish to be rude to him&#x2014;to say that the purpose of the new clause is to advance further the cause of a Bill of Rights. Although he spent some part of his speech eloquently putting forward the case that would arise if we did not make the amendment in respect of Scotland, the fact is that the motivation for the clause and its likely effect is to take us a step further along the road to a Bill of Rights for the United Kingdom. That is something I strenuously oppose.<br/>
The pursuit of a Bill of Rights is undesirable for several reasons. First, the idea of a Bill of Rights is mistaken. My hon. Friend says that both parties are committed to the European Convention. That is true. He says that we have not queried it. But I can assure him that some of us have been trying to, but those efforts do not get much public attention. It is about time, since the matter has now been raised, to bring this question into the open.<br/>
The trouble with a Bill of Rights is that it is vague and general. Although I hope we are all united in this House on the idea that we should defend the liberties of the subject, those liberties are specific. As


soon as one treats them as being general one gets into political matters.</p>

<p>There is a specific difficulty with a Bill of Rights in the matter of which my hon. Friend is speaking. While the rights are general, so, of course, are the rights of the citizen in the common law. The difficulty arises when one attempts to enshrine the principles of the common law in the absolute straitjacket of statute.</p>

<p>My hon. and learned Friend is absolutely right. I shall be coming to that point.<br/>
During the previous interchange my hon. Friend the Member for Cleveland and Whitby did not answer the point which lies at the root of this matter, namely, that there is an inevitable conflict between the powers of the judiciary and Parliament. In this country, for reasons for which others may have their own explanations, we have been the subject of more representations to the Commission on Human Rights in Europe than any other country. Yet it is fair to say, without being immodest, that this country is not the worst in these matters among the signatories to the convention.<br/>
One of the reasons for that state of affairs is that we have in operation the three most important elements in maintaining human rights. They are, first, vigorous media, secondly, a vigorous Parliament, and, thirdly, an active judiciary. All these produce circumstances in which people who feel they have a grievance and feel they are up against some encroachment on their rights have a means of expressing that grievance, and it can be taken to the European Court.</p>

<p>That is not what I said. I do not think the process diminishes those rights, but nor does it help them. It diminishes the power of this place and other existing bodies to watch over those rights and to see that they are brought

up to date and safeguarded. Let me pursue the matter further and perhaps I can give the hon. Member an answer.<br/>
The items in the schedule have to be interpreted. We do not have to guess on that score because we can look at what has happened in the European Convention. I tabled a Question to the Foreign Secretary on 23rd January asking what cases Britain was currently being asked to answer at the Commission. He listed 38 such cases. These excluded the Isle of Man, which has gone forward to the court. The reply refers to the preliminary stage. The answer was as follows:
<ol>
<li>(<i>a</i>) aspects of prison treatment and prison conditions;</li>
<li>(<i>b</i>) deportation;</li>
<li>(<i>c</i>) corporal punishment in schools;</li>
<li>(<i>d</i>) the law relating to homosexuality;</li>
<li>(<i>e</i>) trial procedures;</li>
<li>(<i>f</i>) the closed shop;</li>
<li>(<i>g</i>) alleged discrimination in the provision of schools;</li>
<li>(<i>h</i>) Mental Health Review Tribunals and conditions in Broadmoor Hospital;</li>
<li>(<i>i</i>) housing in Guernsey;</li>
<li>(<i>j</i>) the postal service;</li>
<li>(<i>k</i>) insurance companies legislation;</li>
<li>(<i>l</i>) the Incitement to Disaffection Act 1974;</li>
<li>(<i>m</i>) The Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provision Act 1975);</li>
<li>(<i>n</i>)vaccination of Children.</li></ol>
&#x2014;[<i>Official Report,</i> 23rd January 1978; Vol. 952. c. <i>448.</i>]
That list includes a great many subjects which would not be regarded as suitable for judicial decision. They would be essentially political decisions which would be taken either by a local authority or by Parliament, and they should not be sent away to 13 foreign judges for decision on our behalf.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Cleveland and Whitby says that it is less embarrassing for the Scottish courts to do it here than for the matter to be dealt with in Europe. But that is not the point. The question is whether we should subject ourselves to that procedure at all. If the answer to that is that we should not, what is the point of enshrining it in a statute of the United Kingdom for the purpose of "advancing further the cause".<br/>
It seems to me that, by accident in a sense, the subject has come to the surface at last, and it is worth pursuing it. As I understand the position&#x2014;any lawyer will correct me if I am wrong&#x2014;we are bound by treaty to the convention. I think that


we can get out of the convention in six months if we wish to do so. The effective part of the convention, the part which bites to the embarrassment of Her Majesty's Government, is that relating to automatic jurisdiction and the private petition. It has been renewed from time to time, and was last renewed for only five years, until 1981. In the period until 1981 we have at least an opportunity to investigate whether we wish to go further along this road.<br/>
Without making any comment on the merits or demerits of birching, I suspect that the Isle of Man case will concentrate people's minds very considerably on this matter. I understand the motives of my hon. Friend and respect them, but he cannot evade the point by saying that the position will be slightly better because it will be dealt with in Scotland. That is not really the point at issue.<br/>
The point at issue is whether this House&#x2014;or, in this case, the Scottish Assembly&#x2014;should be able to make laws which most people would regard as political, and which may, in the case of some of those affected, involve Executive decisions rather than judicial decisions. Such matters are in any case covered by the common law of the land, which looks into matters of fairness. The question is whether we should have these matters handled in that way or whether we are to abrogate the decisions to a court across the seas.<br/>
The whole business of human rights has developed in a way which people have not really comprehended. There is another covenant, based in the United Nations, which is not yet fully in operation. The European Parliament has produced a joint declaration, which is not yet effective, but it is asking that it shall be made effective. We shall then be bound by three international arrangements on the question of human rights.<br/>
Although the words "human rights" sound splendid, what we really have is a series of generalised statements which have to be interpreted. That interpretation, under the traditional United Kingdom parliamentary system, has been done here in Parliament and in the local authorities. The convention, on the other hand, requires that it should be done elsewhere by unelected people whose cultural and other backgrounds may be quite different from our own.<br/>
Although I understand that the motive of my hon. Friend&#x2014;I sympathise with him&#x2014;is to get at that root point, I think that, far from the new clause being such that we are getting something good out of something bad, we are taking an opportunity to deal with a minor problem in a bad Bill, and producing something which is infinitely worse.</p>

<p>I shall not follow in detail the speech of the hon. Member for Manchester, Withington (Mr. Silvester), with much of which I agree. At least he has brought the discussion to the crucial point, which is not so much whether people should have rights but rather which body is the best to enshrine, preserve and extend those rights. Should it, on the one hand, be the courts or, on the other hand, should it be Parliament in one form or another?<br/>
Although, in moving the new clause, the hon. Member for Cleveland and Whitby (Mr. Brittan), tried to deal with these points, almost as an afterthought at the end of his remarks, he did not deal with them satisfactorily. He dealt with them, of course, from a lawyer's point of view, as one would expect.<br/>
I suppose that much of this discussion really originates from the assumption, enshrined in the American constitution, that as soon as one has a written constitution, in whatever form, it becomes important to build in a Bill of Rights which enshrines the rights of the citizens of the country. I do not think that there is any necessary correlation between a written constitution and the need for a Bill of Rights, neither do I necessarily say that because, we have the Scotland Bill, which is about to go on to the statute book, somehow or other we are transformed into a situation in which we have a written constitution.<br/>
It seems to me that this measure is no different in principle from measures such as the Treaty of Accession, or other measures which affect our constitution, such as the Parliament Act 1911, or subsequent Parliament Acts which affect our constitution and are Acts of this House which can be amended or repealed by this House. I hope that that principle is still accepted and respected by all of us.<br/>
Whether we have a written constitution seems to be rather a bogus question,


and certainly not one that is entirely relevant to the decision whether we should have a Bill of Rights. It would be an interesting exercise&#x2014;but one that would take far too long&#x2014;to try to compare the position here with that in another Western country, such as the United States. The United States has had a Bill of Rights over a period of 200 years. It has had a written constitution. Our country, with the provisos that I have made, has no written constitution and no Bill of Rights.<br/>
It would be interesting to compare the two countries and to discuss whether individual rights have been better preserved in the one country than in the other. I should be quite happy to enter such a debate, and I have no doubt at all where my judgment would be. It would be that rights have been better preserved and enshrined in this country, which has not a written constitution and has not a Bill of Rights.<br/>
The Americans have discovered a major problem in the development of their constitution. In theory, there were to be three equal components which could check and balance one another, the legislature, the Executive and the judiciary. The legislature is relatively simple to change, to alter and to influence. The President is considerably more difficult to change, alter, influence and remove. As we know well enough, the President has been removed only once. But it is almost impossible to change, alter, influence or remove the judiciary. Usually, if it is ever suggested in any Western country that the judiciary is wrong in any respect whatsoever, people adopt the kind of cathedral countenance that brooks no opposition and suggests that something tantamount to blasphemy has occurred.</p>

<p>In making a comparison between the United States and other Western countries, would it not be better, in trying to set up a new form of government, not to compare and balance one system with the other but to cull the best out of each and put them together? Does my hon. Friend agree that the right of individuals in the United States to inspect the vast majority of Government documents is a very useful one?</p>

<p>I listened to the speech of my hon. Friend with great interest and

agreed with much of what he said. His proposed new clause, which was not selected, is quite different from the one proposed by the hon. Member for Cleveland and Whitby and comes much closer to what the hon. Member for Withington referred to as specific rights being written into a document so that it can be understood and the courts have very little difficulty in interpreting it. As a rule, courts manage to find difficulty in interpreting all sorts of simple things, but theoretically they should not have great difficulty in interpreting the rights of access to information in my right hon. Friend's new clause. That is a very different proposition from the generalised one that is before the House at the moment.<br/>
As to the American constitution, I believe that over the years the Supreme Court and the judiciary have not been very effective in extending human rights. The Supreme Court has been very unresponsive to the way in which people's views change and develop. Although there are certain rights which are valid for all ages and all conditions of men, there are other rights which develop as society develops. The American Supreme Court has been very slow in adjusting to these kinds of developments.</p>

<p>I shall not develop this discussion. As I have said, it would be an interesting debate, but we could not possibly follow it through now. There are all sorts of difficulties in making this kind of comparison. That I touched on it at all was because it was repeatedly suggested that because one had a written constitution one must have a Bill of Rights to safeguard the people's rights. I do not accept that.<br/>
I return to what seems to me to be the central point of this discussion&#x2014;whether in this country the rights of the people


are better secured by generalised Bills of Rights in the way that the hon. Member for Cleveland and Whitby said was to be started in Scotland and would develop thereafter in the rest of the United Kingdom, or whether they are better preserved in Parliament and by Acts that Parliament passes and are then interpreted in the courts.<br/>
I have no cathedral countenance that I adopt when I refer to the courts of this country. Anyone who is interested in the liberty of the individual and the development of rights knows the posisition. I shall not dwell at length on trade union rights, but I think of all sorts of important rights which we have come to accept today but which were not accepted a century ago and were very slow to be accepted by the courts. I have no great respect for the courts and their ability to keep pace with changing notions of what liberty should be and with the demands of a modern society.<br/>
One of the great problems with the judiciary is that it is almost impossible to alter its composition, let alone criticise it. It remains very old. We talk about the retirement age for everyone but judges. The judiciary remains appallingly unrepresentative in a social sense. I do not think that it should be completely socially representative. That would be a ludicrous proposition. But I understand that every High Court judge had a private education, went to public school.</p>

<p>Perhaps there is an exception of one. Perhaps there has been a recent appointment. There is always a tame member of the Opposition who is allowed in to make it look convincing.

<p>The hon. Gentleman should do his homework. What I have just said is incontrovertible. I expected the hon. Gentleman to get hot under the collar. I shall not bother to respond to

him, because he is greeted with a certain amount of amusement here. As the hon. Gentleman knows well enough, if he looks at the facts he will find that it is incontestable&#x2014;I say this slowly so that perhaps he will understand&#x2014;that the higher echelons of the judiciary are hopelessly unrepresentative. They are representative simply of a tiny, very wealthy, very privileged elite. In a democracy that cannot go on indefinitely. It cannot inspire confidence among the population as a whole.<br/>
When I look to the judiciary to safeguard my rights or the rights of my constituents, although the House has many limitations, as have legislatures generally, I much prefer to see those rights cared for by the proceedings of Parliament with all its faults than in the higher echelons of the judiciary.</p>

<p>I have spoken for long enough and should come to a conclusion.<br/>
If legislation were introduced to construct a legislature like the House of Commons, we should be terrified of what we were doing. The opposition would go on indefinitely, because to give such a body the powers that the House has would be a terrifying prospect. There is no limit to what we can do. There is nothing to stop the House declaring the Conservative Party illegal or extending its own life for 100 years, indefinitely or for whatever period might seem convenient.<br/>
In theory, at least, we should be very fearful about entrusting the rights of the people of this country or anyone else to a legislature unchecked as the House of Commons is. But I believe that in practice it has been checked and is checked, that in practice the country's culture and history have meant that there are fairly well recognised boundaries within which the House operates, fairly well recognised rights which the House preserves. At the end of the day the public have the right to remove hon. Members and change the composition of the House, whereas they have no such right with regard to the judiciary.<br/>
Therefore, I much prefer to see my rights enshrined in decisions of the House, not the higher courts, and


accordingly I hope that the clause will be rejected.</p>

<p>This has already been a stimulating and instructive debate. The hon. Member for Cleveland and Whitby (Mr. Brittan) is to be congratulated both on raising the matter and on the way in which he did it. The debate looks like being a good ending to what has been in the main a good-humoured and interesting Committee stage.<br/>
From the Liberal point of view the question is not whether a Bill of Rights is acceptable <i>per se</i> but whether it is appropriate to introduce the change in this Bill. I want to concentrate on that matter rather than on the more basic question whether a Bill of Rights is a good thing to have. The hon. Members for Manchester, Withington (Mr. Silvester) and Lichfield and Tamworth (Mr. Grocott) concentrated on that, but we know that there are in the House strong&#x2014;I will not use the word "intransigent"&#x2014;opponents of that concept. They say, as did the hon. Member for Withington, that it is better that human rights are protected in this place or in an Assembly rather than that they be protected by X number of judges, possibly, as he said, "of a cultural and other background perhaps different from our own", making judgments.<br/>
We on the Liberal Bench do not accept that. That is perhaps most simply evidenced by the fact that two attempts at a Bill of Rights have been made from this Bench, one by my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Montgomery (Mr. Hooson) and one by my hon. Friend the Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) under the Ten Minutes Rule, the latter being entirely based on the European Convention on Human Rights. There is also the Bill currently being considered by a Select Committee in the House of Lords&#x2014;a Bill introduced by my noble Friend. Lord Wade.<br/>
With all respect to the hon. Member for Lichfield and Tamworth, I do not think that we advance the argument by hurling generalised abuse at the judiciary, as the hon. Gentleman did, without very much specific justification. I am prepared to listen to any amount of specific justification for anything, but I become bored by generalised abuse. I deeply suspect

people who state that anything is absolutely incontestable, as the hon. Gentleman did. As a politician and a Liberal, I do not think that there is anything in this world that is absolutely incontestable. When I hear people say that, I suspect them far more deeply than any judge, however venerable he may be.<br/>
I return to the issue whether we should enshrine a Bill of Rights in this Bill. Essentially the arguments against such a proposition&#x2014;I dare say that the Minister of State will develop this later&#x2014;have to a degree already been tackled by the hon. Member for Cleveland and Whitby. They are, first, that it would not be sensible or wise that there should be a Bill of Rights in Scotland and not in the rest of the United Kingdom; secondly, that the matter is under discussion in the Select Committee of the House of Lords; and, thirdly, that there is the Government's consultative document.<br/>
Let us take the first argument&#x2014;that it is wrong to take a step of this kind in Scotland alone. We are essentially bringing into Scottish domestic law the European Convention of Human Rights. It is not a question of changing the law. The law is to be the same. It is a question of the recourse of the litigant being different, so that in Scotland&#x2014;I assume that this is right, although I am not a lawyer&#x2014;the Scotsman or Scotswoman would be able to go to the Scottish courts and the European Court, whereas if the litigant were resident in England or Wales he would be able to go only to the European Court, because the convention is not, as yet, enshrined in domestic law.</p>

<p>It is fair to say that there would be a further difference. The activities of the United Kingdom Parliament and the United Kingdom Government, in so far as they related to England and applied to English citizens, would not be constrained in any way, while the activities of the Scottish Assembly and Executive dealing with Scottish matters would be constrained.</p>

<p>That is a perhaps innocent misinterpretation of what I said. The hon. Member for Cleveland and Whitby (Mr. Brittan) knows that what I am talking about is the direct applicability of the courts to the matter. It is quite a different thing to be constrained by the domestic courts and to have to go through the rather particular and sometimes difficult procedures of petitioning the European Convention of Human Rights. But there would be this difference, would there not, that the United Kingdom Government would be responsible for education and would be under no inhibition while the Scottish Administration, responsible for education north of the border, would be under an inhibition, a constraint. That is an important difference.</p>

<p>It is a difference. I would be the last to deny that, as I would be the last to deny that the likelihood of the hon. Member for Cleveland and Whitby being innocent is remote. I do not see how&#x2014;and this relates to an intervention I made in the speech of the hon. Member for Withington&#x2014;this diminishes the human rights of the individual. It is the object of the exercise to protect these. Given that I accept what the Minister says I do not see how this represents a negative disadvantage for the citizen.<br/>
6.45 p.m.<br/>
The hon. Member for Cleveland and Whitby argued&#x2014;I would go along with him in this&#x2014;that in a political sense, if a Bill of Rights were accepted as part of the Scottish settlement it would generate political pressure for a similar piece of legislation to be passed in this House, so that conditions were equivalent in all parts of the Kingdom. It does not appear to me that anyone who has so far spoken has suggested that to have the two systems out of kilter would make all that much difference in practical terms for the individual. That is why I begin to wonder to what extent this change would produce anything very dramatic in terms of its immediate effect, although I accept

that there would be a dramatic long-term impact.<br/>
The Minister of State intervened during the speech of the hon. Member for Cleveland and Whitby to make a point which I did not quite understand. If I mention it now he may clarify the matter later. The Minister told the hon. Gentleman, in a somewhat critical fashion, that he was not introducing a Bill of Rights but simply introducing the European Convention of Human Rights into Scottish domestic law. I did not follow that intervention or the point of the argument since the European Convention of Human Rights is a Bill of Rights. The fact is that the Conservative Front Bench has decided that it was the best and simplest thing to adopt an existing and agreed Bill of Rights and apply it to Scotland. That is, as the Minister knows, the same approach that we adopted in discussions with the Labour Government on this matter.</p>

<p>What I was putting to the hon. Member for Cleveland and Whitby (Mr. Brittan) was that it might, perhaps, be better if a Bill of Rights were specifically designed to deal with the Scottish situation. I wonder whether it is appropriate to take the European Convention for Scotland only and prohibit the Assembly from introducing slavery, which is an unlikely event, given the responsibilities which the Assembly has for such things as education, housing and health.</p>

<p>With all respects to the Minister&#x2014;and I do respect him&#x2014;I do not see that Bills of Rights are meant to be specially applicable to particular groups. There are basic universal human rights. Even if it is not a common thing to have slavery in Scotland, I am not at all satisfied that there is any reason why it should be excluded from a Bill of Rights for Scotland or the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>Perhaps the hon. Member would consider the point that, post-devolution, some parts of the government of Scotland will be dealt with by the Assembly&#x2014;education, housing, and the like&#x2014;while other parts will be dealt with by the United Kingdom Government and Parliament&#x2014;trade, the economy, industrial relations, and the like. To introduce a Bill of Rights in this form merely offers protection in respect of the devolved subjects and does not cover the whole range of government in Scotland. Would it not be better, if we are moving to a Bill of Rights, to do the whole thing at one time for the United Kingdom and to put all citizens in the same position with respect to any so-called protection which is given?</p>

<p>That is the nub argument&#x2014;that we should not do it in one part of the United Kingdom but rather should apply it throughout the whole of the kingdom. As a variant of the central argument, the counter argument to that surely is that this matter has been discussed for some time and that to have it enshrined in legislation incontestibly&#x2014;that is a proper use of the word&#x2014;produces the political motive force for something actually to be done in the remainder of the United Kingdom. That surely is an argument for such a concept for those who favour a Bill of Rights as such.</p>

<p>Is not the force of the Minister of State's argument that perhaps it is not the best way to introduce such a thing to introduce it in only part of the United Kingdom rather than in the United Kingdom as a whole? When one is considering how to vote on this issue, if the Minister were to say that it was the intention of the Government to introduce such a provision for the country as a whole, one might well think this amendment to be an inadequate provision. It would be helpful if the Minister could enlighten us about the position of the Government.</p>

<p>That point is extremely well made. For those who favour a Bill of Rights as such and are anxious to see such a measure incorporated in the law of the United Kingdom, it would be better if it were to be so incorporated rather than done in a partial way. I sympathise with the hon. Member for

Aylesbury (Mr. Raison), but I doubt whether the Minister is in a position to give the sort of assurance he asks for.</p>

<p>The position of the Government on the question whether the convention should be incorporated into domestic law in the United Kingdom is that the question is still under consideration. A discussion paper has been issued, and the matter is being discussed by a Select Committee of the House of Lords. The hon. Gentleman would not expect any Government to come to a conclusion in advance of any of those considerations.</p>

<p>As I have said, the fact that Governments discuss things is not a major reassurance to me.<br/>
It has been said that the Assembly could introduce a Bill of Rights itself if it were so minded. I do not think that that is an argument particularly one way or the other. It is simply a statement of what power the Assembly has. But if it is contested that there might be a likelihood of the Assembly introducing one, I would have thought that to do it at once might be a better course of action.<br/>
From the Liberal point of view, one of the favourable aspects of including Amendment No. 557 would be that it would provide one of the essentials of a federal approach which is a framework of legal protection for human rights and which, to us, is a logical and sensible thing to do and paves the way for further improvement to the Bill. I shall be inclined to support the amendment unless the Minister can produce more pertinent arguments against it than I have heard so far. It is not enough to say that the matter is under discussion, that it would be better to do everything at once, and so on. I think that the opportunity for Scotland to lead in this matter is one that we should not dismiss lightly.</p>

<p>I apologise for having had to leave the debate for a brief period, thereby missing a couple of speeches.<br/>
Like the hon. Member for Inverness (Mr. Johnston), I make no complaint about the way this subject has been introduced. Although it is taking up a fair amount of time, it is an important subject and I welcome the debate, but for different reasons from those of the Conservatives. I am basically opposed to a written constitution and to a Bill of


Rights. My contribution to the Scotland Bill would have been New Clause 2, but, unfortunately, it was not selected. By implication, therefore, I accept that the House of Commons should impose limitations and restrictions and conditions on the way the Assembly operates. My view is all laid out in New Clause 2 for anyone to read.<br/>
I put down New Clause 2 for the same reasons and motives as the hon. Member for Cleveland and Whitby (Mr. Brittan) spoke of this subject; that is to say, I regarded it as the thin end of the wedge in the United Kingdom. I am aware of the argument that my hon. Friend the Minister of State may use. He may take up the point I made in an earlier intervention, that it may be possible for the Assembly to legislate a Bill of Rights of sorts for its own domestic purposes. In the same way, he would have met my argument on New Clause 2, that the Scottish Assembly should legislate for greater access to official documents by the Scottish electorate.<br/>
The details of the proposed Bill of Rights in Amendment No. 557, the related new schedule, concern me. I shall not go into detail, but there are certain contradictions in it. I am not clear, for example, whether Amendment No. 557 is an exact replica, without any additions other than references to Scotland, of the European Convention.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1978-02-01a.537.0" hansard_membership_id="1643" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/11535" speakername="Mr. Brittan" colnum="537" time="">
<p>The answer to that is "Yes". A few changes in wording have been made in order to include the word "Scotland". Also, one or two articles in the convention are not included because they relate to matters so plainly outside the powers of the Assembly and the Executive that there would be no point in putting them in. There are in it some points that are probably outside the powers anyway, but I do not think that that matters. There is nothing added from any source other than the European Convention.</p>

<p>There is an anomaly in Article 10. Several times in the House over the last four years we have debated industrial relations legislation, particularly as it affects the individual problems of trade unions. We have heard constant reiteration by the Tories that there should be a right not to belong to a union, just

as there is a right to belong. Indeed, that was incorporated in the Industrial Relations Act 1971.<br/>
I therefore had a wry smile when I read Article 10, which says that there shall be
<q>the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and to freedom of association with others, including the right to form and to join trade unions&#x2026;".</q>
There is no mention there of a right not to belong. I could not believe that the Tory Party, having raised these fundamental human rights matters in the amendment, had not taken the opportunity to put in the right not to belong to a union.</p>

<p>I refer the hon. Gentleman to Article 8, which says:
<q>Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion".</q>
The hon. Gentleman will recollect that it was the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Amendment) Act that removed the conscience clause which used to exist lot those who did not want to join a union. The hon. Gentleman has made a valid point. I would have expected my right hon. and hon. Friends to have that in mind when they included Article 8.</p>

<p>With respect, I do not think that that meets the point. If the new schedule in Amendment No. 557 is an exact replica of the Convention, with the few additions or omissions to which the hon. Gentleman has referred, and if it has been so important during the past four years&#x2014;in fact, from the legislation of 1971&#x2014;for the Conservative Party to believe in certain rights and, latterly, to believe that there should be new rights for the Scottish electorate as a means of paving the way for legislation covering the United Kingdom as a whole, the idea being to sell it to the House of Commons here and to the United Kingdom electorate, I should have expected the Conservative Party to use the European Convention and in this context pursue the policy which it has advocated in the past.<br/>
The Tories cannot use that argument with reference to Scotland, with the idea of selling it later to the United Kingdom, if they do not include the right not to belong to a trade union.</p>

<p>If that be put as a question, I can answer it quite simply. No further rights are included, even though one might want those rights to exist, precisely because, to be a constitutional enactment, the Bill must command all party support. We are proposing nothing here which could prevent that support. Because all parties support the European Convention and there is agreement at least on a common core of rights, we have set the matter out in this way. There are items not in it, items I should like to see, and I am sure that there are not in it items which the hon. Gentleman would like to see. Those matters should be dealt with by legislation, passed on a partisan basis, if necessary, but for constitution making one has reluctantly to accept the lowest common denominator of agreed rights.</p>

<p>May I try to help further? There is at present a case before the European Court on the closed shop, arising out of the convention, so at least some lawyers think that it is covered by the convention as written.</p>

<p>I shall not labour the point. At least we have it on record that the right to belong to a trade union is accepted as a lowest common denominator by the Conservative Party. Some of us on this side have been in some doubt about that in recent months. However, I think that I have made my point on Article 10, and I accept what the hon. Member for Cleveland and Whitby has said about his self-imposed limitations in drafting Amendment No. 557.<br/>
I come now to two other matters. I suspect that there is a contradiction raised by Article 11, which refers to the right to marry and found a family according to national laws, and Article 13:
<q>The enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth&#x2026;shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such as sex, race, colour, language, religion&#x2026;</q>
With those two married together, I reckon that there is a contradiction to what the right hon. Lady the Leader of the Opposition has been saying in recent days, and I find it difficult to square the circle between her argument and what appears in the amendment.<br/>
I come now to my last point on detail. Article 9 lays down that everyone shall

have the right to freedom of expression and that
<q>This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information &#x2026;</q>
I regard this as the most important part of the proposal before us. It was implied in my earlier comments on my New Clause 2 that I consider that the right to receive information, especially official information, is a supreme right. Indeed, I have come to the conclusion over the past four years that it is about the only safeguard left for democracy.<br/>
I cannot wholly accept that we can leave the safeguarding of democracy to the other House along the Corridor or to the courts, and I certainly do not accept that we can leave it to a Bill of Rights in the sense in which that is proposed here, since we know that one Parliament can overturn what another has done, a Government can overturn what a previous Government did, and even the present Government could overturn something which we enacted last year.<br/>
There is no such entrenched right as I wish to see. Even if the Bill is enacted and is put to the Scottish people in a referendum, although that would in some ways be an entrenchment of the proposed Bill of Rights, I should not be happy about it, because the House of Commons could overturn or amend any legislation in the form of the proposed new schedule. The House could amend the schedule, it could remove rights, and it could add rights without going back to the Scottish people in a referendum, because that is the normal way by which one amends an entrenched Bill of Rights.<br/>
Therefore, I do not regard this proposal as the protection of freedoms, of democracy and of individual rights, as hon. Members opposite suggest that it is. I want there to be a right to know what is going on, and not just for Members of Parliament or Members of the Scottish Assembly or the Executive. They will not have all that many rights, any more than we have here.<br/>
There are well over 100 subjects on which Members of Parliament are not even allowed to ask Questions, yet we are supposed to be the guardians of democracy, acting as a check on the Executive and representing our constituents.<br/>
Article 9 sets forth the freedom to receive and to impart information, and I should like to see the devolution Bill being used as a pathfinder for the rest of the United Kingdom in this sole respect, on which there is a Government commitment. We have no Government commitment about a Bill of Rights, but we have a specific Government commitment about freedom of information. We have had it from the Prime Minister at the Dispatch Box, and it was in the Labour Party manifesto on which we won the last election&#x2014;a commitment that we should have a reform of the law governing information so that information would be made available unless the law said it should not be, as opposed to the present position, where the law says that everything is secret unless we legislate otherwise.<br/>
In my view, that would be a useful addition to the present Bill. It is a tragedy that it is not given enough emphasis even in the proposed new schedule setting out the Bill of Rights.<br/>
I imagine that the Assembly will have a lot of problems on its hands when it starts. This place has problems enough, too. I am sure that the devolved areas of Government will remain for a long time in uncertainty, in contrast to what I want in the way of rights and obligations.<br/>
We ought to direct our attention to trying to ensure that the Scottish, devolved Government will be a model institution. I am ambivalent about it myself. To be honest, I do not know how I shall vote on Third Reading; but I should like to think that, if the Bill is set on its way, being given approval by the Scottish people, we shall be setting up a system of devolved Government that will be a model not only to the rest of the United Kingdom but to the rest of the world.</p>

<p>I remind my hon. Friend of a topic in which both he and I have been interested, namely, the proposed development of a refinery at Nigg on the Cromarty Firth. Does that not illustrate one of the difficulties, since there would be many people who would say that it is the business of the Assembly and others who would say that it is the business of the United Kingdom Parliament? This

is another of the grey areas. In the matter of getting information, as in so many other things, there will be difficulty.</p>

<p>That is right. In fact, without such proposals as I wished to put forward in New Clause 2, I remain extremely unhappy. As my hon. Friend reminds me, we had the experience almost two years ago of the attempt to pass through the House the Cromarty petroleum Bill, and because of other matters it was then taken out of the hands of the House. One of the problems then&#x2014;it is still a great problem today&#x2014;was the obtaining of information. It becomes a barrier to the working of democracy.<br/>
I was saying that, although I am not too sure that I shall vote for it in the end, I should want the Scottish Assembly, if it is to be set up, to be a model of democracy.</p>

<p>I am not imputing motives to anyone. Indeed, I go so far as to say that there are grounds for thinking that we may have considerably fewer problems in the workings and openness of government in Scotland if certain sections of certain Scottish political parties do not get control of the Assembly. I shall be no more specific than that, before I have the rap down on me from north of the border. As I say, I am imputing no motives to hon. Members on the SNP Bench. They made clear to me a long time ago that they supported the intention behind the new clause which I wished to move calling for greater access to information for the Scottish people.</p>

<p>Will my hon. Friend agree that one of the problems is that there are many good intentions in the House about reforming our procedures? However, because of the everyday major political problems that face us we tend to shelve the responsibility of getting these things right. Once the Scottish Assembly is in being, even though most of its Members will have good intention about setting up good procedures and good standing orders, they will tend to put it off and become entrenched in the ways of this Parliament.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend has summed up the situation extremely well.<br/>
The access to information is not only important to the legislators. It is far more important to those outside this Committee as a safeguard to democracy. Pressure groups, aggrieved individuals, the Press and the other media should all have access to information. This would do the media's job for them in many ways. It is quite true that many of the great issues which Members of this Committee try to take up come about because some journalist somewhere has been tipped off and has taken the time to dig deep into the murky waters of Whitehall. We tend to get bogged down in the business of trying to operate the legislature without proper Standing Orders.<br/>
In setting up a new legislation we haw the opportunity to establish procedures for open government. There is a case for the Scottish Assembly taking the proposal in New Clause 4 and in Amendment No. 557, and if not legislating this for itself, at least taking on board the proposals in it and legislating a Bill of Rights giving access to information for Scottish local government.<br/>
It took a great deal of pressure from the House to get even the committee rooms of local government in England and Wales open to the public. The history of smaller democratic bodies, such as local government&#x2014;and I do not want this to happen in the Scottish Assembly&#x2014;shows that these bodies tend to make themselves closed societies. It is very easy for them not to pass legislation opening access to their deliberations and giving their electors greater freedoms and greater representation. There is an impetus not to do that, and this is what concerns me most.<br/>
The history of this country in expanding democracy bears out that point at every stage. We have a great opportunity in setting up this devolved Assembly&#x2014;</p>

<p>With respect, Sir Myer, it was not ruled out of order. It was simply not selected, and there is a differ

ence. I am not talking about New Clause 2. I am drawing attention to Article 9 in Amendment No. 557 about the freedom to receive and impart information. I have been addressing my remarks specifically to that.<br/>
In the interests of greater democracy, and the rights of the Scottish electors, the very concept of a Bill of Rights is to give rights to people outside so that they cannot be abused by an elected body whether it is the House of Commons or the Scottish Assembly. This is what our debate is all about. I have not gone very wide at all. I have not gone into the arguments about the courts not deciding anything. Many hon. Members in this debate have referred to this subject to illustrate their points. I simply mentioned in passing the point about access to information because of the contents of Amendment No. 557.<br/>
7.15 p.m.<br/>
Even if the Committee does not pass the Bill of Rights clause or any other new clause or any of the amendments proposed, I want the Scottish Assembly to be a model of democracy. That is my intention, and that of my hon. Friends, and there is no reason to believe that it is not the intention of Conservative Members also. The point at issue here is the track record in the past in setting up devolved government, whether by local authorities or anything else. It is better to establish rules and rights to begin with in the original legislation. That is the whole point of passing this amendment and the new clause.<br/>
I began by saying that I am opposed to a written constitution in the widest sense because of the role and history of the courts in this country in basically frustrating radical legislation that usually emanates from this side of the Committee. That makes me very suspicious, and because of that I do not want to impose on the Scottish people a Bill of Rights in this devolution Bill. That is not to say that one cannot hope or recommend that after the referendum. If we still have this Bill, these ideas may permeate from this Committee to the Scottish Assembly. One may hope that the Assembly may take on the mantle of democracy which, in many ways, this Committee has cast aside.<br/>
The greatest safeguard against this country turning into a corporate State is


the provision of access to official information which does not prejudice the security of the State.</p>

<p>Will my hon.

<p>I hope, Sir Myer, that you would not want to curtail the debate on a Bill of Rights for the Scottish people. I do not see any problem in having one set of laws for north of the border and another set for south of the border if these are good rights contained in the clause. Hon. Members may wish to use this as an example of how they can make this work in practice and as a means of giving these rights to citizens in the rest of the United Kingdom. The hon. Member for Cleveland and Whitby put forward the thin end of the wedge argument. I do not accept it in that sense, but at the same time I would hope that many other hon. Members would debate this issue fully as far as we are allowed under the guillotine because some of us have heard the word that there is a cosy relationship between the two Front Benches about curtailing the debate on this issue within the guillotine in order to debate Clause 8. I do not want to cut New Clause 8 out of the debate, but I am interested in having a Bill of Rights fully discussed, because it is extremely important.<br/>
There are negative procedures in Article 9. A lot of rights are given in the schedule in Amendment No. 557 but then, in one or two sentences at the end it says that if these rights are against

<p>My hon. Friend said earlier that he had some doubts whether to vote for Third Reading. If he were to take part in the referendum in Scotland, would it not be crucial to make up his mind which way to vote if there were some Bill of Rights that included the right to their own government and the right to receive all information? Would not that be decisive in the way he would decide to vote? Therefore, would that not be better contained in legislation&#x2014;rather than in standing orders after he had a chance to vote?</p>

<p>I would not wish to interfere in the referendum campaign in Scotland, but I would feel happier in interfering if there were an entrenched right to know that there would be democratic safeguards. However, there are few safeguards in the Bill, and these new clauses and the new schedule do not appear to include such safeguards.<br/>
Perhaps commitments will be given by hon. Members on both sides of the Committee that they will seek to ensure that proposals are put forward if a Scottish Assembly is set up. If we were to have such undertakings then, although those matters were not enshrined in legislation, I might feel happier about voting for this Bill on Third Reading.</p>

<p>I am grateful to the hon. Member for Cleveland and Whitby (Mr. Brittan) for allowing the Committee to have a most interesting debate, the most interesting I have ever heard in this place. I must inform the Minister that my hon. Friends and I in the SNP will support the new clause.<br/>
I do not wish in any sense to suggest that I am lacking in recognition of the Minister's dedication in trying to get the Bill through the House, and I pay a genuine tribute to him. I make no apology for being a lawyer. I know that lawyers are not a popular section of society.</p>

<p>It depends what kind of lawyer one is referring to. I merely seek to point out that this subject is of particular interest to me because of the fact that I am a lawyer.<br/>
The hon. Member for Inverness (Mr. Johnston) asked whether it was sensible to introduce such fundamental matters into the Bill. That is a most important question. I would reply by saying that we have had problems in Scottish private law throughout my lifetime and there has been much call for reform. There have been some reforms, but for 20 years of my legal life there was ground for serious complaint.<br/>
Therefore, when we are offered a prospect of reform of private law we should take it, because we do not know when another opportunity will be offered to us. In that sense, although on the face of it it may not be sensible to introduce matters piecemeal in Scotland rather than in the United Kingdom as a whole in relation to the Bill, one must ask when one will ever have such a chance again. For that reason I tend to take the view that it is better to have a Bill of Rights in Scotland alone than no Bill of Rights at all.<br/>
I thought that the hon. Member for Birmingham, Perry Barr (Mr. Rooker) was generous in his attitude and in taking the view that we should make the Scottish Assembly a model. Why should that not happen? The hon. Gentleman will have the support of the SNP in advancing that proposition. The fact that this formula does not include everything does not seem to me to be a fatal flaw. It is a minimum set of fairly acceptable rights. But the proof of the pudding is that these matters have been found acceptable by a number of legislatures in Western democracy. That does not mean that a legislature cannot take the view "We are sorry that X provision or Y provision is not included, but in your own legislature you can improve the situation". The fact that everything cannot be included is not a serious objection&#x2014;although one takes that matter seriously&#x2014;because the matter can be dealt with by a legislature, and could be handled in the Scottish Assembly.<br/>
I am assisted in my argument by the fact that recently a House of Lords Select Committee took evidence from all interested parties, including the SNP. We submitted written evidence, which is available in the Library, and we also gave oral evidence a week or so ago. Let me quote from the first paragraph:

<q>The SNP believe that it is right that in the constitution of a state there should be incorporated an enacted declaration of the fundamental rights, privileges and immunities to be guaranteed to every person within the jurisdiction that such rights should be justiciable before the ordinary courts, which should be charged with securing their full and speedy enforcement as against every act whatsoever that infringes them; and that none of the basic rights, privileges and immunities should be subject to abrogation or derogation by ordinary process of legislation".</q>
That sets out our position. It is not new, in the sense that we have set it out in a draft constitution. I have no hesitation in supporting the principle of the new clause.<br/>
I was interested to hear the hon. Member for Cleveland and Whitby say that he thought that Scotland was acting as the trail blazer. We do not mind that happening. If there is a favourable disparity, that is a pleasant change. We have had many unfavourable disparities to put up with in the last 250 years. We do not mind whether the Scots are to be used as guinea pigs. One hon. Member said that we were having to carry the can. Again, we do not mind so long as we identify ourselves with the basic principle.<br/>
It was also said that this reform should not be brought in by the kitchen door. It was interesting to have Scotland described as a kitchen door, because a little earlier it was described as the goose that laid golden eggs. I do not mind being a kitchen door or a guinea pig. It is better that we should make a genuine attempt to improve human rights than make no attempt at all.<br/>
I see nothing illogical in having a Bill of Rights for Scotland and the North of England, for the simple reason that those of us who are familiar with the practice of Scots law know very well that we have a different legal system. entrenched by the Treaty of Union Therefore, this is not an unusual situation; it is one to which we have become accustomed all our lives.<br/>
Many funny comments are made about this situation. It was once said that a Lord Chancellor said to the Lord Advocate of Scotland "Would it not be good thing if the laws of our two countries were the same?". The Lord Advocate replied "Yes. But do you not think that it would be difficult to get the English to adopt Scots law?". We have


been used to this situation. There is nothing startling or fearsome about it.</p>

<p>I am grateful to the hon. and learned Member for Solihull (Mr. Grieve). I was using the word "impertinence" only because I was trying to answer the intervention of the hon. and learned Member for Kinross and West Perthshire (Mr. Fairbairn).<br/>
There is no doubt that the Scots courts are adequate to deal with human rights. It is not because we are in special need

of protection or because there is anything wrong with our courts. It does not mean that because we have a good situation it cannot be bettered. I regard a Bill of Rights as a betterment. I regard it as a step forward and as progress from good to better.<br/>
There is no doubt in the minds of the jurists of the world that, rightly or wrongly the Scots legal system is one of the flowers of Scotland's contribution to mankind. It has been much complimented by jurists of all countries. That was perhaps because, having evolved a Roman law system, the European system&#x2014;after all, we had our law evolved before we entered the Treaty of Union with England&#x2014;we then had the tempering of a totally different system, the English system, which was a unique and genuine creation of the English. The combination of the two systems created a perfect system of law in many respects, in contract and in criminal law rights. This is recognised all over the world by leading jurists. I speak as one who used to be an academic in happier days gone by.<br/>
If we end up with a constitution in which the Scots are to have this extra right, in which the Englishman might have to go to the Court of Human Rights whereas the Scots can immediately have the convention in their domestic law, it would be regrettable. I welcome the intervention of the hon. Member who said that he hoped that this was just a first step.<br/>
I have already said that Scots lawyers feel part of Europe. Our law students went to European universities, where the legal studies were conducted in the universal language of Latin. This was done for hundreds of years, when no university in England taught law. If I can remember Blackstone's initial lecture, in either Oxford or Cambridge, he said "This is no subject for gentlemen." That was because the English lawyers were practical men, who thought of the remedy and the precedent rather than the august principles.<br/>
It is because we have been exposed to the two systems that we have ended up with the right, perhaps, to blaze the trail. That is why I support the amendment. It is not necessarily true that to have this incorporation of the convention in our domestic law means that w are on the way to a written constitution. I


think that any lawyer, in Scottish terms would bear me out in saying that it is probable that if we had not entered into the Treaty of Union in 1707 we would have had a written constitution. That is almost incontrovertible on the evidence, because it was at that time that we had the flowering of the Institute Writers. They were trying to codify our law because it was the fashion to codify the law of Europe. We were part of Europe and we were following the European tradition in which our lawyers were trained.<br/>
It was the Union that in certain respects held back our legal development, because we then came under the umbrella of a system that was not prepared to consider codifying its law or having a written constitution. Therefore, in a certain way it seems to be a proposition that takes us back to some of the basic philosophy about our legal system.</p>

<p>The expression "Westminster-imposed", as used by the Minister, is very dramatic. Normally I like to agree with him, because I admire him very much. But I think that that comment was a little unworthy of him. We are dealing with a set of human rights laid down in a widely acceptable convention. I would be the first to resent a list of human rights that did not seem to meet the bill in regard to my very strongly held views on human rights. I have studied the Convention on Human Rights. It is a subject on which I speak in the European Parliament. It is a subject that interests me. There does not seem to be anything objectionable. It may not go far enough for me, but there is nothing objectionable in it.<br/>
On the question of "Westminster-imposed", the Scots lawyers developed their law partly because they were not averse to borrowing the best ideas. It was often said by our greatest lawyers "Let us borrow the best there is. If it is from England, let us borrow that. If it is from the European system, let us borrow that."

So if we have a good convention of Europe, I have nothing against borrowing it. If it is imposed on the House, what does it matter?</p>

<p>Is not the answer to the Minister that some of the things in the Bill of Rights are not devolved subjects? The Scottish Assembly would not be able to adopt the European Convention. For instance, that covers forced labour, which I suppose comes under the heading of employment. It covers the right to join unions, which seems to come under employment, and also race relations, which is not a devolved subject.</p>

<p>It is delightful for the Conservative Party to take the bold step of increasing the powers of the Scottish Assembly&#x2014;if that is what it is doing. I do not object to its attempts to do so. But the hon. Member's argument will not help the hon. Member for Cleveland and Whitby to get the votes tonight.<br/>
On the question of parliamentary sovereignty, the squeals of pain that we are hearing about the Bill of Rights to some extent emanate from the fact that this House of Commons and England, in which we are physically standing, is thirled to the theory of parliamentary sovereignty as some sort of holy cow, some sacrosanct principle. I dispute that theory.<br/>
In the first place, it is not in accordance with Scottish constitutional law. Admittedly, that was dented when we entered the Treaty of Union. But there is no doubt in my mind that the Scottish constitutional law, long before it was possible in England, gave us the right, for instances, to sue the monarch in the ordinary courts. In the early days of the nationalised industries that meant that one could sue a Post Office van, and practical things of that kind. It was very important to the rights of the citizens. It was established in England, but it was never established in Scotland, because we did not regard the monarch as being above the law. While the English, naturally enough, are proud of the Magna Carta, we are very proud of the Declaration of Arbroath.<br/>
The interesting point about the Declaration of Arbroath is that those brave men, risking excommunication as they were all members of the Catholic Church, bravely


faced their Pope and said that they would not be under the domination of England. However, they also said that if the Scottish people so decided, they could expel their king. They said that if the Scottish people decided that he was not looking after their interests, they could expel him, and the words were
<q>choose another in his place.</q>
In the matter of McCormick v. the Lord Advocate in 1953, on the matter of the Queen's Title, again it was established that there was a separate constitutional concept in Scots law about the sovereignty of the people, and not the sovereignty of Parliament. I leave it to those in this Chamber to consider which is the nobler concept and which is, perhaps, the wiser.<br/>
Again, I go to the Bill of Rights 1689. That was an English Bill, but, at the same time, we had the Claim of Right in Scotland. The wording may interest hon. Members. It is relevant to this point. The Bill of Rights in England said:
<q>Whereas our King has left the country, therefore we must choose another.</q>
The Claim of Right said:
<q>Whereas the King has acted against the public weal and has been a traitor, we do expel him from the throne and do choose another.</q>
That difference of opinion arose because there is a different concept.<br/>
I feel that the new clause is in keeping with the philosophy that has echoed through the centuries in our Scottish constitutional law, where even in the Scottish Parliament, although it was a long time ago, it was possible, on one day that was allotted with due publicity, for people themselves to come in with their petitions, to petition the King in Parliament. That concept has gone. It is an old idea, but it was a very open type of law and it ensured rights.<br/>
Now we are asked to consider whether this system in Westminster could be improved by the introduction of a Bill of Rights. Lord Hailsham made a very important speech six months ago, in which he said that the Westminster system was an electoral dictatorship and that it was time that we looked at the possibility of a written constitution. I know that a Bill of Rights is not a written constitution, but it is interesting that a lawyer of Lord

Hailsham's standing is prepared to look along those lines.<br/>
In the United States it was partly because of the framing of the constitution&#x2014;which was done by a Scotsman, Wotherspoon, whose statute stands on Fifth Avenue&#x2014;that Watergate was exposed. There was the segregation of powers. Without that, it would be very difficult to know whether the same could necessarily have been accomplished in this country. I do not find anything objectionable in the proposal. In the foreword to the discussion paper of the Standing Advisory Commission on Human Rights, which is available in the Library, Lord Feather said:
<q>No one can afford to be complacent about the adequacy of existing measures for the protection of human rights.</q>
That is obviously what all of us believe. He also said:
<q>Equally important, the subject must be approached with realism as well as hope.</q>
I think that this is a fairly realistic debate on the matter, which has raised hopes, but again, I do not think that anyone will imagine, in a sophisticated modern world, that just because one has a Bill of Rights, that is a panacea for all ills. I do not think that hopes will be raised falsely.<br/>
The rather strange so-called reform of local government that we had to put up with in Scotland, the division of Scotland into chunks, each being given so-called autonomy and massive powers, has resulted in the situation that one cannot get a decision out of Scottish local government in the way in which one could get a decision under the old system. There is a need for more protection of human rights, because the average person now cannot feel confident that his right will always be satisfied. In this country we do not have a codified system of administrative law or what many Western democracies guarantee by way of human rights. I see no reason why we should not advance a little on this road.<br/>
7.45 p.m.<br/>
Lastly, on the international front, there is nothing more important in making the world smaller than ensuring that people who live everywhere in the world have human rights. Many people cannot leave their countries. I have raised this matter in the European Parliament on behalf of


people in the Soviet Union and others have raised matters of human rights affecting people in many countries where even slavery is still in existence. The more that any example can blaze a trail in the direction of being prepared to give at least a minimal set of guarantees, the more difficult it will be for countries that do not recognise human rights to resist the recognition of those rights.<br/>
In the international sense, this matter is extremely important. We cannot forget, for instance, that in India, the whole situation in regard to democracy changed overnight. We have seen a betterment in Portugal and Spain. In human rights, things can happen very quickly. At least if everything is guaranteed in writing, it is less likely that upheavals or changes will bear away the essentials, which are in the end the rights of people before the law.<br/>
I should like to make one last comment, perhaps with a little acidity. I believe this to be true from my heart. If there had been a United Kingdom Bill of Rights, the vote requiring, in effect, 80 per cent. of the Scots' aspirations in order to achieve devolution could not have been passed.</p>

<p>Perhaps we could deal with the argument on another occasion.<br/>
I come to another point, which is substantial, and I say this in not an unfriendly way to the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn. She cannot go on saying that for 20 years of her life she resented the way in which Scottish private law was not dealt with by the House of Commons. It was never a problem of Westminster time. It was a problem of very deep differences of opinion among elected Members of Parliament from Scotland on such matters as, surely, those to which she was referring&#x2014;the divorce laws and the licensing laws. Some of my right hon. Friends&#x2014;my right hon. Friend the Member for Kilmarnock (Mr. Ross) in particular&#x2014;did not want&#x2014;rightly, I think&#x2014;reform along the lines for which others were pressing.<br/>
Indeed, coming to the present time and an issue in which both the hon. Lady and I are interested&#x2014;the reform of the Scottish stated case procedure&#x2014;my experience over the past year in relation to the case of Sergeant William Jamieson of Bo'ness is not of difficulties at Westminster but of trying to get some agreement among the various law bodies and lawyers in Scotland as to what should be done. In the stated case procedure, the problem is not at the Westminster end, but at the Scotland end.</p>

<p>I apologise, Sir Myer, but the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn


got away with it. Westminster produces Adjournment debates and ways of raising matters more quickly than any other form of government I know. The House gives endless opportunities to hon. Members to raise such matters and within a week of my asking for this subject to be raised, Mr. Speaker gave me the opportunity.<br/>
I cannot make up my mind whether the hon. Member for Cleveland and Whitby (Mr. Brittan) has had a brilliant insight on what should be done or is floating a kite of his own and conducting a campaign that is not relevant to devolution. I shall venture only briefly into the lawyer's den and concentrate on one issue, the parallel with the case of the Isle of Man. Added to the other question in relation to devolution, we now have the Isle of Man question.<br/>
The Lord Advocate reminded me that the Isle of Man is not part of the United Kingdom and that its status is that of a dependency of the Crown, but it has its own parliament, claimed to be one of the most ancient in the world, and it passes its own laws for its internal government. The British Government have remained responsible for the island's external affairs.<br/>
It was on that basis that the Isle of Man became associated with the European Economic Community with a specially negotiated relationship which appears to favour it with many of the benefits of Community membership without imposing more than minimal responsibilities. To what extent is the parallel with the Isle of Man valid?<br/>
The island became subject to the European Convention on Human Rights under the article that allows a signatory to extend it to any territory for whose international relations it is responsible, with the proviso that the convention should be applied in such territories with due regard to local requirements&#x2014;an exception which the Manx representative adopted in arguing for the retention of birching.<br/>
The British Government retain the power to legislate for the Isle of Man on all matters in the interests of good government. It is possible that the residual power may have to be invoked if, as is likely, the court rules that birching contravenes the Convention. It is more than likely that the Manx Parliament, with the substantial support of the Manx

people, will refuse to legislate for the abolition of birching and the United Kingdom Government may find itself under a duty to carry out its international obligation to pass legislation in this House giving effect to the European Court's findings.<br/>
Is this different from the situation that would apply after the establishment of a Scottish Assembly? It is beyond doubt that such action would cause a constitutional crisis between Britain and the Isle of Man. The rights and wrongs of birching would be all but forgotten in what would be seen as a battle over Manx independence. This is the gut issue in the clause and I hope that the Minister will explain the position.</p>

<p>That is very much the pattern that worries us. The hon. Gentleman has mentioned capital punishment. I referred in an earlier intervention to abortion. We are creating the conditions that will enable the Assembly to create different laws on abortion&#x2014;whether less liberal or more liberal. That is exactly the situation which arises in relation to the Isle of Man.<br/>
This issue is not unique to the Isle of Man.

<p>I do not dissent from what the hon. Gentleman has said. His assiduous attendance at these debates is a byword and an example to us all. He knows that our views are identical to his own, but if the question is whether we should avoid the problems he foresees, the answer is "Yes". We would rather not have the Bill.

it, the new clauses do not alter the situation in a direction that is material from the point of view that he is now taking. They do not make any difference to the point that he is raising.</p>

<p>I do not suppose that when the hon. Member for West Lothian (Mr. Dalyell) referred to the Isle of Man question he happened to realise that nearly 20 years ago, speaking from the Government Dispatch Box, I had the unexpected duty of replying to an Adjournment debate initiated by the late Mr. Tom Driberg, who complained of the Parliament of the Isle of Man asserting its powers in respect of birching. I stated the proposition that it was fully entitled to do what it did. It has gone on doing what it wanted to do and, with respect to the hon. Gentleman, he made rather heavy weather of the issue. It is a strange anomaly&#x2014;I suppose that that is how he regards it&#x2014;that has worked, with toleration on all sides, for nearly 20 years.</p>

<p>Of course it has worked for 20 years, but the current situation at Strasbourg is that Britain is having to defend a Government for whose internal policies it has literally no responsibility. It is having to do so in circumstances of maximum embarrassment. The experience of 20 years ago was sweet enough, but in current circumstances, with all the dissensions that have been endlessly argued in 34 days of debate, does not the right hon. and learned Member for Huntingdonshire (Sir D. Renton), who was a member of the Kilbrandon Commission, recognise the possibility of maximum embarrassment when the British Government and the British Foreign Office are having to argue cases in Strasbourg&#x2014;for an Assembly with Assembly law officers it may be that different cases would have to be argued&#x2014;alongside the Isle of Man Attorney-General, for whose Parliament's internal affairs they have no responsibility?

<p>No, I do not think so. The hon. Gentleman has overlooked that the Isle of Man as an associated State is associated with the European Economic Community and has, in relation to the Community, its own independent status that is separate from that of the United Kingdom.<br/>
Having listened to a most interesting debate, I say without hesitation that I favour the case put forward by my hon.


Friend the Member for Cleveland and Whitby (Mr. Brittan). If I may say so, my hon. Friend laid the foundations of the debate candidly as well as effectively.<br/>
We are providing for a written constitution for a part of the United Kingdom. It is not the first time that we have done so. It was done for Northern Ireland in 1922, and now we are doing it for Scotland. It was suggested by my hon. Friend, supported by some other hon. Members, and opposed by my hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Withington (Mr. Silvester)&#x2014;</p>

<p>&#x2014;that a written constitution provides a good opportunity for a Bill of Rights. The opposing suggestion is that whether we have a written constitution or whether we do not, we do not need a Bill of Rights.<br/>
That overlooks the strange position in which we are placed. It is strange but acceptable to me because we have become a party to, have ratified, the European Convention on Human Rights. The United Kingdom is a party to it through the act of the United Kingdom Government in accepting it and through its having been ratified. It is, therefore, binding upon the United Kingdom. It is also binding on all of us in relation to the EEC. However, until it is made part of the law of the United Kingdom it is not binding on us internally in relation to each other. If I am wrong in that proposition, I hope to be challenged at once. I believe that it is fundamental to our discussion.<br/>
Surely we should pay attention to that position when legislating for a Scottish Assembly and Scottish Executive. Although we make various provisions in the Bill as a result of our having become members of the EEC, we find as the Bill stands that the Assembly as such would not be bound by the European Convention. Surely that is a matter that should be dealt with at some stage.<br/>
It is essential that we should take care that no Scottish Assembly is tempted, perhaps through an over-developed zeal for Scottish nationalism, to whittle down any of the basic rights of people, whether expressed in the ancient Scottish Claim

of Rights, the Declaration of Arbroath or other historical documents to which the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mrs. Ewing) referred in her interesting speech. The hon. Lady had briefed herself so well that if I had been a member of the Scottish Bar I could have wished for nothing better than to be briefed by her. However, there is surely a need to ensure that the Scottish people keep these rights.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Withington said that he did not want us to have a Bill of Rights for the United Kingdom or for Scotland. I must remind my hon. Friend that we have the European Convention on Human Rights. To the extent that I have mentioned, it is binding upon us. Therefore, it is no good our saying that we do not want a Bill of Rights. In effect we have one to the limited extent that has been mentioned. As the Minister of State said earlier, the Government are rightly considering whether Parliament should be asked to make it part of the law of the United Kingdom. I do not see how the Government can escape considering that. They may find it difficult to escape asking Parliament to make it part of that law, but I do not want to be committed to that because I have not been into the matter deeply as the Government are now attempting to do.<br/>
The hon. Member for Inverness (Mr. Johnston) perhaps referred to the crux of the issue when by implication&#x2014;I think almost expressly&#x2014;he said that this is a question whether we have to go to the European Commission and the European Court to get redress if they find that there has been a breach of the Convention on Human Rights in Scotland, affecting anyone in Scotland, or whether, on the other hand Scottish people uniquely within the United Kingdom should have the right to go to their own courts.<br/>
As the Minister of State knows, I have a friendly relationship with the Faculty of Advocates and a great admiration for the Scottish Bench and Bar. They are not perfect, but neither are the Bench and Bar of England and Wales. However, they are made up of people whose tradition, capacity and integrity are of an extremely high order. If I were a Scotsman living in Scotland after devolution, I should not want to be pressed by necessity to go to Brussels and then to the European Court. I should want to have the right to seek


redress in Edinburgh, Glasgow or wherever it might be that the cause of action had arisen.<br/>
In the event of devolution taking place, which I hope it will not, within the terms of the Bill, by the new clauses and schedule we offer to Scotland something that would be to its advantage, something of which we should not deprive Scotland, having signed the European Convention of Human Rights. Therefore, I gladly support the new clause.<br/>
Several other matters have arisen in the debate to which I want to refer. One Labour Member said that the judiciary was representative of a wealthy elite. I do not know whether he was referring to the Scottish judiciary, but as the Lord Advocate knows, that would be a most inaccurate description of that body. Indeed, it would be just as inaccurate of the judiciary in England and Wales. I know the son of a policeman who is a Queen's Bench judge and another who is the son of a prison officer.</p>

<p>Yes, there is Lord Denning. They are great men of relatively humble origin and a good mix. I do not think that any judiciary in the world has ever been totally representative of the society whose laws it has to administer. I wish that the Labour Left would abandon its ridiculous posture in relation to our judiciary.<br/>
Next, I turn to the more than academic question of entrenched clauses. The hon. Member for Birmingham, Perry Barr (Mr. Rooker) said that if there were to be changes in the constitution or in a Bill of Rights, the people should be consulted. The hon. Gentleman maintained that when we had given independence to various Commonwealth countries, we had ensured that the people were consulted. I presume that he meant by the holding of referenda. But that has not always been so.<br/>
We have some entrenched clauses in the various independence statutes, but, for the most part, they refer to the requirement of a two-thirds majority in each House of Parliament in the country concerned. References to referenda are made only exceptionally.<br/>
Let us consider the entrenched clauses in the Bill. The principal one is to be

found, strangely enough, in Schedule 2, paragraph 7:
<q>A provision is not within the legislative competence of the Assembly if its effect would be to amend this Act.</q>
One could hardly have a stronger entrenched clause. If this Bill of Rights were to be incorporated in the Bill, the Scottish Assembly could not amend it at all. It could be amended only by Parliament. Therefore, any suggestion that we are attempting to introduce a Bill of Rights within the Bill which has no entrenched clause is without foundation.<br/>
For those various reasons&#x2014;I apologise for dealing with the matter in a way that involved making miscellaneous points&#x2014;I warmly support the new clause.</p>

<p>I listened with interest and at length to the hon. Member for Cleveland and Whitby (Mr. Brittan). I hope that there will be no charges tonight that Labour Members have sought unduly to delay proceedings, given the length of the hon. Gentleman's speech. The hon. Gentleman referred to interventions. He said that he was not conducting a seminar. I agree. One of the basic principles for running a seminar efficiently is not to give the floor too often to the more obstructive pupils and, if one makes that mistake, to be careful to correct their errors before they become endemic in the whole class. I am not sure that the hon. Gentleman met either criterion. However, I listened with interest to what he said.<br/>
At the end of the day my long-standing doubts about a Bill of Rights, whether for the United Kingdom as a whole or for Scotland in particular, were reinforced rather than relieved. One of the great problems of a Bill of Rights for the United Kingdom was implicit in what the hon. Member for Cleveland and Whitby said about entrenching the Bill of Rights in some way. In some way? In what way? That is where the proposal founders. It comes into a head-on clash with the central principles of our albeit unwritten constitution.<br/>
What I fear most is that, if we attempt to entrench a Bill of Rights in an effective manner, we shall destroy those elements upon which the working of the constitution of the United Kingdom turns.


The one central element of that constitution is the doctrine of the sovereignty, put properly, of the Queen and Parliament which translates, once every five years or less, into the sovereignty of the people at a General Election and, between General Elections, into the sovereignty of Parliament.<br/>
It is virtually impossible to find a way of entrenching an Act passed by this Parliament, because part of the doctrine of the sovereignty of Parliament is that no Parliament may bind its successor. Therefore, if we wish we can pass a Bill with a provision that the Bill may not be changed save with a two-thirds majority of those voting. Therefore, all that the next Parliament has to do is to repeal that provision to make it possible for it to repeal the whole Act.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman is right that no Parliament may bind its successor. However, Parliament can bind a devolved Assembly. That is exactly what is proposed in Schedule 2, paragraph 7.</p>

<p>I do not deny that. I have not yet turned to the problem of entrenching a Bill of Rights for Scotland. I was talking about a Bill of Rights for the United Kingdom. That may seem irrelevant to the new clause, but it is not, because the hon. Member for Cleveland and Whitby argued that it was desirable partly because embodying in legislation a Bill of Rights for Scotland took us along the road towards embodying or entrenching a Bill of Rights for the United Kingdom as a whole.<br/>
Therefore, it is proper to rehearse some of the traditional difficulties about having entrenched in legislation a Bill of Rights for the United Kingdom as a whole, not least because, if that were to be impracticable in the long run, we would be left with a Bill of Rights for certain parts of the United Kingdom but not for the whole of the United Kingdom which, if it were to exist in perpetuity, would be an absurdity.<br/>
The hon. Member for Cleveland and Whitby made play of the fact that we are creating for the first time a written constitution. I do not follow the logic of the argument that a written constitution demands a Bill of Rights. However, we should be clear on that matter,

because it occurs frequently in our debates.<br/>
In what sense are we creating a written constitution? In a way, the written constitutions that this Bill and the Wales Bill will create are again not central to the main principles of the British constitution. They do not touch upon the sovereignty of Parliament or upon the doctrine of Cabinet Government. We are really extending what we do when we create local government agencies or ad hoc bodies which exercise certain legal powers. It might be said that this is extreme because we are conferring legislative powers on the Assembly. But at any time this Parliament can withdraw, alter or add to the legislative powers that it has conferred upon the Assembly.<br/>
We must not confuse devolution with the creation of a federal system or with the establishment of an independent Scotland. The way in which we are beginning to develop a written constitution is limited. Accession to the Treaty of Rome, of which I am in favour, was a significant step towards a written constitution. In that situation, we accepted something which, unless we renege upon our treaty obligations, fetters the powers of Parliament.<br/>
I turn to the question of a Bill of Rights for Scotland.</p>

<p>Before the hon. Member leaves that point, and as the matter is of great importance&#x2014;he said "Unless we renege upon our treaty obligations"&#x2014;I suggest to him that it is more correct to say "Unless we make use of the implicit right in the treaty to terminate our adherence to it." The matter is, of course, bound up with the assertion in the Treaty that it is of indeterminate length. It would not be correct to regard withdrawal from the Treaty as reneging.</p>

<p>The right hon. Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell) is correct. I was using shorthand.<br/>
I am opposed to the new clause for four reasons. First, it is unnecessary. As United Kingdom signatories to the European Convention, we remain after devolution as before. Any United Kingdom citizen who is resident in Scotland may petition the European Commission and ultimately gain access to the European


Court. That is not changed by the Bill. Furthermore, restrictions are built into the Bill about what the Scottish Assembly may do in contravention of treaty obligations. These restrictions are embodied in Clause 20(1)(<i>b</i>) and in Clause 37 as it concerns executive acts.<br/>
The new clause would prove to be a work of supererogation. It would make Clause 20(1)(<i>a</i>) apply as well as Clause 20(1)(<i>b</i>). Since the whole Act would be construed together and since Schedule 2 would be construed in the light of this new clause, any attempt at legislation by the Assembly which contravened the European Convention on Human Rights would not be within the legislative competence of the Assembly. Splendid. That is an Act of legislative overkill. It is not necessary. I cannot see that the rights of United Kingdom citizens living in Scotland would in any way be damaged after devolution if we do not add the new clause to the Bill.<br/>
My second objection is more positive. It is not only necessary but confusing. It is confusing because if we add the new clause to the Bill the right of a United Kingdom citizen to go to the Commission and to the Court would remain unchanged. There would be a parallel right in Scotland to use the domestic courts. It would be possible for the United Kingdom Government, using Clause 20 or Clause 37, to declare legislative or executive acts to be invalid. On top of that, because we would all remain United Kingdom citizens, it would not be a question whether a resident of Scotland was in contravention of some convention but whether that act occurred north of the border and whether that act about which the citizen complained fell within the devolved powers. That would create a jungle which would be unhelpful to the citizen because it would be exceeedingly confusing.</p>

<p>There is no jungle except that which is created by the hon. Member for The Wrekin (Mr. Fowler). The European Convention would be part of the law of Scotland. An attempt by the Assembly or the Executive to act in contravention to it would be illegal under the law of Scotland. The citizen would have recourse to the courts of Scotland.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Cleveland and Whitby has come to terms with neither of the two points that have been raised in the debates, to both of which I have already referred. First, if the Scottish Assembly or the Executive attempted to act in contravention of the European Convention, it would be denying the spirit of the Bill in any event. The United Kingdom Government could ensure by their action that such a proposed action by the Assembly did not take place. That is the meaning of Clauses 20 and 37.<br/>
Secondly, the hon. Member has not come to terms with the fact that the Convention does not march precisely with the devolved powers. For example, it is pointless to pass legislation preventing a Scottish Assembly from taking people into slavery. It could not do that because it does not come within the devolved powers. If the hon. Member for Cleveland and Whitby put down an amendment adding that provision to Schedule 2, we could consider it at Report stage.<br/>
My third objection is that it would give power to the Scottish courts. My objection is not the same as that raised earlier to which the right hon. and learned Member for Huntingdonshire (Sir D. Renton) took exception. The clauses of the European Convention are exceedingly wide in their drafting. They are not specific. They do not touch upon specific acts&#x2014;whether legislative or executive&#x2014;of Government. I believe that it is a mistake&#x2014;and this is in no way an attack upon the judiciary but rather a defence of democracy&#x2014;to give the courts the right to determine whether a wide range of acts falls within the wide provisions of legislation. I think that the error in doing that is that one then commits oneself to legislation by the judiciary, and that is why I prefer a system whereby people may come back to a democratically elected Assembly with their detailed complaints which may provide for each complaint to be looked at afresh rather than trying to set it within a very broad framework of provisions.<br/>
8.30 p.m.<br/>
Finally, I object to the clause on a political ground. Regardless of what the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mrs. Ewing) said this evening, I have not the slightest doubt that there will be those in Scotland who, if the clause is added


to the Bill, will say that England is all right because it does not need a Bill of Rights and there is no possibility of oppression there, but it is necessary to put the clause into a devolution Bill for Scotland. The right hon. and learned Member for Huntingdonshire is the last person to believe that the Scots are barbarians, but he said, in all innocence, that we had to guard against the possibility that the Scots might legislate or act executively in contravention of the European Convention on Human Rights.<br/>
There is the great danger in adding the clause to the Bill that one will give yet another weapon to those who wish to fuel the flames of nationalism, perhaps a nationalism much more dangerous than we hear advocated from SNP Members in this House. For all those reasons I hope that the Committee will reject the clause.</p>

<p>I am sorry that the new clauses are deemed to have been thought necessary. I should like to think that they are necessary only because the whole Bill is of such a revolutionary character and introduces into the United Kingdom constitution such novel conceptions that further safeguards over and above the ordinary laws of the land may be required.<br/>
The very fact that we have to oppose the introduction of these clauses shows how far the Bill has taken the Committee away from the well-established and long-respected constitution of the United Kingdom, a constitution which has been the envy of many other countries for a long time. Like Burke&#x2014;I am surprised that no one today has quoted him&#x2014;I do not have much sympathy with abstract rights. They smack to me of the French Revolution and theoretical concepts of politics. In this country we have always preferred the actual to the theoretical and the specific to the general.<br/>
In the normal course of events I also have little sympathy for so called human rights, a conception that I believe to be vague or meaningless. Actual rights or duties in a given situation are quite a different matter, and it is with them that we should be concerned here.<br/>
However, in the completely uncharted seas of this Bill&#x2014;the Minister and the Government try to play down just how unchartered these seas are and to ignore the rocks and shoals about which we have

heard for so long&#x2014;it may be necessary to have further safeguards for the people of Scotland. This is because if the Bill becomes law those people will be in a different position from that of any other subject of the Queen in other parts of the United Kingdom.<br/>
No other part of the United Kingdom will have a Parliament&#x2014;Wales will certainly not have one, whether or not the Wales Bill is proceeded with. There is no knowing how far the new Scottish Assembly will go in trying its luck at extending its influence. Its Members may, of course, be highly responsible, or they may, as I fear, be not so responsible. They may, for instance, try to legislate&#x2014;although it may be <i>ultra vires</i>&#x2014;about the monarchy and about the Church of Scotland. If one party achieves power, I fear that it will certainly wish to diminish wherever possible, those links which have bound England and Scotland together so happily since the Union of 1707.<br/>
I believe, therefore, that ordinary Scottish people may in time fear the Assembly and fear this legislation. Safeguards for their liberty, which they have taken for granted all this time under the United Kingdom constitution, may be either taken away from them or put at risk.</p>

<p>Does the hon. Gentleman realise that he is saying exactly what I was talking about a few moments ago? He is saying that the Scots are incapable of governing themselves without denying human rights. When I said that the new clause would be perceived in that way by some Scots, there were Conservative Members who shook their heads, but here we have their hon. Friend making my case for me.</p>

<p>I am saying no such thing. The hon. Member ought to have been here long enough not to put words into my mouth. I was talking about the new Scottish Assembly, not about the entire people of Scotland. Most of the people of Scotland, I believe, do not want this Assembly, or any Assembly at all. It is to those people, and to the people in the whole of the United Kingdom, that we in this Chamber ought to be talking, whether it is popular or not, whether it gets votes or not. I have been here almost every day on this Bill and I intend to speak the truth as I see it, whether it is popular or not.</p>

<p>May I reassure the hon. Gentleman that there is no desire on the part of the Scottish National Party to break up the United Kingdom? What we are seeking to do is to dissolve the Union of Parliaments of 1707, not to break up the Union of the Crown of 1603. It is as simple as that.</p>

<p>I am glad to have the hon. Gentleman's reassurance at least about the monarchy. Whether that would survive in the convulsions that would take place if Scotland became a separate country, I very much doubt. What I fear about the hon. Gentleman's party, what people in all parts of this Chamber fear about his party, and what the country fears about it, is that it is using the Bill and the Assembly as a stalking horse for separation and independence.<br/>
As I said in an intervention earlier, the new constitution for Scotland is, of course, a written constitution. That is something which, except for Northern Ireland, is entirely new in British constitutional history. It may be argued whether a written constitution requires written safeguards. I admit that that is a matter of judgment. In my view, it probably does.<br/>
I am, nevertheless, sad to support these clauses. In general I do not believe in vague, general human rights, but in the new dispensation that may affect Scotland I believe that further safeguards may be necessary. It is with some sadness, therefore, that I shall go into the Division Lobby tonight in support of this amendment because I have fears about the new Assembly.</p>

<p>In moving the new clause, the hon. Member for Cleveland and Whitby (Mr. Brittan) said that he was personally in favour of a Bill of Rights for the whole United Kingdom. I accept that that view is held by some hon. Members. The general principle of having a Bill of Rights was endorsed by the hon. Member for Inverness (Mr. Johnston). That view has been in his party for a long time, and I respect the way in which it is held. But there is quite a strong contrary body of opinion in the House and the country.<br/>
The hon. Member for Cleveland and Whitby put the clause forward as an

attempt to improve the Bill. Indeed, that must be the attempt of any new clause or amendment, but the hon. Gentleman also said&#x2014;and it was significant that he said it&#x2014;that it would advance the cause of a Bill of Rights for the United Kingdom as a whole. He therefore invited the support of those who favoured that cause by saying that Scotland should be a pioneer. I have also heard in this debate the phrase "stalking horse" and other such expressions.<br/>
Those who oppose a Bill of Rights for the United Kingdom as a whole, whose view was well expressed by the hon. Member for Manchester, Withington (Mr. Silvester), will not be attracted by the argument that they should support an amendment to the Bill on the ground that it will advance the cause of a Bill of Rights for the United Kingdom as a whole. That is a fundamental matter which has been considered and is being considered by a Select Committee of the House of Lords. There are arguments on both sides of the matter.<br/>
I do not think that it would be wise to come to a decision on whether there should be a Bill of Rights for the United Kingdom as a whole substantially within the context of a Bill creating a devolved Assembly for Scotland. [<i>Interruption.</i>] The hon. Gentleman said&#x2014;and it was not necessary for him to say it in the course of advocating his new clause&#x2014;that he thought that it would advance the cause of a Bill of Rights for the United Kingdom as a whole.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman is not taking it in context. What I said was that I put forward that idea merely in response to the argument that if we were to legislate we should legislate for the United Kingdom as a whole. I said that those who favoured doing that need not be against the legislation for Scotland, because if we legislated for Scotland it would tend in that direction. But the case for doing so for Scotland stands on its merits as well.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1978-02-01a.572.1" hansard_membership_id="4865" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2398" speakername="Mr. Smith" colnum="572" time="">
<p>The hon. Gentleman may argue that there is a case for doing it for Scotland alone, irrespective of the general case, but he said that it would advance the cause of a Bill of Rights for the United Kingdom as a whole and thus


sought to attract support for an amendment to the Bill from people who favoured the general concept of a Bill of Rights. I merely say to those who are against the concept of a Bill of Rights for the United Kingdom as a whole that what attracts one side of the argument must repel the other.<br/>
Many Conservative Members are genuinely opposed to having a Bill of Rights for the United Kingdom and would be opposed to importing into the domestic laws of the United Kingdom the European Convention on Human Rights. What is not at issue in the debate is whether one agrees with the convention. The effect of the clause would be to import into the law of Scotland, so that they could be enforceable in the courts, the provisions set out in the convention, to which the United Kingdom adheres but which it has not yet thought suitable to import directly into our domestic laws.<br/>
In passing, I should mention that New Clause 6 is not all that well adapted for use in the Scottish courts. Although the hon. Gentleman got "injunction" translated properly into the Scots word "interdict", he left in the middle of the clause the words "plaintiff" and "defendant", neither of which is known to the law of Scotland.</p>

<p>Is that the hon. Gentleman's best point?</p>

<p>No, Sir. There are much better points, but, as the hon. Gentleman has a number of colleagues who are Scots lawyers, he should take not 50 per cent. instruction from them but 100 per cent. It is clear that he did his best when he put "interdict" in, but he could have done better by getting rid of the words "plaintiff" and "defendant". [<i>Interruption.</i>] The hon. Member must not be so sensitive about having made a mistake. The best thing when one makes a mistake in the House of Commons is to admit it and not to become too sensitive towards those who have discovered it. The hon. Gentleman ought to allow himself to be teased a little from time to time. It helps our proceedings to be able to do that and for hon. Members to be able to take it.<br/>
8.45 p.m.<br/>
The main reason why I invite the Committee not to accept this new clause is that I think it would be unwise for Parliament to take any decision regarding the relationship between the European Convention of Human Rights and our domestic law when we are considering this matter at the moment. As the Committee knows, the Government have issued a discussion paper setting out the arguments for and against. It would be wrong to move into devolution importing into the Bill this convention which, as my hon. Friend the Member for The Wrekin (Mr. Fowler) has said, does not march very easily with the detailed provisions of the Bill.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for The Wrekin pointed out the references to slavery in the European Convention of Human Rights. He also referred to the rights to join trade unions. Those of us who have been with this Bill in Committee know that the Assembly does not have rights over trade unions. Employment law is a reserved subject. My hon. Friend was also right to say that these provisions are extremely wide in their application. They are set in very general terms.<br/>
I say to the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mrs. Ewing) that she may be putting great inhibitions on the power of a Scottish Assembly, bearing in mind how wide the convention's provisions are. Legislation emanating from the Assembly could frequently be attacked in the courts on the basis of some of the wide provisions of the convention. It is not a convention designed for the powers which the Assembly will have. A little unwittingly the hon. Member may be placing a halter around the neck of the Assembly. As I understood it, the SNP position has been that there should be ever wider powers for the Assembly, with no United Kingdom restrictions.</p>

<p>Will the Minister consider the point on which I ended my speech, which was that in a world where there is slavery, where there are problems of human rights, for instance when people are prevented from leaving a country, this convention represents at least a minimum standard and we would


be setting a good example? The nationalist Bench is at least prepared to take whatever consequences there may be as a result of such a noble aim.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1978-02-01a.575.0" hansard_membership_id="4865" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2398" speakername="Mr. Smith" colnum="575" time="">
<p>I do not know whether the aim is noble. It may be intended to be noble. I would have thought it much better, if we want a Bill of Rights to function in the Assembly, entrenching certain rights for the citizens of Scotland, to design such a Bill specifically for that purpose. Instead of that it is suggested that we take the European Convention, designed with the normal powers of Parliament in mind, and apply it, holus-bolus, to a devolved Assembly which has responsibility for only some of the issues in one part of the United Kingdom.<br/>
If this clause were carried there would be direct access to the courts by all citizens of Scotland but not by those in England. It would be wiser for the United Kingdom to deal with the matter as a whole in one way or another. To import this convention into the Bill would not sit easily with the definition of responsibilities. That has been clearly demonstrated by the examples of slavery and trade unions.<br/>
My hon. Friends the Members for Stockport, North (Mr. Bennett) and Birmingham, Perry Barr (Mr. Rooker) took the argument in a slightly different key. They pointed out that the difficulty about the proposal for a convention was that it was largely negative. They wanted certain things which were much more positive, such as rights of access&#x2014;the "open government" case that they have argued assiduously so often. I have had the opportunity of discussions with them about the subject. No doubt, if New Clause 2 had been selected they would have been able to develop their arguments more fully, although even so they were able to demonstrate some of them in favour of the proposition that they wished to advance.<br/>
But, with the greatest respect to the sincerity with which my hon. Friends hold their views, we do not think that it would be appropriate to build matters into the Assembly which we believe it should be able to take its own decision about. Little is said about procedures in the Scotland Bill and in the Wales Bill&#x2014;much less than in the Scotland and Wales Bill of the last Session. I am sure that

when the Assembly is established, the case that my hon. Friends have made will be carefully considered by its Members. I hope that it will be. I do not endorse everything that my hon. Friends have said, but they have raised important points well worthy of consideration by the Assembly.<br/>
No doubt, since my hon. Friends are persistent men, and as there are some persistent ladies who associate themselves with the general cause, they will pursue their arguments with those responsible in the political parties, with those elected to the Assembly, and with those who may form the Administration.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend is hoping to get as many people as possible to vote for this Bill in the referendum. Surely he should be prepared to spell out the details. For many people in Scotland, the question whether devolution will be a good or a bad thing is not as important as whether they will get more open government than they get at the moment. If that is to be left to the Assembly, it puts off the question until the Assembly votes on it.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1978-02-01a.576.1" hansard_membership_id="4865" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2398" speakername="Mr. Smith" colnum="576" time="">
<p>One of the difficulties is that so many people with very good causes seek to put them into the Bill. We prefer on the whole to leave such matters for the Assembly. One has to have reasonable confidence in it. I hope that the result in Scotland will not be the sort of closed society as that to which my hon. Friend the Member for Perry Barr referred&#x2014;for example, not giving public access to the proceedings of the Assembly, and so on. I hope that government will be conducted as openly as possible. It should be possible to do that in a country of only 5 million people, considering the range of responsibilities that the Assembly will have. It is a far more difficult task for the United Kingdom Government, with the multifarious responsibilities that they have.<br/>
If this is regarded as a general debate about whether a Bill of Rights is desirable for the United Kingdom, it has been interesting, but I must advise the Committee that it would not be wise to tack on to the Bill, dealing with devolution, this set of rights which are defined in advance, which are not suited to the structure of the Bill, and which would,


indeed, cause great difficulty in the operation of the Assembly. The Assembly would find itself confined, perhaps, by a series of cases against it on the very wide principles contained in the European Convention.</p>

<p>Can the hon. Gentleman give some examples of the difficulties which would be experienced?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1978-02-01a.577.1" hansard_membership_id="4865" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2398" speakername="Mr. Smith" colnum="577" time="">
<p>I think that the difficulties that would arise from direct enforcement include provisions which deal with the criminal law. For example, there are provisions in the convention that no one should be liable to imprisonment for breach of contractual liability, and so on. Such things might cut across the freedom of the Assembly to legislate in these matters. Moreover, as was said by the hon. Member for Cambridge (Mr. Rhodes James), difficulties could arise under Article 1.<br/>
Another example is Article 7(1):
<q>Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence.</q>
I am not sure precisely what that means. I am sure that it is included with the very best of intentions, but one of the difficulties is that a litigant might take any act of the Scottish Executive or of the Scottish Assembly to court and manage to get on its legs an argument which in the end was fallacious, using the pretext of some of these provisions.<br/>
The major difficulty, however, is that the proposed Bill of Rights is not designed to go with the structure of the Bill. If it were, there would, perhaps, be a much more powerful argument for advocates of a Bill of Rights. But I think that even those in favour of having a Bill of Rights for the United Kingdom will recognise that this is a bad way of doing it, tacking on something because one is enthusiastic about a general principle although its incorporation may cause great difficulties in the operation of the Assembly.</p>

<p>There is nothing that ill accords with the Assembly or the structure of the Bill. The truth is that, Bill of Rights or no Bill of Rights, if the Scottish Assembly sought to do the things which the Minister says might cause difficulty, it would be acting contrary to its powers

because it would be in breach of a United Kingdom international obligation under the European Convention. Moreover, not only would the Assembly be in breach of its powers and acting <i>ultra vires</i> but the individual would have redress. The only difference at the moment, if our proposal is not incorporated in the Bill, is that the individual will have redress to the European Commission and Court, whereas if it is in the Bill he will have redress before the Scottish courts.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman well knows that the United Kingdom Parliament has not taken a decision on whether it will bind itself under the European Convention&#x2014;</p>

<p>There is quite a difference between accepting an international treaty and allowing certain principles embodied in a convention, which is part of that treaty, to be enforced directly in the courts of this country. The hon. Gentleman cannot get away with saying that there is no question of infringement of parliamentary sovereignty if the European Convention on Human Rights is imported into the domestic law of both England and Scotland. There is a serious question about limitation of parliamentary sovereignty. One might find some ingenious ways of getting round it, but there is no question whatever that parliamentary sovereignty is one of the serious issues involved.<br/>
If this Parliament were bound by the European Convention being imported into the domestic law of England and Scotland, perhaps at the same time, it would be open to aggrieved citizens to challenge the <i>vires</i> of Acts of this Parliament in the courts on the ground that they infringed the convention which has been imported into part of our law.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman says that the Scottish Assembly is different because it is not a sovereign institution. But we should then have a situation in which the Assembly was confined by the convention but the United Kingdom Parliament was not, so that there would be access to the courts, for example, on a change in education made by the Assembly but no access to the courts about a change in


education made by the United Kingdom Parliament affecting England.<br/>
It is not desirable to take an international obligation such as the European Convention and have it enforced directly in only one part of the United Kingdom. It makes no practical sense to have different rights on that scale and about a matter which at root relates to a United Kingdom obligation. The whole of the hon. Gentleman's case was that he was seeking merely to put into our domestic law what is a United Kingdom obligation already in terms of the treaty.<br/>
I do not believe that the proposal before us makes much sense, and I assure the Committee that it does not sit well with the structure of the Bill. I am sure that even those who favour having a Bill of Rights for the United Kingdom, for Scotland or for any other part of the United Kingdom, if it came to that, would find it difficult to run both of these together.<br/>
The Bill has been carefully constructed, and its division of responsibilities is precise. Some hon. Members have criticised it as too precise. I urge the Committee that at this late stage to import this new principle, which has implications for the whole United Kingdom&#x2014;though I leave that aside at this moment&#x2014;would not be wise and would not be a way of creating effective legislation.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1978-02-01a.580.0" colnum="580" time="">
<p>The Committee would be much wiser to leave the whole question until it has been decided after full consideration. As hon. Members know, it is under active consideration now. When a conclusion has been arrived at, the House can come to a decision, if the European Convention is to be incorporated into our law, on how it is to be done. This is not the time.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1978-02-01a.580.1" colnum="580" time="">
<p>Moreover, as I have said, the proposal is unnecessary. It is not necessary to protect the citizen, because the United Kingdom Government can block any legislation under an international obligation under Clause 20. However, though, unnecessary, it has been useful for a general discussion on the question of a Bill of Rights. But I do not think that useful discussion means that there should be a change made in the Bill which does not sit well with its structure and with the way in which the Bill has been organised. Great difficulty and confusion would be caused if we embodied the change proposed in the new clause at this stage.</p>

<p>I was about to say, by way of explanation, that Section 5 of the Public Records (Scotland) Act 1937 provides that</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1978-02-01a.584.0" colnum="584" time="">
<p>"It shall be lawful for any Government Department, board of trustees, or any other body or person having the custody of any records belonging to His Majesty and relating exclusively or mainly to Scotland&#x2026;to transmit such records to the Keeper."</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1978-02-01a.584.1" colnum="584" time="">
<p>The proposed new subsection seems to me to go a great deal wider than was originally intended.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1978-02-01a.584.2" colnum="584" time="">
<p>I do not pretend to be an expert on this matter but, as a background, I think that we should remember that through the 1937 Act, as the Secretary of State will confirm, there were gathered together under a particularly distinguished Keeper of the Records in Scotland&#x2014;the late Sir James Fergusson&#x2014;many records of the past history of Scotland which had previously been widely dispersed in the hands of the various bodies or persons described. These records constitute much of our history. What I seek to do now, by way of an exploratory amendment, is to find out whether we have the same


safeguards for them as were intended by the 1937 Act.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1978-02-01a.585.0" colnum="585" time="">
<p>As I read Schedule 16 in page 79, it seems to me that it stretches a good deal more widely. The proposed new subsection seems to permit a Minister of the Crown to withdraw from the custody of the Keeper of the Records of Scotland any records whatever that he at present holds, irrespective of date, character and origin, although of course it clearly excludes those of courts and justices of the peace and private records specified in the new subsection. If I am right, and the new subsection goes as widely as I read it, it means that there would be an enormous category which would include, in theory, the records of the old Kingdom of Scotland and of the old Scottish Parliament.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1978-02-01a.585.1" colnum="585" time="">
<p>The amendment proposes to reduce Crown responsibility to the category presumably intended. I should like the Secretary of State to reassure us tonight that there is no need for the amendment, because the Bill as drafted does not extend further than the section of the 1937 Act to which I have referred. The amendment reduces Crown responsibility to the 1937 category and reduces the possibility of removal of such sensitive records as have been deposited since the Public Records (Scotland) Act took effect.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1978-02-01a.585.2" colnum="585" time="">
<p>I do not wish to detain the Committee, but this is an important point, particularly because of the distinguished work done by the late Keeper of the Records, which is being carried on. I should like an assurance that we are not, perhaps inadvertently, damaging provisions that have been made.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1978-02-01a.585.3" hansard_membership_id="6783" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/20925" speakername="Mr. Sproat" colnum="585" time="">
<p>I agree about the background to what my right hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, East (Miss Harvie Anderson) has said. Hon. Members will wish to pay tribute to the distinguished work of the late Keeper of the Records, but I am not sure that the amendment, which I intended to support originally, does what my right hon. Friend wants it to do.<br/>
She seeks to provide that documents that might be politically sensitive and might normally fall within, say, some sort of 30-year rule should still be able to be withdrawn by Government Departments, but that other documents should remain in Scotland. If the amendment achieved

that aim, I would support it, but I fear that it does not do that. It seems to provide that no documents that have been deposited with the Keeper until the Bill becomes operational could be summoned by a Minister. That would be quite wrong since the ultimate Parliament is the British Parliament not any Scottish Assembly and Ministers here must have the right, if they wish, to have access to those documents.<br/>
There is no question of a British Minister taking the Declaration of Arbroath out of Scotland and housing it here like a latter-day Stone of Scone. I do not believe that the words on the Order Paper achieve the objective that my right hon. Friend is seeking. We should seek a Government assurance that no Government would seek to take historic documents from Scotland and house them in London. That is surely outside the bounds of possibility. I hope that the Minister will give us that assurance and that we can get on to discuss forestry and tourism.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1978-02-01a.586.0" hansard_membership_id="6608" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/20058" speakername="Mr. Rhodes James" colnum="586" time="">
<p>I support the amendment, though I share some of the doubts of my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Sproat). The amendment is exploratory and, although I am not a Scottish Member, I have an interest in it becuse I played a part in ensuring that the Rosebery papers were retained in Scotland and did not join the unwelcome trend of all historic papers being placed in London.<br/>
As an historian, I also have an interest in supporting the amendment. I hope that we shall have an assurance from the Secretary of State that, with the exception of certain recent and sensitive documents, the general principle will be that all records relating to the history of Scotland should be retained in Scotland to expand the collection of papers and resources there.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1978-02-01a.586.1" hansard_membership_id="9156" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/11505" speakername="The Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Bruce Millan)" colnum="586" time="">
<p>Given the intentions of the right hon. Member for Renfrewshire. East (Miss Harvie Anderson), the amendment is probably misconceived, but if there is a feeling that we have got it wrong in the Bill I am willing to consider the matter again. The important point to note is that the keeping of public records are a devolved function under Schedule 10 and that this includes any records in the custody of the Keeper of


the Records of Scotland on the coming into force of the Bill. All the records that the right hon. Lady is concerned about will remain in the custody of the Keeper. Any functions of government relating to them will be devolved functions.<br/>
The amendment of the Public Records (Scotland) Act 1937 in Schedule 16 of the Bill is to safeguard the position of the Government and Government Departments at Westminster. The records are not only the records of the Scottish Office; they can be records of other Government Departments relating to Scotland that are under the custody of the Keeper of the Records at this minute.<br/>
It seems from what has been said that it is the feeling of the Committee that that is where they should remain. However, it must be possible for Ministers and Departments in Westminster to have access to them. As I have said, the purpose of the amendment to the 1937 Act is to safeguard that access. It is not our purpose to remove records from Scotland and bring them to London; it is to allow ourselves access if there is any difficulty on that score. I hope that in practice there will be no such difficulty.<br/>
Access is needed in the ordinary course of Government business, and that must be retained. We are dealing specifically with pre-devolution records, to which we must be able to have access. That is why we seek to amend the 1973 Act. The schedule refers to removing records
<q>from the Keeper's custody either temporarily or permanently".</q>
That is for the purpose of access. It is not intended to remove the records from Scotland.<br/>
The unfortunate effect of the amendment is that by introducing the words:
<q>transmitted under subsection (1) of this section</q>
the right hon. Lady removes the protection of records transmitted under subsection (2), namely, local authority records. If there were a difficulty of access, or any other difficulty, about the records relating to local authorities, the right hon. Lady's amendment, if accepted, would prove even more devolutionary in removing a right that is now contained in the schedule. It would have the opposite effect from what she has in mind.<br/>
I hope that the right hon. Lady will agree to ask leave to withdraw the amendment, but following this short discussion I shall check to ensure that we have the matter right. It is a rather complicated method of doing what is intended. We have devolution under the Schedule 10, and then there is this small protection in Schedule 16.<br/>
I am willing to reconsider the matter to ensure that we have it right, in view of what has been said. If the right hon. Lady is willing to accept that assurance, I shall write to her. If I find that we do not have it completely right, the Government will table an amendment. However, I believe that we have it right.</p>

<p>I am grateful to the Secretary of State for his assurances, especially the assurance that he will consider the matter again with particular reference to the word "withdrawn". It is that word that concerns us as much as anything else. However with the right hon. Gentleman's assurances, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p>In essence, these are drafting amendments. A Scottish Secretary will, in future, make Statutory Instruments under the Westminster Statutory Instruments code, under powers derived from Westminster legislation. He may also make Statutory Instruments under powers conferred by Assembly legislation if the Assembly is content to apply or adopt the Westminster code as established by and under the Statutory Instruments Act 1946. That Act has to be extended to relate to instruments made by a Scottish Secretary. That is the purpose of paragraphs 2 to 8 of Schedule 16.<br/>
Paragraph 7(<i>c</i>) of Schedule 16 deals with a web of consequential amendments by adding a new subsection to Section


7 of the Act, but it does not at present get the detail quite right. The amendments are designed to clear up a point of detail. As the Bill stands, it is substantially correct but there is an infelicitous expression that we seek to correct.</p>

<p>I beg to move Amendment No. 601, in page 82, line 20, at end insert
<q>England, Wales and Northern Ireland or elsewhere in Europe.</q>
I was worried whether, by not including the other parts of the United Kingdom and Europe, we might be denied the opportunity of using harbours, particularly in the Highlands and Islands, for transport possibly to the Continent or to other parts of the United Kingdom.<br/>
The matter is slightly complicated because paragraph 17 alters the definition of "marine work". Yet Schedule 15, which specifies the reserved functions of local authorities, includes
<q>Ports (other than marine works).</q>
Therefore, marine works are excluded from what local authorities may do. That does not seem to equate with what happens in my constituency. When we have harbour repairs in Anstruther or


Pittenweem, as far as I can see the whole bill falls on the local authority. I hope that the Secretary of State will be able to explain that matter to me.<br/>
"Marine work" is explained further in the 1937 Act. There are exceptions in Schedule 3 to that Act. That takes out the major ports of Glasgow, Edinburgh, Dundee and Aberdeen. But in Schedule 16, paragraph 17, allowance is given for the Highlands and Islands, Orkney and Shetland and that part of Argyll not on the Firth of Clyde to gain help for communications to other parts of Scotland.<br/>
I think that there may be a need, for instance, to have transport facilities from Orkney and Shetland to Norway. I have been in Shetland and seen ships loading fish to go to North America. I think that at times vessels might want to load fish in Stornoway for transport to France and so on.<br/>
I hope that I have misunderstood the object of this wording and that the Secretary of State can allay my fears.</p>

<p>Since the hon. Member for Fife, East (Sir J. Gilmour) drew my attention to his amendment, I have been puzzled by its effect. Therefore, I should like to know the purpose of this part of Schedule 16.<br/>
I understand that the wording is almost identical to that of the previous Act, except that the Scottish Secretary is substituted for the Secretary of State. I also understand that ports are now not a devolved subject, but that marine works are.<br/>
What is the effect of paragraph 17(<i>b</i>) in limiting the definition of "marine work" to places which have communications with any other part of Scotland? This was the point that was raised by the hon. Member for Fife, East. I expect that it is explained easily. Not only are there certain harbours in my constituency which have a trade with Norway and Russia but some of the smaller harbours have a trade with the North East coast of England. Will this have any effect upon them?</p>

<p>I understand why the amendment has been tabled but I do not believe that it is necessary. I draw the Committee's attention to the fact that

marine works are a devolved function under Group 12 of Schedule 10. If the Committee looks at that it will see that we are dealing, in the context of marine works, with harbours and boatslips, basic fishing harbours or those used for communications to the islands.<br/>
In Schedule 16 there is a slightly amended definition to take care of a situation where the Scottish Secretary rather than the Secretary of State for Scotland is involved. We are not widening or narrowing the definition of harbours or marine works. The wording in the schedule does not say that these works must be exclusively used for fishing, agriculture or the maintenance of communications. It says that they must be "principally used" rather than "exclusively used". Therefore, a particular harbour that might come under this category would not be removed from the definition of "marine works".<br/>
Under existing harbours legislation ports are not to be devolved. That must be a little comfort to the right hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Grimond) in the context of Shetland. At the moment fisheries harbours are the responsibility of the Secretary of State for Scotland, whereas ports such as the Clyde Port are the responsibility of the Transport Minister. Under existing legislation there is a provision to allow the Secretary of State for Scotland to add harbours to the category of harbours for which he is responsible. He does that with the concurrence of the Transport Minister. When we have devolution and the Scottish Secretary takes over the functions of the Secretary of State for Scotland it will be necessary to provide that harbours can be brought within his competence only with the concurrence of the Secretary of State for Scotland who will be a United Kingdom Minister.<br/>
We shall move from the position where the Secretary of State can have a harbour defined as a marine works with the concurrence of the Transport Minister to a situation where the Scottish Secretary can do that with the concurrence of the Secretary of State for Scotland. If that were not so it would be possible for a Scottish Secretary to devolve harbours which are not intended to be devolved by having them redefined as marine works which are within his competence.<br/>
That is why we have had to write a different definition into Schedule 16 to include the concurrence of the Secretary of State as part of the definition of marine works. But apart from that, we are not altering the definition, and I can therefore assure the hon. Member that his fears are groundless. If we were to widen the definition we would potentially be widening the area of devolution, which I believe, is not what the hon. Member had in mind. I hope that with that explanation the Committee will accept that the amendment is neither necessary nor desirable.</p>

<p>I beg to move Amendment No. 603, in page 83, leave out lines 11 to 17.<br/>
This amendment gives us the opportunity at long last to discuss a subject that many hon. Members wished to discuss earlier in our debates. I refer to the question of forestry, and, if the Bill becomes law, its destination.<br/>
The purpose of the amendment is to question the lines of the schedule. I hope, however, that we shall have the opportunity to embark upon a general discussion of forestry in our debate on the amendment. Forestry is closely bound up with agriculture. In many respects it is modern practice&#x2014;desirably so&#x2014;for both sets of activities to be welded together. They often interact one upon the other and it is therefore strongly felt by those involved in these activities that as far as possible the destination of the various powers and functions after devolution should as nearly as possible follow parallel lines.<br/>
That is why considerable concern has been expressed on this matter. Hon Members on both sides of the Committee will have had representations on the question of the different treatment that is proposed for forestry as against agriculture.<br/>
The Bill provides that agriculture is a divided function. Those parts of agriculture which come within national negotiations affecting the whole of Britain, and those parts affected by EEC decisions which increasingly impinge upon agriculture, are to be retained functions. Aspects of agriculture which can be more

conveniently dealt with by the Assembly are to be devolved. We hope that forestry can be treated in a similar way.<br/>
Will the Minister indicate whether he is prepared, after a preliminary debate tonight&#x2014;a debate which can be only perfunctory at this stage&#x2014;to take note of the unanimous views of those in forestry that the Bill as drafted is unsatisfactory. We have had representations from the Scottish Woodland Owners Association that they are concerned about the matter. Many of us have had similar representations from constituents. Although we cannot know officially the views of the Forestry Commission on this matter, the Secretary of State will know what advice it has given him from time to time, and hon. Members have ways of discovering the views that are generally held in those quarters.<br/>
Therefore, although this is to be a cursory and perfunctory debate, I hope that it will provide an opportunity for views to be expressed and for the Minister to indicate some sympathy with the great concern felt by many people involved in forestry.</p>

<p>I am extremely concerned about the part of the schedule which affects forestry, and I am very glad that my hon. Friend the Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger) has been able to move the amendment, even at the very last hour of our guillotined proceedings in Committee.<br/>
I have not heard one good word in Scotland for the inclusion of forestry as a devolved subject and, more importantly, as a separate issue from that of agriculture. For decades everyone involved in farming and forestry has been saying that we must integrate the two activities and bring them forward together. Yet here the Secretary of State for Scotland, who is also our Minister of Agriculture, is splitting up the two functions. It surely must be completely against the trends and the desires of those engaged in farming and forestry at the present time.<br/>
This does not apply only to the interests of the individual forester and the individual farmer. It also involves going against the policies of the Department of Agriculture for Scotland, which has for years been working to bring together these two parts of our land resources.


Indeed, the Select Committee which examined the subject a long time ago pointed to the tremendous advantage of forestry being as close as possible to agriculture.<br/>
We have to consider also the position that may follow in Scotland. Not only have we this policy decision on the splitting up of these two activities; over the years there has been a very close relationship between the Forestry Commission and the owners of private woodlands. The Forestry Commisison has been responsible for administering the grants on a national basis to private woodland owners. There will now, presumably, be a splitting up of functions.<br/>
Many foresters in England and Wales are surely wondering why, after setting up this splendid Forestry Commission headquarters in Edinburgh to look after forests in the whole of the United Kingdom, a large proportion of its duties are to be taken away from a body which has gained so much stature in Scotland and is regarded as being of such importance. We ought to have regard, therefore, to the undoubted success of the Forestry Commission in Scotland.<br/>
Forestry, being a United Kingdom function, is split up into conservancy areas. In Scotland, conservancy has had spectacular success in South-West Scotland, not only in forestry but also in the development of recreation and tourism, which now go hand in hand with the development of planting and the subsequent felling, saw-milling, and so on. In this context we also have to consider the controversy concerning the future of pulping and chipboard in Scotland.<br/>
These are all part of an overall United Kingdom function and must not be reduced to an almost parochial function within Scotland, which would be without the benefit of the overall integration of forestry in the United Kingdom.<br/>
We also have to consider the staff who have been employed, naturally on a United Kingdom basis, from the time that they joined the Commission. How are they to be parcelled out between the Scottish part of the Forestry Commission and the rest of it?<br/>
I do not know where the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland will be in relation to the Secretary of State. It will have an agricultural function, but apparently not a forestry function. That is a retrograde step.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Ayr rightly said that a whole host of objections had been set out in great detail by all the distinguished bodies looking after forestry not only in Scotland but in the United Kingdom. I think particularly of the Royal Scottish Forestry Society, the Scottish Woodlands Owners Association, the Timber Growers' Association in England and many other organisations which know what they are talking about in terms of timber growing. They know the snags. They realise the problems of timber imports and how best to fight that danger, but do not have much support from the Government.<br/>
Forestry is crucial to Scotland's future, and we shall have it for hundreds of years ahead. I cannot see how devolving this major resource away from the power of the whole United Kingdom, as the Secretary of State wishes, will advance its interests. I entirely support the amendment, and hope that we shall win in the Lobby.</p>

<p>I am glad that we have had the opportunity to reach this subject. It is one upon which I recently said a few words and gained a certain amount of publicity when I described forestry as a British disgrace. Therefore, I have some caveats about the amendment, although I do not intend to push the matter to a vote.<br/>
Having the chance of this debate, we should analyse exactly where forestry should be in a devolved Scotland. Let us look at countries similar to Britain. We find that 25 per cent. to 30 per cent. of the land area of Germany, France and Japan is covered by trees. In the United Kingdom, which is of similar size, similar development and similar population, the percentage is a miserable, miserly 7 per cent.<br/>
It is not possible to apportion blame to one party or the other. Remembering that the lifespan of softwood is 75 years and that of hardwood is 150 years, we


see that we can go back to the Gladstonian Liberal policies of the last century, which made it far more attractive to import timber than to grow it in this country. Therefore, the reason for our forestry problem goes back not over Governments but virtually over a century.</p>

<p>I do not think that the matter is quite as simple as that. I think that the cause was policies which made it far simpler, easier and more economic for people in this country to import timber than to grow it here. I leave it to others to work out what acts caused it, but I believe that the policies initially caused it.<br/>
This is where we must look at the position in Scotland. We represent one-third of the United Kingdom land mass but have barely one-tenth of the United Kingdom population. By every ratio we are a country most suitable for the growing of trees. In fact, for most of the types we could grow, our growing rate is, because of our geographical conditions, twice that of Scandinavia. Yet what do we find in Scotland? We find vast areas of land&#x2014;</p>

<p>I shall return to that stupid point a little later.<br/>
We find vast areas of land covered not by cattle, sheep or grouse moors but by nothing but scree, bracken or gorse. There are millions and millions of acres of unused land. A lot of it could be under trees.<br/>
What is more serious to the United Kingdom as a whole is that we have three colossal import bills&#x2014;for food, energy and timber products. It is surprising to learn after the figures I have given, that timber is our third largest import, costing a colossal &#x00A3;2,000 million-plus per annum. The import bill for food will come down if the Government's policies encourage the production of food from our own resources. The import costs in respect of

energy will come down substantially as North Sea oil comes on stream. It is not beyond the bounds of possibility that, as a result, timber could become our largest import bill. What a disgrace. That is why I say that this is an important debate on a subject which ought to be widely ventilated.<br/>
Here I must take issue with my colleagues on the Front Bench. Had Scotland been an independent country, or one which controlled its own resources, we would have had to consider forestry in the same way as do the Scandinavian countries. Our forestry industry would have been similar to those in Sweden Norway and Finland where over 50 per cent. of the land is under trees. None of us should be sceptical in this respect. Scotland has suffered in its forestry development because of industrial priorities. Taking the United Kingdom as a whole and considering its industrial priorities, we have such things as car making, consumer durables, and agriculture at the top of the list. Forestry in the United Kingdom probably comes about No. 5 on a list of 10. If forestry were to become a Scottish problem it would rise immediately to about No. 8. It would have a far higher priority within a Scottish decision-making context.</p>

<p>I suspect that my hon. Friend is not interested in this Bill if there are any arguments which do not suit his point of view. I am not talking about the central industrial belt. I am pointing out that Scotland's population represents one-tenth of the United Kingdom population and that Scotland has a third of its land area.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend is saying that, because Scotland is part of Great Britain and because Great Britain is primarily an industrial country, forestry in Scotland has not been properly developed. All I am saying is that if Great Britain is an industrial country, Scotland is even more so.</p>

<p>It is obvious that my hon. Friend wishes these great masses of unutilised land in Scotland to remain unused. His argument convinces no one in any party. I suggest that he puts a little timber in his pipe. Scotland has lost out here because forestry does not have the correct priority in the United Kingdom industrial set-up.<br/>
I agree with some of the remarks made by my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries (Mr. Monro). In this country, we have been slow in the integration of agriculture and forestry. It is not a question merely of shelter belts but of learning how to winter cattle&#x2014;for example, to winter them in the lower slopes of tree-planted areas&#x2014;and of understanding that trees can be grown and cropped just as wheat and other renewable sources can.<br/>
In trees we have not only a renewable source of energy but an employment multiplier. Forestry is one of the few remaining labour-intensive industries. Once the trees are there, whatever one is dealing with on the spot at any given moment in time, one has all the downstream employment multipliers of milling, pulp making and paper board. Trees are there, and they are available the whole time providing an indigenous source of energy.<br/>
I do not disagree with the amendment, but I enter a caveat. Were we looking at forestry from the purely Scottish point of view instead of from the United Kingdom point of view, we would not be in the present situation over the importing of timber. I hope that it will not happen in future.</p>

<p>I support the amendment. It is an indication of the absurdity of the guillotine procedure that we should be discussing forestry on this amendment. We should have been discussing it on Schedule 10. If by chance the amendment were passed, it would be consequential on a provision which is already passed in the Bill as a result of the guillotine. But that is a nit-picking point.<br/>
I strongly support what my hon. Friends have said about the integration of agriculture and forestry. It is a most important point. I await with interest

to hear what the Minister of State says as to why the two are to be separated.<br/>
I want to make a consequential point to what my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Fairgrieve) said. We have had the discovery of a major natural resource in the British Isles&#x2014;and I emphasise "British Isles"&#x2014;in oil. We are told that it will last for 25 to 30 years. During that period we have to consider how we can best equip the country to face the years thereafter. One of the ways in which we can do that is as my hon. Friend pointed out, to tackle those industries where we have a major import problem&#x2014;and timber, of course, is the one which concerns my hon. Friend. By a modest application of about &#x00A3;5 million or &#x00A3;10 million a year from oil revenues, a transformation of that problem could be accomplished during that period. But I emphasise that it means treating the United Kingdom forestry estate as a whole, regarding it as a whole, and giving it the same incentives and the same provisions.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend has made a most important point. Recently in Scotland, one of the major international oil producers asked whether it could help Britain by investing money that it was getting out of oil in a renewable source.

<p>I take the point. Here we have an opportunity to turn the situation round. But if we have provisions for timber in Scotland different from those in England and in Wales, the situation will be far more difficult. I pay warm tribute to what the Forestry Commission has done. I am not among those who want to see it curtailed or abolished. It has provided a very fine partnership with private woodland on the one hand and State operation on the other. Under these provisions of the Bill, that situation stands in jeopardy.</p>

<p>I said that it could be worse. Why should we run our heads


into this noose? We are not trying to do it with agriculture, but we are with forestry. We could leave land tenure as a devolved subject, as it is in agriculture, but why forestry? I say again that it could happen, although it need not. Why make it possible for it to happen? That is why I warmly support the amendment.</p>

<p>The courageous and powerful speech by the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Fairgrieve) has stated the position correctly in regard to forestry. Scotland possesses the land, it possesses the capability, it possesses a lot of the skills, and I do not take the pessimistic view expressed by the hon. Member for Buckingham (Mr. Benyon) that any change would be for the worse.<br/>
The very fact that the land is available and the resources are there must mean that forestry will be given far more attention. In this short debate, I shall not go into the reasons why forestry has not developed faster in Scotland, but, as the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West said, our import bill for timber must be one of the weakest points in economic planning within the United Kingdom. It is an import which could have been stopped, or at least reduced, with benefit to the balance of payments, had forestry been encouraged.<br/>
I am sure that as time goes by forestry and wood products of all kinds, including pulp, will become progressively more valuable, and as a world resource wood will become scarcer, so that forestry will grow in importance.<br/>
In my view, the Government should be given credit for deciding to devolve forestry to the Scottish Assembly, and I hope that the hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger) will have the grace to withdraw his amendment. However, at the hinner end of this Committee stage, I take the opportunity of thanking him for giving us the opportunity to have a brief but useful debate on this important subject.</p>

<p>I had not intended to speak until I heard what my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Fairgrieve) said. I represent a Glasgow constituency. My hon. Friend, whose views I cannot share, represents a constituency to the north of me, in Aber

deenshire. My hon. Friend the Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger), who moved the amendment, represents a constituency in the south of Ayrshire.<br/>
Let me make clear at the outset that I agree with all that my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeenshire, West said about the importance of forestry. I am very much in favour of forestry. As he said, it offers us a way of saving on our import bill. On all those matters I agree. I differ from him, however, in his explanation of why there is less forestry in the whole of the United Kingdom and in Scotland than there might be. It has nothing to do with his suggested English connection that forestry is not as big in Scotland as it might be.</p>

<p>It has nothing to do with what my hon. Friend is getting at, either. It is a question of the geography and geology of the United Kingdom land mass. Let my hon. Friend look at the climate and see where the suitable areas are. I do not suggest that trees could be grown in vast numbers in England. It does not fit in.</p>

<p>It does not fit in? It fits in with almost every part of England. It fits in very well with certain parts of England, with certain parts of Ireland and with certain parts of Wales. For that reason, because it fits in very well with different parts of the United Kingdom, I agree firmly with my hon. Friend the Member for Ayr. I hope that my hon. Friend will not listen to the blandishments of the Scottish nationalists and ask leave to withdraw his amendment.<br/>
The two uses of land, forestry and farming, go together. The practical forester and the practical farmer do not want to deal with two different Departments. They want to deal with one, and they want it all done on a United Kingdom basis, as my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham (Mr. Benyon) said.<br/>
I hope that the Minister will explain in practical terms why he has decided to split the two and give the forestry responsibility to the Assembly instead of leaving it on a United Kingdom basis, where it has done so well.</p>

<p>As my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham (Mr. Ben-yon) said, we should have been discussing this on Group 15 on Schedule 10. The reason why we did not is that the Scottish National Party put down a lot of frivolous amendments to Part I and prevented the whole of the rest of Schedule 10 from being discussed at all.

<p>I have made a few short contributions to this debate. There is no justification for that allegation.<br/>
I want to underline what my hon. Friends have said about the importance of forestry. What sticks out a mile, apart from our dependence on timber imports, which is one of our biggest burdens now that we have our own oil resources, is the fact that the timber we import comes mostly from the Communist world. We put ourselves at very great risk. We could find ourselves in the same situation as we were in during the oil crisis. If the Communist bloc decides not to fell any more trees and to hold up supplies because it will get more money in five, 10 or 15 years' time, this will increase considerably the amount of money that we have to spend.<br/>
We need to know the workings of forestry under devolution. Paragraph 20(2) of Schedule 16 says that any power of the Forestry Commissioners to make regulations includes power to make separate provisions for Scotland. Does this mean that with the devolved power of forestry, it will be possible to have different levels of maintenance and plant

ing grants in Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom? Or is it just a form of words which says that the forestry powers devolved will apply to felling licences and amenity rather than the nitty gritty of actual financial work?<br/>
Most hon. Members will agree that the thing that makes the difference between whether people plant trees this year, next year or the year after is the impact of taxes. I understand that tax-paying powers will not be devolved. Therefore, it is presumably true that the whole financial aspect of forestry is still controlled by this House. I hope that the Minister of State, when he replies will tell us that the Secretary of State will still be the forestry Minister for Scotland and that we shall be able to put questions to him.<br/>
It is easy enough to devolve forestry, but it is not clear what the powers will be. I imagine that because neither agriculture nor fishing is to be devolved to the Assembly, having already been devolved to the EEC, if the EEC produces a forestry regime which this country accepts and adopts, we would have to claw back from the Scottish Assembly anything to do with forestry because we would be devolving it to the EEC.<br/>
10.15 p.m.<br/>
I hope that the Minister will be able to answer this point. It relates to the set-back that we have experienced in forest-planting in past years. This has been due entirely to fiscal measures taken by the Labour Government. I am glad to see that the Government have seen the error of their ways. They have set up a committee which we hope will alleviate the difficulties. I believe that confidence is returning to those who are engaged in planting and that we can look forward with some confidence to the future. However, the matter still resides with the House of Commons.<br/>
I should like to have an explanation from the Minister of State on how the responsibilities for forestry are to be split between this House and the Assembly. Will he say which powers will be granted to the Assembly and which will remain with this House? I hope that the Minister will be able to give an explanation because the action we shall take on this amendment will depend upon his reply.</p>

<p>I regret that I missed the first part of the debate on forestry, but I should like to make one or two points on this amendment.<br/>
It appears that many of the officials who work for the Forestry Commission and who reside in my constituency would prefer to see an integrated forestry policy throughout the United Kingdom. It will be appreciated that those officials are not allowed to put forward their views because they are civil servants, but I am sure that the Committee will agree that there is no reason why I should not undertake that task for them.<br/>
There are others in my constituency who are engaged in the forestry business. One gentleman, a Mr. D. B. Crawford, has a small business connected with forestry and he has written a long treatise on the subject. He said in part of his remarks:
<q>To maximise the production of food and wood in Britain, there must be a British integrated land use policy which takes fully into account both the problems and the potential of each of the three countries. This means in practical terms a uniform total strategy, and a relatively uniform system of grant aid and taxation.</q>
There is a fear that while the EEC is working towards a common policy on forestry, this will be made more difficult if forestry matters are devolved to Scotland. There is a tremendous potential for forestry in Scotland. The Committee may be interested to know that 44 per cent. of forests in the United Kingdom are in Scotland, and the potential for development is primarily in Scotland. That is why the headquarters of the Forestry Commission has been kept in Scotland. Therefore, it must be recognised that a great deal of administrative devolution has already taken place.<br/>
I also wish to put on record the views of the Scottish Woodland Owners Association. That association is against devolution in respect of forestry. It says:
<q>With Britain so heavily dependent upon imports of wood and wood products costing the nation some &#x00A3;2,000 million a year, an all-British forest policy and strategy is needed to build up home timber resources and make the country more self-sufficient".</q>
The Association believes that the division of forestry by devolution into virtually three separate entities could dis

tort the timber market and create difficulties in siting new wood processing industries. I shall be grateful if the Minister will try to answer these points.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger) has done the Committee a service by tabling this amendment and allowing us to have a debate on forestry matters. This debate could more appropriately have taken place on Schedule 10, but the hon. Gentleman has rectified the situation by initiating this discussion.<br/>
The hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Fairgrieve) was in slight disagreement with some of his colleagues. I noticed how passionately and sincerely were his feelings in respect of forestry development. That was most evident from the way in which he spoke.<br/>
I have been asked a number of important questions. These matters have been reinforced by the hon. Member for Dumfries (Mr. Monro) who said that since we had retained the matter of agriculture, we should also retain forestry matters. The answer is that there are special features in respect of agriculture which make it necessary for it to be retained. If those features did not exist, agriculture might be subject to devolution.<br/>
Indeed, the hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) argued the case for the devolution of agriculture on the basis that it was a natural matter for devolution. I took issue with him on that occasion because the Government's involvement with agriculture is in financing agriculture. It is very difficult to make different arrangements for financing support systems in agriculture in different parts of the United Kingdom. That is the view of the farmers' unions in different parts of the United Kingdom. I know that the hon. Member for Dumfries is closely associated with the National Farmers' Union of Scotland.<br/>
There is also a very important aspect of the EEC involvement in agriculture which makes it necessary for it to be a United Kingdom responsibility. Post-devolution, the Secretary of State will continue to be responsible for agriculture. So it will be possible for the voice of Scottish agriculture as well as that of English agriculture to be heard. That


is the case for the retention of agriculture, with which the majority of the Committee agreed with the exception of hon. Members from the SNP, some Liberal Party Members and the hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns. But we do not think that the same criteria apply to forestry.<br/>
There are other matters which we have devolved and which the Committee has decided should be devolved. There is land use, agricultural land management, the countryside, tourism and rural development. With all these matters, forestry has quite a close connection. In deciding whether it should be a retained United Kingdom function or whether it should go to the Assembly we took into account its close links with those matters. It is closely involved with land use and agricultural land management, with the countryside, tourism and, perhaps increasingly, with tourism because the Forestry Commission does a number of imaginative things which assist with the development of tourism and rural development.<br/>
But there are some features&#x2014;the hon. Member for Fife, East (Sir J. Gilmour) mentioned some&#x2014;that are retained by the United Kingdom Government. There is the fact that the tax system is not devolved. Responsibility for taxation and changes in taxation remains a United Kingdom matter. We had a long debate about that.<br/>
As to whether taxation should be retained by a United Kingdom Parliament, or any aspect of it, taxation arrangements with regard to forestry, which are of particular importance to the private forestry owners and developers, will remain the responsibility of the United Kingdom Government. That is the main impact of Government so far as the private woodland owners are concerned.</p>

<p>Would that, therefore, mean that the Secretary of State will still answer Questions in this House about forestry matters because he is responsible for the financing of forestry?</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Fife, East, if he were asking questions about taxation, would probably wish to ask them of the Chancellor of the Exchequer. He would certainly be able to do that following devolution. But the question of forestry being devolved depends on the

conventions at which the House arrives. We had a debate on that matter earlier. If it followed the Stormont precedent, I think general questions of forestry not related to the taxation aspect might not be appropriate to put to the Secretary of State because the Secretary of State post-devolution will not be the responsible Minister. That responsibility passes to the Scottish Secretary.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman was most concerned about taxation. He is quite right in emphasising that that is the matter of principal concern to the private woodland owners. He was generous enough to say that the Scottish Government had done a great deal to stimulate the development of private forestry.</p>

<p>One of the things that struck me was that we have always been able, if we are asking about forestry in England, even though it was a financial matter, to put our questions to the Minister of Agriculture because he was the Forestry Minister in England. But now we shall have a situation in which English Members of Parliament will be able to ask Questions of the Minister of Agriculture but Scottish Members of Parliament will not be able to ask Questions of the Secretary of State for Scotland. As long as that is understood, I am quite happy. But I think that we ought to understand that this is how we shall run our affairs in future.</p>

<p>I do not disagree with the hon. Gentleman's analysis. If forestry is a devolved matter it is the responsibility of the Scottish Administration and the Scottish Assembly. The distinction, therefore, after devolution between agriculture and forestry would be that questions could be asked of the Secretary of State for Scotland about agriculture but not about forestry. It is a consequence of devolution that forestry is a devolved matter, in the same way as education will be the responsibility of the Assembly.</p>

<p>The Minister says "the same as education". Education is quite different. Here we have to consider the farmer. He is farming and he has animals and trees on his land. He does not want to have to deal with two different Ministries. He wants to deal with the same Ministry. In the House of Commons we wish to be able to cross-examine the same


Minister on the two aspects of the use of land.</p>

<p>I think that the hon. Gentleman does not want devolution at all and wants it all to be dealt with in the House of Commons. When one has devolution, that involves the splitting of responsibility and the conferment of administrative and legislative responsibility on another body. It is inevitable that the scope of the United Kingdom Government is restricted in regard to the matters devolved. A transfer of responsibility is taking place. I say to the hon. Member that it is a consequence of devolution.<br/>
What the Committee is presently considering, and what we have to decide, is whether the Government were right to say that forestry, instead of going with agriculture and being a retained matter, should go with land use, agricultural land management, the countryside, tourism and rural development. We felt that the balance lay on the side that it should be a responsibility of the Assembly.<br/>
There are, though, some features of the arrangement that I should like to point out to the hon. Member for Dumfries. The Forestry Commission will be retained as a single unit. It is beyond the competence of the Assembly to set up a separate Forestry Commission for Scotland.</p>

<p>If forestry is to be devolved to Scotland, will not that inevitably mean that the United Kingdom headquarters of forestry can no longer be in Scotland and will have to come back to England, and that, therefore, those jobs in Scotland will be lost? Or is the Minister seriously trying to tell English Members of the House of Commons not only that forestry will be devolved but that the United Kingdom headquarters will remain in Scotland? That is surely untenable.</p>

<p>I see no difficulty in the headquarters remaining in Edinburgh. The hon. Gentleman is raising an unnecessary fear. I have no reason to think that the Forestry Commission believes that its headquarters in Edinburgh are in any way unsuitable. Many of its activities, take place in Scotland. It is a suitable administrative headquarters for the management of forestry responsibilities for

the whole of the United Kingdom. I see no difficulty whatsoever in forestry being managed by the Forestry Commission from its headquarters in Edinburgh, the Forestry Commission having acquired, not so long ago, headquarters in the constituency of the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton), as he pointed out.</p>

<p>It is not at all an astonishing proposition. The point that I was answering concerned the location of the headquarters. I see no reason why the: Forestry Commission cannot operate from Edinburgh. Indeed, it is a very desirable place from which it can operate, being a very desirable place in which to live and to work.<br/>
However, concerning the devolution of forestry, the Forestry Commission will be responsible for its Scottish activities to the Scottish Assembly and the Scottish Administration, and for its English activities it will be responsible to the Minister of Agriculture, as is presently the situation. In the present system of Government, the Forestry Commission is responsible to the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, to the Secretary of State for Scotland and to the Secretary of State for Wales. I know that they are three Ministers in the same Government, but that recognises the Scottish, Welsh and English interests in the development of forestry. [<i>Interruption.</i>] I am trying to deal with the matter seriously. I do not know whether hon. Members are trying to prolong the debate.</p>

<p>I have been listening with great interest because I have large Forestry Commission territory in my constituency in England. It seems to me that the Minister's position is extraordinary. At present the Forestry Commission is responsible to one Parliament, here at Westminster. Although all three Ministers come together, they at least come together in this House of Commons. The Minister is now suggesting that the Forestry Commission should remain as a single unit but should be responsible to two bodies,


this Parliament and an elected Assembly. What is the logic in that?</p>

<p>If we decided that forestry should be a devolved matter&#x2014;and there are very strong reasons for that, which I have been developing&#x2014;and should be the responsibility of the Scottish Assembly we had then to ask whether it should be within the competence of the Assembly to set up a separate Forestry Commission for Scotland. We thought that that would be undesirable, so in the Bill it is beyond the competence of the Assembly to create a separate Forestry Commission so that we would have two Forestry Commissions operating in the United Kingdom. We have safeguarded against that possibility.<br/>
That may not please some hon. Members on the nationalist Bench, but I am sure that the general view of the Committee is that we have taken a wise decision. We see no reason why the Assembly cannot be responsible for forestry in Scotland. Some Conservative Members may criticise our proposal, but I suggest that they should have a word with the hon.

<p>I understand that the Scottish Administration will appoint some members but I am not sure about that. I shall check and write to the hon. Gentleman.<br/>
The main point is on which side of the line forestry should go. We have concluded that it would be wise to have it on the devolved side and we have built into that decision a number of factors, including the provisions that there should be a single commission, that the taxation system, which is the principal interest of the private sector, should be reserved and that we should also reserve plant health, since tree disease is no respecter of boundaries.<br/>
Obviously there can be legitimate arguments about whether forestry should go with agriculture or elsewhere. We concluded that it would be wiser for it to go with agriculture, given its close connection with rural development, land use and tourism.<br/>
Weighing up the matter and considering the advantages and disadvantages, we consider that it would be right to retain the provisions in the Bill. If the amendment were passed, forestry would be reserved. I do not know whether the amendment was put down to enable us to have a general discussion or in an attempt to change the Bill. Certainly, if it were accepted, it would wreck the devolution of forestry. That may be its purpose. It is certainly not a technical amendment. It goes to the root of the matter.<br/>
I shall write to the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Taylor) about the appointment of members of the Commission. I think that they are appointed by Her Majesty, but I am not sure.</p>

<p>That is a misrepresentation of what I said. That may be the hon. Gentleman's sincerely held opinion, but it is not an accurate portrayal of what I have been saying. We think that it will work perfectly well. Some of the arrangements may be beyond the comprehension of some hon. Members opposite, but we believe that forestry should be devolved and that the Assembly should have responsibility for it because of its close links with other matters. I understand that there may be legitimate differences of opinion about that.<br/>
One of the differences between this Bill and the Scotland and Wales Bill is that the Forestry Commission now falls into the category of the bodies in Schedule 13 with which consultation has to take place before orders implementing devolution go through.

<p>Will the Minister answer two questions that I put to him earlier? Paragraph 20(2) refers to:
<q>Any power of the Forestry Commissioners to make regulations under Part II of that


Act includes power to make regulations making separate provision as regards Scotland.</q>
We ought to know what sort of regulations can be made under this paragraph.<br/>
If it means that we can have separate levels of planting grants and maintenance grants in Scotland that the Assembly passes, presumably out of its block grant, that is something that the Committee should know about. If that is not made known, we are devolving forestry without giving any power to the Assembly. Surely the hon. Gentleman should be able to tell us that.<br/>
Secondly, if the House of Commons were to accept an EEC forestry regime, would we have to take back the devolvment of forestry from the Assembly? We have not devolved agriculture and fishing because they are matters to be discussed by the Council of Ministers in the EEC. Therefore, if we accepted an EEC forestry regime, presumably we should have to bring back forestry and put it entirely into the control of the House of Commons.</p>

<p>We are most grateful to the Minister of State for answering the debate. In the course of his remarks the hon. Gentleman asked us to treat the matter seriously. I believe that the Committee would completely break faith with itself if it did not treat it as an extremely serious matter.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman's reply&#x2014;I am sure that it was offered in good faith&#x2014;revealed a most extraordinary muddle. When I moved the amendment I never believed that we would get anything remotely like that which has been put before us. I take that view against the background of every viewpoint within the forestry industry being opposed to the devolving of forestry.<br/>
The Government have apparently thought out these matters as carefully as they can. That is what the Minister said. Having done that, they have come up with a solution that Messrs. Gilbert and Sullivan would have been overjoyed to invent. It is not as if they are sticking to their convictions and fully devolving forestry. They have decided that they cannot do that and have kept one Forestry Commission. I am glad that they are doing so, but that decision contradicts the idea of having two separate political bodies&#x2014;namely, the House of Commons

and the Scottish Assembly&#x2014;possibly with separate forms of political control, controlling one industry. If we have one body situated in Edinburgh that does not have complete control at either one end or the other, a greater and more obvious recipe for chaos for forestry, whether we are for devolution or against it, would be hard to devise.<br/>
Let us consider the parliamentary side. The Minister has admitted that we shall not be able to table Questions or in other ways to question Ministers about Scottish forestry. That is because it will be a devolved matter and will come under the Assembly. However, as the hon. Member for West Lothian (Mr. Dalyell) would no doubt be quick to remind us yet again, those who represent Scottish seats will be able solemnly to table Questions on English forestry matters. The answers will be dreamed up by the Forestry Commission, which will be one body for both parts of the country.<br/>
It seems that the Government have not begun to think through the implications of what they are trying to do. I must ask them to return to the fact that the forestry industry is one industry. There is no way in which anyone can get away from the fact that it is one industry. It is serving one market. It is in one country where the same sort of laws apply throughout. The Minister has admitted that the same tax laws will affect forestry north and south of the border, and for that matter in Wales, which no doubt we shall consider when we discuss Welsh devolution. However, the Scottish Assembly and the House will have the power to have different systems of grant for the two different parts of the forestry industry that will be administered by the same commission. The whole thing is a muddle.<br/>
The Minister must face the fact that if we are to have two different sources of political control for one industry there will be different policies. The Assembly could decide, if it gets this power, to have different systems of support for forestry.</p>

<p>What is wrong with that?</p>

<p>There is nothing wrong with that if the whole of it is devolved. But we are to have it half devolved, and the Secretary of State will ask the same


single Forestry Commission to administer it in some way not yet specified. I do not know what authority officials in the Forestry Commission will have over the officers on the ground. We have no time to go into that matter tonight.<br/>
If the same officials are to be obliged to operate two different systems from one office and one headquarters under one director, with one board of commissioners appointed jointly by these two bodies, it is inconceivable that it will work properly. It would be like running one industry with two different boards of directors, two different sources of control, two different policies, two different lists of products and two different methods of work.<br/>
The Minister said that he weighed up the balance whether forestry should more logically go with agriculture or with the other functions associated with it, such as the countryside, tourism and so on. That is a legitimate argument. But it is perverse to say that these other functions are more likely to be correctly allied with forestry and to ignore the one most obviously allied with it.<br/>
It is not as though it were a new idea that agriculture and forestry are closely allied one with the other. The Minister of State and the Secretary of State will be aware that there have frequently been great controversies in various parts of Scotland whether the emphasis on land use in a particular an area should be on agriculture, sheep farming or forestry. Yet, after weighing up all these matters, the Government have concluded that it is correct to divide agriculture and forestry in this way. The Minister has failed to put forward an argument that will make sense to those who work in forestry.<br/>
Has the Minister had any representations from anyone involved in forestry in favour of the devolution of forestry in this way? Has anyone involved in forestry said that it is a good idea? I think that the answer will be "No". Therefore, it is all the more surprising that he has gone against all the facts by making this proposal.<br/>
Forestry is a single industry that requires a single set of policies. If not, there will be differing methods of work,

different levels of support and different prices eventually.<br/>
I ask the Secretary of State, in his capacity as Scotland's Minister with responsibility for the economy, to consider the attraction of setting up timber-using industries. If there are two separate policies north and south of the border&#x2014;not to mention Wales&#x2014;are there not likely to be two separate methods of attracting timber-using industries to the different countries? There will be nothing to prevent the English branch of the Forestry Commission&#x2014;I nearly said English Forestry Commision, but it is to be the British Forestry Commission&#x2014;dictated by the House of Commons, whose political control could make the decision, from introducing special incentives or inducements to attract timber-using industries to England. There will be nothing to prevent it from situating them in the north of England so that they can compete with and have an effect on the industry in Scotland. The only link between the two will be the people working in the Forestry Commission headquarters, and they will be torn this way and that by two bodies having different political control and pulling in different directions.<br/>
The debate has been more useful than I thought it would be. I thought that the Minister would have a perfectly calming and rational explanation of how he had thought the whole matter out, that he would be able to give us good reasons for developing forestry and that the Government had thought out a smooth method for administering this great industry that would lead to its future expansion and prosperity. We must remember that it is not only a question of having two different divisions&#x2014;although we do not want to go into that because of the time&#x2014;but there will be three different branches if it is proposed to devolve Welsh forestry, which is undesirable.<br/>
10.45 p.m.<br/>
The Secretary of State is Scotland's Economic Minister. What about regional policies? The Secretary of State has rightly retained most of the functions of regional development, and I personally support that. What sort of job will he have in trying to weld forestry development into his general regional development policies if he has to deal with two different policies? It will be very difficult.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Fife, East (Sir J. Gilmour) made an excellent point in his speech and again a few moments ago when he asked what would be the position when there is an EEC forestry regime. We all know that the EEC does not have a forestry regime, but if it gets one, what wil happen about the devolved part of forestry?</p>

<p>The Secretary of State must know that there is talk of devising an EEC forestry policy. The Secretary of State must face the fact that the industry is likely to be the subject of an EEC policy. If he survives as Minister for that length of time he might be involved.<br/>
Let us suppose that such a policy is developed, that the Government of the day agree to it and that it is introduced into this country. What would be the position? We should have devolved forestry in Scotland and the Assembly would have complete authority for dealing with these matters. This is yet another matter which has not been thought through and the Minister has not given a sensible answer tonight. My hon. Friend the Member for Fife, East asked that question and the Minister cannot answer it. I look forward to his reply.</p>

<p>There are plans in the EEC to harmonise many things in all sorts of subjects. None of that prevents the Minister from having to face up to the fact that there may well be a forestry policy for which the Bill makes no allowance.<br/>
When I opened the debate I hoped that the Minister would explain simply what scheme the Government had worked out for the operation of forestry. I thought that he would assure me that he had taken account of the objections expressed by those in forestry to what was proposed in the Bill. I hoped, too, that he would assure me that he had listened to what was said today and would think again about what could be done later to improve matters. But none of that has happened.<br/>
The Minister has shown that the scheme the Government have come up with is muddled. They have not thought through its implications, and they have paid not the slightest attention to what anyone from forestry&#x2014;people who want nothing to do with the Bill&#x2014;have said. Unless the Minister's second speech is far more acceptable, I advise the Committee to vote for the amendment.</p>

The Secretary of State chastised me the other day for trying to discuss tourism. He suggested that I should wait until


Clause 67 to do that. That clause was guillotined. It is nothing short of scandalous that in a perfectly proper debate the Minister has failed to give an adequate answer to my hon. Friend, and that, as a result, it is clear at eight minutes to eleven that there will be no time to discuss important issues surrounding the change in the constitution of the British Tourist Authority.

<p>The hon. Member should reflect on the fact that long interventions such as his do not assist my efforts to reply to the debate.<br/>
The hon. Member for Fife, East (Sir J. Gilmour) asked about planting policy for forestry under the devolved Administration. It would be possible for the Scottish Administration to spend more money on the development of forestry and perhaps to devise a bigger programme than would have been devised by the United Kingdom Government. It would take funds from its block grant for the purpose.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman also asked me about the effect of the EEC on forestry. I am not aware of any well-developed EEC policy on forestry. The effect of such a policy would depend on what that policy was. It is therefore difficult to gauge the effect. I find difficulties arising from that.</p>

<p>I do not think that the EEC has any direct responsibility for the development of forestry. As far as I am aware&#x2014;I am open to correction on this&#x2014;there is not a policy among the EEC countries on forestry development. I find it hard to see that there would be intervention by way of regulation or directive on forestry matters in the way that there is in agriculture. Agriculture is the one function in the EEC in which there is heavy intervention by the Commission and by the Council of Ministers. Some of the critics of the EEC say that it is the only part of the arrangement that

works. Some say that it works badly. It depends on one's opinion. The hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger) must have some very interesting discussions about that with his hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Taylor). There is that difference between agriculture and forestry to which I have drawn attention.<br/>

<p>The Assembly must arrive at its own decision. That is central to the whole thing. After having received the block grant from the United Kingdom Parliament, it will be for the Assembly to decide which priorities to follow. It may decide that forestry should be given a higher or a lower priority.<br/>
The hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr Fairgrieve) takes the view that successive British Governments have failed to develop forestry properly. I understand and respect his sincerity, but it is not just the development of forestry that we are discussing tonight. It is whether, in making this important constitutional change, forestry should be retained with the United Kingdom Government and Parliament or be one of the subjects devolved to the Scottish Assembly.<br/>
I am aware that there has been a substantial argument put up from another part of the House that some of the other functions which are to be devolved, and which are highly pertinent to this matter, such as land use, agricultural management, the countryside, and tourism, have not been&#x2014;[<i>Interruption.</i>] I have not heard the argument put outwith the House that


these subjects should not be devolved&#x2014;[<i>Interruption.</i>] It would have been quite possible for the hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger) within the context of his argument tonight, to submit that these subjects should not have been devolved.&#x2014;[<i>Interruption.</i>] The hon. Gentleman, with great respect, has sufficient skill to keep within the rules of order. Indeed, it would have been entirely proper for him to discuss these matters as well, because there is a clear link between forestry and the responsibility for the countryside, tourism, land use and rural development.<br/>

You may or may not have been in the Chair the other day when the Secretary of State for Scotland himself chastised me for, as he put it, wasting time and thus preventing us from reaching Clause 67, which totally changes the role and function of the British Tourist Authority. The Secretary of State was a party to the debate on that evening, the result of which was that we were not able to debate the matter then.<br/>
We have had exactly the same procedure tonight. What are Back Benchers to do when Ministers on one night ask them not to make speeches, so that they may later raise subjects which are subsequently guillotined, and then when we hope to have a final opportunity, the same thing happens?

<p>I beg to move,
<q>That an humble Address be presented to Her Majesty, praying that the Community Drivers' Hours Rules (Temporary Modifications) Regulations 1978 (S.I., 1978, No. 7), dated 4th January 1978, a copy of which was laid before this House on 5th January, be annulled.</q>
On the last occasion when we debated the question of drivers' hours and distances, we were given a semi-assurance by the Government that they would press for a full debate to be held on the subject. On 4th April the Under-Secretary of State said:
<q>I should like to give the hon. Member for Sutton Coldfield an assurance that I shall certainly make representations to my right hon. Friend the Lord President about a debate, but finally it is for my right hon. Friend to decide in his own due time."&#x2014;[<i>Official Report,</i> 4th April 1977; Vol. 929, c. 1069.]</q>
We have now seen what those representations have produced&#x2014;a debate which starts at 11.16 and which must end at 12.30 a.m.<br/>
It was open to the Government to lay a draft of the regulations for approval in both Houses, and I believe that that is a point about which my hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) will wish to say something, if he catches the eye of the Chair. We have put down our Prayer because this is the only option left open to us.<br/>
Given the restriction of time, I shall seek to be brief. Let me make our intention clear from the outset. The regulations allow a phased introduction of the EEC regulations on drivers' hours and distances. There are serious reservations about those regulations throughout the whole transport industry&#x2014;road haulage, freight transport and passenger transport&#x2014;and there are serious reservations about the details of the transition period.<br/>
However, we are presented tonight, basically, with a take-it-or-leave-it situation. Everyone I have consulted would prefer this transition period to no transition period at all, so the Opposition will not seek to divide the House at the end of the debate. We shall, however, examine the detail of the transition period

and, above all, seek a statement from the Government. It is worth making the point that, in spite of the undoubted importance of these regulations, this is the first time that the Government have come to the House to make a statement about them.<br/>
Because of the time element I shall concentrate on one major issue&#x2014;the distance limit of 450 km in one day. The fact that there is a 450 km limit being introduced immediately contradicts the expressed hope of the Secretary of State. He is on record expressing confidence to the industry that the limit would not come in at all during the transitional period, or if it did, that it would not come in at once. The Secretary of State made that clear in the middle of last year, but he has not delivered the goods on that undertaking. I hope that he will tell us the factors that have made it impossible.<br/>
We have today a position of undoubted confusion. No decision was available to the industry until 5th January, relating to a phased programme that started a few days earlier, on 1st January.<br/>
It is important to stress the seriousness of the 450 km limit. It is obviously serious for road haulage operators in Scotland, just as it is for those in the South-West. My hon. Friend the Member for St. Ives (Mr. Nott) has pointed out that great concern is felt in his constituency, where the main markets for local products are more than 280 miles away. A similar point was made by the National Farmers' Union. The West Country already suffers severe competition from Continental producers. Obviously there is concern throughout the country about this matter.</p>

<p>Is the hon. Member aware that the 450 km limit was laid down by the EEC in 1969. As the Conservative Party took us into the Common Market, would he tell the House what representations his party made about this iniquitous limit in 1972?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1978-02-01a.628.1" hansard_membership_id="4250" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2715" speakername="Mr. Fowler" colnum="628" time="">
<p>We dealt with that point in Question Time. If the hon. Member wants to take it up with the Secretary of State, I hope he will ask his Front Bench what happened under the Labour Government in the renegotiations. We are debating the transitional period tonight, and I would very much hope that there is common ground between the two sides


of the House in adopting a constructive approach.<br/>
It may be said that the 450 km rule could be avoided if one of two conditions are met. It may be avoided if there is a second driver, but the difficulty of that is that it pushes costs through the roof. Few firms will be able to offer that solution, particularly those that are suffering severe price competition already.<br/>
The second alternative is that the rule may be avoided by the fitting of a tachograph. That brings us into an area of undoubted complication. There are practical difficulties involved, apart from anything else. There are not even remotely enough calibration centres in this country. Even if operators wanted to observe the rule, they would find great difficulty in doing so. In Scotland there are only two or three centres, and the Freight Transport Association says that some of its members have to drive 200 miles to get to one. The same position applies in other parts of the country as well.<br/>
The next problem is the opposition of the Transport and General Workers' Union to the introduction of the tachograph. Again, operators are in all kinds of difficulties and the Government has put forward a compromise solution which euphemistically is called relaxation enforcement, although I do not like a situation in which the law says one thing and the enforcement authorities do another. It seems to me that that is the only possible compromise in the immediate future. I accept that, but I make this proviso&#x2014;that everybody should be clear what the enforcement position is to be. This is a call that comes from all sides of industry. They want to know exactly where they stand in this unique and certainly unusual situation.<br/>
The Freight Transport Association would like to see a position where there is first a six-month general moratorium on enforcement which is in line with the Secretary of State's proposals, and, secondly, a 12-month stay on enforcement in respect of the 450 km limit, although the other requirements would come into force after six months. That proposal has been to the Secretary of State, and I hope that he will take the opportunity now to make the Government's position clear.<br/>
The position we must accept is that whether it is after six months or 12 months, sooner or later the 450 km rule will come into force. Therefore, we return to the question: what do the Government advise, how do they intend to help, and how do they see the situation?<br/>
It appears that probably the only way forward is for the road haulage companies and the unions to come to voluntary agreement at local level on the issue of tachographs. This is the view of John Silverman, Vice-Chairman of the Road Haulage Association, who made a statement on 26th November in which he said:
<q>I would welcome trade union co-operation in the fitting of tachographs by agreement locally between labour and management.</q>
He continued:
<q>I appeal to the responsible leaders of the trade unions whose members are engaged in road haulage urgently to rethink the situation and to concede quickly that it is in their own interests as well as ours to keep lorries working effectively to the maximum they are allowed to do within the new law. This means fitting tachographs, for which I plead trade union agreement.</q>
I understand that that basically is also the Government's position.<br/>
On 5th January, when the Secretary of State issued his Press release on EEC drivers' hours, he said:
<q>Now is the time for employers and trade unions to get together to make sense of the new situation. The health of the industry both on the freight and passenger sides is important to the strength and prosperity of the nation. We must now all accept the Commission's decision and show common sense and goodwill in working out the implication.</q>
That is all very well, and in general terms they are reasonable and sensible words, but it would be for the benefit of the House and for the industry if the Secretary of State for Transport could be more specific tonight. Will he say whether he agrees that the voluntary agreement on the use of tachographs is or is not a way forward?<br/>
Many other points could be raised if there were time in this short debate. For example, many will be concerned about the position of the passenger transport industry. Although the debate inevitably centres on the road haulage industry, it is worth stressing that these regulations will affect not only road haulage but the bus and coach industry and, as applied, they threaten the existence of some


services&#x2014;for example, the service from London to Stratford-on-Avon. What the Confederation of Passenger Transport wants above all is more flexibility to be given to the operator. I hope the Minister will say something on that matter.<br/>
In deference to other hon. Members, I confine myself to these two points. Will the Minister make crystal clear the position on the enforcement of these regulations because that is in the interests of the whole industry? Secondly, will he spell out his view on the introduction of tachographs and voluntary introduction and say where the Government stand? There is no question but that the industry wants some guidance from the Secretary of State. I think that it is entitled to some guidance from him. I hope that tonight it will get that guidance.</p>

<p>Tonight I shall try to speak very quietly, because generally I get a bit passionate about these things when we get involved with the Common Market.<br/>
This is a very serious situation. I have taken part in many of these debates when we have not had the necessary documents before us or they have been the wrong documents, and so on. But tonight is a special night when the absurdity of the Common Market reaches new heights.<br/>
Because we have gone through these matters, the House of Commons has a procedure that says that we refer them to the Statutory Instruments Committee for examination. We have been overtaken by events. The Order Paper is always worth looking at. It says:
<q>The Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments have not yet completed their consideration of the Instrument.</q>
On 5th January, the Minister said:
<q>Five years after United Kingdom entry to the Common Market we now know the final timetable for the implementation of regulations on drivers' hours. We have had a welcome breathing space although I wish that the programme for the next three years had been more generous. Now is the time for employers and trade unions to get together to make sense of the new situation. The health of the industry both on the freight and trans

port sides is important to the strength and prosperity of the nation. I have tried hard in negotiations in Brussels to create a tolerable framework for the future. We must now all accept the Commission's decision and show common sense and good will in working out the implications.</q>
[<i>Interruption.</i>] The hon. Member for Lancaster (Mrs. Kellett-Bowman) is quite right. It is important that it goes on record.<br/>
But then, on 11th January, the Minister said:
<q>In spite of the transitional arrangements, adaptation to the wholly new legal structure and to the changes in actual limits that apply from this month cannot in practice be achieved immediately. A period of six months for `running in' is clearly sensible."&#x2014;[<i>Official Report,</i> 11th January 1978; Vol. 941, c. <i>767.</i>]</q>
What we are talking about here is men. I have been in contact with my colleagues in the Transport and General Workers' Union. They are sensible people, despite the phrases often used about them. They want to improve the conditions and pay, and so on, of the drivers they represent. But in these matters they do not want to be faced with some regulation being brought in and no one knowing what it is, and suddenly drivers in a specific area being told that it is being introduced.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell) knows that there is a very serious situation. A deputation came to the House because people were suddenly told that they would not be able to work existing work schedules as from January. It meant that if they were taking containers from Grimsby to Hull and back again, they would have to stop 40 miles short. The impact on wages is considerable.</p>

<p>Yes, I am sorry. However, all sorts of complicated things would affect their wages, and they had not had time to negotiate.<br/>
Let us look at what the employers have said. I refer now to the Freight Transport Association. It says:
<q>The Regulations which are to be debated on Wednesday evening are helpful in so far as they will allow a phased adoption of the onerous EEC requirements. Having said that, the whole drivers' hours situation is still far from


certain and confusion abounds in the industry. The Regulations, which officially come into operation on 26th January are still not available, and indeed it appears that there is some doubt as to the official numbering because the Order quotes S.I. 6/78, whereas the typescript of the Regulation in the Association's possession is numbered 7/78!</q>
Therefore, we are in a position in which some people are saying one thing and others are saying other things. Prior to the October meeting&#x2014;this is the Commission talking&#x2014;there was a threat by the Commission to introduce proceedings for breaches of Regulation 543/69 in the case of Germany for a breach of the 450 km. provision, and following the October meeting decision the Commission was directed to work out the phasing-in period of the different provisions concerning the United Kingdom and Southern Ireland.<br/>
So we go into January, and still nothing is decided. It is coming into effect now. What a ludicrous situation&#x2014;what a bureaucratic situation&#x2014;that causes this appalling difficulty.<br/>
I know what the attitude of the TGWU is. Their leaders have had some criticism from their members, asking what the union was doing and what Parliament was doing to get us into this state.<br/>
I have explained what happened. Commissioners did or did not take decisions. Faced with a position like this, late in January, no appeal could be made. Certain regulations were imposed, with the consequence that we are in this position tonight.<br/>
We are glad that the hon. Member for Sutton Coldfield (Mr. Fowler) is not going to take his Prayer to a vote, but we regard the position as totally unsatisfactory. The union thinks that it is completely unsatisfactory. If we refused to bring in these regulations tonight, however, I understand that the whole of Council Regulation 543/69 would come into operation. I can tell the House that if that happened there would be a strike in the transport industry&#x2014;a strike of tremendous proportions, not because of any irresponsibility on the part of the men in the industry but because we could not tell them that this new law was coming into effect merely because somebody in the Commission had done something, in the course of exceedingly complicated negotiations&#x2014;something that we could not explain to them properly. We could not then go on to say "Deal

with it by way of a nod and a wink, although this regulation replaces part of the Transport Act 1968 steps will be taken in consultation with both sides of the road transport industry to see that the position is taken care of "&#x2014;in other words&#x2014;" We agree that this is the law, but we will do nothing about it. We will write letters to chief constables saying that although there can be prosecutions we shall not be able to follow them up because wo do not know what the Community has done, or what the details are."</p>

<p>I agree with the right hon. Gentleman. In this respect the Opposition are failing in their duty. The hon. Member for Sutton Coldfield is tarred with the brush of the Common Market. He helped to get us into this system. The two Front Benches had Back Benchers pointing out the error of their ways. They fell between two stools. The Opposition cannot do their job properly, because they have a responsibility to get Common Market regulations accepted by the House.<br/>
Let me tell hon. Members what the union is trying to do. It has had a meeting and it is doing its best. It has issued the following statement:
<q>After considering all aspects and consequences, the National Trade Group Committee decided the following policy:&#x2014;</q>
<q>There is no change in the RTC Group policy in its total opposition to tachographs on domestic journeys (members should not allow themselves to believe otherwise).</q>
<q>That the assurances given by the Secretary of State for Transport as to the phasing-in period should be accepted until proven otherwise.</q>
<q>Any notice of a pending prosecution under the 450 kilometre provision should be notified to the National Secretary, who has been requested to inform the Secretary of State for Transport of the same.</q>
It is saying that it will not see its members prosecuted under regulations introduced at two minutes' notice and on which they, as responsible men, were not consulted. They are willing to negotiate, but have been denied the opportunity to do so. The union says:
<q>Negotiators in all companies in which an incentive bonus scheme operates are to commence discussions with the company or companies concerned:


<ol><li>(<i>a</i>) to establish whether any loss arises for the category of driver and vehicle referred to in the 450 kilometer provision.</li>
<li>(<i>b</i>) if any loss is entailed, to negotiate forthwith consolidation of any such monies on the particular journies concerned."</li></ol></q>
These are huge areas of negotiation which may take many months. They are difficult matters to negotiate, even between men of good will. The union continues:
<q>That the National Secretary prepares a comprehensive submission as requested, in conjunction with members of the National Trade Group Committee.</q>
<q>That the action taken by the General Secretary and the National Secretary in gaining support of all transport unions and the Commission within the European Community to replace Regultion No. 543/69 with a more acceptable directive is endorsed; and this National Trade Group Committee calls on the Commission to produce the aforesaid draft directive without further delay.</q>
My union talked with the unions over there and it feels harshly about the Commission because it was given assurances that these matters would be looked at. In the event, it got nothing for its pains.</p>

<p>Does my hon. Friend agree that it is not just a question of the powers of Parliament being challenged but that, in addition, a wide range of trade union agreements will be affected by some of these regulations?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1978-02-01a.635.1" hansard_membership_id="4001" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/30075" speakername="Mr. Ellis" colnum="635" time="">
<p>Indeed. These are fundamental and serious matters that cannot be changed at a minute's notice without trade unions and employers knowing what is hoped to be achieved and so on.<br/>
I know that the Minister is doing his best, but the directive that he is to put forward is not yet available. It is all very unsatisfactory.</p>

<p>I like the regulations very little more than the hon. Gentleman does, but he has been talking about suddenness and the lack of notice in connection with proposals that should have come into force two years ago and have been postponed three times at the behest of the United Kingdom Government, in their reluctance to have anything to do with the Common Market, as well as of Ireland.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1978-02-01a.635.3" hansard_membership_id="4001" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/30075" speakername="Mr. Ellis" colnum="635" time="">
<p>People were arguing about whether the draft directive was realistic. The question whether it should be

changed fundamentally was being argued. That is the point. Under the EEC's funny law, if no agreement is reached, certain things happen automatically. If a meeting breaks down or only part of a problem is solved, the whole holocaust descends.<br/>
It was put to me graphically by a union man who said that we were making life intolerable for him by chopping off his legs, but that if the Opposition's Prayer succeeded, we would be chopping off his head as well. That is the brutal situation we face.<br/>
I spent half a day with my hon. Friend the Member for Grimsby talking to honourable men about this problem. They are affected and we could not give straight answers to their straight questions about how their pay and conditions would be affected if this proposal came into law.<br/>
The hon. Member for Sutton Coldfield is one of the hon. Members who consented to Britain joining the Common Market. He got us into this situation and it ill behoves him to criticise the Government now. His Government knew that these provisions were around. The hon. Gentleman finished by saying that we are passing a law but that we should try to see that it is not enforced.<br/>
We are in a terrible position. I always thought that, when a law was introduced, it had been considered and that the ramifications were known, yet we find ourselves in a considerable dilemma. Many of my hon. Friends who know of my close interest in these matters, and my close contacts with my union, have asked "What should we do?" I replied "If somebody pushes the prayer, we shall have to vote against it and support the order". The truth is that we find ourselves in a disastrous situation.<br/>
To those who still believe in the Common Market I repeat what I have said about it throughout&#x2014;that it is bureaucratic and unworkable. Surely it is up to us to say after this debate "It is a shambles. Please stop this sort of thing happening".</p>

<p>My hon. Friend is saying that we have to pass the measure before us because the situation would be even worse if we carried the Prayer. He said that, as we are defenceless, we should be placed in a


position in which we should face wholesale strikes. Does my hon. Friend understand that the advancement of the trade union movement throughout its history has not always been the result of activity in the House? Perhaps some people outside should take action against the Common Market and its activities, the like of which have caused my hon. Friend to be so upset. I put it to him that it may be our duty to throw out this measure to support the Prayer and hope that it is carried. In that event, let us see some activity at ground level from those who were misled in the 1975 referendum. Let them provide the means for finally getting us out of the Market.</p>

<p>I fully understand my hon. Friend's argument. Many of those at ground level to whom he refers did not understand the Common Market. They knew the way in which we conducted our affairs and they had enormous respect for the law. They are now bemused. They do not understand how the present dilemma has arisen. The issue has to be presented to those at that level.<br/>
I have been on the shop floor and taken part in industrial action. I was always reluctant to take action or to lead marchers when I knew that those I would lead would suffer. However, I have given certain advice to my union. The union is upset. It is not over-concerned about all the gobbledegook and nonsense that we meet in the House. It is concerned that an employer has told it how its members' conditions and pay will be affected. It is looking for some assurances. If the issue were put before the members on the basis of how their pay and conditions would be affected, they would recognise what was happening about the Common Market. They would take up the issue even though it might result in their losing wages. They would take that decision in the light of that consequence.<br/>
The union is seeking to get out of the difficulty to which I have referred. I know that many hon. Members wish to speak, so I end my remarks. I think that I have explained the position. The House is in a sad position tonight.</p>

<p>At the time of the negotiations fishing and drivers' hours were the most important items for my constituents.<br/>
Reluctantly, because I believed that it was right for the United Kingdom to enter the Community, I accepted the position regarding drivers' hours, knowing that the current problem would arise in due course and cause the difficulties now facing us.<br/>
I agree with much of what was said by the hon. Member for Brigg and Scunthorpe (Mr. Ellis). The purpose of my intervention is limited. I agree that it is unsatisfactory to have an arrangement coming into effect to which the Government turn a blind eye and say "We are not going to enforce the law".<br/>
I want to know the facts from the Minister. My constituency is more than 280 miles&#x2014;450 km&#x2014;from virtually all its markets. At the time of the negotiations, I did not see much point in having a regional policy in the Community if we were to have this kind of arrangement. What is the purpose of a Community regional policy if the regions, one of which I represent, are grossly penalised by virtue of arrangements of this kind? I am in favour of being in the Community, but this is one aspect of it with which I disagree.<br/>
Does the Minister intend to turn a blind eye to this matter for six months or a year? I understand that he does. How long have transport operators in my constituency got before they know that the full rigours of enforcement will be brought to bear upon them? That is a factual question.<br/>
I understand that there have not been any prosecutions in the Community from the inception of the mileage regulations. I do not know why prosecutions have not been brought in the Community. Perhaps the Minister will answer that question. How long does he intend not to enforce these provisions?<br/>
Why have we still not got sufficient calibration stations in the South-West? Will he help to speed up the establishment of calibration stations in the South-West? If tachographs are fitted to


vehicles, mileage problems do not arise. I understand that there is a calibration station in Barnstaple, North Devon, but there is not one anywhere in Cornwall. It is not possible for transport operators to take their lorries to North Devon every time they have them serviced to have the tachographs recalibrated.<br/>
There are special problems involved here. Perhaps the Minister will comment briefly on them in reply to the debate.</p>

<p>I am obliged to you, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I should like to explain why this document, headed "1978 No. 7" ought not to have come before the House as regulations that have been made. It ought to have come before us as a draft on a resolution by the Government asking the House to approve it. Indeed, it should have come as such before both Houses.<br/>
The document seeks to amend a pre-accession regulation by which we are bound. It is part of our law. Although it is not in the form of our law either by an Act of Parliament or by a Statutory Instrument, we are bound by it, but the time at which we are bound is delayed. That time is running out. The document seeks to extend the time. The regulations seek to bring into effect a Commission decision. We are not bound by a Commission decision unless we introduce it into our law.<br/>
The regulations can be made under the European Communities Act 1972. That Act gives the Government a unique discretion to choose the form in which the regulations shall come before the House. The Government do not have that unique discretion anywhere else in our law. Therefore, the House should watch that discretion and its exercise with care.<br/>
When should the Government choose to bring draft regulations before the House for consideration under the negative resolution procedure? Weight should be given to what Parliament has decreed

in an Act should apply to documents of this kind. Under the Transport Act 1968, as amended, documents which relate to drivers' hours must be made after a draft has been put to the House. The Government could have done that.<br/>
On three recent occasions the Government have brought before the House orders in draft and objections have been made. The drafts have been withdrawn and the orders remade. If the Government had adopted that course we should have had more time.<br/>
The Government chose the easy course. They chose to bring the document before the House under the negative procedure. They should have examined Part VI of the Transport Act and acted as they should have acted. Every document should be in draft and this matter should have come before us in draft.</p>

<p>Four weeks ago, from 9th to 16th January, my constituency was almost brought to a halt by a strike of 1,200 heavy goods vehicle drivers. It was a strike which received hardly a mention in the national Press or on television, but it was a strike which was disastrous for a port which depends upon the rapid movement of fish and of incoming supplies and a town which depends on food processing. It was a strike which almost wiped out some businesses and which caused 10,000 people to be laid off. It was a strike which was caused directly by the EEC transport regulations of which tonight's derogation is a part.<br/>
I am as enthusiastic about the EEC as the next man, provided I stand next to my hon. Friend the Member for Bolsover (Mr. Skinner) on my left and my hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Test (Mr. Gould) on my right. I am as happy about the Market as I would be about any other disaster for this country&#x2014;such as a Conservative Government. So in normal circumstances I would think of recent events as just another part of Common Market madness&#x2014;something to be laughed at.<br/>
It is ludicrous that these regulations, made in October, did not reach us until 30th December. It is ludicrous that from 1st January to 26th January we had a legislative vacuum. It is ludicrous that, because of the misunderstandings and problems, we have to have an enforced


"honeymoon" of six months and one year for the 450 km.&#x2014;the only enforced "honeymoon" in history which cannot be consumated. But the laughter stops when the misunderstandings and confusion that such rushed negotiations produce&#x2014;the differences over whether they are enforced and the arguments over whether the offences are endorsable&#x2014;continue to inflict a crippling strike on Grimsby. Then the laughter dies on the lips and turns to anger. People still do not know whether the regulations are to be enforced. There is confusion.<br/>
The case against the regulations has been well stated. They are explosive. I quote from a letter from an employer in Grimsby, who said:
<q>Should the proposed Common Market legislation be implemented in its final form, or even interim form, I would anticipate that we would need to increase our tanker fleet by one-third and our general haulage vehicles by about one-quarter.</q>
These regulations are particularly difficult at a time of pay policy. Worse still, they are inflexible. Everyone wants more time off for drivers, but not time off away from home. The regulations are unrealistic. They will be enforced in a different framework and within a different discipline and legal structure from what will be done in the EEC. It is no wonder that drivers want split licences and the same kind of spot fines and the easier enforcement that has developed on the Continent.<br/>
The regulations are ludicrous, particularly in respect of the 450-km limit, which is a back-door method of introducing the tachograph. That limit allows transport going from Grimsby to Liverpool to return to within 10 miles of Grimsby and then to stop. That is the situation which will arise in a year, after the "honeymoon" period has ended.<br/>
I support the tachograph in principle. It is just that I do not want it in the cab. But I observe that, in fact, the tachograph is in force already and that, according to the EEC Commission's background report of 21st December, the tachograph becomes legally compulsory after 1st January 1978. So, according to that, we already have the tachograph. We have a situation in which the Commission is perpetually delaying its announced intention of delivering a warning to the British Government to

implement the tachograph. It is a situation like "The Perils of Pauline". But we shall be in good company. So far, only Denmark has escaped censure for failing to implement some part of Regulations 543/69 or 1463/70. Proceedings in the European Court are already threatened against every other country for violating some aspect of these regulations.<br/>
The oddest situation is the one in which we find ourselves tonight, in which, if we agree to tonight's Prayer and throw out the regulations, we shall find ourselves back with the full majesty of Regulation 543/69 in all its lunacy. Since the Conservative Members who took us into the EEC are in part responsible for that state of affairs, because this is a part of the framework of regulations which existed when we came into the Common Market and which we accepted by the Treaty of Accession, they should have the courage of their convictions, press the Prayer and let us have the regulation in all its pristine folly so we can see the Market for the lunacy it is.</p>

<p>This is a great night for those who wish to recruit for the anti-Market cause. The whole matter that we are discussing is nonsense, but I ask to whom we are addressing our comments. Perhaps the Minister can be persuaded to arrange for <i>Hansard</i> to be printed in French and German and then to have it distributed to those who have some influence on these matters.<br/>
The hon. Member for Sutton Cold-field (Mr. Fowler) defended his decision to introduce the Prayer on the principle that the Conservatives did not correct the mistake that he admits his party made, which fits in nicely with the whole tone of the nonsense we are debating.<br/>
The regulations affect many areas in Scotland and England. The constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) is affected. My constituency gives one example of the sort of nonsense involved. From my front door to this house is 301 miles by motorway. If one uses the old doddery A30, the mileage is 254. It is, therefore, legal to use the road which was outdated 100 years ago but not to use the motorway.<br/>
Perhaps the hon. Member for Brigg and Scunthorpe (Mr. Ellis) will explain to me, in view of his close connections with the union in question, just what is the objection to the tachograph. Why should not a tachograph be put in a lorry? Why should not I, as a citizen, have some assurance that the regulations which apply to these mammoth vehicles are being adhered to in respect of speed, for example? I do not understand why the Transport and General Workers' Union has made such a song and dance about this for such a long time. I can tell the hon. Member that his union's insistence on the regulations will cause some serious financial consequences in my area. It will not affect so badly the areas that are within 200 miles of London.<br/>
Who in Europe is in favour of these regulations? It appears that no one enforces them. Will the Minister tell us how many prosecutions there have been in France for lorries doing between 280 and 350 miles? I happen to know the answer. It is zero. I do not know who is in favour of the regulations. I have contacted people whom I have met by chance in various European organisations and have found no one in any European country who is in favour of these regulations or who will publicly say so. Where is the pressure coming from to keep this nonsense of a bandwagon going along the road?<br/>
I hope that, within the regulations which exist, the opposition to the tachograph will quickly collapse and allow the West Country and areas such as Berwick to have some degree of fair competition with other regions of this country in trying to achieve prosperity for our people.</p>

<p>The only comment in the speech of the hon. Member for Sutton Coldfield (Mr. Fowler) with which I agreed was that this is a rather ridiculous way in which to conduct important debates. I am in full agreement with that comment.<br/>
When we consider the full significance of the regulations with which we are

dealing and recognise the hour of night and the length of time that this matter has been on the agenda, we can only wonder what the business managers of the House of Commons regard as important. In many respects this is something which will affect Scotland far more than the Scotland Bill, and we shall be interested to see what turns up in the future.<br/>
I say to Opposition Members&#x2014;including the hon. Member for Truro (Mr Penhaligon)&#x2014;that it is disheartening to come to this House on all these occasions when we debate EEC orders of one form or another and find them all protesting about the idiocies which come from Brussels and the Commission, because it was we who were denigrated in the 1970s for trying to put a counter-argument. Why were not Opposition Members arguing some of these issues in 1972 at the time of the so-called re-negotiations? It was because Opposition Members&#x2014;including the Liberals&#x2014;did not talk about them then that we are now stuck with the regulations.<br/>
The hon. Member for Truro said that no one is in favour of the regulations, and he asked where the pressure is coming from. It is coming from West Germany, from the West German politicians. The reason for that is that there is a great deal of Community traffic flowing through Germany, and Germany wants to turn traffic from the road on to rail. This is the method that the German politicians are using, and it is a very useful one.<br/>
When I read the report of the Second Reading debate on the Transport Bill which took place last week, I found that, with two minor exceptions, the EEC and its transport policies were not mentioned at all. I found it incredible, when there are so many issues before the Council of Ministers, emanating from the Commission, that will radically affect transport in this country, that no one should want to discuss these matters.<br/>
I have no intention of reading through the document that I have before me. It is from the Commission to the Council of Transport Ministers and is concerned with a working programme for the next three years. There are no fewer than 16 different matters relating to road and rail only. The document refers to the first directive on commercial vehicle taxation systems, uniform principles for the


calculation of railway costs, direct tariffs for railways, road vehicle weights and dimensions, the setting of deadlines for and conditions of railways' financial plans, plans of action on social regulations for road transport conditions to be pressed ahead as soon as possible, and so on. There are many more subjects. All those are in the transport field, yet in the Transport Bill in the House of Commons we did not manage to discuss any of them.<br/>
I could scarcely believe my eves when I read the hon. Gentleman's Prayer to annul the regulations. I noted his point that this was the only way in which to get a debate. Whether that is true, I do not know, but I was surprised that 60 colleagues signed the motion. Surely this can be done through the usual channels. Certainly one assumes, from what the hon. Gentleman said, that he would have insisted that this vitally important matter should be debated.<br/>
The regulations will give us a temporary derogation for three years. Council Regulation (EEC) No. 543/69 comes fully into operation on 1st January 1981. Whereas the regulations will reduce the continuous driving time to four and a half hours, the Council regulation provides for four hours. The daily driving time in our regulations is nine hours and in the Council regulations it is eight. The comparative figures for the driving week or fortnight are 54 hours and 106 hours in our regulations and 48 and 92 in Regulation No. 543/69. These figures have a considerable impact on road haulage costing.<br/>
For passenger transport there is a difference. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State was clearly successful in persuading his European colleagues in the Council of Transport Ministers that there would be cataclysmic effects on our transport system. The Council regulation does not distinguish between drivers of goods vehicles and drivers of passenger vehicles. There is no reason why it should. They are all drivers, even if one is behind the wheel of a goods vehicle and one is behind the wheel of a coach. However, my right hon. Friend is clearly well aware of the cost effect on our haulage system and our passenger transport services.<br/>
If the regulations are annulled we shall be in grave difficulties. My right hon.

Friend will have to trot back to Brussels and say "I am sorry. The House of Commons would not accept them." The people there will think we have gone mad. They will say "You can have Regulation No. 543/69 as from now." If that happened, I do not know whether we could cope with the strikes that would undoubtedly occur in the transport industry.</p>

<p>I appreciate that my right hon. Friend wants to reply, Mr. Deputy Speaker, but we were not allowed to fix the time for the debate. Many questions will have to be asked, and much more should be said about the regulation.<br/>
I finish on a point of fundamental importance. The regulation is about road safety, or so we have been repeatedly told&#x2014;we have had the matter before us in the European Assembly for two years. No one will decry any aspect of improving road safety. But, although we are saying that a driver may drive for only a certain number of hours, we are not legislating against his taking a second job. There is nothing to stop a driver of a heavy goods vehicle performing his duties in accordance with the regulation and then taking a second job, even driving a taxi or a car.<br/>
That is the nonsense of the regulation. Clearly, we dare not regulate the life style of one section of the community alone. The nonsense is that we are not trying to outlaw moonlighting, which is widespread throughout the community.</p>

<p>It is not a question of my wanting to reply, but I assume that the House wants me to do so. I should be content to listen to what hon. Members have to say&#x2014;they have raised important matters&#x2014;but our debate ends at 12.30 a.m. and I understand that the hon. Member for Wellinborough (Mr. Fry) would like to say a few words before the close. Therefore, I regret that I am in any way curtailing the debate, but there is no alternative except not to answer the points that have been made.<br/>
I entirely agree with what has been said about these being very complicated


matters. The hon. Member for Sutton Coldfield (Mr. Fowler) spoke of contention, concern and problems, and I would not dissent. My hon. Friend the Member for Brigg and Scunthorpe (Mr. Ellis) used the words "ludicrous" and "bureaucratic", and I would not dissent from those expressions. When the hon. Member for Truro (Mr Penhaligon) said that we should like the whole matter to go away, I found it very difficult to disagree with him.<br/>
But we are stuck with the fact that if the motion to annul the regulations is carried, we shall lose the benefits&#x2014;they are important benefits&#x2014;of staged implementation. In other words, the full rigour of the EEC regime will come into force immediately. There will be no question of my going back to Brussels to explain anything. It would come into force immediately. The effects would be disastrous, as all hon. Members agree.</p>

<p>I thought I heard my right hon. Friend say that if we carried this motion tonight the full force of the EEC regime would be brought in. I had always assumed&#x2014;I do not know whether my right hon. Friend has changed his mind&#x2014;that my right hon. Friend was one of the most fervent and fanatical Europeans. What he should be saying, if he believes what he said during the referendum campaign, is that the full force of the European legislation will be brought in and provide benefits for all the lorry drivers and everyone else. Why is he not saying that?</p>

<p>I did not use the word "regime", he did. I referred only to these regulations. What I have said is consistent with my views. I believe that these are undesirable regulations. We have to face realities, and the reality of the situation is that if the motion is carried we shall be faced with a situation even more unsatisfactory than that facing us now.<br/>
I took note of what the right hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) said and I will consider the implications of his remarks, as will, I am sure, my right hon. Friend the Leader of the House. I apologise to the right hon. Gentleman and to the House if there has been any incorrectness in our behaviour. We were faced with a situation in which it was import

ant to make these regulations quickly because of the highly uncertain situation. If we have exceeded what was proper, we shall have learned from this experience. I appreciate the important points made by the right hon. Gentleman.<br/>
This debate is important not only to the House but to the industry as a whole, and I ought to place certain remarks firmly on the record. Regulation 543/69 was agreed by the original six members of the community before we were a member. The United Kingdom played no part in formulating it, and I think that this is to our credit. The regulation arose from circumstances in the six very different from our own because we have a long history of regulation of drivers' hours&#x2014;social regulations as they are often called.<br/>
Under the terms of the Treaty of Accession, there was no renegotiation of the regulation. Strictly speaking, we were obliged, after five years' membership of the Community, to enforce the regulation in this country. The Commission had been given powers to defer it until 31st December 1977. It had no further power to grant deferment and, therefore, it was vitally important that the Government should do all they could to negotiate some amendment or some understanding about the regulation.<br/>
My objective, when the British presidency began last year, was to seek a situation in which the regulation could be implemented in stages from the beginning of this year. This was the best that we could expect. I should tell the House that the negotiations in which I took part with that objective in view were almost the most difficult I have known. They were delicate and they involved all other members of the Community. We always ran the risk that by not accepting what the other members of the Community wished we should find ourselves ultimately being obliged to enforce the regulation in full. It was not until 27th October last year, when we had a meeting of the Council in Luxembourg, that we succeeded in getting agreement in the Council of Ministers to a package which had important advantages for us in so far as there would be phased implementation.<br/>
Quite apart from the debate of 4th April last year, we kept in the closest touch with both sides of industry throughout our negotiations in the Community. It was essentially a combined operation


in so far as both sides of industry and the Government were seeking the best possible terms in difficult circumstances and in the light of the fact that we had been blocked by the inability of the French to agree to the principle of phased implementation at the Council meeting in June. At the end of the negotiations, we secured agreement that we should implement Regulation 543 by stages over three years. The solution was, in my view, and, I believe, in the view of the industry, the best that could have been achieved in all the difficult circumstances. Shortly after the Council had adopted the new regulation, we sent our proposals for staged implementation to the Commission for consideration. To avoid unnecessary upheaval within the industry we proposed two stages over the three years, the first to last for two years and the second for one year, with full implementation in January 1981.<br/>
It soon became clear, however, that the Commission's ideas of stages differed substantially from our own, and in the event the Government were not aware of the contents of the decision until almost the end of the year. The actual decision itself did not arrive in the United Kingdom until 2nd January. The necessary orders&#x2014;Nos. 6 and 7 of 1978&#x2014;were laid in Parliament on 5th January and, in deference to the 21-day rule, were made effective from 26th January.<br/>
It goes without saying&#x2014;and I agree with all that my hon. Friend the Member for Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell) said about it&#x2014;that the late arrival of the Commission's decision has given rise to confusion and uncertainty throughout industry. I can only say that, in conjunction with both sides, we have done our very best to sort out the difficulties.<br/>
The Commission's decision permits the gradual implementation of the Community driving limits in the following way. For buses, the daily driving limit remains at 10 hours until the end of November but is reduced to nine and a half from 1st December 1978, and reduced again to nine hours on 1st October 1979, going down to eight hours, with a provision for nine hours twice a week, on 1st January 1981. For goods vehicles, the reduction to nine and a half hours comes on 1st December 1978, but the reduction to nine hours is on 1st July 1979. The final re

duction to eight hours is on 1st January 1981.<br/>
These are complicated regulations, and at one stage we had a choice between simplicity and finding a regime which would meet the somewhat different needs of the bus industry and of the road haulage industry. We decided to settle for the best terms we could get, and I believe that both sides of industry take the view that the formula is, in the circumstances, reasonable.<br/>
There is one change which has applied from the beginning of January. This is the imposition of a daily driving limit of 450 km for single-manned heavy articulated vehicles unless they are using a tachograph. I say to my hon. Friend the Member for Grimsby, the hon. Member for Truro and others that I think that the whole question of the compulsory use of the tachograph and the possibility of infraction proceedings is a separate issue.<br/>
I fully understand that having a 450-km limit causes particular problems in distant places like the West Country, particularly Cornwall, and Scotland. The industry would not have been slow to remind me had I overlooked that. This is a flaw in what is otherwise a generally favourable settlement and is why we have said that there must be a so-called honeymoon period of rather longer&#x2014;of up to a year&#x2014;in this respect as in the other cases.<br/>
Of course, the industry cannot be expected to digest the details of the agreement and of implementation immediately. In practice, there is a long-standing tradition that, where there are changes in drivers' hours, there should be a honeymoon period of this kind, during which enforcement officers concentrate more on education in the law and giving advice than on attempting to bring prosecutions. I am sure it is right&#x2014;there are precedents&#x2014;to follow this practice on this occasion, and it is fully accepted by the enforcement authorities.<br/>
Under the new regulation the United Kingdom has certain powers of derogation in respect of vehicles such as minibuses, and there are other types of vehicle and journey to which the Commission has power to agree derogation. We are consulting both sides of industry


and all authorities and other bodies concerned about these powers, and it will take a little time before the final decisions can be made. In the meantime, of course, I would not want anyone to change operating practices in respect of the vehicles and purposes for which derogation is possible.<br/>
As I say, I have been in close touch, and my officials have been in close touch, with both sides of the industry on these matters, as on other matters such as the question of calibration centres, which also has been raised in the debate. I hope that together we shall be able to sort matters out and correct the misunderstandings which there have been.<br/>
I think that it will be quite a few months before we are able to reach finality on the various possibilities of derogation and before we have decided how best to harmonise the requirements of two sometimes conflicting codes. I recognise that this will create difficulties, but, as I have said, had we not been able to negotiate phased implementation there would have been far greater disturbance for the industry and disastrous implications for the economy as a whole.<br/>
We shall, of course, continue to work together not only to solve the remaining problems but also, over a period of time, in further negotiations in Brussels, to improve the basic regulation and to achieve some of the flexibility to which the hon. Member for Sutton Coldfield referred. That is certainly my aim, which, I believe, will be endorsed on both sides of the House and by all those who have doubts about the present situation.</p>

<p>Even after the Secretary of State's speech, anyone who has listened to this short debate must come to the conclusion that this whole situation is an unholy mess. It is an unholy mess constitutionally, legally and practically. Yet the only way by which the House can debate such an important matter is by the Opposition putting down a Prayer. I feel that hon. Members should be grateful to the official Opposition for having taken that decision.<br/>
It is right that we should debate this issue, and I must say that those who

criticise the shortness of the debate have much on their side. I hope that the Government will take note of the protests made tonight and recognise that this is a complicated issue with many facets, and that the House ought to be able to return to it on other occasions.<br/>
Let me take one example of the difficulties which have arisen. Until 24th January, operators in this country were under the impression that this new set of regulations would do away with the obligations under the Transport Act 1968, and particularly Section 96. Two days before these regulations were due to come into force, it was suddenly realised that the EEC law was not on all fours with the British law.<br/>
Thus, we have reached the ludicrous state of affairs in which, perhaps alone in Europe, our hauliers are bound by one set of regulations in terms of drivers' hours and another set of laws governing hours of duty. Our transport operators, therefore, are competing on grossly unfair terms vis-&#x00E0;-vis their rivals in Europe.<br/>
It is obvious that this situation must be remedied. The Government have the opportunity to remedy it. At this moment, the Secretary of State is piloting his Transport Bill through Committee. Why cannot he add a new clause to put right that glaring anomaly?<br/>
So far we have had a few fair words, and the right hon. Gentleman has talked about consultation. But there is a strong need for action. Without that action, we shall find that industry will stagger along and not be able to do its job properly.<br/>
I could give a whole list of practical suggestions. I take, for example, the 12 months' period which is supposed to be the period when no one will be prosecuted. If an operator breaks the distance limit and at the same time offends against some other road traffic law&#x2014;</p>

<p>I very much value this opportunity of explaining to the House and the Minister the anxieties that beset my constituents in Chorley, Leyland and a score of surrounding villages about the future of the Chorley Hospital.<br/>
It may be helpful to my hon. Friend the Minister if I point out that there exists a unique bond of affection between the local community and this hospital. In the days before the last war, working people contributed weekly through the trades council towards its upkeep, and even today local residents and local organisations raise considerable funds to provide comforts and amenities at the hospital.<br/>
It is important that I emphasise this happy relationship which has existed for many years, otherwise it might be thought that my represenations tonight reflect only the views of a few malcontents who are reluctant to accept change and progress. In truth, the threat to the standing of the hospital has generated an angry and quite spectacular response throughout the Chorley constituency. On one day of protest, the commercial and industrial activity of the whole area was practically halted as more than 10,000 people marched in protest at the curtailment of the hours of service by the accident and emergency unit at the hospital. Public meetings objecting to proposals designed to further diminish the available facilities have been crowded, and petitions of protest have been signed by tens of thousands of people.<br/>
The local weekly paper&#x2014;the <i>Chorley and Leyland Guardian</i>&#x2014;has covered the compaign on behalf of the hospital in great detail and concludes that full support must be given to a crucade to retain and enhance the range of services provided at Chorley. A special investigation covering all aspects of the hospital crisis was undertaken by the <i>Lancashire Evening Post.</i> This has resulted in a demand for a higher rate of financial investment in the local health services and an accelerated advance towards full district status for the Chorley Hospital.<br/>
The two local authorities, Chorley and South Ribble, have come out firmly in support of the public crusade for the retention and extension of services at Chorley, as has the community health council, which, of course, was created to enable the views of the public and the consumer generally to be taken into consideration when matters of this nature were being discussed.<br/>
It is against that background of widespread protestation that I wish to focus attention on four aspects of the situation that warrant urgent investigation. If those with responsibility are prepared to examine these issues and are willing to act on them where it is apparent that there is cause for concern, I am confident that good will can be restored and anxieites about the future of the Chorley Hospital set at rest.<br/>
First, I wish to comment on the strategic plan for hospital services in the Preston district&#x2014;an envisaged programme which contains many sound and enlightened proposals. Unfortunately, there is some confusion when it describes the future role of the Chorley Hospital. In the original draft, there was no mention of the intention to close the children's ward at Chorley; this proposition has been introduced as an afterthought, probably as a consequence of the Rochdale inquiry. I have studied the report and recommendation and can well understand that those who are employed in this area of the Health Service should wish to avoid the possibility of another child dying in similar tragic circumstances. The attitude is correct and commendable. However, it is clear from the report that the death of the child was not due to the absence of a paediatrician or of any item of special equipment but occurred because


things went terribly wrong and unbelievable errors were made in clinical judgment.<br/>
I do not wish to dwell upon the case but only to say that it would be folly to relate the sad events of that night in Rochdale to the position in Chorley. Indeed, if the recommendation that all children from a wide district who are in need of hospital care should be under one roof regardless of their degree of illness is carried out, it is not difficult to recognise that those children furthest away from the roof in question could be placed at risk by having to make a long journey before their needs could receive attention.<br/>
There are obvious delays and dangers in having to transport a sick child to a distant hospital. In the case under review the nearest alternative children's ward would be at Preston some 10 miles from Chorley. The route is the scene of long and frequent traffic hold-ups, and, of course, some points of the present Chorley Hospital catchment area are much more than 10 miles from Preston.<br/>
The child would often be separated from parents and family by worse than miles and distance. The journey into Preston by public transport is desperately expensive, and for families without their own transport, who are still the majority, the cost of hospital visiting is an expensive item. The importance of this consideration to the well-being of the young patient should not be lightly shrugged off; the presence of friends and family can be an important factor in the recovery of a sick child. Clearly, the small children's ward at Chorley does a valuable job and should be retained. Already there as suspicions that children are being directed to Preston when they could be accommodated at Chorley, the purpose being to provide an impression that the children's ward is under-occupied. I am reluctant to believe that this is the case, but I am disturbed by letters I have received from the parents of children who have been sent to Preston for treatment that has previously been available at Chorley.<br/>
I must make it clear that I accept absolutely that for specialised and particular treatment it will be necessary for the sick child to become a patient at a hospital outside the immediate area. That is

common sense, and we are not without that commodity in Lancashire. We also believe that it is common sense to retain the children's ward in its present setting where it provides a useful and popular service to a growing community.<br/>
I turn now to the accident and emergency department. This is a well-equipped unit which is situated conveniently close to the motorway system but which has functioned only on an "office hours" basis since 1974. This is not one of the many casualty departments throughout the country that have closed, or face closure, because of a rationalisation of the service. The position here is that the regional and area health authorities are anxious to see the unit operating on a 24-hour basis and have made this clear on numerous occasions.<br/>
Unhappily, the restriction on the hours of service is in force because of the inability of the health authority to recruit qualified medical personnel. It has been said that the reason for this is the poor career prospects in this discipline. If this is so, I must ask my hon. Friend what is being done to remedy the problem. Another theory given for the seeming reluctance of doctors to man the accident department is that they would prefer to be employed in units attached to the larger hospitals where the range of activity and of equipment is greater. To laymen such as myself, it would seem that doctors should serve a group of hospitals rather than one, which would overcome the problem. If this brings complications, let us by all means hear about them.<br/>
It is quite ludicrous that a casualty unit located in an area of population growth and amidst heavy industrial development should be closed during evenings and weekends. Qualified staff must be recruited so that building and equipment are utilised in a sensible fashion. The Government have wisely acted to increase the numbers in the medical profession by encouraging a greater intake of students, and this should improve the situation in coming years. Though the blame for current problems may lie with previous Administrations, a determined effort must be made immediately to correct a position which allows instruments and premises to stand idle while injured people are carried past the hospital gates in search


of an accident unit which is adequately staffed.<br/>
I must mention one other point before I leave the question of the casualty department. When the initial closure took place, the unit was closed entirely. Subsequently it has reopened, though, as I have indicated, it has not yet resumed a round-the-clock service. Incredibly, when the unit closed down completely, the public were informed by a notice posted at the hospital entrance. The local authority was neither consulted nor advised. Such off-hand behaviour inevitably creates resentment and hostility. Fortunately, the lines of communication between the health authorities and local government have since improved considerably&#x2014;and not before time. Nowadays, there is a massive exchange of correspondence and a multitude of meetings, but I cannot pretend that the problems that afflict the hospital have diminished&#x2014;indeed, in many respects, the situation in recent months has worsened.<br/>
My third area of concern is the pace of advancement towards full district status for the Chorley Hospital. On this there is no dispute at all with the regional health authority on the principle. In fact, the authority is advocating that the hospital be upgraded at the earliest date possible. Any differences lie in how quickly district status can be achieved, and the rapidity of the accomplishment is largely dependent on the availability of resources.<br/>
The Registrar General's population figures show a growth in the population of Chorley from 79,490 to 83,100 and in South Ribble from 87,330 to 92,000 during the years 1972 to 1976. Ironically, a substantial growth in population is under way in the immediate vicinity of the hospital. Several thousand new houses have already been constructed under the auspices of the Central Lancashire New Town and many thousands more are being built at the present time or are in the pipeline. All new town development of any consequence is taking place south of the River Ribble, yet hospital facilities are being concentrated at the northern end of the territory.<br/>
It would be ridiculously parochial if one disadvantaged area of the North-West were to begrudge another area much-needed Health Service provision, and I do not intend to tread that road. None

the less, circumstances have changed since plans were laid for new hospital development north of the river. If the formula on which the plans were made has become obsolete, logic demands that the plan be changed. To concede that one is wrong is merely to say "I am wiser today than I was yesterday "&#x2014;and this applies to vast organisations as well as to individuals. The modified plans of the Central Lancashire New Town mean that the incoming population will be accommodated in the Chorley and Leyland districts; therefore, hospital extension must take place in that area. The Chorley Hospital has an abundance of land at its perimeter available for development. In short, everything points to the desirability of a swift progression to full district status in the early future.<br/>
My concluding observations are about the financial implications of meeting the problems that I have outlined. I appreciate that it is very easy to leave this calculation out of the debate entirely, which might enable me to make an emotionally attractive speech which could appeal to my constituents but which would be cowardly in evading the realities of the situation.<br/>
The reality is that the Health Service could consume the nation's entire budget, such is the cost of sophisticated equipment, of new buildings and of maintenance and running costs. Even if the Government were to abandon investment in education, welfare provision, transport and everything else, giving all our funds to the Health Service, it would still not be sufficient to meet all needs, and clearly there is no question of finance on this scale ever becoming available.<br/>
However, accepting the overall limitations, I am convinced that our resources can be allocated more sensibly and more fairly. Already the Department of Health and Social Security has taken bold and decisive steps to divert funds from the more prosperous regions of the country and direct them towards disadvantaged areas such as the North-West. I approve and applaud the decision to implement the recommendation of the Working Party on the Allocation of Resources. This will mean that over a period of time the most hard-pressed regions will receive additional support to meet their formidable, almost overwhelming, problems in the field of health care.<br/>
The North-West Region has generated the wealth of the nation. It still puts more into the national kitty than it gets out. It has a higher death rate, a higher incidence of disease, a more polluted atmosphere and a greater proportion of decayed housing stock than any other region. Unemployment is higher than the national average, and there are fewer doctors and dentists per head of population than elsewhere. It is small wonder that a weighted allocation of funds is a desperate necessity.<br/>
An enlightened Government are now endeavouring to bring some justice and decency to a deprived region. I suggest that what is being done is insufficient, and my concern is shared by the leader of the North-West Regional Health Authority, Mr. Sidney Hamburger, who complains that the pace of reform is too sluggish and that there is still too much indifference in Whitehall to the needs and entitlements of his hard-hit region.<br/>
I took to my hon. Friend to convey to the Secretary of State the anger and resentment of folk in the North-West, and especially in Lancashire, at the imbalance of wealth and resources within our own country and amongst our own people.<br/>
Finally, when the strategic plan for hospital services in the Preston district has been assessed and approved by the various health authorities in the North-West Region, it will be forwarded to the Secretary of State for final decision. I hope that the criticisms that I have felt compelled to make on behalf of my constituents will have been needed and the plan amended accordingly. If not, I call upon my right hon. Friend to reject the proposals as they affect the Chorley Hospital because they do not reflect the needs and desires of the people&#x2014;and that, after all, is the whole point and purpose of our health and hospital services.</p>

<p>I am glad that we have the opportunity to debate this issue, which I know is of very great concern to the inhabitants of Chorley.<br/>
I pay tribute to the vigour with which my hon. Friend the Member for Chorley (Mr. Rodgers) has argued the case for Chorley Hospital over a number of years.

He sent my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State a copy of the formal objection which he addressed last October to the North-Western Regional Health Authority about plans which had been put forward for the future of hospitals in the Preston district. In December he took part in a meeting which was arranged between representatives of the regional health authority and of the Chorley and Ribble borough councils. Going even further back, in April 1975 he led a deputation to my predecessor, who is now Foreign Secretary, which presented a petition signed by a large number of Chorley residents, to which he has referred, expressing the same view.<br/>
The main issues which have exercised my hon. Friend's constituents were set out in the petition which he laid before the House on 13th December last. My right hon. Friend's observations on the petition have been circulated. Tonight I have the chance of dealing fully with some of the issues that my hon. Friend has raised.<br/>
One issue is that of the accident and emergency service at Chorley. It is restricted. It was restricted in 1974 from a 24-hour service to a 9 a.m.-5 p.m. service. As my hon. Friend rightly divines, the problem is one of insufficient medical staff to provide the essential medical cover. This is still the factor preventing the extension of this service, and it is a problem that is not peculiar to Chorley but one that I find up and down the country in quite a number of places. The area health authority has reaffirmed that it will continue to make every effort to recruit the appropriate staff to enable the hours of the service to be extended.<br/>
The problem is that the accident and emergency service at Chorley is one principally for minor accidents, as it has been for many years. This means that, because of the need to have available the full range of back-up facilities which are required to deal with serious accidents, a full accident and emergency service is at present provided only at the Preston Royal Infirmary. Although the journey to Preston, or, indeed, to Wigan&#x2014;which is about eight and a half miles from Chorley&#x2014;may take longer, the problem is that the longer journey and the risks attached to that have to be weighed against the risks of taking people to an accident and emergency centre,


such as that at Chorley, which is not fully equipped to deal with serious cases.<br/>
I am fairly sure that what will happen is that, as Chorley Hospital develops into a full district general hospital, full consideration will be given to the need for a full accident and emergency service and department at the expanded hospital.<br/>
In the meantime, the department is too small to attract the services of a consultant, which is the main grade for providing medical care, and registrars cannot work without consultant supervision. Secondly, as my hon. Friend says, the personnel being persons under training, the accident and emergency department at Chorley does not provide the appropriate range of accident and emergency work or, indeed, the equipment to give them the breadth of experience necessary to enhance their skills.<br/>
In the long run this particular problem may be remedied, but in the short run, although I am sure that all that can be done will be done to ensure proper medical staffing, we have to rely on the willingness of doctors to work at Chorley and other accident and emergency departments of similar size up and down the country. I have indicated why doctors may not always be willing and why those who are willing may be hard to find.<br/>
I turn to the question of the children's ward at Chorley Hospital. I do not want to go into too much detail, because there is the possibility that the matter will be referred to my right hon. Friend for a decision and our position has to be reserved. He would not want his decision prejudiced by anything I might say. The issue is also rather different because it is really one of deciding what deployment of services will be in the best interests of the population served.<br/>
At present the hospital has a 10-bedded children's acute ward. Last year the Lancashire Area Health Authority published proposals for the future use of hospital accommodation in the Preston district. One proposal was that, on completion of phase two of the new hospital, the children's ward at Chorley should be closed and the service continued in the much larger children's unit at Preston. It is possible that after the consultation the AHA may drop or modify the proposal. On the other hand, if it goes ahead

in the teeth of opposition from the community health council, the House knows that the procedure we have laid down for dealing with proposed closures provides that the matter is referred to my right hon. Friend for a final decision. I know that my hon. Friend and those for whom he speaks are taking a full part in the local consultations and I can assure him that, if the matter is referred to my right hon. Friend, the arguments that he has advanced so persuasively will be taken into account. We may need to refresh ourselves as Lo their content nearer the date of the decision.<br/>
My hon. Friend referred to children who have to go to Preston when beds appear to be free at Chorley. This situation may arise because of the requirements of individual children. If they require the specialised treatment that only the larger hospital can provide, doctors sometimes think that, despite the vacant beds at Chorley, it would be better for the children to go to Preston.<br/>
Finally, I should like to look at the case argued by my hon. Friend for Chorley Hospital to be advanced to full district status. The principle here is not in question. The argument is purely and simply about the timing of such a development, and this is something that has to be seen in the context of the other pretty heavy pressures facing the North-Western Region. The region has inherited some of the oldest hospital buildings in the country. Two-fifths of them were built before the turn of the century and more than half before 1918. There are also pockets of serious under-provision in certain services and certain localities. They are worst in services for the mentally handicapped, the elderly, especially those suffering from severe mental infirmity, and the mentally ill, but, looking at the region as a whole, one finds that there are deficiencies in some places almost right across the range of services.<br/>
The strategic plan which the regional health authority published just a year ago sets out a comprehensive programme for trying to remedy these deficiencies. The view that the regional health authority has taken is that the filling of outright gaps in the level of services must command the highest priority and that replacing old buildings and correcting the mislocation of services, desirable though


both these aims are, must take second place.<br/>
Chorley is part of the Preston district. For hospital purposes it divides itself into two parts. The northern part, comprising Preston borough and part of South Ribble borough, looks to Preston for its hospital services. In 1981 it has a planning population of about 200,000. The other part of Chorley and the remainder of South Ribble, for which Chorley is the natural centre, will have an estimated 1981 planning population of about 150,000. That figure takes into account the projected increase in the population of the Central Lancashire New Town.<br/>
The district has under construction a major new hospital at Fulwood to the north of Preston. It will be the region's first entirely new large hospital since the start of the National Health Service. The first phase will be completed this year. The second phase will be completed in about 1980. There will then be a total of over 700 beds. In all this planning, the region took into account the deficiencies in certain of the district's services, especially general medicine, children's services, geriatrics, accident and orthopaedic services. All these will be provided at the new hospital.<br/>
There is also a need to replace some of the wards of the old Preston Royal Infirmary, which is more than 100 years old. When this is all done, there will be a total of about 1,060 acute beds in the district. Apart from the children's unit, the opening of the new Preston hospital will not affect services at Chorley.<br/>
The trouble at Chorley, of course, is that its services will to a large extent be off-centre. At Preston and Chorley, patients will be obliged to go to Preston. Although there is a reasonable level of public transport, which I do not underrate, there will be considerable inconvenience for patients and visitors. I am afraid that that has to be accepted as one of the problems. The region intends that Chorley will be developed into a full district general hospital in time.<br/>
It will be clear to my hon. Friend that the problems of Chorley, as with so much of the North-West, stem directly from at least 30 years of neglect of the area's problems in favour of lusher medical and hospital pastures elsewhere. As a course

to be followed&#x2014;I cannot call it a policy&#x2014;I find it indefensible.<br/>
As my hon. Friend has recognised, we are the first Government to have recognised fully the needs of the North-West and to have started the region on the road to getting its fair share of the National Health Service budget. This year the region has had a growth rate of 3&#x00B7;2 per cent. in its revenue allocation, which is higher than any other region and more than twice the national average. Under this Government, a similar pattern will be repeated in future years. However, because the region has been so badly deprived of resources in the past, it will still take time to meet all the needs that have been recognised.<br/>
I cannot accept, as my hon. Friend reports Mr. Sidney Hamburger feels, that the region is ignored in Whitehall and Westminster. My right hon. Friend and I have spent more time in the North-West than in any other part of the country. Our whole policy is designed to come to its relief. We have incurred much criticism in other parts of the country in following that policy, not least in the areas that we represent as Members of Parliament. I appreciate that the pace of help must appear painfully slow to the people of Chorley, but 30 years of neglect, not only of Chorley but of the surrounding towns, will take a little time to correct. However, we shall do our utmost, so long as we have power, to keep faith with the health service in that part of the world.<br/>
I might not be able to give the answers that my hon. Friend would most like to hear, but I hope he will understand the extent to which the matters we have been discussing fall within the responsibility of area health authorities and regional health authorities and will accept that they must have reasonable discretion to take decisions in the light of their knowledge of the local picture. I hope I have persuaded him that those decisions are not taken lightly and that the authorities do their best to strike a fair balance between competing claims with a finite amount of resources. On any matters that are referred to us, we shall give as fair a hearing as we can to both sides of the argument.</p>
