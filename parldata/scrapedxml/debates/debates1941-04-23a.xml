<p>The Federal Reserve Bank in North China has prepared a form requiring details of certain importations from June, 1939,to June,1940. Importers obtain these forms direct and submit them for attestation to their national chamber of commerce. Import and export permits issued by the Federal Reserve

Bank are required for goods passing into and out of Tientsin. This is the case even if the goods in question belong to a branch of the same firm in Shanghai.As I stated in answer to my hon.

<p>With regard to the first part of the Question, while I do not accept the figures given by the hon. Member, the comparison which he draws between Cove Camp and the London County Council flats at the White City is of no value, since obviously the problems involved were in no way comparable.

<p>The two cases are not in the least comparable. At the White City, the buildings were used purely as dwellings, and they were built on a prepared site, at a time when labour was plentiful. The Cove camp was built on an unprepared site, at a time when labour was scarce, and, therefore, expensive. At the camp there were recreational rooms, hospitals, garages, roadways, and so on, to be constructed. It is perfectly true that this contractor is not now being given an opportunity/ to tender for War Office contracts.

The reason is that his costs were very much higher than the costs of other contractors, and, so far, no satisfactory explanation has been offered.</p>

<p>There is no scheme at all at present for the retail shopkeepers. The retail shopkeepers are not at present being asked to concentrate. If they find that it is necessary owing to the reduction of business to concentrate, they will do it of their own free will, and in so doing they will not in any way be forced by the Government. The Government are generally sympathetic to their difficulties, and will do all they can to see that they get a square deal. Perhaps my hon. Friend the Member for Stone (Sir J. Lamb) will put his question down.</p>

As regards unfurnished sub-lettings, the Rent Restriction Acts provide a simple remedy, and I have no evidence that there is any general tendency to overcharge sub-tenants. Such sub-lettings are subject to a definite standard rent, a statement of which the tenant is obliged under penalty to give to the sub-tenant on demand, and, in cases of doubt, the standard rent may, on the application of the sub-tenant, be determined by the Courts.

<p>The Resolution to increase the Income Tax of this country has met with satisfaction by people generally as being an indication of the

Government's resolve to carry the war through by the complete organisation of the country. It is true that in many instances. Income Tax is reaching the point where it raises considerable difficulties. I think it is right that the Government and the House should realise, with the incidence of Income Tax as it is to-day, that it is rapidly reaching the stage where, from the point of view of the normal incentive provided for people to carry on their duties, it will eventually be a handicap in this and other directions in achieving progress in the war effort. I came across an instance the other day of a civil servant being offered promotion. He accepted it, but the curious thing was that in accepting that promotion the man suffered a reduction in his income. That was partly due to the incidence of Income Tax and to other circumstances arising out of the war.<br/>
There are many circumstances arising to-day where the effects of the incidence of Income Tax are a deterrent on people accepting more responsibility, and therefore the normal inducement of additional income is being removed as a method of securing additional effort. That throws on the Government the responsibility of providing some other incentive, and I think we ought to register our appreciation of the fact that throughout the country to-day the overwhelming majority of the people are willingly rendering service, on the ground of patriotism and from the desire to see the country victorious, in spite of the fact that they themselves may be personally handicapped in the action that they take. It is therefore desirable that this House should also register, in the case of firms and individuals who are putting personal motives first and handicapping the progress of the war, their contempt for such action. Some firms are showing an entirely selfish outlook and are prepared, even at the risk of the defeat of the country, to handicap the war effort, but we are glad to say, in contrast to that, that the overwhelming mass' of the people are making voluntary sacrifices.<br/>
Taxation by money is not the only taxation that is being levied. When the Chancellor of the Exchequer takes 10s. in the &#x00A3; in taxation he takes away half the right to consume goods or employ labour, and the State takes the means of spending that money, instead of the person taxed. The


State is doing that in other ways as well, because, as it calls people up for service in the Army or for the Civil Defence Forces, as it enrols people for service in the nation's effort, it automatically removes from the sphere of employment large numbers of people and therefore even though a person might have thousands of pounds of income, they become relatively useless to him if there are no people to employ, and no goods to purchase. Therefore taxation is not only imposed by means of the Chancellor's efforts, but a very large amount of real taxation is being carried through by the reorganisation of the man-power of the country in a planned and constructive fashion. If we take that to its logical conclusion and imagine that the Government are organising the activities of the whole man-power of the nation&#x2014;it is immaterial whether you register it by money means or not&#x2014;you are effectively depriving everyone of spending money except in the case where the State gives permission to do so.<br/>
Take the case where ever so many people are competing for building-trade labour to repair houses and shops which have been damaged. You get a kind of option market for building-trade labour. I am informed that public houses are the first in the market by offering the highest prices to have their establishments repaired, and in every "blitzed" area the public house is the first place to be repaired. That is obviously a matter of competition for building-trade labour. If the Government take steps to decide what repairs are to be done first, and plan those repairs in the order of their necessity and of public service, they may decide that public houses come last, in which case it would not matter how much money the publican was willing to spend; his money would be useless because the Government would be achieving the purpose of controlling the labour by other means than taxing the publican and removing his ability to purchase the labour. Therefore, in contemplation of the Budget, and of this particular Resolution, we must realise that the conception of simply taxing people and removing their power to spend is only one part, and is becoming a less fundamental part, of the Government's power to decide what is to be done by the labour of the country; and I am sure I express the feelings of the country as a

whole that all these measures of taxation, of organising the man-power of the country or of taking the cash from the people in order to divert that man-power to a public purpose, are giving evidence that the Government are going to spare no effort to organise the country to achieve its maximum effort for victory.</p>

<p>In attending the Budget Debates this year, what has struck me is that the level of interest of all the speeches in connection with it has been a great deal higher than on many occasions in the past. The reason is that we have tended to get away from those small details, such as so much on tea, etc., to really big issues. The last speaker has confined himself very largely to some of those broader issues that are raised by the Budget proposals, and, while it is true that the nation as a whole, and certainly we who listened to the Budget being unfolded, have cheerfully and gladly welcomed its savage taxing provisions, it would not perhaps be out of place to recall some of those implications which are inevitable in connection with this rate of taxation.<br/>
Nothing can be more certain than that the standard of life of practically everyone in the country will be completely upset. You have only to think of the extreme of the 19s. 6d. in the &#x00A3; person who lives in a realm of fairyland compared with the rest of us. Everyone of us, even if he has not been living extravagantly, has to recast entirely his standard of life. It is inevitable that in any Budget provisions this ratio must bear more heavily on some than on others. The very wealthy have very heavy commitments and responsibilities of various sorts which are not comprised in the ordinary spending of money on themselves, and they will find it very difficult to reconstruct, even if they are left with a substantial income. I cannot hide from my mind the effect that this is going to have on those great charitable institutions which have so largely been supported by those with considerable wealth. The voluntary hospitals, Dr. Barnado's work, the Waifs and Strays, the Argnes Weston Homes, and hundreds of thousands of charitable organisations have been kept going largely by contributions from the better-to-do. They will suffer very severely and will have to recast their standard of life.<br/>
Then we come down to those of whom I very often think, those with incomes ranging between &#x00A3;500 and &#x00A3;1,000. The man with an earned income of &#x00A3;500, who spends &#x00A3;490 and is &#x00A3;10 to the good, has no cushion to fall back upon. He has commitments of rent, insurance and education, and I think he will find he will have great difficulty. With regard to those who have a cushion to fall back on, these provisions will be tantamount to an elastically applied capital levy, so that two of the great cries that we have often heard from hon. Members opposite, one about the conscription of wealth and the other about the capital levy, are taking place before our eyes. I mention these considerations, because it seems well to bear in mind the position in which we are finding ourselves.<br/>
In this connection I wish to make an appeal or suggestion to the Chancellor of the Exchequer which I have made in the past, and which is, indeed, I may say an annual event. At present, our relations with the United States of America are growing, as we hope, ever closer. The United States are taking an ever-greater part in this world convulsion and we now read that, following in the footsteps of our own Chancellor of the Exchequer, they are about to increase their taxation enormously. Certain people in this country&#x2014;it is true they are fewer to-day because of the Treasury's policy of impounding, as it were, the investments of British citizens in the United States, but there is still a considerable number of them&#x2014;have sources of income on both sides of the Atlantic. These people find that not only are they paying American tax on the source of their American income, but that the same source of income is being taxed at the highest rates over here. Thus they find themselves contributing, not only to the upkeep of an ever-increasing British Navy but also to the upkeep of two United States navies, one for the Atlantic and the other for the Pacific&#x2014;all coming out of the same income.<br/>
I know that there have been great difficulties because it is a question of cooperation with a foreign country, unlike the arrangements which we have been able to achieve with our own Dominions on this matter of double taxation. But at a time like this, when we have had the passing of the Lease and Lend

Act in the United States, when proposals for the actual application of the money has passed Congress and when the speeches that we read and the general atmosphere show a closer outlook on the part that our two countries are playing in this war, I suggest that this is a consideration which might, at least, be put forward. I suggest that a person with interests in the United States should properly have those interests taxed for the defence purposes of the United States but that when it comes to a question of applying the taxation of this country, that the double taxation should be, if not entirely avoided, at least to some extent reduced, because it falls with tremendous additional force on top of the already heavy blows which we are bearing here.<br/>
We, one and all, know that whether this is a 10 per cent, or a 100 per cent, capital levy is immaterial. We have to win this war and everything that any of us has got must be put into the winning of it. At the same time, it is not out of place to bring forward some of these considerations, and 1 hope that the Chancellor may be encouraged by what I have said to take up this question again with the proper authorities and to see whether what seems to be a very heavy unfairness cannot somehow be alleviated. We can with courage say that we are prepared to bear this heavy taxation, but to do so twice over, for two Allies or near-Allies, is, I submit, putting it a little strongly. I hope the Chancellor of the Exchequer, therefore, will see his way at any rate to ventilate this question with our opposite numbers on the other side of the Atlantic.</p>

<p>I would ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer to look into a small problem which has been brought to my notice. I do not propose to dwell on the larger issues of taxation mentioned by the hon. and gallant Member for Yeovil (Sir G. Davies) but I trust that nobody will refrain from making grants to hospitals because of this increased taxation. The point, however, which I desire to raise has come to my notice in this fashion. Deductions are now made by employers from wages, and it has been said several times in favour of this method that what we do not get we do not seem to miss. In the case of a coal miner working at the coal face his


wages are paid from the office of the colliery and the tax is deducted in the ordinary way. I do not know whether the practice applies all over the country but in certain districts it is customary for the coal miner to employ a young man as his assistant. This assistant is known in colliery language in some areas as his "butty." The miner pays this young man's wages himself and a case has been brought to my notice showing that while deductions in respect of Income Tax are made from the wages of certain colliery workers, young men of the type I have described are not taxed at the source. In one case a young man recently received from the Income Tax authorities an account for &#x00A3;8 15s. He was, of course, staggered to find that he had to pay Income Tax to that amount in one lump sum; if deductions had been made from his wages he would probably not have felt it at all. I understand from inquiry that this system applies not only to colliery workers but in some other industries as well where work is on a contract basis; and I would ask the right hon. Gentleman whether some method could not be devised to make regular deductions from., wages to prevent these young people receiving accounts for large amounts of Income Tax dues.</p>

<p>This Resolution imposes a level of Income Tax which is higher than any ever contemplated in the history of this country, either in peace or war, and I am glad that it is not going through without some comment being made upon it. It is true that, on the whole, the proposal to raise the general level of Income Tax to 10s. in the &#x00A3; has been well received in the country. The reason is obvious. With the growing expenditure on the war effort, it is necessary that there should be a growing yield of taxation, and the country is in the mood for sacrifices. It realises that unless we get a greater yield from taxation, our national finance is in danger of being swamped by the whirlwind of inflation. Therefore, the community, as a whole, is willing to bear sacrifices and burdens, but it seems to me that when we get to this abnormal level of taxation, we should bear in mind the whole resources of the community, and have some regard, not only to the income of the individual but also to his capital resources.<br/>
My hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Yeovil (Sir G. Davies) said that taxation at this level, constituted a kind of capital levy. It is true that the individual may have to realise some of his capital in order to meet. his Income Tax demands but the point is that that kind of. capital levy is inequitable. It is a capital levy put on to individuals entirely through their incomes. If you contemplate a capital levy, such levy should have regard to the volume of capital possessed by the person taxed. Take the cases of two individuals each of whom has an income of &#x00A3;2,000. One of these may be in charge, say, of one of Lord Nuffield's factories making war material. Such a person might be regarded, for the purposes of the war, as belonging to the salt of the earth. He may have grown up in his business or profession and while having achieved an income of &#x00A3;2,000 a year, he may have no capital resources. On the other hand, the other person's income of &#x00A3;2,000 may be derived from capital resources which have passed down to him and which may amount to as much as &#x00A3;100,000. Those two people pay precisely the same contribution to our war taxation. We should have regard to the question of the capital resources of the individual when we get a level of Income Tax as high as that of the present time.<br/>
The hon. Member for East Stirling (Mr. Woodburn) mentioned the same point and put the fact that when we get beyond a certain level of Income Tax it tends to interfere with the productive ability of the country. While everybody agrees that sacrifices must be made, we cannot pass this Resolution without making the comment that if a level of Income Tax at 10s. in the &#x00A3; is to be part of our system, we may be causing severe injury to our productive processes and interfering with the growth of that virile section of the community which is coming along, which demands higher wages for increased skill and ability, and whose position is being materially sacrificed in these circumstances. I make these comments to the Chancellor because I am sure that in the commercial and industrial world they have great weight.</p>

<p>I would like to say a word in reply to the hon. Member for East Willesden (Mr. Hammersley), who, we all know, is an advo-


cate of a capital levy or capital tax. What is the use of discussing it in war-time when our prime concern is revenue which comes out of the spending capacity of the population? A capital tax may or may not be equitable, but it cannot be imposed until the capital of the country has been valued.</p>

<p>Having said that it cannot take place without a capital valuation, I think that I have disposed of it. Both my hon. Friend the Member for East Stirling (Mr. Woodburn) and the hon. Member for East Willesden pointed out the appalling height which taxation has reached. It is now so high that we have to view taxation from a rather more realistic point of view than many of the speeches in the House have tended to do. The acceptance of this high taxation by the House of Commons has been very creditable. I remember a predecessor of the right hon. Gentleman putting 3d. on the Income Tax, and he sat down in absolute silence&#x2014;an unusual thing after a Budget speech. Hon. Gentlemen apposite were horrified. When the right hon. Gentleman raised Income Tax to 10s. in the &#x00A3; he was greeted with laughter. We accept this taxation, but it is no use accepting it unless we are prepared to realise how far these proposals are taking us. We are possibly reaching a limit where on certain ranges of income we may get a diminishing return.<br/>
We cannot discuss the effect of this rise to 10s. without some reference to the other part of Income Tax, namely. Surtax, because the two go together. When we get Income Tax and Surtax up to 19s. 6d. maximum, and 19s. practically through the whole range of income, we get to a level where we must consider what the effect will be. It is true, as my hon. Friend has said, that it is bound to have some effect upon initiative and incentive. We have been told often enough in this House and in every Debate in the last 30 years on the subject of Socialism and Capitalism, that the only motive that will drive industry is the motive of private incentive. I do not accept that for a moment, but if we have an industry organised on a basis of private incentive, it is a serious matter to interfere with what

is the very mainspring of the industrial system. I do not say that this is the only motive that can be used in human society, but with our present economic system it is the main motive, and a tax of 19s. in the &#x00A3; is cutting into the root of it. I am not certain that, if this war continues long, we shall not have to extend largely the idea an industry which is not run primarily for profit and not owned by private individuals. That is rather by the way, however, for I want to talk about the question of taxation as such.<br/>
This country, probably for a century, has been the most highly taxed country in the world. Our Income Tax has been so effective because it has always been accepted. The main reason why we can tax and have taxed, and why our taxes are paid, is that in our democracy we impose our own taxation, and it has been accepted voluntarily by the taxpayer. When, however, taxation gets to the present height, or even lower, there is a certain number of people, who do not accept it voluntarily. We all know the vast amount of complicated legislation to prevent avoidance and evasion which we have been compelled to pass in the last 10 or 15 years. That has been due to the fact that a certain element have not voluntarily accepted the taxation that has been imposed and have taken steps to avoid it. This refusal to accept taxation was very noticeable after the stiff increases that were put on by the late Lord Snowden in 1929&#x2013;31 The total increase of tax in the higher ranges of Income Tax and Surtax was then 3s. 3d. The result was that incomes subject to Surtax dropped catastrophically. It may be said that part of the drop was due to the slump. That is so, but not all of it was due to that cause. If we examine the subsequent growth of incomes subject to ordinary taxation and compare it with the growth of that small section of incomes which also pays Surtax, we find that the growth of the total taxable income of the country has been much greater in proportion than the growth of Surtax incomes. Unquestionably steps were taken to avoid the payment of Surtax even when the total Income Tax and Surtax was only 13s. 3d. With the total at 19s. 6d. I do not believe that we shall get Surtax fully paid unless we take further steps along the lines we have been continually compelled to take in the past to make it more and more


difficult to avoid the payment of taxation.<br/>
The present 19s. 6d. is not the only impost which is placed by the Government on income. There is the War Damage Act levy, and on some forms of income 2s. is imposed 'for Mineral Rights Duty and mineral welfare levy. Imposts by the Government on certain ranges of income are now more than 20s. in the &#x00A3;, and every increase in a man's income makes him poorer. That is, I will not say a ridiculous situation, but an anomalous situation, and a situation in which we cannot rely upon steady patriotism to carry us through. I am not objecting to this exceptionally high taxation. I am merely querying whether our machinery as it is now constituted is likely to be effective, in collecting it. The man with &#x00A3;150,000 a year from bricks and mortar can give away &#x00A3;110,000 and be better off from the net income point of view with &#x00A3;40,000 a year than with &#x00A3;150,000 a year. He has to give away &#x00A3;110,000 and leave himself with &#x00A3;40,000 before he reduces his Income Tax, Surtax and war damage contribution to less than 20s. in the &#x00A3;. If the income arises from minerals the same thing applies, though not quite so hardly. Here you have income which is a definite detriment, and one has to be extremely patriotic to go on year after year receiving income, which burns a hole in your pocket.<br/>
I am not suggesting that taxation should be reduced, but I feel that we ought to realise where taxation has got us to, and I think we shall have to introduce certain safeguards. If we realise that the war is going to last, say, three years, why not let us adapt to Income Tax legislation a clause on lines somewhat similar to one that applies to Death Duties. Hon. Members know that gifts <i>inter vivos</i> are taxable if they have been made within three years of death. Our present taxation is a tremendous incentive to a wealthy man to make settlements upon his children&#x2014;I do not mean minors, but adult children. If he makes a seven years settlement, he need not dispose of his capital. If he makes a seven years settlement, the income under the settlement passes out of the higher range of taxation. It is a tremendous saving, particularly where a man is supporting his son or daughter

out of his income. I am not saying whether his action is right or wrong, but I am pointing out the motive. Every settlement of that kind will impose a severe loss upon the Exchequer. Moreover, there must be a tendency not merely to make settlements but to dispose of property to children in order to avoid what might be termed negative income which arises from the property, and that would also help in avoiding death duties later.<br/>
Is it not possible to introduce some such Clause as this&#x2014;that during the period of the emergency any transfer of property without valid consideration, or any trust for seven years, shall bear taxation at the rate of income not necessarily of the disponsor but at the higher rate of either the recipient or the disponsor? I make that suggestion became of the possibility of using a seven years' trust to avoid tax if the tax is payable at the rate of the settlor. If it is taxed at whichever is the higher rate, the recipient's or the dis-ponsor's, that difficulty should begot over. I am not blaming people who get rid of negative income, which is a different thing from getting rid of positive income, however small, but I think we shall have to take some step in face of the tremendous incentive, which will tend to grow, to people to get rid of income which makes them poorer.</p>

<p>I should like to draw attention to another class of taxpayers who will find it more than difficult to meet the obligations they will be called upon to face under the new Income Tax proposals. I refer to working men who earn by wages &#x00A3;200 a year. The Chancellor has taken steps to impose compulsory saving upon them. The only advantage which the Chancellor will gain is that he will have the use of that money for a given period of years free of interest, for thereafter he is going to return it to them. But what about the capacity to pay of all the individuals in this category? However difficult things may be for the man who is called upon to pay taxation up to 19s. 6d. in the &#x00A3; at any rate he has a sufficient number of sixpences left to support him. Things are different with the individuals with &#x00A3;200 a year. Many of them have heavy travelling expenses to meet. I am mindful of the difficulties involved, and I do not blind myself to the fact that a large proportion of the population are by choice residing elsewhere than


where they work, but to-day, with the creation of so many new points of production, there is a big redistribution of large masses of working men and women. One cannot go into any county without coming across a large army of men and women who daily have to be transported considerable distances to their work. That involves them in tremendous expenditure. An outlay of 10s. a week is a normal occurrence in the case of tens of thousands of men and women.<br/>
Now the Chancellor states that we must compel a person with an income of &#x00A3;200 a year to save some of it, which is a very desirable thing if it is possible and practicable. But take the case of a married man with an income of &#x00A3;4 a week. Of that &#x00A3;4, &#x00A3;1 may go in rent and 10s. in travelling expenses. That accounts for 30s. In addition, the cost of living is mounting week by week, and as a result trade unions feel compelled periodically to make applications for increases of wages. To a man in that position this tax, let it be &#x00A3;5, &#x00A3;10, &#x00A3;15 or &#x00A3;20 a year, is an increase in the cost of living. The Chancellor of the Exchequer is imposing a tax which one wav or other is very unequal in its incidence. One man with &#x00A3;200 a year may live near the place where he works, and another man with a similar wage has to travel 20 or 25 miles to work and pay 10s. a week or more in travelling expenses. The problem cannot be disposed of by saying that many people choose to live where they do not work. I am not concerned about those who choose to live away' from their work, but with the case of the man who is compelled to travel to work, because there is no possibility of his living near his work. With all the new points of production which are being set up in the country, one cannot assume that a man will always find accommodation near his work, because it is not available for him. Transport is therefore unavoidable at every step.<br/>
I wish the Chancellor of the Exchequer would most seriously reconsider the factor to which I have referred, because it will affect not only the individuals who have to bear this increased imposition but there will be other effects. I warn the Chancellor now that it will involve trade union practice and negotiations for wages. Speaking as a miner, this must arise. I would regard an increase of Income Tax of &#x00A3;10 or &#x00A3;20 a year as a definite increase in the

cost of living. The Chancellor certainly takes only a loan from my wages until after the war, but what do I get during the period of the war? The Chancellor will take a greater slice of my income than I can afford. Trade unions will therefore be compelled to enter into negotiation for increases of wages because of the increased cost of living represented by this increase of tax. It is therefore reasonable to ask the right hon. Gentleman to consider this matter, with a view to modifying the incidence of the increase of taxation on the lower levels of earned income.</p>

<p>Nobody grudges higher taxation made necessary by the war. It has one advantage, on the basis of realism. The difference between our formerly opposed parties seems to be rapidly disappearing. Nobody could tell from the speeches which we have heard the supposed political allegiance of those who have spoken. I am sorry that my right hon. Friend was not impressed by my efforts to obtain a bachelor tax. Perhaps I was rather keen on the matter, because I imagine that my Division, being almost entirely working-class, has fewer bachelors than almost any other Division in the country. I complain that a considerable number of people with quite large incomes live in flats or hotels and are in such a position that they can pay the extra Income Tax demanded, by drinking water instead of champagne, or something of that kind. It will be easy for them. On the other hand, there are people who can pay the increased Income Tax only by dismissing men whom they employ. It mayor may not be right that great country estates should still be kept up, but it is far more beneficial to the community that gardeners, foresters and people like that should be employed than that money should be spent in towns merely upon living in flats and in other ways that merely concern a single individual.<br/>
Very much on the lines of the speech which was made from the other side a minute ago, I would urge my right hon. Friend to consider, as far as possible, the obligations that fall upon the taxpayer. What has to be investigated is how many people are being supported on particular incomes. A difference in treatment should be accorded between a person who has no dependants and whose income is spent entirely on himself, and


another person who may be supporting 20 or 30 individuals, including the children of those who are working for him. I hope that something will be done on these lines. We must take note of the way in which a man has to spend his income, whether he be in the working class or in any other class of the community. Undoubtedly various schemes will be evolved with the object of dodging taxation which is felt to be unfair. In a foreign country some years ago I was speaking about the English Income Tax, and a comment I received was that the English people must be extraordinarily honest folk not to try to evade taxation on such a scale. It was pointed out. that in very few other countries would it be possible. I urge my right hon. Friend to give consideration to the obligations which have to be met by the incomes on which this taxation is imposed.</p>

<p>Previous speakers have drawn attention to the double taxation from which some people suffer, and I hope that the Chancellor of the Exchequer will look into that matter. I wish to draw his attention to another danger, in the case of people who are making money in America. When the 100 per cent. Excess Profits Tax was imposed, the best brains in the country were brought to bear upon the problem to see how something could be saved. People who were doing very large business with America put their heads together to see how they could accumulate something of the profits they made, and many ways were considered. I have no doubt that some scheme for accumulating profits there and avoiding taxation here was evolved. There are people in this country who have very large interests in America and who would rather let their capital position increase there than have profits coming to this country on which they would have to pay high taxation. I hope that the Chancellor of the Exchequer will, through his Department, and particularly through the Purchasing Commission in America, carry out a thorough investigation of this position.<br/>
I want to put a question to those who are doing business in America and to ask whether there are any delaying commissions. I am certain that, although there may not be agreements, there are many

understandings on the matter. I have in mind people with very large interests in America who are importing and selling in this country. I am certain that they are allowing to accumulatae in America vast sums of money. With very little excuse, some people are sending representatives over there into all kinds of well-paid jobs, taking offices and employing people. I am aware of one instance, although I do not think it will do much harm in this case. The people in question are building up an organisation there at the expense of the British Government which will be very useful to them. Inspectors of taxes have the right to go behind all kinds of arrangements and to refuse to allow certain expenses; I hope that the Chancellor will see that his Department look into this matter from the point of view I suggest. I am sure he will find that in many cases people have agreed to delaying commissions and that staffs are there, receiving some kind of consideration from the higher profit being accumulated in America. The Purchasing Commission should be authorised or instructed to look very closely into this matter. I would ask the Chancellor to consider some methods of taxing capital appreciation in this country. I know the argument against it, that you must set off the costs against it.</p>

<p>I think that not only the House as


a whole but the Chancellor of the Exchequer will agree that we have had a very interesting Debate. As has been said, it has been a Debate that has cut very largely across the ordinary party lines. The only reason for my intervention is that I would like to sum up what has been said. In all the speeches the main agreement has been that with this exceptionally high level of taxation entirely new considerations arise. In the first place it means that certain classes of Income Tax payers will not, and, in fact, cannot, pay their Income Tax out of income, and are forced to pay it out of capital. I will not go further than that, because, if I may say so, Mr. Speaker, you have very properly ruled any further discussions on that matter out of Order. I do feel entitled to say, however, that there must inevitably be a payment of Income Tax out of capital in many cases.<br/>
In the second place, my hon. Friend the Member for Chesterfield (Mr. Benson) has wisely pointed out that with this high level of taxation the incentives to evasion are very much greater than they were before, and the Treasury will have to look into this matter and do everything possible to stop evasion. Thirdly, the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for East Rhondda (Mr. Mainwaring) is a very important one. Whereas people have not bothered about small and necessary expenditure when the rate of tax has been low, they will be forced to deal with that matter now that the rate of tax is high. This question of travelling is certainly one which will have to be very carefully considered, because there may be two people, one of whom has a certain income which is really net income, and the other with an income subject to travelling expenses; it may be possible for a man to get a job near by at one figure and to get a job further off at a higher figure on which he has to pay a certain amount of travelling, and it must be clear that that becomes a serious consideration when the rate of tax is as high as it is. I do not expect the Chancellor of the Exchequer now to say what he is going to do, but I put it to him that the higher the rate of tax, clearly the more essential it is that the administration of the tax should be fair. Therefore, although I do not want him to whittle away the proceeds of taxation, I think he will have to consider being a little more friendly towards Amendments

and concessions for obvious hard cases than he would be if the rate of tax was low. I hope that he will not shut his mind to making concessions which, I hope, will not cut to a large extent into the actual volume of the yield of the tax, but which will relieve it in the cases where it ought to be relieved. I hope that, without committing himself, the Chancellor, with his usual fairness, will say that he will keep an open mind when the time comes when individual concessions may be asked from him during the discussion of the Finance Bill.</p>

<p>I am very much indebted to the House for the observations that have been made. As my right hon. Friend has said, it has been a brief, but a well-informed Debate, and I think that what has been said by all my hon. Friends in all parts of the House really reflects the opinion generally of the country on the Budget. One of the observations which I have drawn from what has been said is that no one has said to me as Chancellor of the Exchequer, "You should not have introduced this Budget." No one has said, "You have gone too far ''. What have been addressed to me, quite rightly, have been words of warning that in many respects the limit has been reached, and that when taxation is as high as it is it is important that the administration should be fair and equitable. I also note what has been said about the danger in relation to evasion. I must say that I recognise that the burdens are pressing so heavily upon everyone that it is a matter which the Exchequer must carefully consider if evidence arises, and they must deal with any atttempts at evasion of this kind. In fact, I myself think that at this time evasion is almost doubly an offence, and I hope it will not arise.<br/>
I would like to make one or two observations in answer to some of the questions which have been put to me. I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for East Stirling (Mr. Woodburn) will communicate to me the case of the Civil servant who apparently had some increase in his remuneration and was then worse off, but I notice that my hon. Friend slipped in the words" and other circumstances arising out of the war "</p>

<p>We can always think of those cases, but I would not like to see it in flaring headlines in the papers tomorrow that the hon. Member for East Stirling put forward a case of a man who was actually worse off on account of the rise in Income Tax despite an increase in his salary.<br/>
My hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Yeovil (Sir G. Davies) mentioned how people will undoubtedly have to face very considerable difficulties and hardships arising from the tax. It is also to be noted&#x2014;and it should be noted in fairness to the Budget&#x2014;that instances have been given concerning all sections of the community. Complaints in that respect have not been confined to any particular section. I think the counterpart of those considerations is that in imposing the burdens that have arisen from this Budget I have endeavoured to deal fairly with all sections of the community. The fact, of course, is reflected in one way by the fact that many of my hon. Friends have pointed out how various sections of the community will suffer. My hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Yeovil said that voluntary hospitals and other charities will suffer or be inconvenienced in that respect. I comfort myself so far as voluntary hospitals are concerned, because a great proportion of the assistance that they are now receiving, and, in fact, the assistance which has saved so many of them, does not come from subscriptions of large sums of money but from regular contributions which are made week by week by large sections of the community all over the country. Therefore, much as I would regret the withdrawal of subscriptions, I am not so apprehensive in that respect as otherwise I would be. I will take note of the suggestions about the question of double taxation. This, of course, is a matter for mutual arrangement.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Westhoughton (Mr. Rhys Davies) raised the

case of people employed in collieries; apparently, from what he said, there are other people engaged with them, rather on a sub-contracting basis. He asked what was. their position. I will look into that and see if anything further can be done, but the view we have taken up to the moment is that in the case of colliery workers who are employed on a sub-contracting basis, tax is not deducted at the source. It is not because we do not believe in it or think it necessary, but because we feel that it might be held unreasonable or impracticable to expect the sub-contractor to assume the burden of keeping the necessary records, which are, of course, essential for the collection of tax. It is really a matter of balance as to whether we ought to impose upon someone in that position the keeping of a lot of books. I made inquiries while my hon. Friend was speaking, and I have been informed that in a good many of these cases Income Tax stamps are bought, which rather eases the position as far as such people are concerned.</p>

<p>May I offer a suggestion to the right hon. Gentleman? In the case of collieries, it might be possible for the Treasury to make arrangements for some employ&#x00E9; of the colliery, say a clerk, to act as adviser to these people, and actually arrange, in an individual capacity, to keep the records and act as agent of the Treasury.</p>

<p>I will certainly explore that suggestion and see if it is practicable. On the one hand one wants to avoid keeping a lot of records, and on the other hand one is confronted with the difficulty occasioned when men receive demands for tax which they might find it difficult to pay all at once.<br/>
I am indebted for what my hon. Friend the Member for Chesterfield (Mr. Benson) said. I listened with care and attention, because I heard what he said to me on the last occasion when I introduced a Budget, and if the hon. Members will refer to what he said then, they will see that in many respects I have adopted the suggestions which he made. People often say that I do not take much notice of suggestions, but occasionally I do. He advised me not to hesitate to impose burdens, and he was fair enough to say that they should be imposed all along the line. He did not, as some hon. Members


do on occasions, suggest that one section of the community ought to bear the whole burden while the other is let off. He was quite definite and quite courageous and said that this was the sort of Budget which he himself would introduce, spreading the burden right from top to bottom, except, of course, for the very small incomes. We will study what he has said about the question of tax evasion. As a matter of fact, I am already considering that in connection with the Excess Profits Tax, but there is a difference in that case, because the Excess Profits Tax is one which we regard as being of a temporary nature, arising from the war, and in regard to which we have not always been able to bring in provisions to deal with attempts at evasion. It is only fair to say that, while so far as Income Tax evasion is concerned, people do sometimes have a run, the Inland Revenue, the Finance Act and the House of Commons generally overtake them, and in this connection it may also be observed that in many cases where provision has been brought in to deal with evasion it has been made retrospective. People who wish to evade taxation will therefore have to bear in mind the growing tendency to make such provisions retrospective, "and they will do that sort of thing at their peril.<br/>
I will also look into the question of travelling expenses raised by my hon. Friend the Member for East Rhondda (Mr. Mainwaring). It is exceedingly difficult, as my hon. Friends will appreciate, to endeavour to apply the law to particular cases of this character. At the moment, travelling expenses incurred wholly, exclusively and necessarily in connection with employment are allowed &#x2014;that covers, for instance, the case of the commercial traveler&#x2014;but not travelling expenses to and from a place of business. I will also note what my hon. Friend the Member for East Middlesbrough (Mr. A. Edwards) said on the question of America and tax evasion there.</p>

<p>Before the Chancellor leaves the question of travelling expenses, I would like to point out that there are cases in which the Ministry of Labour actually sends a man to special work some long distance away, and it may be almost conditional that he travels backwards and forwards. If it is a condition of employment that he must pay travelling expenses out of his wages, or if he is

allowed travelling expenses by his employer, does not that absolve him from paying Income Tax on the expenses allowed for travelling? If a man's wage is &#x00A3;3 a week, and he gets a job somewhere else which involves the payment of &#x00A3;1 a week travelling expenses, which are paid by the employer, has the man to pay Income Tax on that &#x00A3; 1 a week travelling allowance, in addition to the Income Tax on his own income?</p>

<p>Why is it that a commercial traveller is to be in this unique position of being allowed this concession? In my own constituency there are thousands of people who are going to be placed in the position of paying from 9s. to 15s. a week in travelling expenses because of the "blitz." Is any allowance" to be made for that? It is not, by any stretch of imagination, of their own freewill: they have been "blitzed"&#x2014;bombed out of their homes&#x2014;and some of them have had to go 45 miles away. Surely the Chancellor of the Exchequer will give some sympathetic consideration to men placed in such a situation.</p>

<p>May I ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer to give us a fuller explanation as to why there is this distinction? I am informed by my right hon. Friend that there is a difference between travelling while at work and travelling to and from work. Would it not be advantageous to make the position clearer?</p>

<p>The present position is as I have stated. I take it that the reason is this: when travelling expenses are so intimately associated with the work upon which a man is engaged, as in the case of a commercial traveller, the law at present is that those expenses are allowed, but, as I have said, the expenses of travelling to and from a place of employment have not up to the present been allowed. The distinction has been made purely because in the case of the commercial traveller these expenses are so wrapped up with the course of his business and employment.<br/>
My right hon. Friend the Member for East Edinburgh (Mr. Pethick-Lawrence) summed up very fairly a good many of


the considerations that have arisen in connection with the Debate. It is obvious that when heavy impositions of this kind are imposed there must be hardship. I think this hardship will be borne cheerfully, because it is essential to victory. One can only hope that it is of a limited and temporary character. I was faced, and every Member of the House has been faced, with the fact that the alternative would be much worse for the great mass of the community, and particularly for&#x2014;for lack of a better description&#x2014;the lower sections. If these steps had not been taken, we might have been in for a very serious period of rapid inflation, in which a great deal more suffering would have been inflicted. That is what we have to take into consideration in connection with the Budget Resolutions. I have no doubt that the general opinion of the House will be that the course we have taken, although a very hard one, is the best.</p>

<p>This question of men living some distance from their work is becoming a very serious one. Thousands of people, not only miners, now live a long distance from their work. I think it is a desirable social improvement; people should not be living on top of pitheaps. I add my plea to that of my hon. Friend the Member for Dumbarton Burghs (Mr. Kirkwood) to the

Chancellor, to consider the whole matter. With Income Tax operating on very low wages, these payments of 8s. to 12s. a. week in travelling expenses are a very serious consideration.</p>

<p>This was one of the Resolutions which I welcomed more than any others. At present, the opportunity given to farmers to dodge backwards and forwards between Schedule B and Schedule D puts them in the position that they can practically avoid payment of any Income. Tax whatever. I am not sure how far this Resolution is going until we have the Finance Bill before us, but I hope that the Clause will be a wide and embracing one and that it will put a stop to the avoidance of taxation, which has been permissible hitherto. I am not sure whether every farmer is going on Schedule D&#x2014;possibly this will apply only to farmers of a certain acreage or rental&#x2014;but I hope that it will prevent even these farmers coming below the prescribed rental from dodging backwards and forwards between Schedule B and Schedule D in order, primarily, to avoid taxation.</p>

<p>As the hon. Member has said, it will be much easier to discuss this when we have the actual terms of the Bill, but I would point out that this measure was first foreshadowed by my right hon. Friend the Minister of Agricul-


ture in June last, when he announced the crop prices for the 1940 crop; and after that my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in reply to a Question in this House in August, said that this provision would be included in the Finance Bill. I merely say that to show that it is not unexpected by the people who are to be caught by the proposal. It is not to apply to all farmers, of course, but only to the larger farmers. The present intention is that it will apply to farmers coming above the limit of &#x00A3;300 annual value. That annual value may not be all in one farm; it will govern the farmers' farming operations in different places, so as to bring farmers more in line with the general system of taxation of trading. I do not think the hon. Gentleman will wish me to take the matter further than that. As I think my right hon. Friend said in his Budget speech, we expect the additional yield of the tax to be &#x00A3;1,000,000 this year, and &#x00A3;3,000,000 in a full year.</p>

<p>I would urge the right hon. and gallant Gentleman not to limit the Clause to &#x00A3;300 annual value, at any rate as far as the option to dodge backwards and forwards from one Schedule to another is concerned. That dodging backwards and forwards is primarily for tax avoidance. If the small farmer cannot be bothered to make out the Schedule D return normally, he ought not to have the option of making it out when it suits him and then dodging back to Schedule B.</p>

<p>Certainly. I am at the disposal of the House, and when it is necessary to speak I am willing to do so. This Resolution carries out the proposal which was adumbrated by my right hon. Friend in this House on 18th December, when he made his statement

about the improved Personal Injuries (Civilians) Scheme. The point is that, having made the arrangement&#x2014;which we are not discussing now&#x2014;on the personal injuries scheme, the Government came to the conclusion that it was very important that there should not be permissible an allowance for Income Tax purposes on payments which might be made by employers in schemes, whether directly by way of premiums or contributions in regard to war injuries. Where the Excess Profits Tax of 100 per cent, works, if that form of compensation for war damage were to be a permissible charge, it would in fact mean that to a large extent it would be financed by the State, the State having come to the conclusion that the personal injuries scheme should be dealt with by way of State grants. The House will agree that there should be no allowances made if, in spite of the announcement of last December, such schemes have been introduced, or are continuing. It is in order to get over that difficulty that this Resolution has been introduced.</p>

<p>This Resolution is to allow Clauses to be introduced into the Finance Bill to strengthen the machinery for the collection of Schedule A, which I am sure is a matter very near to the heart


of the hon. Gentleman, because he has mentioned it in previous Budget Debates. The existing machinery has for some time past, as fie and other hon. Members know, in certain cases, been found difficult, and, of course, the higher the rate of tax, the more serious become the difficulties of collection and of loss arising out of difficulties of collection. The first paragraph of the Resolution deals with what one would have thought was rather a curious point, and that is, that the validity of the Schedule A assessment is sometimes challenged, because in order to be valid at present it has to contain the name of the person who is the landlord. One would have thought that that was not very difficult, but curiously enough, cases arise where that difficulty has to be met. Sometimes it is merely a change of ownership. I daresay that at the moment, with the devastated houses, that difficulty may very easily increase. Sometimes we have had cases where there has been deliberate evasion in tenement buildings, and landlords sometimes conceal their identity by having the properties which they have acquired put into the names of relations or nominees. If that sort of thing happens, the collectors have a great deal of trouble in identifying, and therefore in carrying out, the preliminary necessity of having the name of the landlord on the assessment.<br/>
It is in order to deal with that point that we shall propose in the Finance Bill that the tax shall be recoverable from the person who was in fact the landlord of the property on 1st January. If, through one or other of these occurrences, his name does not actually appear on the assessment form, he will be given the opportunity of proving that he is not the landlord. He will be assumed to be the landlord, and it will be for him to prove that he is not. I do not think there is anything of which anybody could really complain in regard to that point.<br/>
The second part of the Resolution says:
<q>Further provision shall be made as to the persons from whom and the manner in which tax under Schedule A shall be recoverable.</q>
At present, if you have an unwilling landlord, the means of collecting Schedule A is sometimes unduly laborious, if it is not appropriate to have court proceedings. There is the statutory power of collecting from the tenant, who then deducts any

tax from the rent. In the straight case that is pretty easy, but in the case of large blocks of flats or tenements there is no statutory power for collecting. It is obvious that you cannot get all Schedule A through a named tenant, nor is there any particular reason why you should name the tenants if there are 30 or 40 of them, and this part of the Resolution is in order to bring in some arrangement to cover that point. I do not think that it is necessary now to say exactly what we have in mind, but that is the object of the Resolution. The wording of the third part of the Resolution says that it
<q>shall apply to past and future assessments, for whatever year of assessment.</q>
That is not retrospective taxation. It enables the Revenue to collect tax which has already been assessed, and which has fallen due and ought already to have been paid.</p>

<p>I would like to offer a few observations upon this Resolution. I think that the country will have received with satisfaction the decision of the Chancellor of the Exchequer not to reduce the Excess Profits Tax. A great campaign was started claiming that the 100 per cent, should be reduced, and while there may have been some arguments in favour of that, there can be no moral justification in this war for mere dividend-drawers obtaining extra profits out of the war. The question therefore arises as to whether there is any expediency in reducing it, and the main argument adduced is that the profit incentive stimulates greater activity. We must agree that the existence of the 100 per cent. Excess Profits Tax has a tendency to make some people sit back and not exert themselves as they might otherwise do to increase productivity and improve the efficiency of the war machine. That will occur especially when the people concerned with the ownership of the shares and the property are in control of the management. Where


the management is separate from the ownership of the firm, the tendency will not exist to the same extent.<br/>
The other argument is that the profit incentive tends to cause waste. It is perhaps in this regard that the greatest danger arises from the 100per cent. Excess Profits Tax. As a member of the Select Committee on National Expenditure, I naturally have received complaints from Members of waste which has been brought to their notice, and the House will be surprised at the number of cases in which workers who are employed in camps and in factories have complained to their Members of Parliament about money being poured out in a wasteful fashion where they are employed. I myself have had complaints from workers that though they have been paid their wages, they have been given nothing to do. I have had complaints from owners of works, and workers in factories, about certain firms which have induced men to go to their works, have asked them to look as busy as possible, and have paid them overtime for doing nothing. That, at first sight, may seem quite unjustifiable, but there are certain explanations. At one firm of this kind the case of which I investigated, I found that production had been held up for want of a part, which meant that the firm was faced with the alternative of disposing of workers or paying them for doing nothing.<br/>
In other cases, however, there is no question that there has been unjustifiable waste. Some of these cases have been reported to the House by the Select Committee on National Expenditure. I want to make it clear that the workers in this country do not want to be paid for doing nothing and that they themselves are as indignant about this kind of thing as anybody could be. In this connection one disadvantage arises. It has been shown clearly, that the action of firms, who pour out money in wasteful fashion by offering people anything they like for the work they are to do, brings into contempt, in the mind of the worker, the whole of the Chancellor's appeals for economy and avoidance of waste. It strikes them that there is something wrong with the machinery of Government when firms are obtaining such prices for goods that they can afford to throw away money. The 100per cent. Excess Profits Tax has given some excuse, because anything

firms accumulate beyond the standard profits goes to the Government, and obviously the Government are paying for it.<br/>
The Government, I understand, are keeping a strict eye on the question of firms using revenue to build up capital appreciation. In the last war some pits, during the period of control, were able to fit themselves out with most up-to-date machinery. When the war was over and control disappeared, this was brought in as depreciation of capital and a great issue of bonus shares took place. I am satisfied that the Government are doing their best to keep a strict eye on this matter but there are cases in which that strict supervision is actually having a disadvantageous effect. My hon. friend the member for Dumbarton Burghs (Mr. Kirkwood) explained that in his constituency certain workers were suffering from the effects of the recent "blitz." It is true that the normal way of life has in many cases disappeared from there and therefore, there is a necessity of creating the communal kind of life that is only possible where canteens are established. I understand that one of the large firms there put forward as a reason for not building a canteen the statement that the Government would not allow them to build or run a canteen out of their excess profits. If that is the case I suggest that while it may be selfish and reprehensible on the part of the firm to do such a thing, in the circumstances there should be some relaxation in that respect if that is the only way in which canteens can be obtained. In many cases we have to submit to expediency. It is wrong to bribe people during a war but it may be the only way in which we can get things done and, therefore, however immoral it may be from one standpoint, from the point of view of getting the job done the Chancellor might take that into consideration.<br/>
If you abolished the profits of dividend-drawers it would not necessarily produce one extra screw, because people drawing dividends are not taking any part in the productive work of the country. Workers have been given piece-work and bonuses and while people might think that some other methods should be adopted to increase production I, and others who have had long experience of industry, think


that no other method could produce such an intensity of production and such carefulness as this method. If a man is paid for producing goods in the proper fashion and with proper accuracy, and by some inducement he produces more, then there is no question of the efficacy of the method. But in many cases there is no inducement at all to the people who run businesses and to draftsmen, technicians and those responsible for improvements in design and methods. The 100 percent, duty may mean that owners of businesses will discourage managements from taking any steps to improve the efficiency of war production if such is likely to reduce the potentiality of that firm for profits after the war.<br/>
If extra profits are not to improve production the Chancellor might consider some method of allowing, as part of the expenses of industry, bonuses to men who are running the management side. and in many cases are working 18 to 20 hours a day. I gave an example in an earlier Debate of one such man who is now in the' service of the Government in a voluntary capacity. By his ingenuity he actually made it possible to produce, during this war, shells at a rate that would not have seemed conceivable during the last war. Less than one-tenth of the time taken during the last war is now spent on machining and fitting. If a person is doing that kind of work, there should be some recognition of it in some form or other, although I am perfectly certain that this man did not do. it for personal gain. Some people, however, sit back because they are getting no inducement. The Ministry of Supply has the responsibility of maintaining the efficiency of industry and it can only do that by recruiting a sufficient number of inspectors to check industry throughout the country. The Minister places thousands of contracts during a month and it is a physical impossibility for a Government Department to deal not only with the inspection of contracts but with the question of the efficiency of all the firms.<br/>
Therefore, whether we like it or not, we are thrown back on the fact that we must rely on the industrial organisation which exists at present, and must make it work to the best of its ability and raise itself to the maximum efficiency. In considering the whole question of excess profits, I

would like the Chancellor to go very carefully into the relationship of the 100 per cent. Excess Profits Tax to efficiency in industry. There is no question that in some places there is slacking. In one case of which I know, some of the big combines have actually deterred and prevented to some extent the bringing in of highly efficient firms from outside simply because the big firms are more concerned with what is to happen to them after the war than with the prosecution of the war. It is a great disadvantage if all the inducement that is provided to industry is that they must hope for their profits after the war. Undoubtedly this causes the combines to give their attention not to finding the best methods of producing for the war, but to finding the best methods of evading their responsibility during the war and building up for themselves a favoured position in order that after the war they may scoop the market.<br/>
This is a conflict of interests for which I cannot see a remedy, but if I were to name any one thing that handicaps our production at this time more than anything else, I should say that it is the question of many firms and great organisations sacrificing what they could do now in order to safeguard their position after the war. This is the one thing, as far as my observations go, that has played the biggest part in retarding our production, and it is a matter in which the 100 per cent. Excess Profits Tax is very much involved. I think the Excess Profits Tax may have to be carried on for a considerable period-after the war, and if firms realised that, they might get down to the job now, and not be so much concerned about the future.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend the Member for Stirling and Clackmannan, East (Mr. Woodburn) said he was pleased that this Resolution did not mean any reduction in the Excess Profits Tax. If I have read the Budget statement correctly, there is to be a reduction of 20 per cent, at some time or other. The wording is somewhat vague, but behind it there is the purpose that at some later time the people who are now paying 100 per cent. Excess Profits Tax will get back 20 per cent. This concession is made because it has been found that these patriots, the men of business who have controlled the affairs of the country for some time, feel


now that they ought no: to pay away 1oo per cent, of their excess profits, and if the Government insist on that, they adopt some other means of getting their own back. My hon. Friend spoke about waste. That is one of the various means these people are adopting. They are blackmailing the Chancellor by saying that they will retard production unless he does something for them, and that they will do what they can to get the money back, irrespective of what may happen to the war effort. I had expected some thing different from that. It was my opinion that the Government did a very good thing for these people when they adopted, after negotiations, the standard years of 1935, 1936 and 1937 as being a fair period &#x2014;</p>

<p>The Resolution begins by saying "that the extent and incidence of Excess Profits Tax&#x00BD;" Surely, whether the Excess Profits Tax is 10 per cent. or 100 per cent, is a matter of its incidence and its extent.

<p>I am entirely in your hands, Colonel Clifton Brown. I take the Resolution to mean that in some way or other something will be given back to the employing classes after the war. If that were not the case, there would be no reduction and the tax would remain at 100 per cent., and there would be no trouble on that point. I want to argue on the lines of why the change has been made. The position we are in when we are defending the Budget in the country&#x2014; which I do, on the whole, because I think it is a good one&#x2014;is that we are asked why, seeing that the limit for Income Tax has been lowered so as to bring in more workers, we are allowing very rich people to get away with excess profits. Before the Budget was introduced, 1 knew that attempts were being made by many interests to get the Chancellor to make a reduction in the Excess Profits Tax. The Government have no right to alter the position with regard to the Excess Profits Tax simply because of such pressure. If people adopt the means which they are adopting to defeat the end which the Chancellor has in view, those people ought to be dealt with accordingly. I take it that the sum of money that will accumulate out of the 100 per cent, tax will be tabulated, and that at the end of the war certain money will be handed back to those people who can prove that they have a right to it.</p>

<p>This is a question which, we know, is very much in the minds of the public. I thought the discussion was "Brought within the Rules of Order by the inclusion of the words "the avoidance of tax." We have recollections of the kind of efforts which were made during the last war to defeat the objects of a similar tax, and to prevent the money being collected by the State and becoming public revenue. I have in mind examples of palatial offices&#x2014;I pass one of these every time I go home&#x2014; which were completely unnecessary, and were built almost entirely for the purpose of avoiding the payment of Excess Profits Duty. There are all kinds of dodges of that kind about which we have heard. To-day we are living in a new generation, and are more aware of the sort of things which took place during the last war. Although I belong to that generation, I must point out that very great attention will be paid to these

matters. As I said, I thought the discussion was covered by the inclusion of the words "the avoidance of tax." We know these methods of avoidance involve all kinds of fancy schemes. Therefore, I think it will be of interest to the House and the country to know from the Government what steps are being taken to see that in this war, as distinct from the last, the tax is not dodged and avoided in the same shameful way.</p>

<p>Perhaps it would help the House, as you, Mr. Deputy-Speaker, have ruled that we cannot discuss the Excess Profits Tax issue, if I briefly explained what these Resolutions are about. Hon. Members could then see whether they really wished to discuss them. This Resolution deals with two or three very technical points which, in the Finance Bill, are bound to be discussed. There will obviously be opportunities later on for hon. Members to discuss particular points on the relevant Clauses of the Finance Bill. They may, if they wish, even have an opportunity" of discussing them on the Second Reading of the Bill. This Resolution is merely for the purpose of altering the law in regard to certain technical points. I do not think, taking the first Resolution, that the particular abuse, which the hon.

Of course, if there are any possibilities of avoiding the tax, we shall stop them up. A few devices have come to our notice and we propose to deal with them. Apparently it is possible that some artificial arrangements may be made, such


as the amalgamation of businesses which have no natural affinity, the purpose of which is to reduce the excess profits made by the prosperous business by setting them off against the deficiencies suffered by the less prosperous business. I think the way to describe that is "buying a standard." It is proposed to introduce a specific provision to deal with any such arrangements.<br/>
Another conceivable instance is that of a director of a director-controlled company owning more than 5 per cent, of the shares. His remuneration, as a consequence, is disallowed in computing the company's Excess Profits Tax. It is conceivable that he might transfer some of his shares to his wife to reduce his holding to less than5 per cent. Hon. Members may find two or three other devices have emerged, but they will be dealt with. Then a small technical alteration is required in regard to interconnected companies in regard to the chargeable accounting periods. It will be necessary to provide there for some apportionment of the profits and standards in cases where the chargeable accountable periods of these are partly before and partly after March, 1940.The reference to the relief with regard to deficiencies and profits to be given in parts of His Majesty's Dominions outside the United Kingdom is only to correct some drafting powers; but we have to take the powers in the Resolution. With regard to paragraph (<i>b</i>) that is an arrangement for concentrating industry and deals with the same point as was dealt with in the Sixth Resolution. Paragraph (<i>c</i>) deals with the point which I explained just now with regard to the Seventh Resolution. They are all important points but they are not of the same calibre as the general issue of the maintenance of the Excess Profits Tax at 100 per cent, or otherwise.</p>

<p>I am somewhat uneasy about one point in the Resolution. It starts off by saying:
<q>The incidence shall be varied so as to give effect (<i>a</i>) to amendments as to standard profits.</q>
I am very much in favour of amending the standard profits. As a matter of fact I would reduce them until they disappeared altogether, but I am told if you do not give the incentive of profit, the ruling class, the employers, will sabotage industry. If they will sabotage because of 100 per cent, excess profits, what will they do if we reduce standard profits?</p>

<p>I am dealing with these two proposals as to standard profits. I am suspicious that the intention is to enable them to increase standard profits. I want to see them reduced. If I argue against the standard profits being increased, they will say to me, "If we are not in a position to increase standard profits in certain cases, the employers will sabotage industry." The hon. Member for East Stirling (Mr. Woodburn) has a remedy. He says, "Get inspectors." What is the use of inspectors? The firms get to know when the inspector is coming round and polish up the place and everybody is told to look busy. If the intention is to increase standard profits I shall vote against it. The Minister of Labour will tell you that one guarantee against


the sabotaging of industry is to get a powerful, well-organised body of independent shop stewards. The hon. Member for Dumbarton Burghs (Mr. Kirkwood) was a foreman in a factory and he had the finest body of "Red" shop stewards that it was possible to get.</p>

<p>The Amendments raise a point which, as far as I have been able to find, has not been raised before. In view of your Ruling, Colonel Clifton Brown, I propose to speak on the Question, "That the Clause stand part of the Bill." I shall divide the Committee on this, because it is an important matter. I understand that the 1930 Act is the Act upon which this Bill is based, and I want to draw attention to the 1919 Act upon which in turn the 1930Act was based. It gives the Treasury powers for borrowing similar to those which applied in 1900, 1902 and 1914&#x2013;18. Great changes have been brought about since that period. We have mechanised and modernised the Army, and, in our view, it is time that our methods of raising finance were modernised. It is for that purpose that we put down the Amendments which have been ruled out of Order, and' for that reason we intend to oppose Clause I. Section I of the principal Act states that the


Treasury may borrow as they think fit on the security of the Consolidated Fund. We contend that it is the duty of this Committee as representing the nation to see that the Treasury carry out the powers which the principal Act gives to them. That is not being done now.<br/>
Why should the Government, which represents a nation, pay the banks to lend them the nation's own credit? Why cannot the Government raise their own credit on the security of the Consolidated Fund as the Act lays down? Because of what has taken place in the past we on this side feel strongly upon this matter, and many Members on the other side, had they known this question was coming on, would have shown that they felt strongly too. In war time, in order to encourage people to save and to reduce unnecessary consumption, it is sound policy to secure the maximum sale of National Savings Certificates. In that case the payment of interest is justifiable, but there is no justification in these days for the continued payment of interest to the extent of millions of pounds on bank-created credit. Had our Amendments been adopted the nation would have been able to save millions of pounds which are now being paid out in unnecessary interest on bank-created credit. In his Budget statement the Chancellor made reference to the work of the Select Committee on National Expenditure. I have read every report of that Committee and I want to join in paying tribute to the great contribution the Committee has made to the war effort. At the same time, however, we continue to adopt Victorian methods of obtaining our own credit. We say that we ought to obtain it on the security of the Consolidated Fund. The time has arrived when the Government ought to grant themselves credit by vote of Parliament and on the nation's security.<br/>
The Lease and Lend Bill is a new idea, and wherever I have gone I have found that people in all walks of life have welcomed it. Surely it is a logical step to take for us to adopt similar unorthodox methods in this country. The situation is so serious that we cannot continue Victorian methods of raising credit. The National Debt is now &#x00A3;11,394,000,000, according to the final statement presented to us in the Budget Debate. The interest alone on that debt will cost the nation &#x00A3;250,000,000 a year. I suggest that as a

result of the last Resolution we have passed we shall not be able to ascertain in future what we are really paying out in interest on the National Debt. If I understand the Resolution correctly, it will mean that in future when blue papers are placed before us on Budget Day, we shall not be able to ascertain, to the same extent as in the past, what interest we are paying on the National Debt. The creation of our own credit would be an unorthodox step of a progressive character.<br/>
The Government are very gradually mobilising the whole resources of the country, and that provides support for my next point. The minutes of the Macmillan Committee stated that the creation of credit or loans by banks is the creation of power to employ labour, and that, therefore, the only limit is the amount and quality of unemployed labour. As a result of the great effort which is being made by the Ministry of Labour hardly any unemployed are left, and there was never a more opportune moment for introducing the unorthodox progressive step that we suggest, which is of the same kind as that which has been introduced in America. Section 3 (<i>a</i>) of the principal Act contains the words,
<q>charging on the Consolidated Fund any remuneration payable to the Bank of England in respect of the management of securities under the Act.</q>
I would like to ask what is the total amount that has been paid to the Bank of England for managing these securities since 1939. Why cannot the Treasury themselves manage the securities which have been taken over in order to assist us in financing the war? To borrow the genuine savings of the people is sound in war time, but to pay others to grant us our own credit is out of date and mid-Victorian. We were desirous of moving the Amendments which have been ruled out of Order in order to alter that and to save the nation millions of pounds. As a result of the trade union movement spending thousands of pounds in educating young men, more and more of them are getting a grasp of economic and financial questions. Too long have the people of this country been exploited in this way and too long have we been prepared to accept Victorian ideas. Everything in life is being speeded up and modernised. The Army, Navy and Air Force have been modernised, and we should take the


logical step of modernising the methods of raising our own credit. In these serious times the Committee should be prepared to consider a reasonable step of this kind.</p>

<p>As there are pretty well the same Members here now as when I last spoke, may I be allowed to say that when I said that the last Resolution which we took in the House was concerned with this Bill I was in error. I was looking at the one below on my Paper, which had already been passed, I apologise to the House most humbly for the error which I made. What that Resolution did refer to was borrowing, as my right hon. Friend said in his Budget statement, as regards the Sinking Fund. If any hon. Member was misled by what I said I am very sorry, and I hope he will see my correction now.<br/>
On this Clause the hon. Member for Stoke (Mr. Ellis Smith) seems to be raising the whole question of our financial policy and our borrowings both now and in the years since the last war. If I may respectfully say so, it is a very interesting topic, but the Clause itself is a narrower one. It is the one by which we are taking power for borrowing this year. It does not deal with the conditions, but merely makes it possible for us to borrow, and, as I said yesterday, it is limited, as was the first National Loans Act to the amount of Supply which would be granted during the year. You cannot borrow more than the amount of Supply voted, plus, as the last word says, &#x00A3;250,000,000. It is necessary to ask Parliament for a little more than the Supply, because with the difficult system of financing through Votes of Credit as well as taxation one cannot be sure of one's dates with the particularity which is possible in peace-time, and that is why we have to ask for a margin. That is all that this Clause is concerned with, the power to raise money. If at any time hon. Members wish to bring before us various conditions which they think ought to be inserted in our borrowing powers, they can find opportunities for calling attention to their suggestions by means of Questions, or by Debates devoted to that purpose, but this Clause merely enables the Government to borrow this maximum.</p>

<p>We have had a very interesting point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke (Mr. Ellis Smith), and it is one to which I think we do right to pay attention, but I would submit to him that it would be a little unfortunate if he were to Divide the Committee on this particular Clause, because it says nothing about the raising of the money, nothing about whether it is raised on the credit of the nation or from the banks or individuals, and a vote against this Clause might be construed, really, as a vote against the war effort.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1941-04-23a.228.1" hansard_membership_id="12256" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/29261" speakername="Mr. E. Smith" colnum="228" time="">
<p>I want to assure my right hon. Friend and the whole Committee that there is no intention of that kind behind my remarks. I want to make that quite clear. In addition to that, may I draw attention to the fact that Section 1 of the principal Act speaks of the power of the Treasury to raise money, and states that it shall include the power to raise any money required for any Supply, and later it adds:
<q>and in addition a sum not exceeding &#x00A3;250,000,000.</q>
Now surely upon that Section the question of raising money under the principal Act arises, because you cannot construe this Clause without reading the principal Act. I have read the principal Act, and if I understand it correctly it is the principal Act that gives the Treasury power to borrow in the way they are doing; and in my view it is time they borrowed on the basis of the principal Act, that is, on the Consolidated Fund.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1941-04-23a.228.2" hansard_membership_id="12840" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/19492" speakername="Mr. Pethick-Lawrence" colnum="228" time="">
<p>My hon. Friend has made another speech along the same lines as his earlier speech, but it has not changed my view in the slightest. I was very careful not to suggest for a moment that my hon. Friend was desirous of crippling the war effort. I quite appreciate that, and should not attribute any such improper motive to him. But what I did say, and I think it is correct, is that people who did not know the integrity of my hon. Friend, and people who did not happen to listen to his speech, might construe a vote given against this Clause as a vote given against the war effort. I think that is indisputable, and therefore J think it would be very unfortunate if he decided to Divide the Committee. With regard to his reference to the principal Act, my hon. Friend is not seeking to


repeal the original Act and to substitute something else. I do not know whether he could have framed an Amendment that would have conveyed his meaning, but the particular Amendment which he did frame, which no doubt conveys meaning as far as it could, has not passed the Chair, and for that, of course, none of us is responsible.<br/>
I would remind my hon. Friend that my hon. Friend the Member for Leigh (Mr. Tinker), whose name was also down to the Amendment, but who has not spoken on the Question of the Clause standing part, succeeded recently in getting a very substantial modification introduced into our legislation dealing with finance. I think the Chancellor of the Exchequer was most forthcoming on that occasion when, in accordance with a proposal made by the hon. Member for Leigh, he did make a very substantial alteration in a Measure which was in time-honoured form. Had my hon. Friend who has raised this matter on the Question of the Clause standing part been able to move his Amendments then, whether one agreed with him or not, at any rate his action could not have been misunderstood. Put, those Amendments being out of Order, to propose to vote against the Clause itself, in which the point really does not arise, would be rather unfortunate, and I hope he will not do it, because&#x2014;he did not bring the matter to the attention of myself or any of my hon. Friends who are likely to take part in this Debate&#x2014;I should have to ask those who sit on these benches to vote against him and to ask for the Whips to be put on. I hope my hon. Friends will not put me into that awkward position, because I do not want to quarrel with him on this matter. It would, however, be very unfortunate if any large body of Members were to be counted in the Lobby against the Clause, which simply says that he Treasury shall have power to borrow for the prosecution of the war such sums as may be required plus the extra &#x00A3;250,000,000. Therefore I do hope that this Clause may be carried without our having to go to a Division.</p>

<p>There is no intention to Divide the Committee on the Question of this Clause standing part, that is certain, but my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke (Mr. Ellis Smith) has felt ever since this Budget was introduced that the question which he has brought forward ought in some way to be raised. He himself was advised that it could be raised on this Clause. He asked me whether I would attach my name to his Amendment and I am always willing to help him, because I know he is always seeking to improve things, but when the Chairman decided that the Amendment was not in Order we never had any intention of Dividing the Committee against the Clause itself. That would be utterly ridiculous. At the same time I should like to say to my right hon. Friend the Member for East Edinburgh (Mr. Pethick-Lawrence) that I feel he might have left some of his remarks to be addressed to us by somebody on the other side of the Committee. After all, we do not wish to act in a ridiculous manner, and he knows that. My hon. Friends the Members for Leigh (Mr. Tinker) and Stoke-on-Trent felt that this matter ought to be brought to the attention of the House as soon as possible. However, if this is the wrong occasion we shall seek some other occasion.</p>
