<p>While we are waiting, I should like to ask a question, Mr. Speaker. I should like to know what arrangements were made on this occasion for hon. Members to ballot for tickets for the opening of the new Session on Tuesday.

I should like you, Mr. Speaker, to give us an explanation, or to find out what the position was. This has happened on this occasion, but never before. I should, therefore, like to know why so many of us have not had the opportunity of putting our names in a ballot for tickets for next Tuesday.</p>
