	<p pid="a.1550.3/1">I last met Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes to discuss opening up the European energy market and other issues on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-27">27 January 2006</phrase>. I continually emphasise to the Commissioner that she has our full support for the sector inquiry that she is carrying out and that we look forward to seeing the results.</p>
	<p pid="a.1550.3/2">The inquiry's initial report in November last year identified a number of issues in the European energy market, in particular a lack of unbundling and transparency in some parts of the EU. We hope that the latest report, which is published today, will build on those findings and that it will identify individual cases where there has been a distortion of competition.</p>

	<p pid="a.1559.3/1">I thank the Leader of the House for giving us the business for the week after the recess. I am grateful that the Children and Adoption Bill has found a place in the business of the House for that week.</p>
	<p pid="a.1559.3/2">The right hon. Gentleman and other hon. Members will have noticed that we will use our Opposition day on <phrase class="date" code="">1 March</phrase> to discuss dentistry and the treatment of cancer patients in the NHS. I asked last week for a debate on dentistry, as did <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1509" name="Ann Winterton">my hon. Friend the Member for Congleton (Ann Winterton)</phrase>, and the Leader of the House suggested that Members should raise the issue in today's debate on NHS inequalities. He was being somewhat disingenuous in saying that because the debate today not only covers the whole of the NHS, but will probably last for only two and a half hours. There will not be much time to talk about dentistry.</p>
	<p pid="a.1559.3/3">In 1999, the Prime Minister gave a commitment that by the end of 2001 everyone would have access to an NHS dentist&mdash;a commitment on which he has failed to deliver. However, hon. Members may care to know that the Government have a radical and innovative answer to ending the queues of people waiting to sign up to a new NHS dentist. They are going to ban people from queuing and force them apply by phone or post. We need a debate about the real answers to the problems, and we will give hon. Members that debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.1559.3/4">On the issue of cancer patients and the use of Herceptin, and following yesterday's court decision&mdash;which revealed that, despite the comments by the Secretary of State for Health last autumn, the Government had not changed their policy&mdash;will the Leader of the House ensure that the right hon. Lady makes a statement to the House on Herceptin before the debate on <phrase class="date" code="">1 March</phrase>?</p>
	<p pid="a.1559.3/5">We waited a long time for it, but I was pleased to hear the Leader of the House announce the date of the Budget today. It is a pity that it was announced on Sky News before he could announce the date in this House. Talking of long waits, when will the education reform Bill be published?</p>
	<p pid="a.1559.3/6">I realise that referring to the economy usually brings a torrent of statistics from the Leader of the House about inflation, interest rates and employment, but yesterday we saw the biggest rise in unemployment for 13 years, and there are serious underlying problems that need to be addressed, particularly the position of young people. Does he share my concern that over the past year there was a 28 per cent. increase in youth long-term unemployment; the number of economically inactive 18 to 24-year-olds has risen by nearly a quarter since Labour came to power; and that the number of young people who are not in education, employment or training has risen to 1.2 million? The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he would not be satisfied until the Government had removed the scar of long-term unemployment from the face of Britain. Yesterday's figures show that he is failing to achieve that goal, so will the Leader of the House make time for a debate on youth long-term unemployment?</p>
	<p pid="a.1559.3/7">Finally, on a day when a review of the work of the Electoral Commission has been announced, I note that the Leader of the House has previously said that in order to engage people in the electoral process we should force them to vote by making it compulsory and by fining people who do not vote. Is that still his view, or has he now realised that the more people who vote at the next general election, the bigger the Conservative majority?</p>

	<p pid="a.1562.0/1">Will the Leader of the House make time for a debate on the future of the Post Office card account? Is he aware that there is very great concern in many parts of the House about the news that it will cease in 2010&mdash;not only the fact of that, but the manner of it as well? Is he further aware that although the Government argue that it was always known that the card account would be temporary, the Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1909" name="James Plaskitt">the hon. Member for Warwick and Leamington (Mr. Plaskitt)</phrase>, said yesterday in Westminster Hall:</p>
	<p pid="a.1562.0/2" class="indent">&quot;Of course, it is a temporary arrangement&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.1562.0/3">but if we had told people that at the beginning, it&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.1562.0/4" class="indent">&quot;would have been interpreted as . . . a barrier to . . . taking up the account.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report,</i> <i>Westminster Hall,</i> <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-15">15 February 2006</phrase>; Vol. 442, c. 496WH.]</p>
	<p pid="a.1562.0/5">So it seems to me that he has blown the gaff.</p>
	<p pid="a.1562.0/6">We need such a debate not only for the sake of the 4.3 million people who have those accounts and rely on the convenience that they bring, or, indeed, because of the &pound;1 billion a year that the contract is worth to the Post Office, but&mdash;this is a very immediate point&mdash;because sub-postmasters who have reached retirement age who want to sell their businesses now discover that, as a result of that major blow, the business itself has a much smaller value and they are now struggling to sell. It is a very important issue and I urge the Leader of the House to make Government time available to debate it.</p>
	<p pid="a.1562.0/7">Will the right hon. Gentleman also find time for a debate on local government reorganisation, as contradictory signals are coming from the Government about their intentions, about the time scale and about the process&mdash;not least from the Deputy Prime Minister, as we heard yesterday?</p>

Would it not be more honest to tell the public that people have been sentenced to a range from three and a half to seven years, so that people will not be disillusioned when they see that those whom they thought had deservedly been put away for a long time are out on the streets all too soon?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-02-16a.1576.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1818" speakername="Owen Paterson" colnum="1576"  time="012:28:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060216/debtext/60216-11.htm#60216-11_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.1576.1/1">On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. I am grateful to you for allowing me to make a point of order, of which I have given you prior notice.</p>
	<p pid="a.1576.1/2">In recent years, the Government have been encouraging&mdash;some would say bullying&mdash;benefit recipients to take benefits through direct payment to banks or through a Post Office card. I was involved in that debate and I cannot remember at any stage receiving a letter or reading anything in Parliament to say that the card was anything but permanent. I even had a constructive meeting&mdash;I took one of my postmasters&mdash;with the Minister for Pensions Reform, who was then the Minister responsible, and I cannot remember anything being mentioned to suggest that the card was anything but permanent.</p>
	<p pid="a.1576.1/3">That was until yesterday, when we had a spirited debate in Westminster Hall and the Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1909" name="James Plaskitt">the hon. Member for Warwick and Leamington (Mr. Plaskitt)</phrase>, whom I am delighted to see in his place, read out the contract between the Government and the Post Office in 2002. He said:</p>
	<p pid="a.1576.1/4" class="indent">&quot;I am in the middle of a quotation&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.1576.1/5">he was speaking to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1454" name="David Lepper">the hon. Member for Brighton, Pavilion (David Lepper)</phrase>&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.1576.1/6" class="indent">&quot;and I must conclude it. It goes on:</p>
	<p pid="a.1576.1/7" class="indent">'The POCA is intended to be an interim step for Account Holders who will be encouraged by both Parties to migrate to Bank Accounts'&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report, Westminster Hall,</i> <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-15">15 February 2006</phrase>; Vol. 442, c. 495WH.]</p>
	<p pid="a.1576.1/8">I do not think anybody in the country, apart from those who were privy to the contract, knew about that. There has been the most enormous deceit perpetrated on literally millions of benefit recipients. There are 4.3 million cardholders at the moment, and they took on these cards not knowing the facts.</p>
	<p pid="a.1576.1/9">Incredibly, the Minister went on to say,</p>
	<p pid="a.1576.1/10" class="indent">&quot;If . . . we had been actively saying, 'Of course, it's a temporary arrangement,' that would have been interpreted as yet another barrier to discourage people from taking up the account.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report,</i> <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-15">15 February 2006</phrase>; Vol. 442, c. 496WH.]</p>
	<p pid="a.1576.1/11">It seems to me to be deceitful of the Government to have perpetrated this on millions of benefit recipients. The Minister was pressed to say that he would put the full contract in the Library. It says on page 441 of &quot;Erskine May&quot;, under the heading, &quot;Citing documents not before House&quot;:</p>
	<p pid="a.1576.1/12" class="indent">&quot;A Minister of the Crown may not read or quote from a despatch or other state paper not before the House, unless he is prepared to lay it upon the Table.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1576.1/13">The Minister has quoted verbatim a selected piece from a Government document. That document is relevant to millions of benefit recipients and to the 14,400 post offices whose future is now in jeopardy. Could you please rule, Mr. Speaker, that the Minister, contrary to what he said in Westminster Hall, should place this vital document in the Library so that Members of this House and the citizens of this country can read it?</p>

	<p pid="a.1582.1/1">I am glad that the hon. Gentleman recognises the nobility of the Government's aim and hope that he also recognises the nobility of the Government's achievement in breaking the historic link. The question of incentives for saving lies at the heart of the Turner commission report and the national pensions debate, which is currently under way. The report and the debate give us the chance to build a consensus for an enduring pensions settlement. That is our aim and I hope that the hon. Gentleman and other Opposition Members will be part of it. Consensus is very important, because we need a pensions settlement that will stand the test of time and not be pulled apart by successive Governments.</p>
	<p pid="a.1582.1/2">Later this month, industry groups will present their alternatives to Lord Turner's national pensions savings scheme. On <phrase class="date" code="">18 March</phrase>, which is national pensions day, more than 1,000 people will meet in six cities across the country to consider the choices and options in the Pensions Commission report. I look forward to welcoming Opposition Members to that programme and we will debate and scrutinise the different ways to achieve the objectives set out by the commission.</p>

	<p pid="a.1582.3/1">I can give my hon. Friend that assurance. It was a scandal that so many pensioners were on a means-tested benefit of &pound;69 a week in 1997. We must not head in that direction, where a large number of pensioners were below the generally recognised poverty threshold. That will be a key criterion in our package of reforms, and I am sure that she has been encouraged by Lord Turner's comments about maintaining the pension credit.</p>
	<p pid="a.1582.3/2">To meet the challenges of an ageing society and permanently eradicate poverty in retirement, we must address inequalities during people's working lives. That is why our record in tackling child poverty is so important; that is why we are committed to supporting families in work; that is why our welfare reforms and aspiration of an 80 per cent. employment rate are so important; and that is why we want to see a modern, active and inclusive welfare state.</p>
	<p pid="a.1582.3/3">When I made my statement on today's benefit uprating to t<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1564" name="Nigel Waterson">his House in December, the hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Waterson)</phrase> asked, in a slightly sceptical tone, about our proposals for welfare reform. As I said that we would, we set out in the Green Paper in January our ambitious and radical proposals for a welfare state that lets people move out of poverty rather than a welfare state that institutionalises dependency. We want a million fewer people to claim incapacity benefit, a million more older people to be in work and 300,000 lone parents to be able to come off benefits.</p>
	<p pid="a.1582.3/4"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1793" name="Philip Hammond">The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond)</phrase>, whom I am delighted to see in his place this afternoon, welcomed the proposals and congratulated my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State on</p>
	<p pid="a.1582.3/5" class="indent">&quot;grasping the nettle of incapacity benefit reform&quot;.&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-24">24 January 2006</phrase>; Vol. 441, c. 1310.]</p>
	<p pid="a.1582.3/6">He pledged to support the proposals and to work towards a consensus.</p>
	<p pid="a.1582.3/7">That is the consensus that we want to build. I hope that it will not be too long before Opposition Members finally have the grace to support the new deal, which is responsible for helping more than 1.5 million people into work. We will strengthen the new deal so that it offers learning agreements for teenagers in eight areas of the country, extends the new deal pilots to help lone parents back into work and pilots personal action plans for those unemployed for six months or more.</p>
	<p pid="a.1582.3/8">For the sixth successive year, we will freeze non-dependent deductions to relieve the pressure on low-income parents who house their adult children, which will benefit some 30,000 benefit recipients. We want a welfare system that breaks down the barriers to opportunity and enables all those who can work to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.1582.3/9">Our &quot;Age Positive&quot; campaign has promoted the business case for age diversity in the work force. This year we shall legislate for the first time against age discrimination in the workplace. A new default retirement age will mean employers can no longer compel an employee to retire before the age of 65 without objective justification. In 2011, an evidence-based review will consider the possibility that the default retirement age should go altogether.</p>

	<p pid="a.1586.0/1">We welcome this debate, and I am grateful to the Minister for setting out the Government's proposals on the uprating of social security benefits and guaranteed minimum pensions. We shall not oppose the proposals in the Lobby today.</p>
	<p pid="a.1586.0/2">We welcome the extra benefits, but we cannot be satisfied with a welfare system that is increasingly being driven by mass means-testing. There was little in the Minister's statement today about the real need for reform. In his benefits uprating statement on <phrase class="date" code="">6 December</phrase> last year, he said that the changes that he was announcing were in the context of</p>

	<p pid="a.1586.0/4">In October 1996, millions of people heard the Prime Minister famously say:</p>
	<p pid="a.1586.0/5" class="indent">&quot;By the end of a five-year term of a Labour Government: I vow that we will have reduced the proportion . . . that we spend on the welfare bills of social failure . . . This is my covenant with the British people. Judge me upon it. The buck stops with me.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1586.0/6">At least the Minister for Employment and Welfare Reform, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1383" name="Margaret Hodge">the right hon. Member for Barking (Margaret Hodge)</phrase>, who is not in her place today, recently had the honesty to admit that the Government had done &quot;sweet nothing&quot; to tackle this problem until recently. The Conservative Opposition will make constructive proposals finally to get to grips with a social security system that is tragically wasting too much human potential and writing off too many people's lives.</p>

	<p pid="a.1586.2/1">If the hon. Lady looks at <i>Hansard</i> tomorrow, she will see that I referred to &quot;mass means-testing&quot;. Of course, any welfare system will require an element of means-testing&mdash;[Hon. Members: &quot;Ah!&quot;] That is self-evident. Our point is that means-testing is growing and spreading to become mass means-testing. It is going up and up, and the Minister knows exactly why that is happening. It is because of the endless fiddling by Complexity Brown, the Chancellor of the Exchequer. The question that the Secretary of State must answer is whether he is going to engage with us in this process of reform. He hit the heights of uncharity when, on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-09">9 January</phrase>, he said that he did not believe that we had anything to contribute to the debate on incapacity benefit and welfare reform. Well, we do, and we are going to scrutinise his proposals.</p>
	<p pid="a.1586.2/2">In this debate on social security uprating, delivering more support and help to those in need, and giving support to those who want to work but are being prevented from doing so, it would be appropriate to remind ourselves that the Green Paper on incapacity benefit reform&mdash;which, we hear, is to become a flagship welfare reform Bill in this Session&mdash;comes from a long line of well-meaning attempts from the Government. I counted them up; since 1997, we have had six Secretaries of State and 28 White or Green Papers.</p>
	<p pid="a.1586.2/3">On close examination, the Green Paper announced in January was found to contain vagaries and obfuscations that give cause for concern, even for a Green Paper. First, existing benefit claimants will not get the help that they need, because the new measures announced in the Green Paper&mdash;the proposed work-focused interviews, for example, and the greater frequency of medical assessments&mdash;are not obviously going to be applied to&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="a.1595.4/1">The hon. Gentleman makes an extremely good point. If, as a result of the Government's policy, the means of access to benefits and pensions&mdash;local post offices in rural areas or deprived urban areas&mdash;is removed, the uprating should include an amount that makes it possible for people to gain access to those benefits and pensions. Otherwise, while there may be a superficial uprating, increased costs will mean an overall downrating for those people. I hope that the Minister will address that issue, and particularly the question of when people living in such areas might lose the ability to access benefits in the manner of their choosing. I hope that the Government will provide time in the near future for a full debate on this issue, because Ministers have so far been unable to address it on the Floor of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.1595.4/2">I come to the future of disability benefits, with which the orders before us also deal. We Liberal Democrats will make a formal submission on this subject in response to the Government's Green Paper on welfare reform, but there are a few points that are worth making in the context of today's debate. Although we endorse, for example, the various forms of support being offered to people on incapacity benefit to get them back into work and, therefore, off the benefit currently provided in the pathways to work pilot areas, if such support is to be extended throughout the country to all people in receipt of incapacity benefit it needs to be properly funded. The Government estimate that the pathways to work project costs some &pound;400 per claimant. Based on the latest annual figures for people commencing incapacity benefit claims, it would take some &pound;220 million a year to fund a national roll-out at the same level. Yet the Government are offering only &pound;360 million over two years. If the resources are spread too thinly, we will not see results and we will let down all those claimants who want to find work. That is especially true at a time of rising unemployment.</p>
	<p pid="a.1595.4/3">Conditionality of benefits has been a major feature of the debate on the future of benefits such as jobseeker's allowance and incapacity benefit. That debate continues.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-02-16a.1600.6" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1406" speakername="Graham Stuart" colnum="1600"  time="013:51:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060216/debtext/60216-18.htm#60216-18_spnew10">
	<p pid="a.1600.6/1">That is true, but it is why it is all the more shameful and sad that the Government have squandered the unparalleled opportunity presented by the transformed economy that they inherited and have let down the people who most need help.</p>
	<p pid="a.1600.6/2">The Minister used the interesting word &quot;consensus&quot;. I have been in the House only since last May, and I try not to be cynical, but whenever I hear a Minister use that word I know that he is presiding over a system that is chaotic and failing. That is why, in a desperate bid to shore up his weakening political position, he uses that word to seek the support of the Opposition.</p>
	<p pid="a.1600.6/3">However, the good news from my hon. Friend the Member for Bury St. Edmunds is that the Conservative party is always prepared to work for the good of the most vulnerable people. We will work to achieve consensus to support them and give them the dignity of work. People want dignity, not means-testing.</p>
	<p pid="a.1600.6/4">I am nervous of touching on the new deal but shall do so only in passing and certainly less than the Minister did. Only 15 per cent. of people aged more than 25 who were out of work when the so-called successful new deal was introduced&mdash;that is, only one person in seven&mdash;have returned to work and so no longer need to claim benefits. Six out of every seven benefit claimants have been failed by that enormously expensive and bureaucratic programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.1600.6/5">I welcome the Conservative party's continuing commitment to programmes that will help and support people and get them into work. In contrast to what too often amounts to political posturing among Labour Members, I do not even mind if we keep the new deal name. That is a matter of indifference to me, as long as we move away from the politics of failure and get all those people still languishing out of work back into employment. That is what the Conservative party is about. That is why we transformed the economy, and that is the opportunity that I hope that we will take on again when we next form the Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.1600.6/6">The Minister referred to the number of children in poverty. He will be aware, although he is no longer in his place, that the percentage of children experiencing persistent low income&mdash;those in the unhappy state of remaining below 60 per cent. of median household income in at least three out of four years&mdash;was 16 per cent. in 1996&ndash;97 and remained at 16 per cent. for the following three years to 1999&ndash;2000. We need to recognise that far too many children still live in poverty and that the Government have not delivered the transformation that they promised. I hope that we will see fewer eye-catching initiatives and more hard work to make the systems that we already have work better. When we have a Conservative Government, we will make the systems work better. We will be less interested in headlines and more interested in reducing poverty for those with least.</p>
	<p pid="a.1600.6/7">The Minister's words on pensions were hardest to take. As my hon. Friend the Member for Bury St. Edmunds said, Labour's first Minister with responsibility for welfare reform said last year that when Labour came to power we had one of the strongest pension systems in Europe. Now we have one of the weakest. That is a searing indictment of the Government's failure. They have removed opportunity from hard-working people and replaced it with means-testing. I have yet to meet a constituent, whether from the far left like so many Labour Members who rebel against the Government, or from the right, or of no known political persuasion, who wishes to spend their life working hard and paying tax in order to end up on means-tested benefit. They do not want to have to fill in 24-page forms to get pension credit or 12-page forms to get their council tax benefit.</p>
	<p pid="a.1600.6/8">When I attended the Hornsea pensioners annual Christmas lunch, I sat beside an upstanding, hard-working, socially contributing and economically successful member of the community who, in his old age, has, because of the Government's &pound;5 billion raid on pensions, ended up in need of means-tested benefits in order to live properly&mdash;<i>[Interruption.]</i> Ministers may laugh at the predicament of hard-working, decent people who are forced into relying on means-tested benefits at the end of a life in which they have suffered no ill-luck and no great illness. They consider themselves successful members of our society. They have always worked, they brought up their children and they tried to do the right thing. This Government have made such people feel like beggars from the state. The gentleman whom I sat next to at Christmas lunch told me that he had seen adverts saying, &quot;It's yours: claim it&quot;. So, he filled out all the forms and sent them off. By return, he was told that his building society accounts had not been sent in original form and was asked to supply every last one, even one that had &pound;80 in it. He told me that he chucked the lot in the bin. The 1.5 million people in the same situation deserve better, but they have been let down by a Government who are addicted to means-testing instead of providing dignity for people in their old age.</p>
	<p pid="a.1600.6/9">Age Concern estimates that more than 2 million retired people are living in households with incomes below the Government's official poverty line. I would have thought that Labour Members would be campaigning vociferously on behalf of women, who benefit least from the current system. We know that fewer of the recently retired have money coming in from an occupational pension. We also know that 1 million people have seen their occupational pension schemes wound up&mdash;more than 60,000 schemes&mdash;because of the policies of this Government, who have raided pensions to the tune of &pound;5 billion a year. That is not a modern, active and inclusive welfare state. For Ministers to persist in saying that it is nothing short of a deception of the British people, and I hope that it will be increasingly recognised as such.</p>
	<p pid="a.1600.6/10">Pensioners, people on incapacity benefit and people on the new deal&mdash;in other words, some of the most vulnerable people in our society&mdash;are not well served by the benefits uprating today. They are being let down. The basic state pension, for people who have contributed all their lives, was 21 per cent. of average earnings when this Government came to power, but it is now just 15.9 per cent. That is the legacy that this Government will leave.</p>

	<p pid="a.1602.1/1">That is my next point. At the election, the Conservative party laid out proposals to help to lift pensioners out of poverty, to bring them dignity and not means-testing, and to bring back the link between average earnings and the state pension. Labour Members will point out that that link was removed by the Conservatives, but I ask them when that happened. It was in 1980, at the end of a decade in which Labour Governments had brought the economy of this country to its knees. That is why we had to remove the link. By 1997, we had transformed the economy, which is why Labour Members should join Help the Aged, Aged Concern and the National Pensioners Convention&mdash;indeed, with everyone associated with pensions except the Chancellor of the Exchequer&mdash;in believing that we should bring back the link between average earnings and the state pension. We should not allow the number of people dragged into the hole between pension credit and the state pension to increase. It is beyond belief that we can even consider having 70 per cent. of people dependent on this Government's mean means-tested benefits in as short a time as 44 years.</p>
	<p pid="a.1602.1/2">We need a Conservative Government to lift people out of poverty, because they want dignity, not means-testing. We need to bring back the link, and we need to stop the Chancellor of the Exchequer's pernicious, poverty-inducing increases in council tax. We had proposals to deal with those issues at the last election, and I look forward, under the leadership of my right hon. Friend the Member for Witney, to my party coming forward with a considered position that will help to bring dignity back to the people of this country and provide hope for those with least.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-02-16a.1603.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1696" speakername="Philip Dunne" colnum="1603"  time="014:08:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060216/debtext/60216-19.htm#60216-19_spnew2">
	<p pid="a.1603.0/1">I am conscious of your strictures, Madam Deputy Speaker, to confine our remarks to the topic for debate, and I shall endeavour to do so. I hope that you will allow the odd lapse.</p>
	<p pid="a.1603.0/2">Yesterday, I received a helpful press release from the Office for National Statistics, which suggested that we are at a tipping point for the potential number of claimants. For the first time for some years, the trend in employment is declining and the number of people unemployed is increasing. That is noticeable and I shall remind the House of the statistics. The unemployment rate has increased from 4.7 per cent. to 5.1 per cent. over the period October to December 2005. The number of unemployed people has increased by 108,000 over that quarter and by 123,000 over the year, to reach 1.54 million. In tandem with that alarming increase, there has been a significant increase in the inactivity rate for people of working age. That is relevant to the debate because it affects potential claimants.</p>
	<p pid="a.1603.0/3">The number of economically inactive people of working age has risen by 59,000 to reach 7.95 million&mdash;the highest figure since comparable records began in 1971. At the same time, the average number of job vacancies for the three months to January 2006 was 616,800, which is down more than 34,000 over the previous 12 months. While unemployment is rising, job vacancies are declining, which suggests that there may be a significant change in the number of claimants in the coming year. It will be interesting to see what&mdash;if anything&mdash;the Chancellor makes of that in his Budget statement next month.</p>
	<p pid="a.1603.0/4">A connected issue relating to those in receipt of benefits is tax credit. We have been told that, from April 2006, the level of income that the Chancellor will disregard, which was &pound;2,500 a year, will rise significantly to &pound;25,000&mdash;a move that I welcome as it will take a large number of tax credit recipients out of the pernicious series of negotiations with the Inland Revenue into which they are required to enter to determine whether they are entitled to tax credit as their income changes during the year. All Members will have countless examples from their advice surgeries of members of the public who cannot understand the informative&mdash;I shall be polite&mdash;letters that they receive from the Revenue on that subject.</p>
	<p pid="a.1603.0/5">I wanted to know the cost of that move to the Exchequer, so I put a parliamentary question to the Chancellor last month. I received a reply from the Paymaster General, who was incapable of providing the information. I shall read part of the reply, which stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.1603.0/6" class="indent">&quot;The increase in the disregard from &pound;2,500 to &pound;25,000 from April 2006 is part of a package of measures announced in the 2005 pre-Budget report . . . It is not possible to produce robust estimates of the impact of individual elements of the package of measures, as there are significant interactions between the different components.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-26">26 January 2006</phrase>; Vol. 441, c. 2246W.]</p>
	<p pid="a.1603.0/7">That answer is not acceptable. It is beyond belief that the Chancellor could announce such a major measure, which will have an impact on a large number of people, without understanding its effect on the public finances. I shall be looking for clarification in the Chancellor's Budget statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.1603.0/8">Another aspect of tax credits relates to the issues we are discussing: the impact of child support measures. It was disappointing that, in his pre-Budget report, the Chancellor failed for at least the second successive year to uprate to any degree the family element of child tax credit, which has been frozen&mdash;as indeed has the child care element of working tax credit. Both measures would have done something to help families on the lowest incomes out of child poverty.</p>
	<p pid="a.1603.0/9">I turn to the pension element of the uprating. I have been following with some interest the statements about pensions of the Minister for Pensions Reform, who is not in his place, so I welcomed his comment in this debate, when he appeared for the first time to acknowledge the need to encourage incentives to save. Under the Labour Government, savings have roughly halved nationally. One of the main contributory reasons is the introduction of so much means-testing in the pensions environment. It is essential that the Government's measures in response to the Turner commission reduce dependency on the state and on means-testing, and they have acknowledged that as an important ambition. I shall look particularly at how they achieve it and should welcome the opportunity to participate in that debate over coming weeks.</p>
	<p pid="a.1603.0/10">I urge the Government to take care that they do not damage the existing savings regime in our pensions industry. It has already suffered significant damage from measures taken by the Government, as we heard earlier, so it would be the height of folly if the introduction of a low-cost national pension savings scheme, or its equivalent, caused the migration of all existing savings arrangements to that scheme to the detriment of pensioners and the savings industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.1603.0/11">It is also important that the Government do not fall into a mis-selling trap of their own making. It could be avoided if there were an element of compulsion in the national pension savings scheme. If there is an auto-enrolment system, as proposed by Lord Turner, individuals must be given some advice, one way or another, to determine whether saving for their pension is right at a particular stage of their working life. I am thinking particularly of graduates at the beginning of their careers who have to pay off tuition fees and so on. Is it really appropriate for them to be saving for their pensions at the beginning of their career when they have costly debts to pay off?</p>
	<p pid="a.1603.0/12">I also urge the Minister to ensure that there is sufficient confidence in whatever savings scheme is established to allow people on lower incomes to participate if they want to do so. Experience has shown the difficulties of previous Government schemes that were rolled out with great fanfare but not taken up in the numbers that the Government wanted, in part because people felt that the Government would not play fair with them and the rules were changed. I do not criticise this Government particularly because all Governments have a tendency to change the rules as they go along, so whatever regulatory oversight regime is in place, there should be an element of independence. Just as, to their credit, the Government introduced independence for the Bank of England, they should consider a regulatory oversight regime for the national pension savings scheme that is independent of Government.</p>

	<p pid="a.1611.1/1">The hon. Gentleman again seeks to assert that there has been a recent decision or change of policy, but there has not. I repeat the commitment that we have given many times before that if pensioners and benefit recipients choose to collect their income from the post office we want to ensure they are able to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.1611.1/2">We need to do more to meet the demographic, social and economic challenges that we face today. The Pensions Commission was clear that there is not a pensions crisis, but it identified about 9 million people who were not saving enough for their retirement. That, together with the demographic challenge of increasing life expectancy, would lead to a crisis in 20 or 30 years' time if we failed to make appropriate responses now. That is why we established the Pensions Commission to provide a reliable, independent review of the UK pension system and to make recommendations for change.</p>
	<p pid="a.1611.1/3">We are expanding the national pensions debate and talking to people of all ages across the country to listen to their views. We want to involve citizens and stakeholders in developing a lasting settlement on pensions. We will hold a number of events that will culminate in national pensions day on <phrase class="date" code="">18 March</phrase>. The findings will help us to develop a consensus-based package for reform. I believe that building such a consensus is crucial. We want to ensure that the decisions that people make in the next few years about savings for retirement will still be sensible choices in 20, 30 or even 40 years' time.</p>
	<p pid="a.1611.1/4">The Government have undertaken their own rigorous analysis of the commission's proposals. The package of reforms that we will introduce in a White Paper in the spring will satisfy the five tests that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has set out to promote personal responsibility, and be fair, affordable, straightforward and sustainable.</p>
	<p pid="a.1611.1/5">In conclusion, the uprating order further delivers on our promises to help the people who need it most, supporting families and tackling the poverty suffered by pensioners and children wherever it occurs. We are supporting more people who can work into work, including people on incapacity benefit and lone parents. We are helping older people who want to return to, or remain in, the work force to extend their working lives. We are ensuring dignity and security for pensioners, as well as an end to abject poverty in retirement. For those reasons, I commend the orders to the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.1611.1/6" class="italic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="a.1611.1/7" class="italic">Resolved,</p>
	<p pid="a.1611.1/8" class="indent">That the draft Social Security Benefits Up-rating Order 2006, which was laid before this House on 25th January, be approved.</p>

	<p pid="a.1622.1/1">The work on health trainers was developed by talking to those on the ground about how we can engage people who are not presenting themselves to services in the traditional way. We have asked&mdash;<i>[Interruption.]</i> I shall finish my sentence, if the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire will allow me. We have asked different areas of the country to provide information on such services, and we will evaluate their impact. <i>[Interruption.]</i> Both the life check and health trainer initiatives emerged from the White Paper consultation process. We will establish an expert stakeholder group, which will examine how the initiatives will work.</p>
	<p pid="a.1622.1/2">This is not about adding more checks&mdash;there are already opportunities for different checks&mdash;or adopting a one-size-fits-all approach; nor is it not just about sickness: it is about health and finding a practical, non-burdensome way of engaging with people at different points in their life and getting them to think about their health. <i>[Interruption.]</i> For some people, relatively little action will be required. Many will be able to carry out a self-assessment and will need nothing more. But for others, a health check might be the spur for health providers to think about the services that they should provide, and for the individual to consider how their lifestyle is affecting their future health.</p>

	<p pid="a.1640.4/1">We have had a wide-ranging debate, although we have focused rather narrowly on Surrey in the past 20 minutes or so. I want to go back to where we left off on Tuesday night, when, collectively, we made probably the biggest advance in public health legislation for decades by passing a full ban on smoking.</p>
	<p pid="a.1640.4/2">The prevalence rates for smoking are illustrative of the wider health inequalities that exist throughout society. I looked at the statistics for the south-west of England. The highest prevalence of smoking is in my own city of Bristol, where it is 33 per cent., and the lowest is in an area that has been mentioned several times today, east Dorset, where it is 20 per cent. There are also great variations within areas. In the Henleaze ward in my constituency the figure is 12 per cent., while in the Knowle West ward, in Bristol, South, the constituency of Paymaster General, it is as high as 56 per cent. Those wards are only about two and a half miles from each other. There is an enormous variation in quite a small geographic area. In broadly middle-class parts of the city, the prevalence of smoking is below 20 per cent. In working-class or deprived communities it is always over 40 per cent., and in some areas over 50 per cent. Throughout the city, the rates are higher among men than among women.</p>
	<p pid="a.1640.4/3">Perhaps the key vote on Tuesday night was on whether we should remove the exemption for private members' clubs. Several Members, mainly but not exclusively Conservative, said that attendance at a private club was a matter of choice. Had I been called to speak, I would have said that where people go in the evenings is often not a matter of choice. In many parts of the country, particularly south Wales, where I grew up, going to a private members' club rather than a pub is the norm. If we had not removed that exemption, health inequalities in such areas would have widened rather than narrowing.</p>

	<p pid="a.1641.1/1">That is interesting. I assume that the hon. Gentleman is referring to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1690" name="Jane Kennedy">the right hon. Member for Liverpool, Wavertree (Jane Kennedy)</phrase>. I admit that I did not note that she voted for the exemption, but I am sure that the people of Liverpool will take careful note. As the hon. Gentleman will know, an excellent organisation called Smokefree Liverpool is promoting a private Bill to impose a full smoking ban throughout Liverpool&mdash;of course, it will not now be necessary&mdash;led by Liberal Democrat-controlled Liverpool city council.</p>
	<p pid="a.1641.1/2">Health outcomes are not always a matter of choice. They are often related to the accident of where people were born, their family circumstances, the occupation of family members, the housing in which they were brought up and the degree of poverty in <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1476" name="Andrew Lansley">their household. The hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley)</phrase> quoted from briefing that I too received, from the British Thoracic Society, about chronic pulmonary diseases such as bronchitis, emphysema and asthma. Those diseases can often be linked with occupations in declining industrial areas. It is a complicated picture.</p>

	<p pid="a.1642.0/1">It is often dangerous to presume too much knowledge of areas represented by other Members. I do not know the hon. Gentleman's constituency, but I am sure that he knows more about occupational patterns there than I do. The smoking industry in Bristol went into decline a long time ago. I think that only very expensive top-of-the-range cigars are still produced in south Bristol, although the world headquarters of Imperial Tobacco is still there. The white-collar jobs remain in the Bristol cigarette industry, but the blue-collar jobs do not. The hon. Gentleman is partly right, however: the incidence of smoking in south Bristol can, to an extent, be linked with the fact that workers in the Wills factories were given free cigarettes almost as part of their pay.</p>
	<p pid="a.1642.0/2">What we did on Tuesday night to eliminate smoking in public places represents a big step towards narrowing health inequalities, but there is still much to be done. We need to deal with alcohol consumption, poor diet and other contributors to ill health.</p>
	<p pid="a.1642.0/3">One thing that has not been mentioned so far today is the location of health care services. The recent White Paper on community services contains an interesting section on what the Government call &quot;under-doctored areas&quot;&mdash;a phrase that I had not heard before. It includes a table showing the bottom 10 per cent. of areas in England in terms of the number of general practitioners per 100,000 of population. North Manchester PCT has 41, and Wigan PCT and Blackpool PCT each have 45. The accompanying map shows a clustering of low-level GP services in the north-west, south Yorkshire and Tyneside. Of course, they are the areas of greatest general deprivation in England, and they also have some of the worst health outcomes.</p>
	<p pid="a.1642.0/4">However, this is not just a north-south phenomenon. As is often quoted, Hastings is a pocket of poverty and deprivation on the south coast, so it is no surprise to discover that it has a GP rate of 46 per 100,000 people&mdash;a figure that matches those for the north of England. According to the Department of Health, a GP rate of 58 per 100,000 people constitutes under-doctoring. On comparing PCTs across the country, it is clear that rural and more prosperous urban areas have twice as many GPs per head of population as the bottom 10 per cent. of areas that I just mentioned. Interestingly, that distribution has not really changed since the NHS was formed in the 1940s. So Aneurin Bevan's vision of a health centre for every community in the country is still not that close to being realised, 60 years after he pioneered his service.</p>
	<p pid="a.1642.0/5">There is, therefore, a correlation between a low concentration of GPs and the worst health outcomes. Given that the general trend of the White Paper is to move the focus of health care away from secondary and toward primary care&mdash;and, we hope, toward preventive care as well&mdash;it is all the more important, as we undertake that switch, that PCTs with under-doctored areas be given the incentives and resources that they need to ensure that everyone has access to a GP.</p>
	<p pid="a.1642.0/6">As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1677" name="David Taylor">the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor)</phrase>&mdash;he is no longer in his place&mdash;said earlier, men are notoriously reluctant to visit their doctor. Teenage boys are often taken reluctantly to the doctor by their mothers, and men are often pressured into going by their partners. It is true that in many ways, men can be their own worst enemies, and not only in terms of visiting GPs. Men are three times more likely than women to become an alcoholic, and four times more likely to have a drug addiction. They are also more likely to be obese and to smoke. As the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire said earlier, we should not overlook our responsibilities in this regard. It is not simply a question of the Government providing services; we must all behave responsibility. None the less, according to the most recent figures from the Office for National Statistics, male life expectancy is 76.3 years, whereas female life expectancy is 80.7 years.</p>
	<p pid="a.1642.0/7"><i>The House Magazine</i>, of which we are all doubtless avid readers, ran a supplement on men's health in its <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-30">30 January</phrase> edition. It contained some interesting articles, including one by me.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-02-16a.1650.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1531" speakername="Andrew Gwynne" colnum="1650"  time="017:09:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060216/debtext/60216-32.htm#60216-32_spnew4">
	<p pid="a.1650.0/1">I welcome the debate and am pleased to contribute to it. My constituency is in eastern Greater Manchester and covers two local authority areas. The first, Tameside, like much of east Manchester, contains a number of deprived areas, which consequently have serious public health problems. The second, Stockport, is considered one of the most affluent areas in north-west England, but, despite that, it must be recognised that there are areas of serious deprivation in Stockport, including parts of the borough that form my constituency. In socio-economic terms, they have much more in common with Tameside and east Manchester than with the prosperous areas of Bramhall and Cheadle in the south of the borough.</p>
	<p pid="a.1650.0/2">More than 100 years ago, at the height of the industrial revolution, the city fathers of Manchester sought to make a radical improvement in the health of the growing population by ensuring a supply of clean drinking water from the Lake district. Almost overnight, the rates of cholera and other preventable diseases plummeted. That, along with other sanitation services and the provision of public parks&mdash;I believe that one of the first municipal parks in the country was in Greater Manchester&mdash;was the first major step towards greatly improving public health in our major cities. With the introduction of the NHS in the late 1940s, there was a remarkable improvement in public health. I am proud of the fact that the former Denton urban district council was among the first councils to adopt the Clean Air Act 1956.</p>
	<p pid="a.1650.0/3">As a result of all those decisions, life expectancy has increased dramatically and our quality of life has been transformed from the standard that my grandparents' parents were used to. That said, health inequalities have continued, despite the steps forward over the past century. It is sad but true that to this day there remains a direct correlation between one's background, housing, environment and income, and one's health.</p>
	<p pid="a.1650.0/4">I am proud that the Government that I was elected to support committed themselves at the general election to</p>
	<p pid="a.1650.0/5" class="indent">&quot;tackle the long-standing causes of ill-health and health inequality by . . . tough targets to close the health gap to cut deaths in poorer communities and among poorer children&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1650.0/6">That will have a massive impact on my constituents, and for the better.</p>
	<p pid="a.1650.0/7">Mr. Deputy Speaker, with your indulgence, I wish to focus on the work undertaken by agencies throughout Denton and Reddish to tackle issues of concern. First, as a result of the single regeneration budget round 5 funds, there has been tremendous investment in the regeneration of the most deprived parts of the constituency. In Haughton Green, SRB funding has enabled the provision of innovative community-based health services in a new joint community and health centre. The services are provided by numerous agencies, but come together under one roof to provide local people with access to housing and homeless services, local health services, benefit advice, access to the credit union, child care help and advice for young people, including advice related to tackling sexual health issues and teenage pregnancies. That superb facility has provided the local community with a new resource.</p>
	<p pid="a.1650.0/8">Adjacent to the Haughton Green community and health centre are the Haughton Green playing fields. Again, spearheaded by SRB 5 and the commitment of the neighbourhood forum and local councillors, major funding was secured to refurbish completely the rather derelict, overgrown waste of space. Through community consultation, a bid for doorstep green funding was secured and that public open space in an urban area that lacks good-quality open space has been transformed into a community asset to be proud of. Not only were the football pitches drained, new play areas for toddlers, children and teens, and a new floodlit multi-purpose games area were provided. Even the old bowling green was restored after being out of action for at least two decades. Now, the area is used by all the community. A bowling club has been established and the sports development unit at Tameside metropolitan borough council ensures that the state-of-the-art sports facilities are well used by local youths in particular. That is crucial, not least to ensure that the ticking obesity time bomb is diffused in communities such as Haughton Green.</p>
	<p pid="a.1650.0/9">I also want to highlight the impact that Sure Start is having in my constituency, offering access to a variety of services such as child care and health advice, providing new parents with the skills necessary to be a parent, and developing simple skills such as cooking. These are crucial in areas such as Haughton Green and other parts of Denton and Reddish. Sure Start is beginning to address long-standing problems and I am proud that my constituency will eventually benefit from six Sure Start centres. I point especially to the good work being done by Reddish Vale early years centre in the Stockport part of my seat, which provides all the services that I mentioned. It has undoubtedly been a resounding success.</p>
	<p pid="a.1650.0/10">I draw to the attention of the House the work of Tameside youth service and the Tameside and Glossop primary care trust in providing services to young people throughout the borough. Whether we like it or not, many teenagers find themselves in situations where they have access to alcohol and sometimes to drugs. Usually as a consequence of being under the influence of those substances, they may be more inclined to have, or be at risk of having, unprotected sex.</p>
	<p pid="a.1650.0/11">In connection with the borough's health targets and the crime and disorder partnership, the joint service offered by the PCT and the youth service provides local young people with an all-in-one support service on drug abuse, alcohol abuse and sexual health issues. As a result of the latter, teenage pregnancy levels in the borough are starting to show an improvement. I commend to the Minister the recent report of Tameside's health and education services scrutiny panels on teenage pregnancies, which describes in much more detail the progress being made in the borough.</p>
	<p pid="a.1650.0/12">Finally, I highlight the proposals of Tameside and Glossop primary care trust to devolve primary care services to local communities. Three primary care centres are being developed which will provide services far more locally than ever before. A range of services previously available at only the district hospital or outside the borough will be available in the state of the art new centres. Importantly in the context of the present debate, the centres will be located in some of the most deprived wards in the borough. One of the wards, St. Peters, which is partly in my constituency and partly in the constituency of Ashton-under-Lyne, is in the top 5 per cent. of deprived wards in the whole country.</p>
	<p pid="a.1650.0/13">The availability of services locally is important because too many people from areas like St. Peters do not have access to good services if those are not available in the communities. Whether because of low car ownership or poor bus services, if facilities are too far away, people will not access them, so I commend Tameside and Glossop primary care trust for taking the services directly to those communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.1650.0/14">Leading and responding to the debate is a Health Minister, and a very good one at that, but I could fill up the Front Bench for this, because tackling health inequalities is a responsibility not just of the Department of Health. I have spoken of the single regeneration budget, community regeneration, the crime and disorder strategy and sports development, but I could also mention the hundreds of millions of pounds being invested by New Charter Housing and Irwell Valley Housing through stock transfer, and by Stockport Homes through an arm's length management organisation, which will bring the area's housing stock up to the decent homes standards.</p>
	<p pid="a.1650.0/15">I could talk about the new schools being built and the innovative joint services being developed with the NHS and social services, or the new jobs coming into the area through redevelopment and regeneration schemes. Put simply, tackling health inequalities involves cross-cutting responsibilities. When that is looked at a whole, the Government have much to be proud of.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-02-16a.1652.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1541" speakername="Geoffrey Cox" colnum="1652"  time="017:18:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060216/debtext/60216-33.htm#60216-33_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.1652.0/1">I shall try to be brief, as I know that others of my hon. Friends want to speak.</p>
	<p pid="a.1652.0/2">I listened to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1531" name="Andrew Gwynne">the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish (Andrew Gwynne)</phrase> with fascination. I have begun to realise what it must have been like for the little boy pressing his nose to the window of the pie shop, wishing he could get his hands on some of the goodies. I represent Torridge and West Devon, which is one of the most rural constituencies in England. In the few minutes of the House's time that I shall occupy, I shall concentrate on rural health inequalities.</p>
	<p pid="a.1652.0/3">The constituency that I represent cannot tell a story of such gladness and happiness as the hon. Gentleman has just recited. It is suffering cuts. Constituents who are in need of medical services often have to travel dozens, if not hundreds of miles to receive it. We have acute and primary care trusts in deficit. They are closing community beds, have shut down minor injuries units, and are considering further cuts on top of those. An acute hospital trust is &pound;9 million in debt and two out of three primary care trusts are between &pound;1 million and &pound;3 million in debt. I know that the Government will say that mismanagement is almost certainly the only explanation for those predicaments, but I submit to the House that there is another, longer-term reason, and it has to do with the system of allocation of resources to rural areas in England.</p>
	<p pid="a.1652.0/4">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-10">10 January</phrase> t<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1940" name="Peter Luff">his year, my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Peter Luff)</phrase> asked the Secretary of State to look again at the resource allocation system for rural PCTs. He was told that a review had been carried out by the advisory committee on resource allocation and that as a result,</p>
	<p pid="a.1652.0/5" class="indent">&quot;the formula takes account of the effects of access, transport and poverty in calculating health need in rural areas.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-10">10 January 2006</phrase>; Vol. 441, c. 601W.]</p>
	<p pid="a.1652.0/6">However, things are definitely not all right. It is widely recognised by experts who have examined the subject that the indices of deprivation which partly govern the allocation of resources fail to capture rural health needs. The characteristics that make that so are reasonably well understood, although perhaps their quantitative effects are not. What is to blame is the national weighted capitation formula, which is based on the age distribution of the population, additional need, and unavoidable geographical variations in the cost of providing services. The indices adopted by the formula use inappropriate proxies for deprivation in rural communities, and research has highlighted an inherent bias towards urban areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.1652.0/7">It is absurd to apply to Torridge and West Devon a measurement that depends on car ownership. Everybody in the countryside who can possibly scrimp and save to buy a car will do so. It must be the same in the rural constituencies represented by Labour Members. If we adopt a proxy for rural health need that is based on car ownership, we will get a distorted picture of the needs in that rural area. It is absurd to base an assessment or measurement of health needs on the proportion of ethnic minorities in the seat. As we know, it is a documented fact that there are fewer ethnic minorities in rural areas, but that does not mean that there is less isolation, less poverty and less financial disadvantage. Nevertheless, that is the effect of the formula.</p>
	<p pid="a.1652.0/8">As we heard earlier, rural deprivation tends to be hidden, because people living in poverty in rural areas are dispersed across heterogeneous communities. Therefore, the indices that aim to define areas as deprived ignore profound and genuine need in rural areas. People in the countryside are a hardy breed. They are proud, self-reliant and independent-minded, and there is characteristically&mdash;a researched and documented fact&mdash;a low uptake of benefits. That, too, disguises the true level of deprivation in rural areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.1652.0/9">The costs of geographical variations are underestimated. Delivering services in rural areas is more expensive because of poor economies of scale, unproductive time spent travelling by health care professionals and patients alike, and additional telecommunication costs. There are additional expenses associated with transport, including higher fuel costs, providing mobile and outreach services, maintaining branch surgeries, dispersed community hospitals and providing training and support.</p>
	<p pid="a.1652.0/10">The Minister has said that the current formula for resource allocation to PCTs takes rural factors into account, but if one examines the fifth edition of the weighted capitation formula, which is an 88-page document, the word &quot;rural&quot; appears seven times in a single section about ambulance trusts. That document states, for example, that need is assessed with reference to the number of GP surgery visits, but people in rural areas do not go to their doctors as often as people in urban areas. In rural areas, GP surgeries often involve single-handed practices; people find it difficult to attend GP surgeries for want of transport; and cultural factors sometimes prevent people from admitting that they are ill. In rural areas, one cannot depend on the number of people who visit GPs to assess the primary medical services component.</p>
	<p pid="a.1652.0/11">Those are the reasons why the people of rural communities do not believe the Government when they talk a good game on delivering rural health services and tackling rural deprivation. The people do not believe them on health, and they do not believe them on education, which is another important factor in any assessment of deprivation. This year, the schoolchildren of Devon will receive &pound;308 a pupil less than the national funding average, and next year they will receive &pound;330 less, which is a function of the sixth worst education grant in the country. The people are entitled to doubt the Government's commitment to rural areas in the south-west.</p>
	<p pid="a.1652.0/12">A radical change in direction is needed. In countries such as Australia, Canada and even Scotland, rural adjustments are made, and it is accepted that the indices for the allocation of resources are flawed when they are applied to rural areas. In those countries, systematic research is conducted to capture those needs, and although the Government have made pious noises about compiling a rural database from which to make an accurate assessment of rural needs, little has been done.</p>
	<p pid="a.1652.0/13">In an earlier intervention, I referred to the December 2004 DEFRA technical report, which shows that most of the agencies from which DEFRA seeks information are simply not equipped to distinguish between the rural and the urban in the data that they collect. The health funding formula is based on the work of those agencies. Only last week, the Government's chief medical officer, Sir Liam Donaldson, said in the foreword to a booklet:</p>
	<p pid="a.1652.0/14" class="indent">&quot;We often think of life in rural areas as being something of an idyll, but there is now a wealth of evidence highlighting issues of rural deprivation social exclusion which has a potential impact on the health of those living in rural communities.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1652.0/15">A concerted multi-agency approach is required, and every agency and every Department should ensure that information distinguishes between the urban and the rural. It is time for the Government to live up to the CMO's admirable sentiments.</p>
	<p pid="a.1652.0/16">The Government have wept crocodile tears over the plight of the countryside for eight and a half years. Farming and tourism are the twin pillars of the rural economy, but as farming has declined, English tourism has been undersold and the way of life in rural communities has been decimated by insensitivity and neglect, we have been told that it is all right, because Labour is concentrating on the things that matter to people in the towns and the countryside&mdash;education, health and poverty. However, those claims ring hollow when they are judged by the reality in the rural south-west, where people perceive a casual indifference to their areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.1652.0/17">If the real needs of rural people are not identified by a concerted and coherent effort, which I have discussed, health inequalities can only get worse. In Scotland and Wales, the devolved assemblies and their Executives recognise the importance of financial adjustments in the distribution of resources to their countryside communities. It is time that the Government did the same for England.</p>
