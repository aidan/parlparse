<p>The price of bread in London is regulated voluntarily in accordance with the Food Council's scale, under which the price of the 4-lb. loaf varies by &#x00BD;d. for every 4s. rise or fall in the price of a sack of 280 lbs. of straight run flour. If the price of a sack of flour does not rise above the figure of 27s., to which it was recently reduced, the price of the loaf should be reduced to 7&#x00BD;d. on the 31st July.

<p>Most of the contracts for the larger Militia camps were placed on the basis of prime cost plus a fee for profit, overhead expenses and the use of certain tools.

The cost plus percentage of cost basis has been used in one exceptional case only. The cost plus fixed fee contracts contain a stipulation that rates in excess of those for the time being awarded by the wage fixing machinery of the building industry shall not be paid. I am aware that, in order to provide the necessary labour, "exceptional margin" rates, higher than those normally payable in the districts, concerned, have been fixed by the industry for some of these camps but I have learned of only one case in which the rates of wages, etc., paid were in excess of those required by the working rules of the industry, and immediate steps were taken to have the wages reduced in that case.</p>

<p>The normal method of placing contracts for War Department building services is by competitive tendering amongst firms selected from those noted on the Department's list of contractors.

<p>I think I have tried to help the hon. Gentleman. I have done a considerable amount of research to get him the figures, which did not tally with the information which he had. I have now told him that, with the contractor's consent, I have no objection to his visiting the works and examining the books. The contract provides for examination of the wages sheet by a military officer; that is the only right I have under the contract. I propose to ask the contractor that the hon.

<p>The effective expenditure on our military garrison in China for the year ended 31st March, 1938, was &#x00A3;1,817,082, excluding recruiting and training expenses at home.

An infantry battalion of the Indian Army is permanently lent for Imperial service at Hong Kong and forms part of the military garrison; its whole cost, estimated at &#x00A3;90,000 a year, is borne by Army Funds. Since September, 1937, a second infantry battalion of the Indian Army has been on loan from India for service at Hong Kong, the whole cost of which is, similarly, borne by Army Funds.</p>

<p>During the past two years, 14 extra Regular and 81 extra Territorial chaplains have been appointed, of whom one and five respectively represent the Free Churches. The extra cost involved in these appointments is some &#x00A3;8,000 a year. No difficulty is experienced in filling vacancies. In garrisons where there is an insufficient number of troops to justify the maintenance of regular chaplains, local clergy and ministers are employed as part-time officiating chaplains; in these, the Free Churches are included. Close co-operation is maintained with the authorities of the various churches, both depart mentally and through the Interdenominational Advisory Committee on Army Chaplaincy Services, and all nominations for chaplains of every kind are made by them. The spiritual care of militiamen will be maintained in the same manner as for Regular troops. Militiamen who have no religious belief will be permitted to make a declaration to that effect, and will not be compelled to attend the Divine Service of any church. There is: no objection to gatherings of an ethical and educational character, so long as the general regulations of the camp or station are observed.</p>

<p>I have been in communication with the Service Departments on this subject. Herring do not form part of the standard rations issued in kind, and it is left to the messing authorities concerned to decide what they will buy with the cash messing allowance, according to the wishes of the men. Herring are regularly quoted in the price lists of the Navy, Army and Air Force Institutes, and, as my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary to the War Office stated on 4th July, tinned herring are issued in considerable quantity at stations abroad. I am also informed that cooks attending the Army School of Cookery are taught different ways of preparing herring. It appears, therefore, that, so far as circumstances permit, the Service Departments have this matter fully in view. With regard to the last part of the question, I am informed by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster that his Department have already arranged to pur-

chase all the supplies of canned herring which the manufacturers can offer up to 15th August, and have in view to make additional purchases as further supplies become available.</p>

<p>asked the Secretary of State for Scotland to what extent the circular letter of 16th February, 1938, from the Department of Health for Scotland has stimulated a more extended use of sulphanilamide preparations for streptococcal and urinary infections; and whether he has any information as to the hospital-bed accommodation which may thereby be made available for war emergency purposes?</p>

<p>We desire to obtain to-day the Committee stage of the British Overseas Airways Bill; the Report and


Third Reading of the War Risks Insurance Bill, and of the House of Commons Members Fund Bill, as well as the Second Reading of the Isle of Man (Customs) Bill, and the Motion to approve the Rumanian Clearing Office Amendment Order. We also hope that there will be an opportunity of disposing of the Report of the three Supplementary Estimates which were considered in Committee on 17th May, as well as the Committee stage of Supplementary Estimates for the Navy, Army and Air which were recently presented.<br/>
With regard to the Estimates for preparation of the plan for the Ministry of Information, I hope that it will be possible to find time for the Debate on the Supplementary Estimate, and I would suggest to the right hon. Gentleman that it might be discussed through the usual channels to see what time should be allocated for this purpose.<br/>
I would like to say that in the Statement of Business last Thursday I announced the Government's intention of asking the House to take the remaining stages of the Senior Public Elementary Schools (Liverpool) Bill during the present week. This Bill has been considered by the Select Committee this morning, and I am informed that it has been reported to the House without amendment. It is a hybrid Bill, and, therefore, has to go through the additional procedure of a Select Committee in each House. I am advised that if the Bill is to secure its passage into law before the Summer Recess, it is necessary for it to be received in another place during to-morrow's Sitting. I am sure that it is the desire of Members in all parts of the House to facilitate the passage of the Bill, and I would therefore ask the House to agree to its remaining stages being taken as first Order to-morrow before we enter upon the consideration of the Prevention of Violence (Temporary Provisions) Bill.</p>

<p>I beg to move,
<q> That leave be given to bring in a Bill to facilitate the avoidance of corruption.</q>
During recent months there have been introduced into this House Bills dealing with the instalment system and with

share-pushing, and everyone will admit the importance of those Bills and the serious character of the evil with which they deal; yet at the same time we must recognise that those affected by those Bills were only the sprats of the financial world, and now, it seems to me, the time has come to give some consideration to the sharks, because the sharks have been busy in the troubled waters of politics, and as a consequence of the power they have in this House and in another place they may in conceivable circumstances become very dangerous and a source of very undesirable corruption. I know that a small group in the other place have, through a series of relationships, control most of the Government Departments in this House, and that 200 relatives sitting on the other side of the House can determine the policy of this House. The book


" Tory M.P." is an extraordinary revelation of what can happen, and the possibilities that exist of corruption and of a cynical attitude towards democracy and democratic institutions that can easily destroy us in a time of crisis.<br/>
To understand the nature of this financial power is to understand the character of the policy that has been in operation in this country and which brought about the betrayal of Abyssinia. When we realise the part those associated with oil played in that disastrous affair we can see how it was possible for Mussolini to get his way. If we understand the part played by the big financial houses and their representatives here we can understand the reason for the betrayal of democracy in Spain and in Czechoslovakia; it gives us an insight into why we have had such a deplorable capitulation to Japan and why there is such procrastination in the Anglo-Soviet talks in the hope that in the meantime a way will be found of handing Danzig over to Herr Hitler.<br/>
I have heard Members of this House talk very often about the character of the membership of this House immediately after the War. I have heard them talk of the "new rich" who came in here bloated with profits. They have told me, and I have heard it said in the House, that it was a terrible spectacle. But I suggest that the "new rich" never were the danger and never have the potentialities for corruption that the "old nobility" have. The "old nobility" have kept themselves firmly entrenched in power and privilege, they keep their hold on the land and in the financial houses, and they have placed in this House a stone wall against any advance in the pensions of the aged people, even while their own relatives are getting all kinds of sinecures and pensions as a result of the power possessed by the 200 relatives who sit in this House and who continually vote subsidies for themselves. This continued activity under a cloak of obscurity can have very evil consequences. Therefore, I want to introduce a short Bill that will bring out into the light before the electorate, not only the general characters, but the financial and landed interests and connections of those

who stand for Parliament or those who sit in this House.<br/>
Clause 1 deals with Parliamentary candidates and imposes upon them the responsibility of disclosing the sources of their income, the number of directorships in their own hands or in the hands of their relatives, the acreage of land in their possession or in possession of their families, or whether through another member of the family they are represented in another place. There will be a Sub-section imposing the penalty of imprisonment, to which a fine will be added if they do not give full particulars. The second Clause deals with Members of this House. Members of Parliament will be called upon to make a full statement of their holdings in land, industry and finance to the Clerks at the Table. All such Members will be ruled out of discussion and prohibited from voting on any question on which they have a definite personal or family financial interest. There will be a provision that will allow an appeal to Mr. Speaker where the financial interest is negligible and is not likely to prejudice their vote. There will be a penalty also here for wrong information given under the Clause, and the penalty will be imprisonment to which a fine may be added.

<p>I beg to move, in page 1, line 10, to leave out "British Overseas Airways," and to insert "Air Imperial Routes."<br/>
The object of this Amendment is somewhat pretentious. It is in fact to change the title of the corporation which the Bill sets up. The name that I propose is Air Imperial Routes Corporation instead of British Overseas Airways Corporation. The idea of the change of the title at this late stage may seem unusual, but there is a precedent for it. I remember that in 1919, when the Government of the day introduced a Bill setting up a Ministry of Ways and Communications, it was not until quite a late stage in the consideration of the Bill that an Amendment was moved to change the title to "Minisry of Transport," and it was under those conditions that the Ministry of Transport was set up.<br/>
The Bill has had a Second Reading and consequently we have given our general assent to it, but there is a feeling that the title is rather cumbersome. These great organisations more and more are known throughout the world by their initials. There is the British Broadcasting Corporation, which is scarcely ever referred to other than by its initials, and we have the K.L.M., the I.C.I, and others. If we are going to stick to the present name we shall have this great English organisation known as B.O.A., and I maintain that that will be a very unfavourable form of initial. It gives one the unpleasant idea of a snakelike organisation, creeping round you and finally crushing you. My proposal is that it should be known as Air Imperial Routes, and the beauty of that suggestion is that you will get the initials A.I.R. I am certain that this great organisation would soon be known throughout the world by the name "Air Corporation." It seems to me that the name is comprehensive, it is short, and it means what it says.</p>

<p>In supporting the Amendment I only want to point out that to foreign competitors and users of air lines a short title is very much more important than a long title. Anyone who has travelled abroad, particularly in France, will know the familiar words "Air France," and I echo what the right hon. and gallant Member has said that the initials B.O.A. cannot do anything but harm to this new corporation which we all wish to succeed. I am not particularly insistent on the actual words "Air Imperial Routes," but I hope that something will be done to improve what is at present a really frightful title. A.I.R. is almost essential unless some other equally well-sounding initials can be found. If the present name is not changed, I feel that we shall suffer much against competitors with high-sounding names, and I hope that the Secretary of State will do something to change the name before the Report stage.</p>

<p>I should like to support the Amendment. The initials B.O.A. are not very nice, and although I do not like A.I.R. I think it is a better name for the corporation which we are hoping will succeed. I trust that the right hon. Gentleman will consider this matter again before the Report stage.</p>

<p>The hon. and gallant Member for Wallasey (Lieut.-Colonel Moore-Brabazon) made a suggestion for the Title on the Second Reading. I also made a suggestion for a Title which, I think, is far better, and as he has repeated his suggestion may I be allowed to repeat mine? It is that the corporation should be called "Universal Airways Corporation," or "Royal Airways Corporation." The latter name would have useful initials. I am surprised that none of these suggestions have been adopted so far, but I hope one of them will be.</p>

<p>I do not think the name "British Overseas Airways," has the approval of anyone on any side of the Committee, and I hope that the Secretary of State will reconsider the title before the Report stage. I am not altogether in favour of the Amendment. The title "Air Imperial Routes" is a little better


than "British Overseas Airways," but not very much, and I should like the right hon. Gentleman to tell the Committee why he ever gave up the name "Imperial Airways," which is much the best name for this corporation.</p>

<p>I agree with a great deal of what the hon. and gallant Member for Wallasey (Lieut.-Colonel Moore-Brabazon) has said, but I do not think his title is very much better than the Title in the Bill. "British Overseas Airways" and "Air Imperial Routes" are both cacophonous, and, no doubt, the Air Minister knows the Greek word "caco"&#x2014;bad, and "phonous"&#x2014; sound&#x2014;a bad sound, and that is why I do not like either of these titles. "British Overseas Airways" as a title appeals only to the people of this country, and means nothing to those living in the far distant parts of the Empire. As other hon. Members have made suggestions, may I venture to make one or two? The first is that the corporation should be known as "British Empire Airways" giving you the initials B.E.A., or "British Airways." As a third suggestion why not call it "Royal British Airways," or, fourthly, "British Imperial Airways." I ask the Secretary of State to choose from these names, because I am certain that the present name is the very worst possible. It means everything to have a good crisp name so that when our machines arrive in the Argentine, with the French and German and Italian machines, our nationals out there will say, "Here come the B.A. machines." It is a fine thing to have a good title, and I think you should bring the Empire into it because you have representatives of the Empire on the board, and these machines will fly largely between the different parts of the Empire and carry Empire air mails.</p>

<p>I should like to support the suggestion of the hon. and gallant Member who has just spoken that the name should be "British Airways." I feel that if British Airways had not been the name of one of the corporations being amalgamated it was the obvious title, and would have been chosen. It is rather petty and small-minded if such a reason exists for not choosing what is the outstanding and

obvious and correct title. I put it to the Secretary of State that if British Airways had been correctly named and had been called "Continental Airways," as it was running Continental routes, he would have had no difficulty when amalgamating these two corporations in arriving at what is, obviously, the correct title&#x2014; British Airways. It is short and it describes the corporation exactly. It also compares well with "Air France," and I hope the right hon. Gentleman will override what is obviously a very petty and temporary objection, which in a few years will have been forgotten altogether.</p>

<p>I do not think the proposal of the hon. and gallant Member is a correct representation of the new corporation. A large part of the work of the new corporation will be in Europe and across the Atlantic air route, which is not Imperial. Listening to the discussion I am led to the conclusion that "British Airways" would be a better title than "British Overseas Airways." It would avoid those awkward initials, and beyond the fact that this title is already in use, there is no objection to it, and I think that that objection will be forgotten very soon.</p>

<p>As we have been told that the whole of the internal airways in this country are to be excluded from the activities of the corporation, therefore the name "British Airways" would certainly not accurately describe the work of the new corporation.</p>

<p>The Committee will agree that I am in some considerable difficulty about this matter. Various suggestions have been made and various names have been put forward. It has been suggested that we should retain the title "British Airways." As a matter of fact, there is some practical difficulty in that respect, and also in using the title "Imperial Airways," because both these names still remain upon the register covering these two companies, and will, in fact, remain there until they go into voluntary liquidation when the transactions under the Bill are completed. Therefore, so far as an immediate decision is concerned, we could not go to Somerset House and register a company


in the name of a company already on the list. It might also be a matter of some difficulty if there was a company going into liquidation bearing the name of the new company. I should be only too glad if hon. Members could agree upon a name, and if there is a general consensus of opinion between now and when the Bill goes to another place, I shall be always glad to consider any suggestion. I do not pretend that my own selection of a name is by any means the best, and perhaps we may at some future stage have an informal talk about it.<br/>
But let me say a word or two in defence of the title we have chosen. I do not accept the suggestion that, of necessity, the new corporation will be known by its initials. Air France is not, and it is a well known company; and it may be that this new corporation may be known to the world as "British Overseas," which, in fact, is not a bad title, and one which much more accurately describes the purpose of this corporation than any name that has been suggested yet. It describes with absolute accuracy and precision what the corporation stands for. It is world wide. If you want to describe the corporation accurately I think you must rule out the word "Imperial." One can easily criticise the title but the hon. and gallant Member for Wallasey (Lieut.-Colonel Moore-Brabazon) has not criticised the title but its initials. I suggest to the Committee that the name should stand, because I think it may be that the Corporation will not be known by its initials, but will be known as "British Overseas." I hope my hon. Friend will not press the Amendment this afternoon, but will leave the matter in the way I have described. If some hon. Member has a new and brilliant idea in connection with the name of the corporation, on which all hon. Members can agree, no one will be happier than I shall be.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 1, line 13, after "of," to insert "the Secretary of State for Air."<br/>
The object of this Amendment is to clarify the relationship between the new corporation and the House of Commons. I think I am correct in saying that whenever an hon. Member wishes to have a Debate on the British Broadcasting Corporation or to ask a question about it, he is ruled out of order because there is no Minister responsible for it in the House. On the other hand, if an hon. Member wishes to ask a question about the Forestry Commission, the question is allowed, because there is an hon. Member who represents the Forestry Commission in the House. The only opportunity which the House will have of debating civil aviation, as it is affected by the proposed corporation, will be once a year on the Estimates, and as is known by every hon. Member who is interested in the Air Estimates, on that occasion civil aviation is rarely discussed until midnight, or very often one or two o'clock in the morning. In order to make it possible to raise matters that come under the jurisdiction of the corporation, I move this Amendment to include the Secretary of State in the corporation as an <i>ex officio</i> member, so that he would be directly responsible to the House for the actions of the corporation, with the result that it would be possible for hon. Members to put questions on the subject to the Secretary of State.</p>

<p>I do not know whether the Amendment is the best way of producing the result which my hon. Friend desires, but I think it is very important that the Bill should be so framed as to permit hon. Members to put questions, in order that the corporation shall be under Parliamentary control. I hope the Minister will deal with that point.</p>

<p>I hope my hon. Friend will not press his Amendment. This Bill commends itself very largely to hon. Members opposite because it is under suspicion of being a Socialistic Bill. As a matter of fact, it has a very strong tinge of Socialism in it, but my hon. Friend wants to be more royalist than the king, and to bring the Secretary of State into the day-to-day administration of the corporation. The Bill gives


the corporation a considerable measure of independence, but this Amendment, if adopted, would in fact almost extinguish that independence.</p>

<p>The Amendment would, in fact, make the Secretary of State for Air a member of the corporation, and I do not think hon. Members in any part of the Committee would desire that that should be so. To adopt the Amendment would be to place the Secretary of State in an almost impossible position. The members of the corporation will have a collective responsibility for the control of the corporation's affairs and its management, subject to what is laid down in the Act; but the Secretary of State, quite properly and rightly, will be in a very different position. He will have to give directions in accordance with certain powers that are being conferred upon him, and certain things will be subject to his approval; for instance, those matters which concern finance. Therefore, he would be in an impossible position if he was a member of the corporation and at the same time was the person who had to give his approval.<br/>
My hon. Friend has another object in mind in moving the Amendment. Quite properly, from his point of view, he wants to secure adequate discussion in Parliament of the affairs of the corporation and a fair and reasonable opportunity, on matters of primary importance, of addressing questions to the Secretary of State. It is not my function to rule what questions could be put to the Secretary of State, but it is, I think, clear that the corporation, in relation to the House of Commons, will be in a very different position from that of the British Broadcasting Corporation. The British Broadcasting Corporation is constituted under a charter, whereas the new corporation is to be constituted under an Act of Parliament, and under that Act very many responsibilities and duties will be placed upon the Secretary of State, concerning finance and other matters. I assume&#x2014;I do not think there is any doubt about it&#x2014;that it will be possible to put questions on all those matters to the Secretary of State for Air.<br/>
As regards the question of Parliamentary time, of course the mere fact of the Secretary of State being a member of the corporation would not make any further

provision of Parliamentary time for discussion of the affairs of the corporation. It may very well be, now that the State is taking a much more active part and making larger financial contributions with regard to Civil Aviation, that some other arrangements will have to be contemplated with regard to discussions of Civil Aviation in the House. That is not a matter on which I can give any undertaking, but I have that in mind, and we shall see how things develop. As to matters concerning the major affairs of the corporation which hon. Members might desire to bring before the House, they would not be in any way debarred from doing so by the way in which this Bill is drafted; in fact, they would be assisted in raising matters, as other important matters can be raised, through our ordinary procedure.<br/>
Therefore, while I do not think we want to encourage questions concerning the day-to-day management of the corporation, which would indeed make the administration impossible, I think that, by the provisions of the Bill, we shall in fact secure a very large measure of Parliamentary control, which I believe is all to the good. I suggest to my hon. Friend that, having heard my explanation, he should withdraw the Amendment, and although I know that he put down the Amendment for the purpose of raising the question, I am sure he will recognise that the exact terms in which it is drafted are very undesirable.</p>

<p>I think that the hon. Member for Windsor (Sir A. Somerville) regards hon. Members as being rather more doctrinaire than in fact they are. We might have argued that this new industry should be controlled in the same way as the Post Office or in the same way as London Transport, but I do not think that we would wish to argue that it should be controlled by a rather impracticable mixture of the two. That would be the result of the Amendment. There are certain duties affecting the Secretary of State for Air for which he ought to answer in the House and for which, I think, he will have to answer. As far as the corporation is concerned, it will have other duties to perform, and if the Secretary of State becomes a member of the corporation, he will be only one of 17 members. I do not see how he could


possibly be expected to have responsibility before the House with regard to duties in the determination of which he would be so insignificant a minority. Therefore, I do not consider this to be a practicable Amendment.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 2, line 13, at the end, to insert:
<q> but such appointment and the terms thereof shall be subject to the approval of the Secretary of State and shall not be for a period longer than five years in any one term of appointment.''</q>
I shall endeavour to emulate the brevity shown by hon. Members who have spoken on the two previous Amendments, and I hope this will not result in the Secretary of State showing any less inclination to meet any valid points which may be raised. The proposal in the Amendment is to make the appointment of the chief executive member of the new corporation and the terms of that appointment a matter for the Secretary of State, in the same way as the appointment of the chairman and deputy-chairman is already made a matter for him under the Bill. It is not intended to interfere in any way with any existing contract of the chief executive. I do not know whether the right hon. Gentleman will feel disposed to tell us what is the present position with regard to Sir John Reith, a matter which gives rise, as everything effecting that gentleman docs, to a great deal of public interest and curiosity. However, I shall not press that matter. Nor is it my intention to secure that in no case shall the chief executive remain in the appointment for a longer period than five years. What is proposed is that he shall first be appointed by the Secretary of State for a period not longer than five years, but that the appointment shall be renewable, within the discretion of the Secretary of State, and that the terms of the appointment shall be laid down by the Minister.<br/>
I am well aware that in paragraph 1 of the First Schedule, the Secretary of State has certain powers in regard to altering the period of appointment of a member of the corporation if he should become either chairman, deputy-chairman or chief executive member. There-

fore, in that Schedule, it is recognised that there is a certain unity of character between these three officers which requires them to be brought under the particular control of the Secretary of State. What valid reason is there for the Minister surrendering the control of the appointment of chief executive member to the corporation itself? It may be that at some distant time another party will be in office which is not favourable to the right hon. Gentleman's own ideas&#x2014;I know that seems a strange thing to contemplate in fixing the provisions of this Bill&#x2014;and there might be appointed to the office of chief executive someone with ideas entirely alien to those held by the right hon. Gentleman the Secretary of State, which would make it impossible to have that close co-operation between the two which is so essential if this scheme is to operate smoothly. Therefore, I hope that the Minister will agree with the proposal I have made, unless he can offer some substantial reason for not doing so.</p>

<p>I am sure the Committee feels indebted to the hon. Member for North Aberdeen (Mr. Garro Jones) for his very clear and concise statement on the Amendment. I want at once to say that, in drafting the Bill, I have not had in mind the consideration which the hon. Member has mentioned; and I may add that I do not contemplate any alteration in the Government of this country for some time to come. There is, however, a real reason why the corporation is permitted, under the structure of the Bill, to appoint its own chief executive member. Having regard to the experimental nature of these proposals we must try to balance the position, as between the State, represented by the Secretary of State for Air, and the members of the corporation who will have to discharge the various duties laid down in the Bill and who will, I hope, bring incentive and endeavour and initiative to the work of the corporation. I think there is a prospect that as a result of this experiment we may succeed in obtaining the advantages of State aid with a certain measure of Parliamentary supervision, while at the same time preserving that natural initiative which is in everybody but is in some people to a greater degree than in others. I am sure that is a principle to which no objection will be taken.


What we contemplate is that, as regards the management of the corporation, in such matters, for instance, as the appointment of the chief executive officer, and, later on, in the appointment of officers and staff and workers, the members should be responsible to the corporation itself. We have made a distinction in that respect, in order that they may have a full measure of responsibility in those matters and feel themselves unhampered by any direction from the Secretary of</p>

<p>State, or by requiring the approval of the Secretary of State. That is the actual reason for the distinction which we are making and I commend it to the Committee. I think this is a opportunity for the encouragement of the business or management side of the corporation which I would like to see left as it has been provided for in the terms of the Bill.</p>

<p>The effect of these Amendments would be to exclude the corporation altogether from the internal field, and I shall reply to the hon. Gentleman's three questions by dealing, very briefly at this stage, with the general position of internal air lines and Railway Air Services under the Bill. I think this will be convenient to the Committee and may save time in the discussion of subsequent Amendments. In its original form, the corporation had power to run internal lines, but that was a reserved power under Clause 4 and was subject to the special consent of the Secretary of State. Certain negotiations took place with the organisation representing the internal air line operators, who felt that there was not sufficient security in the Bill as originally drafted. They also felt that before the Secretary of State exercised his power under Clause 4, as it then was, there should be an opportunity for those operators to state their objections to the exercise of that power. Therefore, the Select Committee allowed the insertion of a Clause&#x2014;and I should like to express our gratitude to them for allowing these Clauses to be put in at that stage of the Bill&#x2014;which makes the running of an internal air line or the conduct of an internal air survey flight subject to Provisional Order procedure, which means that the Secretary of State can only make a Provisional Order and that, if it is objected to, the matter goes to a Committee of Parliament, so that the objectors have an opportunity to be represented by counsel and to put forward their objections to the confirmation of the Order. That was agreed to and considered as adequate by those who felt that their interests were prejudiced in the Bill as it originally stood.<br/>
We consider that it is desirable that the corporation should have these wide powers of running internal lines and doing air survey flights, but subject now to this additional safeguard. Indeed, it might be desirable in the future for the corporation, by agreement with the interests running

internal lines, to co-operate in the running of such lines. For instance in Clause 4 (3) there is provision for the <i>status quo</i> with Railway Air Services to be maintained, and this was agreed to by all parties. The answer to my hon. Friend's first question, Can the corporation run internal air lines? is Yes, but only subject to Provisional Order procedure. To his second question, Is the corporation above the law or, if these powers were ever exercised, either by agreement without objection or alternatively after confirmation by the Select Committee, would they be subject to the licensing authority? The answer is Yes. That is provided for in Clause 4 (4) and in Clause 7. On the Second Reading I gave an undertaking that we would strengthen the provision. As to the third point with regard to Railway Air Services, Imperial Airways have at present an operational agreement by which they supply the crews and maintain the aircraft. They also have a share interest, which I understand is 20 or 25 per cent. That <i>status quo</i> is to be maintained in the future. There is power for renewal of the agreement in substantially the same form as at present, which means that it could not be extended to any considerable degree but it can be continued.</p>

<p>Might I ask for a little more specific elucidation of Clause 4 (3, b)? It is that power which permits the perpetuation of the existing arrangements with Railway Air Services. The words are that nothing shall prevent the corporation
<q> from continuing to carry out any existing arrangements with respect to the operation of air transport services on behalf of that company.</q>
This may be internal air services, and the existing arrangements may allow the corporation to carry out the administration of any air line that Railway Air Services may have in operation or may in future inaugurate. Therefore, we may have, by some indirect method, a power under which the corporation could run internal air lines under the guise of an arrangement with Railway Air Services.</p>

<p>The position, as I see it, is that the corporation could only be indirectly concerned in the extension of any Railway Air Service activities, assuming that the Secretary of State had assented to that particular action. Also I think it would not happen unless other


internal lines had, as it were, left the field and there fore Railway Air Services were able to appear in front of the licensing authority and obtain permission to run those side extensions.</p>

<p>These two Amendments seem to me to go further, probably, than the Mover intended. I should imagine that the Provisional Order procedure is a sufficient safeguard in respect of the interests about which he is concerned. It is not only a question of Railway Air Services or any other body operating internal services now. If passed, the Amendments would practically guarantee any possible combination of internal air services a monopoly of the whole country. I see no reason at all why that monopoly should be either granted or allowed for in subsequent developments, and I should imagine that the provisions hereinafter referred to will be sufficient safeguard against any unfair competition with existing interests which must, of course, be considered. I appreciate that point, but the Amendments go much further than that and we must oppose them.</p>

<p>I should like to reinforce what my hon. and gallant Friend has said. In Clause 5 there are six words which remind one of the Commandments
<q> The corporation shall not manufacture aircraft.</q>
I think that, as provided for in this Subsection, they are practically given power to do that by accumulating sufficient component parts.

<p>My hon. and gallant Friends will, perhaps, see another aspect of the question if I explain what the Amendment would entail. The power to manufacture parts of aircraft and aircraft equipment and accessories is deliberately drawn in wide terms, and it forms part of the Section of the Bill which sets out the powers, of the corporation which correspond with the memorandum and articles of association of a commercial company. The exercise of the power to manufacture parts is, however, one of the reserved powers which can only be exercised with the consent of the Secretary of State, and the intention is that those powers shall only be approved to the same extent by the general authority which is given at present to Imperial Airways. For instance, the type of new parts which are manufactured by the company are parts for which there is a small demand and which are hard to obtain. I will give one or two examples&#x2014;chairs, bunks, lifebelts, thermos-carriers, in regard to which the company has special knowledge, special requirements and special experience; lifebuoys, and general spare parts, such as nuts, bolts and auxiliary mountings. These are just a few. If we accepted the Amendment
<q> for the purposes of repair or replacement only,</q>
the corporation would in future be excluded from manufacturing those special requirements and, indeed, would be placed in a rather restricted position as regards essential activities. They could not use fully their special knowledge, based on years of experience, of the manufacture of those special requirements and they could not develop their work experimentally in respect of those requirements, nor could they help other aircraft operators stranded in remote parts of the world. I give the assurance again that these powers will only be exercised as reserved powers, and only under general approval, to the extent that they now are.</p>

<li>(<i>a</i>) on an outward journey, no passengers, mails or other freight embarked in the British Islands are disembarked in Eire except by way of transhipment for the purpose of conveyance by air across the Atlantic; and</li>

This is a Clause that has the effect of requiring the corporation to institute that Provisional Order procedure which I mentioned to the Committee earlier this afternoon, if it wishes to run any service to Eire. The main reason for a corporation service to Eire would be in respect of a Translantic service. The corporation might, for instance, wish to run a land-plane service from some point in England to Eire, where it would tranship its passengers into either a flying boat or an aircraft particularly suitable for the Atlantic crossing; and to require a Provisional Order procedure for such a development would be unduly restrictive and outside the scope of the agreement which has been come to with the internal operating companies, which have agreed that this exclusion should be put before the Committee for approval.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 6, line 4, to leave out Sub-section (3).<br/>
We do not like this Sub-section at all and think it should come out, lock, stock, and barrel. It refers to Railway Air Services and would enable the corporation to hold stock, to run these services, and to carry out any arrangement with Railway Air Services by way of the renewal of any existing agreement. I think I may tell the Committee what Railway Air Services is. The railway companies took power to themselves in 1929 to operate air services, but I believe none of them exercised those powers until 1933, when the Great Western Railway commenced running air lines. Apparently they did not find their operation as easy as they anticipated, and in 1934, together with the Southern Railway, the London Midland and Scottish Railway, and the London and North Eastern Railway, they asked Imperial Airways whether they would get them out of their responsibility of operating aircraft services, while at the same time retaining a clear interest in those services and not finding themselves in the position that they did in regard to road services, where they allowed vested interests in road transport to spring up and had to purchase those interests out at a high figure. Therefore, in 1934 there was this arrangement between the four railway companies and Imperial Airways, whereby each of them had one-fifth of the shares in Railway Air Services, and Imperial Airways operated the services for Railway Air Services.<br/>
My hon. and gallant Friend the Undersecretary of State, when speaking a few moments ago, seemed to think that because the internal air line operators were content to let this arrangement continue, it was proper that it should continue, but I beg leave to think that there are possibly national considerations which might affect the internal operators. As I understand it, this corporation is being formed to clean up British civil air transport, and it has been put in control of all our overseas air transport. Surely this operation of services for Railway Air Services is part of the bad old days when Imperial Airways thought they had to


snatch at every opportunity of flying anywhere and everywhere in order to try and prevent anybody else who was a British citizen or a British company from operating air services or flights; and it seems to me that we are weakening the corporation when we allow or encourage it to continue what is virtually a footling part of its duties, operating a few odd services in this country for the railway companies. Why cannot this personnel that to-day operates these services be passed over to the railway companies to be responsible to the railway companies and to the directors of Railway Air Services, who are, with the exception of the Imperial Airways representatives, directors of the railway companies themselves? It seems to me that possibly this has just gone over, with the whole of the assets of Imperial Airways, and possibly my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Air has not had sufficiently brought home to him the fact that we want to stop this corporation trying to do too many things. If it would only make a success of one or two things, particularly the operation of overseas air services and the Transatlantic services, it would have achieved something, but here we are going on the bad old lines of encouraging it to do everything badly instead of a few things well.</p>

<p>Yes, although it does advertise services, and I believe it has some staff of non-flying personnel, but I gather that the machines are owned by Imperial Airways and operated by Imperial Airways staff. My suggestion is that, seeing that there is a company and a board, the railway personnel of that board should carry on the activities of the company, and that it is wholly unnecessary to ask the members of the corporation to waste their time trying to run a few odd air services for the railway companies. I think it is in the national

interest that we should try to straighten out this issue, and although I quite understand that it may be too much for my hon. and gallant Friend the Under-Secretary of State to answer now, I shall be much obliged if he would feel it possible to consider the matter before the further stages of the Bill, in which hope I move this Amendment.</p>

<p>There may perhaps be something to be said on the question of how far the new corporation should be entrusted with the running of internal air services in this country, including the Railway Air Services, but we ought to be very careful before we lay it down that we want our internal air services handed over to the railway companies, because that is what the suggestion of the hon. Member would mean. I do not think that in their handling of the work so far the railway companies have been at all happy. Their handling of the analogous case of the canals was not at all happy. There are conflicting interests and it would seem to be highly desirable to try to isolate the new internal air services from railway control. How that is to be done, whether by encouraging existing or other internal air companies, or having one unified company for internal purposes, I do not say; but I thought it right to sound a note of warning against the idea that the railway companies are the right people to run the internal air services.</p>

<p>I would point out that I did not suggest that we should alter the responsibility for air services. Railway Air Services have been given authority by the licensing authority to run internal air lines, and I am not proposing that that position should be ended. All I am saying is that Railway Air Services should not ask the corporation to fly its air services, but should utilise the authority it has from the licensing authority to operate those services itself. My proposal does not bring up the question which was raised by the hon. Member.</p>

<p>I have been stirred up to intervene only because of some remarks made by the hon. Member for East Wolverhampton (Mr. Mander). He seems to have a permanent bias against railway


companies, and so does the hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Perkins). The hon. Member for Stroud dislikes Imperial Airways, and, as far as I can see, dislikes every form of transport except yachting. It is a very serious proposition to suggest that the railway companies, which have an enormous amount of capital invested in them, should not be allowed to go into the air transport business if they so desire. I should have thought it would have been a very good thing indeed for them to do so. In years to come people in this country will cease to travel long distances by train and go, instead, by air, and I should have thought the railways, with their experience of transport, had every right to take up air transport. The hon. Member for East Wolverhampton keeps piping up about the canals. Well, canals are like the Liberal party, completely antiquated, and further they are not the subject before the Committee at the present time. I would suggest to the hon. Members on the Socialist Benches that they ought to watch this situation very closely. The railways of this country are, on the whole, excellently managed, and it would be very wrong of this House to put any sort of barrier against their going into the air transport business. We should encourage as much as possible every sort of competition inside this country&#x2014;I wish we could do the same with the overseas services&#x2014;and to suggest that we should exclude the railways seems to be the negation of what the hon. Member for East Wolverhampton is always telling us about the rights of democracy.<br/>
There are in this country some 200,000 or 300,000 railway shareholders and about 600,000 employes, and the railways, having, so to speak, a charter to engage in air transport, ought not to be kept out of it by reason of the bias of the hon. Member for East Wolverhampton. Was there ever such a suggestion put before Parliament? Sometimes I feel this anti-railway bias to be like anti-Semitism or anti-Jesuitism. It is a very great danger to this country. It is already doing harm to the transport interests of the country. I say here and now that I consider that our railways are just as well managed as any railway system in the world, and I should feel that it was a great disaster if our railway companies were kept out of this new and enterprising form of transport.</p>

<p>I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for North Paddington (Mr. Bracken) realises the position of Railway Air Services and the railway companies. The position at the moment is that the railway companies own Railway Air Services, which, in its turn, owns the greater number of the so-called independent air operators of this country. There are now only three companies which are not under some form of control by the railway companies. Our quarrel with the railway companies is not that they are not trying to run aviation but that they are not trying to run it wholeheartedly. They are stepping in to get control and are slowly strangling it, just as they did with the canals.</p>

<p>I will not enter into the differences between the hon. Member for East Wolverhampton (Mr. Mander) and the hon. Member for Duddeston (Mr. Simmonds) as to the merits or demerits of railways operating air services, but I should like to put forward this point of view. The hon. Member for Duddeston based his argument on the present position under which Imperial Airways operate Railway Air Services, and suggested that if the corporation were to take over that work it would weaken the ability of the corporation to fulfil its major task. I suggest that none of the arguments put


forward to the Committee have shown why Railway Air Services should not be allowed, with the consent of all interested parties, to avail themselves of the corporation's resources for operating air services. Therefore I would submit that if the <i>status quo</i> were not allowed to continue, and Railway Air Services had to be thrown over by the corporation, there would be no guarantee that the railway companies, who are not themselves experienced in air operations, but are willing to hire that operational experience from the corporation, would continue such services. Then there is also the point that at the present time internal aviation is not paying. Those who are in it to-day are hoping that at some time in the future their present expenditure upon its development will be rewarded, but it might well be that they would not be in a position financially, or willing from the point of view of administration and technical direction, to undertake the lines thrown over by Railway Air Services if the present agreement were cancelled, and that might deal a very severe blow to internal aviation prospects in this country. For that reason I would ask the Committee to resist this Amendment.</p>

<p>I am rising to ask the Committee to delete this Clause, and I would explain that if the Clause were left out we should have in mind the necessity, at a future stage, of an Amendment to bring the question of the manufacture of aircraft under the Provisional Order Procedure. I suggest that that

would be a sufficient safeguard for anyone who imagines that it would be in our minds, or in the minds o&#x00A3; the corporation, immediately to begin the manufacture of aircraft and to set up factories for that purpose. I cannot understand the objections which have been put forward to the proposal to allow the corporation, under the safeguards mentioned to manufacture aircraft. I cannot understand, either, the objection to internal air transport being undertaken by the corporation. Though there are some manifest objections I think those objections could easily be met but I cannot see why it should be suggested that it would be granting them an unfair disadvantage to allow the corporation to manufacture aircraft under present circumst&#x00E1;nces.<br/>
We are, I imagine, still somewhere near the beginning of civil aviation and its development, and I cannot see why, from the standpoint of private enterprise, civil aviation should be regarded as requiring so much protection. After all the corporation is not the State; it is not a case of restricting State enterprise. I do not want to go into any doctrinaire questions. We have already had our say on the subject of whether it is desirable or not that there should be State enterprise in this business and I do not think we on this side came very badly out of the argument. But this corporation is not State enterprise, it is an enterprise of a public utility character, where the interests are those of private enterprise. If there be any danger of burcacracy in a State enterprise&#x2014;I say, "if there be &#x2014;I do not see how such a fear can be entertained in regard to this particular corporation, unless it is asserted that bureaucracy will come to its fruition in respect of the actual work which it is proposed that the new corporation should do. If we feel that the corporation can handle the air transport side of the business effectively I do not see why it should be taken for granted that if they enter upon the manufacture of aircraft all sorts of corruption and inefficiency will arise.</p>

<p>Earlier this afternoon the Secretary of State expressed the hope that this corporation would display initiative and other high, businesslike qualities. I am certain that we all eagerly


reciprocate and re-echo his wish, but it may happen in the process of time that the corporation will be in a position felicitous enough to manufacture aircraft. We are to lay it down specifically that this form of enterprise shall be excluded by Statute, but it is singular, as we have heard to-day, that the corporation are to be allowed to manufacture necessary parts for repairs and replacements; so that manufacture is not excluded, but only the specific manufacture of aircraft.<br/>
Under Clause 26, authority is given to the Secretary of State to make grants towards enabling the corporation to become a partner with other overseas companies in operating overseas air services. Might we not find that the corporation becomes united with other bodies who are able to manufacture aircraft? What will then be the position? The corporation will be barred by Statute from doing so, but it will be a partner with other concerns which are able to manufacture aircraft. Nothing in the Clause states that it is not to have association with overseas air services that are manufacturing aircraft. It seems clear that we may be placing this concern in rather a ridiculous position.<br/>
I have the view, and I shall not be so modest as the previous speaker and apologise for my outlook with regard to State operations, that whenever a national concern can do better for the State or for itself than private concerns can do, it should be permitted to enter into that activity with the full support of this House. Under Clause 7, we are advised, surplus profits from this concern will be transferred to a revenue account, and when this account reaches certain proportions one half is to be paid to the Exchequer. The Exchequer is therefore becoming a participant in the operations of this concern, and it therefore seems to us that it is nothing but a strange form of reaction resulting from a reactionary outlook which says that this national concern&#x2014;as it is&#x2014;is for ever to be debarred from certain forms of activity, and particularly the activity of manufacturing aircraft.<br/>
As the previous speaker said, we are just on the very fringe on the operations of overseas transport. A relatively small proportion of our population use this form of transport, but the concern may grow to mighty proportions. It is a singular and interesting coincidence that it is 30

years almost to the day since Bleriot flew the Channel. In that short period of 30 years we have witnessed colossal changes in air transport. May we not expect at a very early date, considering the rapidity with which we are travelling in this matter, that the concern will be of such proportions that we might have to agree, whatever our political predilections may be, that it should have the power to manufacture aircraft? It will be an error on our part to debar the concern from this form of activity.</p>

<p>I confess that on seeing this Clause one liked its extreme brevity and directness. Although one does not want this to be an entirely Socialistic matter, I would point out that the corporation is not a Socialist body. I cannot see why we should lay down in an earlier Clause that the corporation may make parts of an aircraft and yet say that it is never to be allowed to manufacture a complete aircraft. When we come to the Schedule we find that no member of the corporation is to be capable of being elected to the House of Commons. I hope that the corporation is not to consist of clergymen, lunatics and prisoners in gaol. I cannot believe that such people have any interest or understanding of, or know anything about, aircraft at all. I cannot imagine that the corporation, as it is constituted by the Bill, would ever set about manufacturing aircraft, and I do not quite see why we should lay down the principle so definitely, especially as we have agreed that the corporation may manufacture parts of an aircraft.</p>

<p>The chief objection to allowing the corporation to manufacture aircraft is that it is a body subsidised with State money and would be placed in a position of very great advantage in competing with private firms.

<p>Many Members of the House would regard the reason which has just been given as an argument for permitting rather than for not permitting the corporation to build aircraft. The Bill contemplates that during a certain period the subsidy will be required for the maintenance of the service which is provided for, and hon. Members must not be surprised if suspicion develops in certain quarters about the influence which has been at work in order to get this restriction imposed. There is an air of familiarity about the condition. I would recall the imposition of a similar condition upon the London Passenger Transport Board. Anybody who is aware of the inside history of that board, which is now operating with an efficiency and a measure of satisfaction which are a standing tribute to its application to the public interests, will know that it is hampered and hindered because in the Bill which brought them into being a similar condition was imposed upon the board in regard to the manufacture of its necessary spares and equipment.</p>

<p>This commendation of the London Passenger Transport Board is very interesting. I hope the hon. Member will recommend it to his right hon.

<p>I think I may leave my right hon. Friend to continue the discussion on that matter under more appropriate conditions. If for some time ahead public funds will be required in order to subsidise and thus make possible the continuance of these services, the corporation ought not to be prevented from entering into one aspect of the undertaking which will, at any rate, provide a measure of profit and possibly of revenue. This is a Bill for the development of external air services, which are not being run with any substantial measure of profit, but one section of the aircraft industry which is making a substantial profit is the production side. The corporation ought to have a full right to enter into production services.</p>

<p>I would first say in reply to the hon. Member for West Isling-

ton (Mr. Montague) that my position in this matter is not doctrinaire, but it will, I hope, find support on all sides of the Committee. It is: Do we or do we not wish the corporation to fulfil its main function with maximum efficiency? I think we are all of one mind in giving an affirmative answer to that question. Then I come to this proposition: Can a body successfully fulfil two functions, the first one of operation and the second of manufacturing for its particular type of operation? I submit that our commercial history shows that what I might call the tied-house form of industry, consisting of a vertical pyramid in which the producer of the raw material is linked to the controller of each process and then to the retailer, has shown many industrial failures. If at some time it is desired to manufacture aircraft by means of State enterprise&#x2014;I am not arguing whether that may be required in the future or not &#x2014;the very worst people to be allowed to manufacture aircraft would be the corporation.<br/>
Civil aircraft in the next few years will have to find a wide market throughout the world, and the corporation would have only a narrow view of its own particular requirements. Design and production for the corporation will be carried out by firms who are engaged in the manufacture of civil aircraft, but only after the designs have been recommended to the Secretary of State as desirable, first for the corporation and secondly for the overseas world markets which we wish to capture for British civil aviation in the future. The recommending body will be the new Civil Aviation Development Committee. It would be restrictive to the prospects of British civil aviation if the corporation were allowed to use the limited resources which are available in this country for the development of civil aviation, in the manufacture of types for its narrow specification. Rather should we learn the lesson of past years. We can see how Imperial Airways was developed. The building of their own particular types of aircraft may have rendered great service to that company but not a single member of those types has ever been sold in the world's markets.<br/>
I think it is far better that we should allow the operational requirements to be met in competition by the aircraft industry of this country. There is one further point. We are going at some time


in the future&#x2014;and I think it is the common wish of the Committee that it should be sooner rather than later&#x2014;to have a cut in the production of armaments and a surplus productive capacity in this country. Here I see some opportunity for the men who are at present engaged in our aircraft industry, as well as the technical section of the industry, to find a new outlet when the production of arms ceases. If this Amendment were agreed to, and the corporation were allowed to manufacture aircraft, that prospect would be further restricted. For these reasons I would ask the Committee to resist the proposal.</p>

<p>I am grateful to you, Colonel Clifton Brown, for that suggestion, as the same principle is embodied in both Amendments. I venture to think that this proposal is one which is worthy of the careful attention of the Committee. As the Clause stands, when the right hon. Gentleman and the State have succeeded in building up this corporation into a position of great prosperity, so that it no longer needs any further State assistance, it is then to be entitled to turn to the State and say, "Thank you for your kind help; we now wish to have nothing more to do with you." In the first four lines of the Clause the corporation is given the power to derogate from the powers of the right hon. Gentleman as soon as it no longer needs his financial help. The question we want to ask is, what is the reason for the right hon. Gentleman taking powers to influence the policy of the corporation? Surely, it is not exclusively in order to build up the corporation into a strong financial position. The State is giving this corporation vast financial aid, the State is interfering and supervising the operations of this corporation, not because it wants to put it in a strong financial position, but because it wants to build up a powerful instrument of civil aviation for the sake of the trade and prestige and of the transport facilities of the British Empire throughout the world. What possible justification can there be if, before any of these aims are accomplished, but only because the corporation no longer needs the financial assistance of the State, it is entitled to divest itself of any restrictions which the Secretary of State may seek to impose upon it? Looking at the precise words of the Clause, we find that it says:
<q> So long as the power of the Secretary of State to make any grant to the corporation

under this Act is, or may become, exercisable, or any guarantee given by the Treasury under this Act is in force.</q>
the corporation shall not carry out certain activities without the consent of the right hon. Gentleman. But once those conditions no longer apply, they may do so. The Bill says that the power "is, or may become, exercisable." I do not know what "may become exercisable" means. Perhaps the right hon. Gentleman will be good enough to explain whether it is of any importance. After 14 years all powers granted under the Act to the corporation must cease, provided that no guarantee by the State is then in force. We shall find ourselves then in the position that the State may have paid up to &#x00A3;56,000,000 in order to build up the financial strength of this concern, and the Secretary of State will have no power over it. If there is any guarantee still in force, that will be a reason for maintaining the authority of the Secretary of State.<br/>
How can the guarantee come to an end? As I understand, only in one of three ways&#x2014;the money borrowed from the public may have been repaid, or there may have been some reconstruction, under which the money may have been obtained without the guarantee, or the State may have been called upon to fulfil the guarantee owing to default on the part of the corporation. In such a case, that guarantee would not be enforced, under the Bill as it is now worded. Nobody could then say what was the intention of Parliament at the time when the Act was passed. Any judge would merely have to look at the Statute, and he would say that if the guarantee had been implemented and the State had had to refund capital and interest to a defaulting corporation, the guarantee would not be in force.<br/>
I know that the right hon. Gentleman thinks that this is a somewhat fantastic conception, or, at any rate, that this state of things is unlikely to arise, but those of us who have been watching the financial operations of Imperial Airways and the extraordinary attitude that the Government have adopted towards them will not be surprised at any proposals that the Secretary of State brings forward in relation to this concern. It is surely wrong that the State, after it has built up this corporation by means of vast sums of money, should give up all influence in these operations when the corporation has


reached that desirable financial position. We are not giving this money in order to put the corporation on a secure financial basis, but we are giving it, and passing this Bill, in order that the State shall have a proper voice)n the operations of the corporation.</p>

<p>I would remind the hon. Gentleman, in the first place, that we are dealing with the year 1953, and that a good deal may have happened by then. I cannot visualise how a judge would interpret the Clause dealing with the corporation's guarantee or the action of the Secretary of State in relation to it, but it will be perfectly obvious that if the state of affairs to which the hon. Gentleman referred did arise, Parliament would have to intervene. The simple explanation of the Clause is that the State is making considerable financial contributions every year to this corporation, and when those contributions cease there is no need for the exercise of supervision by the State over the corporation. Quite frankly I would much prefer to see this corporation proceed under ordinary commercial management, if that were possible, to-day. It is simply because the competition of other nations is such that we have been obliged to take steps, which I believe will yet turn out to be successful, that we have this new corporation and this new scheme.<br/>
I am holding out no hopes that in 1953 this new corporation will be able to continue unassisted&#x2014;I hope that it will &#x2014; but if it is able to go forward unassisted, I see no reason for direct supervision of the kind mentioned in the Bill. Whether the hon. Gentleman and I will be here to see it I do not know, but I assume that before 1953 any Government in office will have to review the position of this corporation. This is an indication, so far as the Government are concerned, that if the position does arrive when Government assistance is no longer needed, there will be no need for the very considerable supervision which in the meantime is to be exercised by the Secretary of State. I suggest that, from a practical point of view, the whole matter will have to be considered by Parliament either in 1953 or before.</p>

<p>It seems to me that this Clause ties the corporation very tightly to

the apron-strings of the Secretary for Air, because the corporation may not do anything that he does not wish them to do and must do all that he wishes them to do. Although I realise that the apron-strings of my right hon. Friend are made of elastic, some of his successors may have apron-strings that are made of iron. When we put the members of the corporation&#x2014;who may be distinguished gentlemen and not merely ex-governors&#x2014;under such supervision, I wonder whether the effect will not be that we shall find ourselves unable to get the type of members that we wish to get. I hope my right hon. Friend will do his best to give them as much freedom as possible. Surely the hon. Member who moved the Amendment will agree that it is sufficient that these members are to be appointed by the Secretary of State, so that if they go contrary to his wishes he can dismiss them. He may exercise a great deal of authority over them quietly, which we may know nothing about. I should like to see them have a little liberty, and then, if they kick over the traces, we should hear about it and be able to discuss the matter in this House.</p>

<p>When I first came into the House there was a great deal of discussion about the sugar-beet subsidy. I remember hearing the late Lord Snowden denouncing the subsidy with all his might and hearing several of my hon. Friends on the Socialist Front Bench saying that such subsidies should be brought to an end as soon as possible because they were a wicked ramp, and if a business could not carry on "on its own," it should be shut down. I think that my right hon. Friend has been, in his usual mellow way, a little too genial in answering the arguments which were put forward by the hon. Gentleman who moved the Amendment. He has told us that 14 years hence the taxpayer will still be shovelling out large sums, and that any Minister then may be in the same sort of predicament as he is in now. I take the view that in 14 years' time the public will have got very tired of that sort of thing. It is to me a matter of the greatest regret that the one party which has been completely against subsidies&#x2014;</p>

<p>This party has never expressed any hostility to the granting of subsidies, provided that those subsidies go


to building up State services. What we object to are those subsidies which go to building up dividends for private individuals.</p>

<p>That interruption is, if I may say so, rather irrelevant. If the programme of the Socialist party is described accurately by the hon. Gentleman, why is it that when the Socialist party had been bitterly opposing subsidies, particularly the sugar-beet subsidy, they kept those subsidies on when they came into office. [<i>Interruption.</i>] The hon. Gentleman has not the courage of his interruption. I think that the Secretary of State for Air has really not considered this matter. Does he suggest that in 14 years' time it will be necessary to pay large subventions to this new air corporation? If so, that is a most appalling outlook from the point of view of the taxpayers of the country. I take the view that the best possible thing that could happen to the corporation would be that it should make a decent enough profit</p>

<p>to get rid of the Secretary of State, but now to my great dissatisfaction I find that the right hon. Gentleman is envisaging being in charge of this corporation or his successor or his second successor, in 14 years' time. The hon. Member for East Aberdeen (Mr. Boothby), who is a great authority on finance and a man of an optimistic nature, would think it a most charitable thing if, 14 years hence, we were paying this money out to the corporation. I hope that hon. Members are going to take notice of it. We ought to be obliged to the hon. Gentleman the Member for North Aberdeen (Mr. Garro Jones) for raising this issue, which has produced from the Secretary of State the most bleak and pessimistic view of his functions I have ever heard in this House.</p>

I should like to ask a question of my right hon. Friend. From paragraph (<i>a</i>) it would appear that before the Secretary of State can make grants to any company other than the corporation that company must satisfy two points, (1) the company must be in receipt of a subsidy payable by the Government of some other country than the United Kingdom and (2) the corporation must own shares or stock in that company. I cannot see that the holding of a few shares or some stock in a company is going to be any great asset to the corporation or any great safeguard to the Secretary of State. Can my right hon.

<p>I beg to move, in page 21, line 9, to leave out from "aircraft" to "the" in line 10.<br/>
The object of this Amendment is to find out what is going to be the position of foreign aircraft landing at an airport which is owned and controlled by the corporation. At the moment there is an international agreement subscribed to by the various aero clubs which allows a member of one aero club to land at the aerodrome of another aero club in a foreign country free of landing fee, provided it leaves the aerodrome within 48 hours. That is of the greatest help to British aeroplanes, but, unfortunately, it works rather unfairly against foreign aeroplanes. When they come to this country they are able to have free landing and free housing for 48 hours, just as we are, but when they land in Palestine or any other aerodrome on the main air routes where the aerodromes are owned and controlled by Imperial Airways they have to pay heavy landing fees. This causes a sense of injustice. If the Clause goes through un-amended it will be impossible to put it right, and this excellent scheme, which is doing much good for flying in Europe and the world, is bound to break down.</p>

<p>I should like to reinforce what my hon. Friend has said. We have a great many difficulties to contend with in the Royal Aero Club

on this matter. The President of the Federation Aeronautique Internationale when he flies from France can land at Tunis and Algeria without having to pay landing fees, owing to the arrangement that is in force, but when he goes to any British Colony or Dominion he, is charged a very substantial fee at every aerodrome where he lands. That does not create a very good impression among foreigners as to the facilities which the British Empire gives them in the way of civil aviation. I had occasion some years ago to fly from Africa and was forced to land at Gaza in flying from Egypt to Palestine, not because I wanted to do so but because I had to clear Customs. I had a small machine and I was charged &#x00A3;1 landing fee by Imperial Airways. When I objected, they said that it was a fee charged to keep wild beasts off the aerodrome. On this occasion I was able to obtain a refund of my money, which is rather an unusual thing to be able to accomplish in regard to a great corporation. I found that Imperial Airways, without my permission, had been using my own landing ground for a very large machine, and as I had a fox covert near the end of the ground I pointed out that I also had to keep wild animals off the aerodrome. This is a matter of great importance, and I hope the Secretary of State will bear it in mind and see whether anything can be done to deal with it.</p>

<p>I think my hon. Friend who moved the Amendment will appreciate that I cannot accept it because it would make it obligatory to the corporation to afford accommodation free of charge to any aircraft at any aerodrome controlled by them. I do not think anyone would suggest that they ought to do that. However, I appreciate what my hon. Friends have said and I will see whether I have power, as the Bill is now drafted, to direct the corporation to make their facilities available to others at reasonable charges. If I have not that power, then either here or in another place I shall propose that an Amendment be inserted with that object in view. I shall first ascertain whether I have that power, and if not I shall adopt the proposal that I have just made. I think the suggestion of my hon. Friend is a reasonable one and most hon.

<p>I beg to move, in page 23, line 8, to leave out from "allowance," to the end of line 9.<br/>
The object of this Amendment is to ascertain precisely what will be the position after the passing of this Bill of those persons to whom compassionate allowances have been made by one or other of the two companies. I understand from the evidence before the Select Committee that there are only six such cases, and I want to make sure that it will not be possible&#x2014;I admit it is extremely unlikely&#x2014;to stop any of these allowances before they terminate in the ordinary way. It would seem from the wording of the Clause, "on the same conditions as previously obtaining," that it was a purely voluntary act and that the corporation might have power to stop them. If the Secretary of State is able to give an assurance that the legal position is watertight, and that there is no option on the part of the directors to interfere with these grants, I shall be satisfied, and will withdraw the Amendment.</p>

number of these cases, and naturally every hon. Member will desire to see that everything is right so far as they are concerned. We have examined the matter since it was discussed in the Select Committee, and I am advised that the Clause is intended to provide that it shall be a matter of legal right under the same conditions as before. There was some discussion whether the words "as before" threw us back on the voluntary allowance, and I understand that is so. But between now and when the Bill is in another place I will have the matter investigated again, and if there is any doubt I will suggest an Amendment.</p>

This Amendment and the next two Amendments have been put down to meet the point made by the Select Committee in regard to superannuation. The Select Committee went carefully into this question and expressed the desire that, if possible, the matter should be made more definite, and it should not be left to the corporation of its own volition to set up a fund. I do not think there is any doubt that in fact they would do it, but the point was raised that they might not. Therefore, I have put down these Amendments to meet the point, and as amended the Clause will enable the Secretary of State to direct the corporation to set up a fund or scheme. I can also give this assurance, that if a scheme or fund were not set up I should direct proper superannuation arrangements to be made under the powers I am now taking, and I should certainly use my discretion in the way I have indicated. I think with these Amendments, coupled with the assurance I have given, the rights in regard to superannuation are fully safeguarded.</p>

<p>It is an exhilarating experience to be able to support suggestions made by the right hon. Gentleman. He will appreciate that the


recommendations which came from the Select Committee were unanimous, and that the Committee felt that the position in regard to superannuation provisions was not entirely satisfactory. There was no evidence that members of the fund, or even the trustees of the fund, had been consulted. If, as I now gather, the Secretary of State intends to exercise his powers and to ensure that a satisfactory and comprehensive superannuation fund is established, and that the staffs are to be consulted and their wishes ascertained, the Committee will regard that with satisfaction.</p>

This is in order to meet a point made by the Select Committee when they examined the Bill. They expressed the opinion that the question of representation should be further considered with a view of embodying a more specific provision in the Bill. This is a provision which I fully approve, and I would remind the Committee that, so far as the staff are concerned, it is my wish and desire, which I have no doubt the corporation will fully respect, that there should be proper and adequate machinery for consultation on all matters connected with their employment. This new Clause and the undertaking I have already given will ensure that the rights of the staff of the corporation will be fully protected so far as discussions are concerned, and that there will be suitable machinery by which conditions of employment can be discussed between the staff and the corporation. We remember what took place a short time ago, and we are looking forward, as a result of these provisions, to very satisfactory arrangements being made and a good atmosphere being obtained so far as the corporation and their employ&#x00E9;s are concerned.</p>

<p>Members of the Select Committee and this Committee generally will regard the statement of the Secretary of State as satisfactory. The feeling of

the Select Committee was that in this matter, as in the matter of superannuation, the situation was not at all happy, and it was desired that arrangements should be made under which representatives of organisations who spoke on behalf of the staff should be fully and freely recognised. We understand that the new Clause intends that there shall be full and complete recognition of the trade unions and other organisations acting for the various sections of the staff, but I should like the Secretary of State to say whether not only those who are in receipt of wages, but also those who are members of the salaried staff are included in these proposals? Does it apply to all sections of the staff, clerical and administrative, as well as operatives and constructive grades who are paid by a weekly wage? If that is the case I think we may say that the arrangements are generally satisfactory.</p>

<p>May I add my voice to the general satisfaction that has been expressed at the fact that the Secretary of State has seen his way to include this new Clause in the Bill and also to give the undertaking he did on a former Amendment? I think it is extremely satisfactory. This new Clause ranges over a wide field. I am, personally, interested in the pilots' point of view, because I am a member of the Air Line Pilots' Association. After all, a professional pilot is even now a comparatively new profession, and the conditions under which he is employed necessitate. I think, that pilots as a body should be recognised and that their representatives should be recognised. That, I think, is of the greatest importance. The Secretary of State has referred to somewhat unhappy recollections, but the position is now better, and in Sir John Reith and Mr. Runciman we have two gentlemen in whom the pilots have complete confidence. Although the present position is satisfactory, I think it is right that the pilots should have sufficient safeguards. That is what we want, and on behalf of the pilots I want to thank the Secretary of State for Air for having proposed this new Clause and given the undertaking to which he has referred.</p>

<p>It seems to me that this new Clause meets to the full in the letter


and in the spirit the recommendations made unanimously by the Select Committee, and if it is carried out on those lines it will be satisfactory. We are setting a very valuable precedent for future Measures of this kind. I do think something of this kind is required, because I was not impressed by the way in which Imperial Airways and British Airways dealt with their employ&#x00E9;s. No consultations took place with the staff, nor was any information given them as to what their position might be in the future. No doubt it was felt that their position would be strengthened, and that there was no need to do so, but at the same time people like to be consulted. This new Clause will make it certain that such consultations will take place, and I should like to thank the Secretary of State for having proposed it.</p>

<p>I am sure that we on this side of the Committee are pleased to see in any legislation provision for the recognition of trade unions or other associations. Many of us wish it had been introduced into our legislation in the past. I am concernedonly with one phrase in the new Clause, and that is "a substantial proportion." I am wondering what interpretation will be given to that phrase. I visualise a provision where, perhaps, 80 per cent, of the employ&#x00E9;s of the new corporation are members of a trade union, but in which only a small minority of one section of the employ&#x00E9;s, the clerical workers, are inside that organisation. Will it be possible to deny to these men the right of representation through their own organisation because a substantial proportion of the clerical staff are members of a trade union? I think it would have been better if this phrase had been left out and that there had been a free right to any organisation which represents a body of people employed by the corporation to be received and their representations heard. Unless the new Clause is interpreted in the spirit in which we desire it should be interpreted, there is a danger that one small section of the employ&#x00E9;s may find themselves denied a right

which should be given to them, that is, the right of representation and the hearing of their case</p>

<p>I beg to move, "That the Clause be read a Second time."<br/>
There have been a small number of cases of old pilots in which questions have arisen as regards their insurance and benefits. There have been a few really hard cases, and I know that the Undersecretary is aware of one or two. I am glad to say that the situation is now very much better, but as there are still one or two hard cases I am moving the new Clause in order to prevent any recurrence.</p>

<p>This Amendment raises a principle of some importance. We are now establishing another public corporation under an Act of Parliament, and we may be quite sure of one thing, and that is that this is not the last public corporation which will be established in this country. We are obviously at the beginning of a period when more and more of these semi-public corporations will be established, and I think that the position of hon. Members of this House will have to be clarified one way or another, sooner or later. The paragraph which I am proposing to delete has been put in, I believe, simply in order to conform to a principle laid down some time ago in respect to a Member of Parliament appointed to a Parliamentary office of profit under the Crown. I submit that that is a very doubtful interpretation, and I think the Committee will have to face the issue. We have to recognise that railway companies, shipping companies, big banks, the co-operative society, the coal industry, the trade unions and the iron and steel industry have their representatives in this House, not in the absolutely strict sense, but in the sense that there are Members who can claim to speak on behalf of these great industries, and if we are to exclude Members of Parliament from serving on the boards of these public corporations it seems to me that we are taking a grave step indeed which may not be conducive to the public interest. I say that if there had been a Member of Parliament, or even two Members of Parliament, on the board of the old Imperial Airways Company the trouble which arose a year or more ago would never have arisen, because hon. Members on all sides could have established direct contact immediately and found out the true facts of the situation. What struck me as being most significant about the whole row was the total lack of touch between the Board of Imperial Airways and hon. Members on both sides. This provision deliberately makes certain that there shall be no direct contact of any kind between the corporation and hon. Members. I think that is a very bad precedent to create.<br/>
With regard to the Amendment in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud (Mr. Perkins), if we are to exclude Members of Parliament, let us also exclude Members of another place. I am sure my right hon. Friend will agree with me that if we are to establish the

principle that in these public and semi-public corporations no members of the board shall be Members of Parliament, that ought to apply to Members of both Houses of Parliament. I ask my. right hon. Friend why he has thought fit to introduce this paragraph, which I do not believe is a desirable precedent, and which I do not believe, in the long run, will conduce to the general public interests.</p>

<p>As this Amendment and the Amendment on the Paper in my name are benig discussed together, I would point out that I put down my Amendment for the purpose of finding out, if possible, why Members of Parliament should be excluded while Members of another place are included. It seems to me that either all should be in or all should be out, and deliberately to distinguish between the sheep and the goats seems to me to be rather a slight on the House of Commons, and to suggest that hon. Members are in some way inferior to Members of another place.</p>

<p>I appreciate the observations made by my hon. Friend the Member for East Aberdeen (Mr. Boothby), although I must confess that I do not think the illustration he gave with regard to the position of the staff of Imperial Airways and the controversy that arose was a very good one. I do not wish to pass judgment on that case, but I should say that the real trouble was that the people responsible for the management were not in touch with the staff as they might have been. However, simply because things do not go right with the staff in a company of that kind, I do not see that it is the duty of Members of Parliament to get in touch with the staff, or with those who sit on the board, in order to be able to put matters right between the House and the company. I always regretted that matter, and when I became Secretary of State I regarded it as one that should be settled by the company itself and not as a matter for discussion in the House. I do not accept the argument that because of that unfortunate case, Members of Parliament ought to be directors of this corporation.<br/>
I submit that, on balance, it is a wise decision that Members of the House should


not be on the boards of corporations of this nature. There are, of course, numerous precedents for this particular provision. There are the precedents of the London Passenger Transport Act, the Sugar Industry (Re-organisation) Act, the Electricity Supply Act, the Coal Mines Act, the Livestock Industry Act, the Sea Fish Industry Act; and my right hon. Friend the President of the Board of Trade has just told me that in the Cotton Industry (Re-organisation) Bill a similar Clause has been passed by the House without opposition. I think there is good reason for such a provision. Although I have often thought that Members of Parliament would be very valuable members of corporations and boards of this character, I think that, on the whole, it is desirable that Parliament should lay down that the same individual should not be at the same time a member of the body which controls the granting of public funds, either itself or through the Secretary of State, for the purposes of the corporation, and also a nominee of the Secretary of State on that particular corporation. That, in fact, is what would happen if this provision were deleted. I should then be free to appoint a Member of the House or two Members, that is to say from the very people who, in fact, are in a large measure controlling, either themselves or through me, the finances of the corporation. I doubt very much whether it would be wise for hon. Members to find themselves in such a position. It might very well be argued that membership of a corporation of this character, which is a very extensive one as far as the State is concerned, might be an office of profit within the meaning of the Section.</p>

<p>I would not like to argue on a case that is not before me, but with regard to this corporation, which is to have very considerable State assistance, there are very large financial commitments by the State through money voted by Members of the House. I am sure that, on reflection, my hon. Friend the Member for East Aberdeen will see that there is great force in the argument that, in such a case, Members of Parliament should not be entitled to be members of

the corporation. With regard to the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud (Mr. Perkins), I would remind the Committee that this distinction has been made in every case. Members of another place are not, of course, concerned with finance. That is a very considerable difference between their position and the position of hon. Members of this House. A peer who is actively engaged in politics may be made a governor of a Colony whereas a Member of Parliament who is made a governor of a Colony has to resign his seat. The position is the same with regard to Ambassadors to foreign Powers. That distinction has constantly been drawn, and I would draw the distinction particularly in the case of this corporation, because of the direct relationship between the House and the corporation, which does not exist with regard to another place. I should be content to rely upon that reason alone for having this distinction. Therefore, I suggest to hon. Members that it is a wise rule that Members of Parliament should not be members of the corporation, and I suggest that the same reasons do not apply to Members of another place.</p>

<p>I apologise both to you, Mr. Deputy-Chairman, and to another place. With regard to the Amendment of the hon. Member for East Aberdeen (Mr. Boothby), I think it is extremely undesirable that Members of the House should be members of the corporation. The hon. Member's example with regard to the last trouble with Imperial Airways was a very bad one. It is absurd to suggest that if Members of the House had been on the Board of Imperial Airways, that trouble would not have arisen. Hon.


Members who have had experience of what has happened in the House during the past few days must know that if certain Members had been on the board of Imperial Airways, the position would have been a hundred times worse, because they would hardly have been the people most likely to look after the rights of the staff with regard to superannuation, pensions, and other benefits to which the staff felt they were entitled. I cannot conceive that certain Members of the House would have improved the relationship between Imperial Airways and its staff.<br/>
It is desirable that Members of the House should have no direct interest in a corporation of this character. We should be as detached as possible in order that, in considering the affairs of the corporation, we may be able to take a detached view. It would be undesirable that any Member of the House should be a member of the London Passenger Transport Board, and I do not think that if Members of the House were members of the board, it would help either the board or the House in deciding various points which might arise. The best method of ensuring that there shall be the most amicable. relations between the staff and the corporation is to give the staff the fullest rights of association in trade union organisations. Had those rights been accorded to the staff of Imperial Airways 18 months ago, we should not have had that trouble. Therefore, I oppose the Amendment of the hon. Member for East Aberdeen, but I should be pleased to support the Amendment in the name of the hon. Member for Stroud.</p>

<p>Having listened to the arguments that have been made, I find myself in agreement with the Secretary of State. I should like to give an additional reason to those which the right hon. Gentleman gave. I think it would create a bad impression outside if we were continually creating new corporations and putting ourselves on the boards of them. For that reason, and for the reasons given by the right hon. Gentleman, I think it is desirable that we should remain in a detached position. With regard to the point that has been made about the difference in the treatment of Peers and Members of the House, I think the reasons for treating Members

of another place differently are overwhelming. For centuries, by custom, and since the passage of the Parliament Act, 1911, by statute, the Peers have had nothing to do with the finances of the country, which are wholly in the control of the representatives of the people. For purposes of finance, the Peers might as well not exist. For those reasons, I think they are eligible to serve upon a board that deals with Government finance. We cannot have it both ways. I support the Secretary of State.</p>

<p>The Secretary of State cited certain precedents where Members of Parliament have allowed members of another place to be members of boards of this sort. I am sure the Secretary of State will remember that on each occasion protests were made in the House on the same grounds as they are being made now. The right hon. Gentleman cited these precedents as though the House had assented to the same principle without discussion, whereas on most occasions there was opposition on the same grounds. I am surprised that so keen an observer as the hon. Member for East Wolverhampton (Mr. Mander) should have been so carried away as to think that, owing to the Parliament Act, the Lords have nothing to do with finance. May I remind the Secretary of State that he and his worthy Under-Secretary have for years carried on a strong agitation in favour of removing the disabilities under which the other House labours as a result of the Parliament Act? Suppose that the right hon. Gentleman's group is successful in that agitation. What will happen then? Will this Amendment of the hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Perkins) be reconsidered in those circumstances? I wish the Secretary of State would give his reply openly and not <i>sotto voce.</i><br/>
While it is true that a Member of the House of Lords would have no control over the financial provisions embodied in the Bill he could, none the less, use undue influence as a member of that House which is in close contiguity with this House. He has an entrance to this House which the ordinary member of the public has not. I see no difference in ability between Members of this House and members of another place which would mark out the latter as specially fitted for membership of boards of this type. In previous Debates on this subject, it has been


argued that members of another place, being gentlemen of leisure, had more time to devote to these matters and that a great deal of ability was going to waste while their services were not utilised. It was suggested that they might as well use their time in this way as in any other way. I do not think that is an argument which carries any weight. If we are going to bar Members of the House of Commons, let us bar Members of both Houses. I do not know whether it is worth going into the Division Lobby on this question but if the Amendment of the hon. Member for Stroud is taken to a Division I shall certainly support it.</p>

<p>It is very easy to maintain a detached position in a matter of this kind if we are kept in complete ignorance of the facts of the situation. If it be the wish of the Committee to deprive Members of this House of all direct access to information about these companies, while at the same time plastering these boards with peers, then, for my part, they are welcome to do so. But I think that in doing so they will be making a profound mistake, and one which will be regretted later. This is a policy which will, in the long run, be reversed and in my view the sooner the better. Obviously, however, it is the wish of the Committee to see as many Noble Lords as possible on these boards, and no Members of the House of Commons.

<q> In the event of any such person being within a period of two years discharged from the corporation's employment for reasons other than disciplinary he shall be paid a sum in compensation of not less than three month's remuneration.</q>
perhaps, Colonel Clifton Brown, I may raise the point now. This is a matter on which the Secretary of State has found himself unable to meet the recommendations of the Select Committee, which expressed the opinion that the question of fair compensation for any employ&#x00E9;s who might be displaced on account of the amalgamation of the two concerns, should be considered with a view to the embodiment of more specific provisions in the Bill. I understand that all employ&#x00E9;s of both companies are to be taken on by the new corporation but there is nothing to prevent the new corporation immediately giving them a week's or a month's notice so that the security given by this undertaking is not as valuable as it appears to be. It may be said that the new corporation will be stronger and more powerful and that the position of the employ&#x00E9;s will be more secure. At the same time it is well known that in the case of all amalgamations, the employ&#x00E9;s who are in ignorance of what is going on, are always very much afraid of how their prospects will be affected.


It is important in this case to give the employ&#x00E9;s all the assurance we can give. It may be that no one will be discharged but I would ask the right hon. Gentleman on behalf of the Government to make some statement with regard to the matter. In spite of the best intentions on the part of the corporation, it is possible that, within a year or two, a certain number of the staff would have to be discharged as a result of the amalgamation. I suggest that it would be in accordance with the best industrial and commercial practice to give, not the ordinary week's or a month's notice in such a case, but something of an ampler nature. I suggest three months, and I hope the Secretary of State will be able to indicate that the cases of any men who find themselves in the position I have indicated will be carefully considered. We do not know who the new directors will be. They may be drawn entirely from the Whips' Office. They may be members of the Government who will be put there in order to facilitate some reconstruction of the Government. We have had no information and it is impossible to expect the employ&#x00E9;s to feel that confidence which they have in the present directors whom they know. I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will be able to give to the employ&#x00E9;s of these companies, the assurance which, I think, should properly be given to them.</p>

<p>I wish to support the view indicated by the hon.

To say that there are insuperable difficulties in the way of such provision is to exaggerate. The right hon.

Such arrangements are to be found in Acts dealing with railways, electricity undertakings and local government amalgamations. While the positions are not strictly comparable the principle is the same, that where, in the public interest, there is a merging of concerns injury must not follow to those employed in such concerns, and if they can show that their displacement is due to circum-

stances associated with the amalgamation, they should be entitled to compensation.</p>

<p>Hon. Members will, I think, agree that I have endeavoured as far as possible to meet the views of the Select Committee and I would have been glad to have gone all the way in accepting their recommendations if it had been possible. But I do not think it is possible, or indeed reasonable to take the view which the hon. Members opposite have expressed in regard to employ&#x00E9;s in this case. I think a distinction must be drawn between private employ&#x00E9;s who have their own contract of service and the employ&#x00E9;s of utility companies, who are in a special category, with reasonable expectations of security of employment.</p>

<p>In this case I would point out there are the most definite conditions. I refer hon. Members to this condition in the contract as set out in the Schedule:
<q> The corporation shall as regards all persons employed by the vendor company offer to take them into the corporation's employment as from the appointed day upon terms not less favourable than those upon which they were employed immediately before the appointed day.</q>

<p>I suppose that an individual employ&#x00E9; would be in the same position as he is in now as regards notice.

Members opposite that they need not be apprehensive. In view of the additional financial provision which this House is making, the operations of the company will be extended, and I suggest that the position of the employ&#x00E9;s is amply safeguarded.</p>

<p>It seems to me that the right hon. Gentleman's argument is unconvincing. It is no good saying that the


corporation will be a wonderful new body and will be greatly strengthened and that all sorts of prospects will be offered to the employ&#x00E9;s. If employ&#x00E9;s are dismissed because of the amalgamation and for no other reason, the wonderful prospects of the new corporation will not be of any benefit or satisfaction to them. The right hon. Gentleman is not, I suggest, acting as the best employers in private industry would act. Where amalgamations take place in circumstances such as we are discussing, and men are discharged, it is usual to give those men more than the consideration to which they are legally entitled. Perhaps the right hon. Gentleman will consider the matter again before the Report stage, since, I am sure, he would like to act in this matter, on behalf of the Government, as a model employer.</p>

I have put down, for the convenience of the House, the changes which will have to be made in order to carry out in proper Parliamentary form the view which, I think, was generally favoured in Committee extending the possible beneficiaries under this scheme to orphan children. Although the actual words inserted in Committee were rather wider, I think it was generally appreciated that it would be best, if we were going to extend the scheme to children at all, to limit it to orphan children. This and the two following Amendments produce that result. There is one further point. There should be some limit on the age of children. It seems to me that probably the House would think the right limit to adopt is that adopted for a great many purposes&#x2014;the age of 16. That proposal will be found a little lower on the Order Paper.</p>

<q> Provided that no such deduction shall be made from the salary of any Member of the House of Commons who is in receipt of a pension paid from public funds of an amount large enough to disqualify him from the receipt of benefit from the House of Commons Members Fund.</q>

This Amendment is for the purpose of providing that no Member of this House who is already in possession of a pension large enough to prevent him from receiving any benefit under this Fund shall pay any contribution. There are a large number of Members in receipt of pensions from public funds, for instance Army, Navy and Air Force, and they now find themselves in the position that, whatever might happen, if they lose every penny they possess in the world, the fact that they possess a pension would disqualify them from receiving any benefit. Consequently they are now expected, unless this Amendment is carried, to pay an annual contribution of &#x00A3;12 towards a fund from which they could never in any circumstances receive any benefit at all. The pensions which such Members receive are in the nature of deferred pay. Many of us spend long years in the service of our country for what is certainly not very generous remuneration, and that remuneration is rather less generous than it would be were it not for the fact that at the end of the service we receive a pension. We have seen Members of the Opposition for the first time accept the principle of a means test in this Bill, and this Amendment is also designed to help them to avoid the accusation of receiving charity, and from their speeches in the past we have always understood that they consider it a very undesirable thing that anyone should receive charity. It seems to me that for any Member to receive a pension from this Fund from contributions made by Members who could not possibly derive benefit themselves is nothing more or less than charity.</p>

<p>It is not, of course, on so large a scale as the pension. The point that I want to make is that so long as the organisation of the State goes on, presumably there will be a Parliamentary salary paid, and there will also be pensions paid to those who have the right to enjoy them because of the service they have previously rendered to the State. Therefore, the submission is a true one that the Fund, unless this Amendment is accepted, would be receiving income from, I agree, a limited number of persons who could not under any reasonable circumstances themselves be beneficiaries of the Fund.</p>

<p>I think there is some force in the arguments brough&#x0165; forward by my two hon. and gallant Friends who have preceded me. If this pension scheme is to mean anything, it is designed to try and found a scheme which will operate fairly as between Member and Member. I dislike this scheme, because I believe that the more you go into it, the more you find that it creates anomalies and works unfairly as between one Member and another. We have extended the benefit to children. Had we not done so, there are Members of this House, of whom I am one, who under no circumstances would be able to benefit from the Fund. I do not think that is any reason why one should not contribute to a mutual fund among Members of the House, but let us make it clear that the Fund that we are setting up is proved by the contentions brought forward to-night to be really a charitable fund, and it is because it is a charitable fund that I object to it. I do not think that charity should come in. I do not think that Members of his House want to benefit by forced contributions given by other Members to a Fund from which they themselves can never benefit. It is true that in the case of any Service Member of this House who is in receipt of a certain pension, which is deferred pay&#x2014;and let it be clearly understood that a service pension is the savings of the

service man&#x2014;it is extraordinarily hard that he should have to contribute, however willing he may be, to a pension fund from which, if he has no wife and no children, he can never himself benefit.<br/>
I merely rise to point out that this is exactly where you get when you try to institute a Fund which is not really fair as between Member and Member. There is no Member on this side of the House who does not desire to help any fellow Member who, through no fault of his own, falls on evil times, and there is no desire to prevent any Member on either side of the House receiving a pension from the Fund if it is possible for him to qualify, but it should be made clear that while we are passing this Bill, we are creating anomaly after anomaly, of which this anomaly that has been pointed out by my hon. and gallant Friends is one.</p>

<p>This Amendment would by no means remove all the anomalies under this head.

debar them, in common justice you ought to allow other Members who have made provision for their old age also to be debarred. You do, therefore, create an ever-extending series of anomalies. Hon. Members opposite who could count upon trade union pensions could also <i>beg</i> to be debarred, and the result would be that by these means you would kill this Bill. If that is the avowed intention of the movers of the Amendment, let me say to them that I would rather they fought this Bill openly and honestly, and killed it, than that they should attempt to strangle it by this roundabout way. The Amendment states that if a Member is in receipt of a pension paid from public funds, he may be debarred from contributing, but it does not debar a Mem-</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 3, line 38, after "Fund," to insert: "provided such person is or has been a Member of the House of Commons."<br/>
I cannot help thinking that if this Fund is to come into existence it should be a Fund which belongs to us as a corporate body in the House of Commons. We hear, with what truth one does not know, accusations that contributions are made to party funds for various purposes. If this Fund is to be what it ought to be, it should be kept completely clear of any accusation that anyone has contributed to it for any purpose of personal gain or advancement. The only contributions should be those made by Members of this House so that they or their widows or orphan children may benefit from the Fund. Therefore, I think it is essential that we should alter the Clause, which gives power to the trustees to accept any property "devised or bequeathed from any person." The proper people to contribute to the Fund should be Members of this House who have shared its corporate life and know the circumstances of. their fellow Members.

I cannot believe that it is right or proper that some wealthy individual from outside should make a big contribution to this Fund possibly&#x2014;I do not say necessarily so&#x2014;with the feeling that ultimately some recognition of the gift might be made to him. That would be putting Members of this House in a very wrong and an invidious position. It would be belittling the dignity of this House for us to go cap in hand to some rich person, to whatever party he belongs, in order to obtain money with which to help our brethren who have fallen on evil times. I do not wish to do anything more than to try to make this Bill, which I admit that I dislike, a better and more workable Bill, and to free it from any possibility that there can ever be a scandal about the contributions made to the Fund, which would be disastrous not only for the Fund but for this House of Commons as a corporate body.</p>

<p>On a point of Order. Might I ask you, Sir Dennis, whether my hon. and gallant Friend would be prepared to withdraw this Amendment in order to move it a little later in the Clause? If we now have the Question put from the Chair to insert the proposed words in


proposed place it will be too late to put the words in in the form which the House would perhaps prefer. It seems to me that if the proposal of my hon. and gallant Friend commends itself to the House the proper form would be this:
<q> The trustees may accept any property given, devised or bequeathed to the Fund by any person who is or has been a Member of the House of Commons.</q>
If my hon. and gallant Friend would be prepared to move it in that form, then we could have a discussion and the Amendment could be put into the Clause rather more neatly.</p>

<p>I beg to second the Amendment.<br/>
I do so because I think it would be beneath the dignity of this House to accept gifts from outside from anybody, whoever it was. I do not think we should be dependent upon the generosity of anybody. This Fund will not be a State Fund, which I have advocated, and it would cease to be a real House of Commons Fund unless it were limited to the compulsory contributions of present Members and the voluntary contributions of Members or past Members.</p>

<p>It is already evident that a number of Members would like to see this change made in the Bill. Perhaps I might be allowed to say that I would welcome it myself because it would emphasise that this is a domestic matter in which all Members belong to the fraternity whether they are recipients or contributors. It would be essentially a House of Commons affair involving nobody except Members of the House of Commons and not calling for any contribution from public funds outside. It

would be very much better kept as one of our internal possessions.</p>

<p>In all of our discussions about the Bill it has been taken for granted that contributions would come from Members of the House of Commons. The hon. and gallant Member is proposing to fill a real gap in the Bill in regard to not admitting contributions from outside. The view is that this House is a corporate body and that the method of creating the Fund was an expression of our corporate spirit. For that reason I should very much prefer the Bill in the form which the hon. and gallant Member proposes.</p>

<p>I invite an explanation from the promoter of the Amendment or from the Chancellor of the Exchequer as to how the Amendment would operate in the event of somebody not a Member leaving a legacy to the Fund.

<p>Are we sure that we are doing the right thing? Did a gift like Chequers take any dignity away from the Prime Minister?

<p>In view of the feeling of the House on this Amendment it may be unnecessary for me to intervene at all, but I would like to say that I welcome the Amendment for the reason that hon. Gentlemen opposite have, quite rightly,


resented certain suggestions put from this side of the House that the Bill savours of charity. I do not agree with this point of view. I do not believe it is charity and I never have done so. My objections are upon entirely different grounds. The Bill sets up a mutual benefit Fund. Many of us have opposed it on other grounds, but I cordially support the Amendment because it will remove any taint of charity which might otherwise have remained in the Bill.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 5, line 15, at the end, to insert:
<q> Provided that the trustees may in special circumstances make payments notwithstanding that the requirements of this paragraph are not complied with.</q>
A similar provision in paragraph 4 of the Schedule is put in to give some measure of discretion to the trustees. It was argued during the Committee stage that it would be better, in the case of paragraph 2, that the trustees should be tightly bound by the provisions of the Measure, but nevertheless circumstances might arise in which we should wish some measure of latitude to the trustees to meet particular cases which cannot be foreseen while the Bill is before the House. During the Committee stage my hon. and learned Friend the Member for North Edinburgh (Mr. Erskine Hill) mentioned the case of an individual who had made a deed of settlement upon his wife, from whom he was afterwards separated. Although he was not touching one penny of the income given to his wife, if that individual fell upon evil times he would, under the strict interpretation of paragraph 2 of the Schedule, be debarred from any benefit from this pensions scheme. I do not believe that that is the desire of the House. I believe that the desire of the House is that under this pension scheme any Member who is really in need of financial assistance shall get it, and that there shall be no quibble about the particular circumstances of his financial embarrassment provided that he can

show the trustees, who presumably will be old comrades of his in the House, that he has no means and that his circumstances are such that he should receive assistance.<br/>
If that be so, I think that some latitude must be given to the trustees. In such a case as that which was mentioned by my hon. and learned Friend, the ex-Member should undoubtedly receive benefit from the Fund to which he contributed while he was a Member of the House. It would be not only hard, but definitely unjust, if he could not get it, and I feel that, however much we may differ from one another about the merits of the Bill, we desire to produce justice in its working. Therefore I think it is essential that we should insert the same provision with regard to paragraph 2 as has already been inserted by the promoters of the Bill with regard to paragraph 4. There is nothing controversial about this proposal; it arises from a desire that Members shall benefit from the Bill.</p>

<p>I beg to second the Amendment.<br/>
I do so with great pleasure, because I think it is a constructive Amendment which will help the Bill. I raised this point in Committee, and I hope the House will agree that this is a better Amendment than the one which I then moved. I cannot see how any Member of the House who wants the Bill to work in the most sensible way for the benefit of those who need it most could object to the insertion of this proviso. The House will see that the general rule remains the same. There must be a limit, as a matter of rule, in the way that the Schedule says, but any Member who can show special circumstances of hardship will be able to get the benefit of the Fund. I can see the Fund growing and reaching a position in which it will be able to afford to be a little more generous. In these circumstances I think we ought to trust the trustees, whom we appoint to administer the Fund, to decide where special circumstances have arisen,</p>

<p>I must say to my two hon. Friends that, whatever may be the arguments in favour of their proposal, I am very much afraid that to add these words at the end of paragraph 2 would not produce the desired result. We have


already passed the first paragraph, which deals with periodical payments made to a Member of this House, but the paragraph to which my hon. Friends have put down this Amendment is not that paragraph, but paragraph 2, and paragraph 2 deals with periodical payments made to a widow. It cannot be the intention of my hon. Friends that we should insist upon the strict test in the case of the ex-Member referred to in paragraph 1, which we have already passed, and that we should introduce this modification in paragraph 2. I think there must be some mistake about the matter.<br/>
If I might express my view to my colleagues in the House, I must say I think it is very doubtful whether we ought to do this. A certain amount of latitude is left to the trustees, and, if hon. Members will turn back to the first page of the Bill, they will see that under Sub-section (2) of Clause 1 the trustees may cause to be made out of the Fund such periodical or other payments as are mentioned afterwards. The only payments that are limited in point of size or by reason of income are periodical payments, and the "other payments," which would include, I suppose, a special grant or something of that kind, are not limited. There is already, therefore, that amount of latitude in the hands of the trustees. I rather doubt whether it would be right to lay down a limit such as is proposed in the First Schedule and then proceed to say that the trustees need not be narrowly governed by that limit. For one thing, it would not be really fair to the trustees. They are going to have a very invidious task, anyhow. No doubt they will do it very well, but I think it is essential that we should recognise that the trustees themselves are entitled to have limits laid down, and those limits are laid down in the First Schedule. As I have already pointed out, if we do not make any qualification in the case of an ex-Member, the effect would be to allow a greater latitude in the case of the widow, and I really do not see any reason why we should allow more latitude in the one case than in the other.<br/>
My own advice to the House would be that we should not make this very partial change, but should rely upon the fact that the trustees are able to make what are called "other payments" as distinguished from the periodical pay-

ments which they would make according to the terms of the Schedule. There is one exception which my hon. and gallant Friend, quite correctly mentioned, namely, in paragraph 4. One can imagine a case where, when a General Election had been declared on a particular date, some Member of the House who was retiring and in poor circumstances might only have been a Member for, let us say, nine years and 10 months, and one can imagine that in such a case the trustees, would say that, for the benefit at any rate of his widow, that period ought to be treated as 10 years. That is a case which is provided for. I respectfully suggest to hon. Members that it would not be a good thing to add to the number of latitudes, for we have only a limited fund to deal with, and we can trust the trustees.</p>

<p>It will be within the memory of the House that we had only a very short time in which to put these Amendments down. We were told only on Monday that the Bill might be taken to-day, and, therefore, the Amendments had to be put down very hurriedly. It was my intention that the Amendment should apply both to paragraph 1 and paragraph 2 of the Schedule. I do not know whether it would be in order for me now to move a manuscript Amendment applying both to paragraph 1 and to paragraph 2. My right hon. Friend is quite right in what he says. It is not intended that this should apply only to the widow, but that it should apply also to the ex-Member who had fallen on evil times and had tied up his money, quite honestly, being thereby debarred from benefit. I do not know whether there is any way in which it could be made applicable to both paragraphs, but that was our intention.</p>

<p>As one who has been a supporter of the Bill since its introduction, I must say that when I first read the Amendment I was inclined to support it but I had not noticed the point which the Chancellor has made about periodical or other payments. That seems to me to give a considerable amount of latitude to the trustees. Paragraph 5 of this Schedule says:
<q> For the purposes of this Schedule the income of any person shall be ascertained in such manner and on such principles as the trustees may determine.</q>

I should have thought that that would have completely covered the case that my hon. and gallant Friend raises. If the supposed income of a possible beneficiary is actually not his income but has been tied up in some way, surely the trustees will have complete freedom, to take that into account. After we have put in this Schedule and laid down various scales under which the trustees shall operate, it will be rather absurd to say to the trustees, "Here are the rules, but you may disregard them if you wish." We have said that on paragraph 4, for a special reason. It would be going too far to say that in regard to the whole of the Schedule. In view of the fact that the points raised are covered by these other provisions, I hope my hon. and gallant Friend will not press this Amendment.</p>

<p>I cannot help thinking, in spite of the excellence of the Amendment drafted by the Chancellor, that the House would be wise to think very carefully before accepting it. This Fund, at any rate for the first few years, is not likely to be in a very affluent condition. The annual income will be about &#x00A3;7,000 a year, and most of us know already of certain Members who cannot serve in this House much longer. It would be a pity if we drew on this Fund in advance, so that when definite, heart-breaking cases came along there would not be enough funds. By increasing the latitude which the trustees already have in dealing with the funds at their disposal, we should be in danger of creating the position that when such cases come along there will be no funds.</p>

<p>I cannot say that the Amendment appeals to me in any of the many forms in which it has appeared. It seems to make nonsense of paragraphs 1 and 2 of the First Schedule. I could understand the Bill having been drafted without those paragraphs, but if they are put in it can only be in order to limit the discretion of the trustees. I would strongly urge my right hon. Friend to resist the Amendment, on the ground that otherwise these paragraphs will serve no. purpose.</p>

<p>As one who supports this Bill, and who has so far sat through the night without talking, I hope that the House will forgive me if I say a word or two on this Amendment. It is extremely hard for the House to appreciate exactly what a manuscript Amendment implies, and naturally one's instinct is to oppose it for that reason. If the Amendment is to give the trustees unlimited powers, I deagree with my hon. Friend the Member for Farnham (Mr. G. Nicholson). I have also been a trustee and I liked to have a good many guiding rules to help me as to what I should and what I should not do. If you put these things in black and white, it is much easier than saying, "Here are the rules, but if necessary you can discard then." I do not think that is right, especially when you are dealing with a matter of such great importance as pensions for Members of the House of Commons. We should lay down as many rules as possible based on the principles of equity and justice. It is for these reasons that I am against this Amend-</p>

<p>Before this Bill receives its Third Reading I should like to ask the indulgence of the House for a few minutes, although I may possibly be using arguments that have been repeated <i>ad lib</i> in connection with the Bill. As one of those who originally went as a deputation to my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer in favour of a scheme of pensions for Members of Parliament, I feel that I cannot vote against the Third Reading without giving a few words of explanation. I have no qualms of conscience whatever in regard to this matter. I have had a fairly long political life and I shall never have recorded a vote in this House about which I have been so happy in my mind as I shall be when I record a vote against the Third Reading of this Bill. Why do I vote against a Bill with the principle of which I was at one time in agreement. It has been stated on more than one occasion that this is the wrong time to introduce this Bill, and I think the Prime Minister said in reply that on that argument there is no reason why it should be introduced at any time. I do not agree with that view. There are many objects, good in themselves, which should be introduced at the proper time; many objects of importance to the State in more than one direction the introduction of which we could justify much better than we can justify the introduction of this Measure at the present time.<br/>
I take it that the genesis of this Bill is the increase in the Parliamentary salary to &#x00A3;600 a year two years ago. Some of us have a lurking suspicion that some arrangement was made at that time in connection with our hon. Friends of the party opposite that there would be a certain sequel in the form of this pensions Bill. From that point of view one has a certain amount of sympathy with some of my right hon. Friends who are giving a great deal of time to this Bill and making big sacrifices in connection with it. I refer particularly to my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who has shown unexampled tact and patience. I know that at the present time he ought to be in another place and that his company is being missed. There is a feeling, and I think there is substantial ground for it, that this Bill is a sequal to the increase of our salaries to &#x00A3;600 a year.

The point I want to make is that there are many on this side of the House who regard &#x00A3;600 a year at the present time as not too large a salary for the work we do for the State. Parliamentary life is becoming more and more a whole-time occupation. There are in this House many hon. Members who are making very great sacrifices for it. Why not be absolutely honest to the House and to the electorate and say that &#x00A3;600 a year is hardly sufficient to cover the ordinary expenses of Members of Parliament, and if so by what right do you make a deduction from it of &#x00A3;12 a year for this Fund? I should be prepared, when the time came, to support a proper system of State pensions for Members of Parliament, a regularised system, and I do not think that we should need to apologise to the electorate for a system of that character. We do very important work. I think we ought to be plain and honest with the electorate, and if we have earned a pension we ought to have it subsidised on a contributory basis and a proper basis of accountancy and audit. This is neither one nor the other. It is a system whereby the overwhelming majority of Members of this House have to contribute to a certain small number. It has been introduced at the end of a Parliament of four years' duration and when there are possibilities of great changes after the next General Election.<br/>
We do not know what the next Parliament is going to be, but I think we may assume that there will be a large number of new Members coming to this House. Those new Members will have based their ambitions for Parliamentary life on the basis of a salary which may reasonably be expected to pay their expenses, and they will be immediately mulcted in the sum of &#x00A3;12 a year in order to maintain Members whom they have never seen and some of whom they have never heard of in entirely new circumstances in an entirely new Parliament. I do suggest that we have no right at this stage of this Parliament to introduce a Bill of this kind. I know that the Government have given a free vote to the House on this mat&#x0165;er, but naturally I assume that they have a benevolent neutrality in regard to the whole Bill. One cannot blame the Government for that once they have taken it up, but I ask them to take note of the fact that in the Division Lobby the majority


of the Government supporters in this House are against the Bill.<br/>
That being so, we are in a sense making a present to the Opposition. I have no antipathy to the Opposition as such. Many of them are very great friends of mine, but I do not know why in the political life of this country on the basis of the ordinary Parliamentary system we should go out of our way to make a present to the Opposition. I want to know whether the Government supporters at the next election are going to get one word of thanks from the hon. and right hon. Gentlemen opposite. Not only are we not going to get one word of thanks for passing this Bill, but we shall be opposed at the next General Election. I was trained for some years in an office which regards support for the Government as almost sacrosanct. No one who has been imbued with that tradition for some years takes it upon himself to vote against a Bill which has the support of the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer of the day, unless he has some feeling of misgiving and perturbation and some kind of restlessness with regard to its introduction. The Press of the country has seized upon the fact that Parliament at a time when it should be engaged in problems of immense magnitude and of immense moment to the population of this country is spending hours of time in a problem which is entirely of a domestic character concerning our own lives. I do not think this is a time to introduce a Measure of that sort and I should not like the Third Reading to go without my protest. I think this is a bad Bill in itself. There are great drawbacks to it and some injustices in it. Not only is the Bill intrinsically bad, but we are introducing it at a time when we have neither the right nor the mandate to do so.</p>

<p>This Bill has already been fairly exhaustively discussed; therefore I do not wish to discuss any of the merits or demerits of it in detail. In fact, I will say nothing about that side at all. I will try to offer to the House one or two main considerations at the risk perhaps of repeating what has been said before. I will try to put them in a slightly different form and endeavour to refine one or two of the issues. Personally I object to this Bill on three

main grounds: first, because of its timing; secondly, because of its sponsorship; thirdly, on purely constitutional grounds. The last point is by far the most important and therefore I propose to leave it to the last. I will take the question of timing first. My hon. Friend the Member for Denbigh (Sir H. Morris-Jones) adverted to the fact that time had been given to this Bill at a period of international crisis. It is undoubtedly true that we are passing through very grave times at present. The Government is striving with every nerve to maintain peace. We as Parliament are devoting hours every week both inside and outside the House to prosecuting an immense rearmament programme, which undoubtedly casts a very heavy burden on the country.<br/>
We are now asked in the middle of all these preoccupations to give up valuable time to a consideration of our own internal affairs in this House&#x2014;whether we are or are not to set up a fund to see that those who fall by the way in the future are not allowed to starve. We are giving up this time simply and solely to secure the position of ourselves. I believe that at this time we should not give up those very valuable hours. Some of those hours, hon. Members may claim, were spent last Thursday. Owing to an arrangement between the Patronage Secretary and the pseudo-Patronage Secretary opposite, the discussion of the Finance Bill was allowed to stop at 7.30, and I do not think there are many hon. Members who will deny that the consideration of the Third Reading of the Finance Bill is incomparably more important than this Measure for our own internal security. Later we spent many hours during the course of last Wednesday night and Thursday morning in consideration of the Committee stage.<br/>
There are hon. Members who would say that surely we who are opposing the Bill were making things worse by keeping the House sitting all that night. But surely the answer is a perfectly simple one. We who oppose the Bill are just as entitled to remain here criticising it, as those who are in favour of the Bill are entitled to waste the valuable time of the House in its consideration. We retort that we were only wasting Government light, a good deal of fairly adequate oratory, a number of pearls of wit, and our own energies in taking the action which we then took. After all, it was


perfectly open to hon. Members who disapproved of our action to go home; there was nothing to keep them here except that they wanted the Bill to go through. Surely we are just as entitled to oppose the Bill as are hon. Members who take up the time of the House in trying to get it through. Nevertheless, the main issue on the timing of the Bill to my mind is that we should not take up so much time in the present international situation, in discussing purely our own affairs.<br/>
My next objection to the Bill is its sponsorship. The putative father of this infant is a Conservative Member of Parliament. I am not at all sure that it did not have two putative fathers, and, therefore, it is hardly surprising that they have produced a monster. The hon. Member who was responsible for this Measure last February was unable to get through a Motion on his own volition and, therefore, like a prudent father preparing for the christening, he looked round for a number of powerful fairies on the Front Bench and on the Front Opposition Bench who would be present at the christening and do what they could to see that the child reached an age of puberty; and he got a number of fairy friends and witches to support his child. The result was that the Bill was taken up by the Government with the full support of the serried phalanx of hon. Members opposite and the support of Liberal Members.<br/>
The course of a Government, whatever the Government might be, is rarely easy even when they have a big majority behind them. They are put in by the electors on broad issues, and probably narrow issues as well, and are kept there by the votes of their own supporters. I suppose that probably no two hon. Members who support the Government would agree in all the details on any given issue, but there is, nevertheless, a general consensus of opinion on the part of the supporters of a Government to support their Government whenever they possibly can. Owing to the wisdom of our forbears, the party system was set up and it Works very well, but while it continues it seems to me absolutely essential that any Government, whatever it may be, must rely largely on the support of its own friends in the House of Commons for the Measures which it proposes to

pass. In any vital issue it seems to me that if the Government supporters are not satisfied with the Measure and the Government cannot succeed in persuading them to support it, the course for the Government is to resign.<br/>
I said "vital issue," because I do not look upon this as a vital issue. It is a small issue but it is certainly one in which it is very hard to prove any reason in tactics, or strategy or indeed in sense, for the Government to go against their own supporters, and I think it is a great mistake on the part of the Government to risk undermining, even on such a small issue as this, the loyalty of their own friends, as most of them who have been opposing this Bill have most strongly supported the Government in all the big issues of the day. Only a few weeks ago when this Bill was first projected 200 hon. Members who support the Government signed a resolution hoping that the Bill would not be proceeded with. In regard to the all-night sitting last week, that was not in the least intended to be against the Opposition. The discussion did not follow ordinary party grounds at all. Many of the richest hon. Members on this side were voting in favour of the Bill, and many of the poorest were voting against the Bill; it transcended party issues altogether.<br/>
Apart from the merits or demerits of the Bill, the action we took in prolonging the Committee stage unduly the other night was almost entirely due not only to an opposition to the Bill <i>in to to</i> and to parts of it in detail, but was intended as a demonstration of the Tory proletariat on the back benches, who felt that their loyalty was being somewhat stretched and that the Government would have been wiser to have relied on the support of its friends rather than to curry favour, shall I say, with others who do not usually support them. I think it was Lord Dalling and Bulwer in the last century who said:
<q> You will never be trusted if yon do more to gain an enemy than to serve a friend.</q>
There are other reasons why some of us are opposing the Bill. Some of us are opposing it because we think that each party should look after and attend to its own casualties, and some because they know full well that when hon. Members in the past have fallen on evil times a very generous House of Commons has


subscribed to see that they do not suffer unduly. There are many other cogent objections to the Bill.<br/>
My final point is the constitutional issue, and it is the most important of all. Hon. Members of all parties in this House are returned to pursue certain general lines of policy in support of the party to which they belong. But they are not returned only to do that; they are not intended to be simply robots. I think they should have a certain independence of action and thought, very frequently of speech, and occasionally of vote. It may be a restrained independence, but it seems to me that anything which detracts from cogency of criticism or the determination of any individual Member not to regard his own future, not always to be considering how he can secure his own position, but that he must be all the time considering how he can do his best for his country&#x2014;it seems to me that disregard of independence of thought, word or action would completely undermine the vitality, independence, and a great part of the value of Parliament. Some years ago, the Conservative Central Office produced a deplorable leaflet&#x2014;I say it now because it was many years ago&#x2014;which was entitled "From the cradle to the grave." It would be wholly bad and a great disservice to the nation if hon. Members returned to this House were to look upon it as a form of professional career, giving safety for the future and complete security from the ballot box to the tomb.<br/>
We have the two great institutions of the Civil Service and Parliament. The former, quite rightly, carries out its administrative functions under any Government, whatever may be the political complexion of that Government. It is entirely secure in tenure, as it should be, and its future is secured by pensions. The House of Commons is a legislative and critical body. It depends for its force on a changing, varied and very virile personnel coming together from all sections of the community. I believe it would be a very sad day for our Constitution if we did anything which tended to turn the House of Commons into a second-line Civil Service. I believe that anything that we might do which tended to induce any hon. Member to consider his own position all the time, to consider his own future, whether in the Govern-

ment or outside it&#x2014;anything which might encourage him to hedge or toady or to try to be over-conciliatory to the electorate in order to keep his seat and thus secure a future for himself when perhaps he had fallen on evil times&#x2014;is most strongly to be condemned. For those reasons, I propose to go into the Lobby against the Bill.</p>

<p>I appreciate that my right hon. Friend did not bring in the Bill, but it was the way in which he handled it, so energetically, that enabled the Bill to have the popularity which it has at the present time. I was down in my constituency last week-end. I heard no criticism that we are voting ourselves pensions and not increasing old age pensions; nor did I hear the criticism that we are using public money in order to give ourselves pensions. What I heard was criticism of the fact that, in the times in which we are now living, we have spent time which is most precious to the country in voting ourselves pensions. Hon. Members must remember that we have now taken up in hours what would practically be four days of Parliamentary time. [HON MEMBERS: "No."] If hon. Members will add up the hours, they will see that it is something like that.<br/>
I submit to hon. Members opposite that they would have been able, quite legitimately, to gain a very fine political point if they had said, on the introduction of this Bill in the first place, that time was so important that they thought it ought to be given to the country rather than to ourselves. They did not say that, but on the first opportunity, when the Prime Minister asked for four days to be taken from Supply, they raised their voices in horror and said that was something which had never been done in the history of this country. I submit that


they would have gained very legitimate political kudos if in the first place they had done as I have said. Every hon. Member must realise that if it had not been for the three speeches which the Prime Minister has made on this matter, the Bill would never have seen daylight. Although the Prime Minister said that this Bill was entirely his own idea and that any hon. Member who supported him could vote as he thought fit, some of my hon. Friends, in the course of the Debates, have hinted that those of us who are against the Bill are doing something disloyal to the Prime Minister. My hon. Friend the Member for Bolton (Sir J. Haslam) was one of them. In the Second Reading Debate, he inferred that some of us on this side of the House would be disloyal to the Prime Minister if we objected to or voted againt the Bill.</p>

<p>If I do not find that in the Official Report, I will apologise humbly to my hon. Friend, but he did infer that we were doing something which the Prime Minister would not like. I was a Member of the House when payment of Members was first instituted, and at that time I voted against the payment of Members, although I may say that, owing to changes that have occurred, I should not vote against the payment of Members now. I believe that when the &#x00A3;400 was raised to &#x00A3;600, it was the right time to deal with pensions as far as the House is concerned. There is one thing I would point out to my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer. It is not often in the history of Parliament that 112 supporters of the Government go into the Lobby against the Government when a Bill of this sort is going through the House. I am afraid that my hon. Friend the Member for East Lewisham (Sir A. Pownall), who after all is the prime mover of this Bill&#x2014;I hope he will not mind my saying this&#x2014;will be sorry that he ever started this in the House of Commons.</p>

<p>As my name has been mentioned by my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for North Dorset (Captain Hambro) and also by my hon.

Friend the Member for Penryn and Fal-mouth (Mr. Petherick) as being one of the parents of the Bill, perhaps I may say a few words with regard to its ancestry. After all, parents ought to know something about ancestry. The Bill arose, as will be seen from the Select Committee's Report, from a Question which I happened to put down soon after the increase in salaries from &#x00A3;400 to &#x00A3;600 took place some two years ago. It seemed then that there might be a margin in the budgets of hon. Members, which there had not been before in a good many cases, from which some small provision might be made to meet cases of hardship. I quite agree with the remarks of my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for North Dorset about the payment of Members. I regard this Bill as being a corollary to the payment of Members, and one that follows almost automatically once we attract to the House those who have not the financial background of the Members who came here 30 or 40 years ago.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Denbigh (Sir H. Morris-Jones) suggested that there had been something in the nature of negotiations with regard to this matter two years ago. I never heard any such suggestion until now, and as the person on whose question the Warren Fisher Committee was set up, I am quite sure that there were no such negotiations. As regards the period of parentage, the Warren Fisher Committee reported in December, 1937, a year and a half ago; and therefore, the period of incubation or gestation with regard to this particular Measure&#x2014;I am speaking as the putative parent&#x2014;has been quite a long one, and hon. Members cannot complain that it has been rushed. The obvious reason for its being put through now is that we want to get it into force before this Parliament comes to an end in case there should be instances of hardship in connection with those who are now Members of the House.<br/>
I am not going to speak on the merits or demerits of the Bill itself. I spoke on the Resolution in February, and on the Second Reading, and I think, from my point of view, I have covered the ground. But I want to say a few words of appreciation of my two right hon. Friends whose names are on the Bill. I wish to thank my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister who, with more preoccupations, one might almost say, than any other Prime


Minister within living memory, has found time to take the interest which he has taken in this Measure. He devoted several hours to attending the discussions on the Bill, he spoke twice upon it and he made himself master of its provisions. I think the House as a whole, apart from party politics, owes a debt of gratitude to the Prime Minister for having, in a time of great anxiety, taken such an interest in this Bill. I also wish to thank my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer. My hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Epsom (Sir A. Southby), who has not seen eye to eye with me on this matter, paid him a generous and graceful tribute on Thursday morning last at the end of the Committee stage, as also did my hon. Friend the Member for Denbigh (Sir H. Morris-Jones) who, incidentally, went with me a year ago to the Chancellor of the Exchequer on a deputation in favour of this, but has since modified his opinion.</p>

<p>I accept the correction. The Bill did not exist at that time and obviously my hon. Friend could not have been in favour of it. This only shows how the Bill has divided parties in this House and even families because we had the case of an hon. Lady who voted against her own brother. I do wish to join my two hon. Friends whom I have mentioned in thanking my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer for the active part he is taking with regard to the Bill. I think opponents and friends of the Bill alike were much struck by the grasp of its provisions which my right hon. Friend showed and also his patience all through the hours of our discussion on Thursday morning. May I say, in conclusion, that I sincerely hope that, in the years to come, this very small Measure will prove of service to those, to whatever party they may belong, who fall on hard times after rendering many years of service to the State by membership of this House.</p>

<p>I regretted having had to give a silent vote

on the Second Reading of this Bill, and I would like to take this opportunity of expressing certain views upon it. No criticism can be laid against either the Prime Minister or the Chancellor of the Exchequer for having taken part in the Debates on the Bill. I think they would have been lacking in courage if they had not done so. Having listened to all the arguments I agree that the present is not a time when such a Measure should be brought before Parliament. I think most of the points which have been debated are rather small compared with the big principle involved. I am one of those unfortunate people who, in two years time, will become eligible for a pension, although at present I think it hardly likely that I shall claim it. But I have seen so many cases among friends and indeed relations in recent years, of people who have lost everything they possessed in the world, that I realise that it is not unlikely that any of us, however favoured we may be at this moment, may find ourselves in the same position. We have to face that fact.<br/>
The reason why I oppose the Bill can be put very shortly, and it will, I think, be understanded of the Opposition. Suppose I became eligible for this pension in a few years time. Hon. Members of the Opposition probably regard me as standing for much that they dislike and indeed almost detest. They would say '' If that particular fellow-Member of ours gets his way all our hopes, and all our great party principles will be shattered." I frankly confess that I consider it undesirable that any hon. Member should be forced, year by year, to contribute to a Fund which might go to someone who was diametrically opposed to him and with whose policy he disagreed. Conversely, I frankly admit that I am in the House of Commons and have given up my life for a principle&#x2014;in opposing Measures for which hon. Members of the Opposition stand. I hope I have many good friends among them, but I feel that if their principles were carried into effect it would mean the complete ruin and destruction of my country. I, therefore, also feel it undesirable that I should be compelled, year after year, willy-nilly, to contribute to a fund which will sustain men who are standing for certain principles which I think are absolutely destructive of the good of my native land.


I hope hon. Members above the Gangway will realise that there is nothing personal in what I say. I should be lacking in courage if I did not frankly state that opinion. Hon. Members above the Gangway claim that they have something like 10,000,000 votes in the country, and I think about 12,500,000 votes were given for Conservative supporters of the National Government. Will anybody tell me that our services are so valued by our respective parties that the people who have sent us here are not prepared to contribute &#x00BD;d. a year in order to see that the representatives of their political parties are not let destitute&#x2014;or is it to be said that there is a lack of imagination on the part of political organisers? The principle to which I object is that of compelling hon. Members to contribute to a Fund which will be used hereafter in sustaining political causes to which they are opposed. That is really what it comes to indirectly. It is a principle to which I object. Surely it is not beyond the wit of the men in the various parties in the State to provide a Fund to sustain those who have represented them in Parliament, in their old age, or to support their widows if they die destitute.<br/>
The House will forgive me if I have said anything which hurts the opinions of any hon. Member here. This is a domestic affair and it is one's duty to say frankly what one feels but I venture to think that if in the future we here are to become a merry family, that principles do not divide us and that Members of all parties contribute to a common Fund to help each other&#x2014;people will begin to say that this is a sham fight. Politics, as far as I am concerned, is not a sham fight. I am here to sustain certain great ideals. Hon. Gentlemen have their ideals, which they sustain with equal sincerity. I think it intolerable that a Bill should be brought in compelling any Member to contribute to maintain those who are fundamentally opposed to the principles which he upholds.</p>

<p>Before the Bill reaches its Third Reading I think I should interpose in order to put on record, at the final stage, what is the relationship of the Government to the Bill. This is not a matter on which the Government take a view. Indeed, looking through the

Division lists, I have noticed that on two principal occasions, the occasion when a Division was taken on the Resolution, and again when a Division was taken on the Second Reading of the Bill itself, I think I am right in saying that 15 Members of the administration voted one way, and 15 the other. There is no Government view about the matter at all. I must insist upon this because it has been my fate to interpose a good many times, not in the least in order to force my views on anyone but because for practical purposes, if a Bill is going to be carried and discussed in an orderly fashion, it is necessary for someone to be ready to give the necessary explanations and offer necessary suggestions. That is all that I have tried to do.<br/>
The only other thing that I wanted to say on the general position is this. The Prime Minister, as he told us at the time, brought the Bill forward, not because he was the head of the Government but because he was the Leader of the House of Commons. There had been proposed to the House last February a Motion by a private Member which invited the House of Commons to say whether it generally approved the Report of the Departmental Committee, and whether it would be in favour of the initiation of legislation to carry out proposals of that sort provided they did not involve any charge on the taxpayer. On that occasion also it was made perfectly clear that everyone, including Government supporters, would be entitled to exercise their own judgment and there was no question of anyone seeking to give an official lead. There could not be a freer vote than that&#x2014;a vote on a private Motion moved by a private Member in the course of which various views were stated. The Motion was carried by two to one, and thereupon the Prime Minister thought it his duty, as Leader of the House, to give the House itself an opportunity of implementing that decision. Consequently, a Bill was presented. I put my name on it, together with that of the Prime Minister, because I knew that I might have to take some responsibility on minor matters.<br/>
We all have in memory the Prime Minister's speech. It was not one calling upon all who trusted him to agree with him on this point. He was most careful to say&#x2014;he has been most scrupulous


throughout to insist that there should be no question here of disloyalty, that there could be no reproach to anyone, and that this was essentially a matter on which every Member of the House of Commons should form his own judgment. I know that it has been a matter of distress to some of my friends that, exercising that liberty, which they were bound to exercise, they found themselves on this point opposed to the Prime Minister. No one could regret it more sincerely than they do, but that is, after all, what we have to do on a controversial occasion when two views are very possible and when we resolve that we will try to decide the matter without the assistance of Government leadership, or party Whips, or anything of the kind. It makes no sort of difference to the permanent relations which exist between Members on this side of the House and their Leader.<br/>
That being so, I want to make one other observation to clear up the position, because otherwise I do not feel that in this respect a great Government Department or I myself have been treated very fairly. Generous things have been said about me, for which I am grateful, but it is not fair that it should be represented anywhere outside the House that this is a Treasury matter. It has nothing in the world to do with the Treasury. I have been doing this for the Prime Minister because I have been doing a certain amount of miscellaneous work for him in the House and for no other reason whatever. I hope it will be made plain, both by supporters and opponents of the Bill, that it is not a Treasury matter. In order that I may prove what I say by visual exhibition and demonstration, I have brought here and have sitting beside me the Financial Secretary. He and I differ on this subject completely. He has lost no occasion of voting in the opposite Lobby to me and I have lost no occasion of voting in the opposite Lobby to him. We have all expressed our views. I can see myself that there are quite serious arguments which have been advanced by some who oppose the Bill. It is not by any means a self-evident proposition but a matter which has to be thought over very carefully, but, weighing those arguments on one side and the other, a matter about which, I hope, hereafter the House of Commons will have no reason to reproach itself. It is

inspired by a feeling that we are really engaged in a common task.<br/>
I know how strongly the hon. and gallant Gentleman the Member for Bournemouth (Sir H. Croft) feels on many matters on which I may agree with him, but I still think that, while we are here in this controversial assembly engaged in fighting one another, there is an underlying sympathy existing between us because we are all members of this historic assembly. I shall rest all the more content feeling that, by our co-operative effort, the House of Commons has decided to try to make a domestic arrangement which may bring a little aid to those of our number who find themselves fallen upon evil days. I feel sure that, now that the battle is over, we shall always wish to look at it in that spirit, that we shall make the truth about the Bill known outside, and that it will not be made the subject of groundless misrepresentation. I am sure that, whether supporters or opponents, if we act together it will do a great deal to prevent a great injustice both to those who have taken a prominent part in putting it forward and to the House of Commons as a whole.</p>

<p>I must apologise for appearing rather late to speak in the proceedings on this Bill, but the only reason I desire to do so is that I was unfortunately away during the Committee stage of the Bill, and as I hold rather strong views about it, I should be reluctant to let it pass without at least raising my voice to justify, as briefly as I can, the views which I hold. There was one sentence, and one only, in the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for East Lewisham (Sir A. Pownall) with which I agreed, and that is that hon. Members opposite ought to be deeply grateful to the Prime Minister for the part that he has played in bringing this Bill before the House. I hope they will allow their gratitude in the coming months to obscure the violence of the attacks which they are continually making upon him. Gratitude, after all, is a great and generous emotion, and I hope they will exercise it to the full.<br/>
The Prime Minister's intervention was of very considerable importance in this matter, and though my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer has done


his best to make it clear that there was no coercion and no endeavour to dragoon Members into voting for the Bill, and, in his own words, nothing could be more free for discussion than a private Member's Motion proposed by a private Member, yet the fact remains that the number of private Members' Motions in whose favour we have a speech from the Prime Minister is very few indeed, and that fact, by itself, marks it out as a very extraordinary Measure. Although there was a large majority, to which the hon. Member for East Lewisham referred, which carried his Motion, it was almost entirely due to the personal influence of the Prime Minister that such a large number of people who disliked the idea of the Bill were so reluctant to put themselves into opposition to the leader of their side of the House that they did in fact vote for it.</p>

<p>I would remind my hon. Friend who has intervened with such heat and indignation that if he would care to study the number of Government supporters who, when they had had time to think and to allow the words of the Prime Minister to sink into their minds, voted against the Second Reading of the Bill, he would find that the votes were two to one on the Government side, and I think that another clear indication is that the number of abstentions was very much greater than the number of those who actually voted in the Lobby. There is one other point with which I wish to deal, and that is the fitness of producing this Bill at this time. The other day hon. Members opposite, to whom an irreverent colleague of mine referred as "Our Dumb Friends' League" on this matter, allowed to pass through this House, practically without protest, a constitutional malpractice of a surprising kind, namely, the removal from them of four Supply days, obtained for them by the defeat of the King by Parliament about 300 years ago, and those four days were not merely their constitutional right, but their constitutional duty to defend in order to attack the Government. They allowed that to go through almost with-

out protest, because of congested business; congested with what? Congested with a Members' pension Bill. Hon. Members opposite should think of their constitutional position as the defenders of the rights of the Opposition.<br/>
Finally, I want to point out to all hon. Members that the pensioning of those on either side who are so unfortunate as to lose their all is not purely a matter for this House of Commons. There are duties which lie on bodies outside. Hon. Members opposite do not belong to a party which is so poor that it cannot look after its own. I gather that the total sum required to pension those who are expected to receive these pensions is between &#x00A3;3,000 and &#x00A3;4,000 a year, one-tenth of the contribution of the Trade Union Congress to the Labour party funds. Why introduce a Measure which, apart from being a compulsory one, does inflict one particularly grave injustice which the House insisted upon maintaining, and that is that people are compelled to contribute to it who can never in the nature of things possibly benefit by it. To my mind that is a major injustice. I hope we shall divide on the Third Reading of the Bill, and I shall find myself with a very clear conscience in the opposition lobby.</p>

<p>I owe an apology both to you, Mr. Speaker, and hon. Members of this House in that I thought you called me just now and that hon. Members were uttering the traditional cry "'Vide,' vide" when, in fact, they were referring to my hon. Friend the Member for Leicester (Mr. Wise). It is only fair in those circumstances that my remarks, which I had intended should be brief when I first rose, should be even briefer now. My right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Private Member's Motion which was brought forward by the hon. and gallant Member for Lewisham (Sir A. Pownall) was adopted by the Prime Minister and a Bill then introduced, but I should like to draw attention to the fact that less than half the Members of the House voted on the day on which the Private Member's Motion was discussed. It should be put on record that this Measure has been brought in when less than half the total Members of the House had expressed their desire that there should be some form of pension. We are now


parting with a Bill which, whatever we like to call it, is a pension Bill. My complaint about it is not that it is making pensions for Members possible but that it is doing in the wrong way something which I believe ought to be done. I do not object to pensions for Members, although I do not believe the present time is opportune for getting those pensions in the proper way, and that is from the State.<br/>
The Bill now makes pensions possible for widows and for orphans. That was in nobody's mind when the Motion was introduced, and it was in nobody's mind when the Second Reading of this Measure took place. I pointed out then that I do not believe that the funds available for this pensions scheme will suffice for ex-Members of this House who are in difficulties. I am quite sure that they will not suffice for ex-Members of this House and for widows and for orphans. My complaint about the Bill is that it is coercing Members of this House to make contributions to a scheme which, when it has been set up, will not carry out what 1 think it is the wish of everybody on both sides of the House to do, and that is to meet the case of a Member of this honourable House who has fallen on evil times.<br/>
Because I believe that that is what will happen, the House should realise now, on Third Reading, that inevitably this scheme will one day have to be taken over by the State. One day it will have</p>

<p>to become a State obligation to pay pensions to Members who have fallen on evil times, and I believe that to be right, but do not let us deceive ourselves, when we set up this scheme, that it can ever really meet the case of the Members of this House who have fallen into difficulties. I do not believe that hon. Members on the opposite side of the House, who have exercised their undoubted right to remain silent during the Debate, like the scheme any better than I do, but I think that they&#x2014;I do not say this in any offensive way&#x2014;consider that half a loaf is better than no bread and that it is better to do it like this than not to do it at all.</p>

<p>I do not think it is fair to suggest that those of us who do not like this Measure and who have discussed it point by point have been wasting the time of the House. Because of the points that have been brought forward, the Bill, bad as it is, is better than it was when it was introduced and upon its Second Reading. The Bill, nevertheless, smacks too much of a charitable fund. I dislike it. I do not think it is compatible with the dignity of this honourable House. Something has to be done to meet the case of the Member who falls on evil times, but I wish it were not being done in this way.</p>

<p>I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."<br/>
This is a formal Measure, which is usually introduced as soon as possible after the Finance Bill has been disposed of. It is passed annually in order to confirm the Customs Resolutions of the Manx Legislature and to make amendments in the law relating to the Isle of Man Customs administration, similar to those made in respect of Customs administration in the last Isle of Man Customs Act. The Isle of Man has a separate existence. It is completely free in respect of its Customs duties and levies, but these are subject to confirmation by this Parliament. I do not think there is any necessity to go further into the matter, but if any hon. Member wishes to ask any questions I will do my best to answer them.</p>

<p>I beg to move,
<q> That the Clearing Office (Rumania) Amendment Order, 1939, dated the thirteenth day of July, nineteen hundred and thirty-nine, a. copy of which was presented to this House on the seventeenth day of July, nineteen hundred and thirty-nine, be approved.</q>
This is a Provisional Order to take the place of one dated last September, the contents of which I explained to the House in November. The object of that was to enable the Rumanian exporter of goods to this country to obtain for a proportion of his goods a greater sum in lei than he was able, under the old arrangement, to obtain at the official rate of exchange plus premium. Our hope when we introduced the arrangement was that the Rumanian exporter would be encouraged to send additional goods to this market, with the result that more sterling would accrue to the Clearing Office, and, therefore, be available for clearing off existing trade

debts and increasing exports of British goods to Rumania. We have, I think, achieved that object, because in the period September to May, 1937-38, our exports from Rumania amounted to &#x00A3;2,500,000 sterling, whereas for the corresponding period, 1938-39, during which the new agreement has been in force, our imports have been increased to &#x00A3;4,750,000 sterling. The effect has been to accelerate the repayment of outstanding debts and to enable more British goods to be sold. Owing to the continually changing circumstances, certain improvements, we think, can now be made. Those improvements were discussed in outline by Sir Frederick Leith-Ross when he was in Rumania recently negotiating the credit of &#x00A3;5,500,000. A delegation of Rumanian experts has since been for some weeks in London working out the details, and this Order now contains the results. The essence has not been changed, but one or two comparatively minor alterations have been made of a technical character, which, we hope, will further facilitate mutual trade.</p>

<p>The Supplementary Estimate asks for an addition, under Vote A, of 89,000 men of all ranks to the 185,000 of all ranks provided for in the original Estimate, which will give us a total on Vote A of 275,000 men. The Estimate covers a variety of increases, with which I think the Committee will be familiar, which are connected with certain steps taken in recent months to add to the strength of the Army. For instance, we have called up, as hon. Members will recollect, members of the Reserve, including officers of the Regular Army Reserve and the Supplementary Reserve under the Reserve and Auxiliary Forces Act. We require these Reservists to take the place of certain Regulars who have been withdrawn from their Regular units mainly for the purpose of training the Militia. Further, under Vote A the numbers have been added to by reason of the embodiment of the anti-aircraft personnel of the Territorial Army. These men, as the Committee will realise, are to-day manning our anti-aircraft defences during the interval when we shall train the Militia, who will take over the permanent manning of these defences. I think that explains why we have to ask for these increases under Vote A. I do not think the Committee will wish me to go into any great detail, but if there are any questions which hon. Members desire to ask, I shall try to answer them.</p>

Member has mentioned something about the Reservists. I should like to know from the Secretary of State or from the hon. Gentleman what is the policy followed in calling up Reservists. Is there any policy of calling up first those Reservists who have been some considerable time away from the Colours, or are the Reservists called up indiscriminately regardless of the time that they have been placed upon the Reserve, because it has been brought

to my attention that in one particular camp&#x2014;I have written to the Secretary of State about the matter, privately&#x2014; Reservists have been called up who have not been long away from the Colours. There should be some policy followed in calling up these Reservists. It is desirable to call up, first, those Reservists who have been away from the Colours some time, because they probably need polishing up in their knowledge and training in weapons with which they are not familiar, in preference to those Reservists who have only recently left the Colours and been placed on the Reserve. The hon. Member might have been a little more informative as to the numbers that have been recruited in the Territorial Force. I hope that he will give us that information now.</p>

<p>It is something in the nature of 30,000 or 40,000 men we still require. With regard to the question as to the reservists, we have deliberately called up those reservists who had most recently left the Colours because we required their services to help in the training. They would be the most useful. There are some who have not seen the most recent weapons and in that respect they are as out of date as the men who had left the Colours previous to them. It was because they were regarded as the most useful men to be used as instructors and trainers that we called them up in the first place.</p>

<p>Can we have an assurance that those reservists who have been called up for training are actually being trained in the use of these new weapons and not being put on fatigue duties and routine duties of that nature, because many of the men who have left good substantial jobs for their service feel that their service time should not be wasted, and they want to have adequate training


in the time while they are called up and not be put on routine matters which in their view are a waste of time.</p>

<p>It is our deliberate policy that these men should be brought up to date as quickly as possible and trained in the use of all modern equipment. Some of them are being used to take the place of regular instructors who have left their units to train Territorials and militiamen, while others are being trained directly as instructors. I can assure the hon. Member for Bassetlaw (Mr. Bellenger) that we are not wasting a day of the reservists' service. It is essential from the Army point of view that when they leave their service they should be thoroughly familiar with the new weapons and equipment.</p>

<p>I should like to ask a question about the 30,000 men whom the hon. Gentleman has told us we are short of for this doubling of the Territorial Army.

<p>No, Sir. I think one of the most remarkable things about the passage of the Military Training Act was the way in which recruiting was stimulated almost concurrently. Recruiting both for the Regular Army and the Territorial Army is constantly breaking records, and I have no doubt that if we continue in the way we have been going the shortage will very speedily be made up. Not only are we getting a magnificent response, but we are getting a magnificent type of man. That is a thing which I am sure the House will gladly note, as indeed does the whole country. Far from having a prejudicial effect recent innovations have had exactly the opposite effect.</p>

<p>The hon. Member will realise that this Estimate deals with the bill which has to be faced as the result of the doubling of the Territorial Army and the introduction of compulsory military training. There are other items in the Estimates. For instance, measures connected with the expansion and


acceleration of the defence programme for the Army, and there is a substantial sum included to pay for the reduction to 20 of the age at which soldiers in the Regular Army are officially recognised as married and can receive grants in respect of dependants. The largest item is, of course, connected with the formation of the Militia, the militiaman's pay and the money required for the erection of camps. There is also hutment accommodation and the finding of accommodation for these men. The next largest item is that required to pay for the doubling of the Territorial Army. There is a saving of over &#x00A3;6,000,000 to go against this, due to the formation of the Ministry of Supply. With the formation of the Ministry of Supply certain establishments which hitherto have been charged against Army Votes will in the future be charged against the Ministry of Supply. There is also certain personnel, most of them connected with technical research. I will not trouble the Committee with the details of the various Votes, but if any hon. Member has any point to raise I shall be only too glad to give the Committee what information I can.</p>

<p>In view of the criticisms which have been made by way of questions in the House as to the manner in which some of these hutments have been put up and the rather exaggerated cost in some cases, I should have hoped that the hon. Member would have told us a little more about that subject. There have been complaints that some of the Forces have been turned out from hutments and placed in tents to make way for the Militia. None of us would desire to see the militiamen t&#x0155;eated in any other way than that their physical comforts should be looked after, but there is a feeling in certain quarters that adequate preparations have not been made for the reception of the Militia. We know, of course, the circumstances which precipitated the calling up of a considerable number of these young men, but we should have thought that could have been foreseen and that accommodation would have been provided for these militiamen. We are not asking that they should be mollycoddled, but we do expect that appropriate accommodation should have been provided, and we hope the hon. Member

will set our minds at rest in this respect, as we have a feeling that the accommodation is still not there for these young men who have been called away from civilian life. Can he tell us whether sufficient accommodation in the way of huts is now available for the whole of the Militia forces which have been called up?</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman will forgive me if I say that I am a little disappointed at some of his remarks about our success in providing accommodation. I think he must have forgotten that it was not until 26th April of this year that the announcement that compulsory military training was to become a feature of our National Defence was made, and that it was not until the end of May that the Bill implementing that decision became law. The fact that the War Office was faced with the task of making all the administrative arrangements, as well as providing accommodation for these militiamen, some 150,000 of whom are to be called up in the first 12 months, caused the Department to be faced with one of the most gigantic tasks which any Government Department has ever had to undertake. The fact that we shall have been able to provide hutted camps, as they will be provided in time to accommodate the men before the summer ends and the cold weather comes on, is not, I think, a matter of criticism, but is one on which those who are responsible in the Department deserve the greatest praise. I do not suggest that when a Department is working at that sort of pressure everything goes absolutely smoothly. That is more than one could expect. The hon. Member must realise the strain to which not only the Commands but also the branches in the War Office, are being put. I think they have achieved something which certainly was unparalleled in the last War, and they have done it on a scale which deserves the greatest praise.<br/>
The hon. Member asked me whether it was true that Regular soldiers are being turned out of barracks and put into tented camps in order to make room for militiamen. That is true. I will tell the hon. Member why it is being done. Some of the young militiamen who are coming up are in a very soft condition. The Regular soldier is kept fit and tough, and he can turn out of the barrack room and go into


more arduous conditions without suffering any ill effects. I think it was only fair&#x2014; and I do not think the Regular soldiers have resented it in the very least&#x2014;that the personal condition of the militiamen in their initial stages should take precedence in settling where the two classes of men were to be accommodated. I assure the hon. Member that within a very few weeks the militiaman will be in just as healthy and tough a condition as the Regular soldier, and that he in his turn will be fitted to suffer the rigours of an English summer. I do not think there is any grievance on that score, but naturally we are anxious to do the militiamen well. We believe that much depends upon the initial batch going home and saying what a fine time they have had, and if it means a little discomfort for the Regulars, I think the Regulars will understand and appreciate the reason why.<br/>
The hon. Member also asked whether there would be sufficient accommodation for all the militiamen. I think that will be so, in spite of the fact that more men have been allotted to us than we had anticipated would be. I do not pretend that all the camps will be ready on the exact date on which we had hoped they would be, but there is no doubt, I think, that the hutted camps will be ready in sufficient time to accommodate the militiamen before the cold summer ends and the warm winter begins. I realise, as does the hon. Member, that the unfortunate conditions of the last fortnight have caused considerable discomfort in these camps, but every step is being taken to mitigate that discomfort. I am not sure that they would have been very much more comfortable had they been in hutted camps, but the hutted camps, when they are completed, will be model establishments, as I think everybody will admit. They will be amply large enough to accommodate the men who will go into them, and there will be ample accommodation in the barracks and depots where the militiamen not in the anti-aircraft camps will be accommodated. Perhaps the hon. Member would like to have an opportunity of visiting them.</p>

<p>I fully realise the magnitude of the task which

has fallen upon the War Office, but I must point out that it is a task which the War Office invited and not one which was thrust upon them. Can the hon. Gentleman give us some facts and figures to show what the situation is at present? How many militiamen are living under canvas, and about what date is it expected that they will be accommodated in huts? I can imagine that when the Bill was passed, about Whitsuntide, when we had a few days of fine weather, the idea of living under canvas may have made a strong appeal to the prospective militiaman. But in the sort of weather which we are experiencing at present, the glamour of living under canvas has probably worn off, and it would be interesting to know at what date it is hoped to relieve the militiamen of the hardships which they are now enduring, and to accommodate them in huts.<br/>
I am sure that the militiamen do not wish to live softly. I do not think that is their spirit at all. I read with great interest the remarks made by the Secretary of State for War on that Saturday when he made a tour of inspection of the Militia camps. He said, in effect, to the militiamen, "You are the guests of the nation and the nation wishes to do you proud." But I think the wisest words said upon that Saturday were said, not by the Secretary of State but by an unknown sergeant who was reported in the Press as having said that he thought the militiamen would be very disappointed if they did not get "a little bit of the real sergeant-major stuff." He was probably nearer the truth than the right hon. Gentleman. I am sure, as I say, that the militiamen do not wish to live softly and that they would be disappointed if things were made too easy for them, but in view of the present weather conditions I think we ought to know how many are living under canvas and when it is expected to transfer them to hutments.</p>

<p>The majority of the men are in huts at the present time. I would hesitate to give the exact date on which all the hut camps will be completed, but I hope it will be towards the middle of September and a large number will be completed before then. No effort is being spared to get on with the work as quickly as possible, but there are certain difficulties which militate against speed in this connection. I appreciate what the hon. and gallant Member said about the


spirit of these men. Wherever any of us has gone among these camps we have found the same thing. I think it would be an excellent idea for hon. Members to see for themselves and my right hon. Friend will be only too pleased, if hon. Members give him notice or give me notice, to arrange that they shall see for themselves the conditions under which the men are living.</p>

I think it will be about the middle of September&#x2014;about the same time as the Territorials return from camp. The huts are being put up where we have been soldiering under canvas. When we arrived there they were about half way up. I should say that about the day we return they will be up and ready for the Militia, which is about the middle of September.

<p>I think it would be the wish of the Committee that I should endeavour to give a brief outline of what we are asking for in this Estimate. We are asking for an increase of personnel of 32,000 regular officers and airmen, bringing the maximum number who can be borne on our establishment up to 150,000, and it is expected that this number will be substantially reached by the end of the present financial year. These additional personnel are required for three reasons, firstly because of the acceleration of delivery of aircraft, secondly, because of the decision to man permanently a portion of the balloon barrage, and

thirdly, because of the formation of more squadrons for overseas and trade protection. The fact that these extra squadrons were to be formed was announced by the Secretary of State in the Estimates presented on 9th March last but, as a decision regarding the actual number of squadrons to be formed had not been reached at the time when the Estimates were prepared, it was not practicable to include that number in the Estimates.<br/>
The personnel of the Auxiliary Air Force called up for service in the balloon barrage count against Vote A, but those young men who are allowed to volunteer, and whom we are able to take for six months continual training, do not appear on Vote A. As regards finance, the money to be voted is only &#x00A3;100, but we are asking for authority to appropriate receipts amounting to &#x00A3;40,000,000. Of this sum &#x00A3;500,000 appropriated in aid of Vote I represents the Royal Air Force's share of gifts generously given towards Imperial Defence by certain Rulers and the Governments of certain oversea Dependencies which are named on page II of the Supplementary Estimate. The remaining &#x00A3;39,500,000 is being provided from the Defence Loan and, as to &#x00A3;23,500,000 is in aid of Vote III, Technical and Warlike Stores, &#x00A3;16,000,000 in respect of Vote IV, Works, Buildings and Lands; and these are the Votes which bear the capital cost of rearmament. I could give details of the items Vote by Vote, but I have endeavoured to give a general picture as regards the personnel and finance for which we are asking authority.</p>

<p>In connection with the increase of personnel of 32,000, there is one matter which I should like to raise. I regret that I have not informed the hon. Gentleman of my intention but I overlooked the fact that an opportunity would be afforded to-night. I want to speak specifically about the camp which the Department is in process of building at Cannock Chase, in the division which I have the honour to represent. I asked a question a fortnight ago of the Secretary of State for Air as to the rates of wages being paid in the construction of this camp, and I was informed that for a 48-hour week labourers in the employ of the Department were being paid 47s. a week, and I was told that that was in


conformity with the general wage rates prevailing in the district. I do not know where the Secretary of State obtained his information. I have suggested that he might approach the Ministry of Labour in the area, because if he does, he will find that the rate of pay which his Department is paying these men is completely out of conformity with the general rates prevailing in the district. I have in my hand a letter from one of the trade unions concerned, the Union of General Municipal Workers, which caters mainly for unskilled labour in this area, and the rates which they give me as applicable in this area are as follows: building trade labourers, is. 1&#x00BC;d. per hour; civil engineering labourers, is. id.; electricity labourers, is. 1&#x00BD;d. The lowest of these figures would give a higher wage rate than 47s. for a 48-hour week, and I would like the Under-Secretary to tell me on what he bases his figure of 47s., unless he is taking into consideration the wages of agricultural labourers, which would be grossly unfair.<br/>
There is very serious unrest in this camp on account of the rates of pay, and I appeal to the hon. and gallant Gentleman, for the sake of harmony and of getting the job completed, to look further into the matter, and, having satisfied himself that these rates of pay are not the recognised rates prevailing in the district, to do what is only right and proper, implement the fair wage principle, and pay the rates applicable. I have a letter from one of the people concerned, a civilian waiter in the sergeants' mess, who says:
<q> I assure you that there has been grave discontent with regard to the people mentioned, and many of the employ&#x00E9;s feel that they are definitely being outrageously robbed. My wages are not even &#x00A3;2 5s. 5d., but &#x00A3;2 3s. 5d. a week, for a 48-hour week, with two hurried meals.</q>
He goes on to say that three weeks ago a warrant officer came into the mess demanding food two hours after the time, and the staff attempted to serve him, but because he was short of soup, he sacked the whole of the staff. The rest of the staff on the building threatened to walk out, but the chief, sensing trouble, reinstated the whole staff the following morning. For the guidance of hon. Members, I may say that this camp is located at Cannock Chase and is many miles from

anywhere where warrant officers could get meals provided for them so that it was probably a question of discretion being the better part of valour that the whole staff was reinstated. That gives some indication that there is discontent, and I would ask the hon. and gallant Gentleman whether he considers that 47s. is a reasonable remuneration for men engaged in laborious work at Cannock Chase. These men have to travel long distances to their work, which necessitates their being away from their homes, not eight hours a day, but 11 and 12 hours a day, in order to get in eight hours' employment. I hope the hon. and gallant Gentleman will give the matter his further consideration.</p>

<p>I think that neither the hon. and gallant Gentleman nor his right hon. Friend can complain of the amount of interrogation which they have suffered in regard to air matters during the last six months. In particular, there has been a screen of secrecy thrown over the operations of the balloon barrage, and I think it is time now that we should have some information upon this form of defence, upon which such large sums are being expended. At present all we know about the balloon barrage is that the right hon. Gentleman has been made an honorary Air Commodore of one of the squadrons, and that the balloons themselves will have a moral effect upon the enemy pilots. I see also that the Prime Minister has been accorded an honour of that kind. Is the hon. and gallant Gentleman satisfied that the balloon barrage is really worth the amount that is being expended upon it? I do not wish to extract from him any military information. All the information I propose to refer to is certainly available to anyone who cares to get it.<br/>
To what height can these balloons go? I have observed the thickness of some of the cables&#x2014;that is a little point which anyone could get who cares to see them&#x2014; and we know that this is information which is already in the hands of any possible enemies. The cable is almost a quarter of an inch thick. It is a perfectly simple matter for anyone to work out from the size of the balloon what length can be carried to what height by that size of balloon. Why, therefore, should that question be surrounded with such an element of secrecy? Then, why is it that one of the largest depots of the


balloon barrage, where are stored enormous quantities of equipment, is situated in what is believed to be one of the most vulnerable parts of London? Why should these depots be centred in the industrial and vulnerable areas? These balloons are supposed to be extremely mobile and is there any reason why these accumulations of supplies should be in one place?<br/>
What measures are being taken to forestall what I would describe as counter-balloon-barrage methods? For example, are any experiments being conducted into the possibility of the utter destruction of balloon barrages by some form of cutting instrument on the leading edge of an aeroplane wing? I believe it is right to say that certain experiments are being carried out, I think in Germany. It is said that in Germany they are emulating our example in establishing a large number of balloon squadrons, and yet in another quarter I have been informed that the emulation of our balloon squadrons is merely undertaken to lull us into the belief that these balloon barrages are really effective. This is the time for us to have some information. I do not believe that it is possible to bluff anybody with balloon barrages, and if it were ever found that these were an illusory form of defence the day of retribution would be very serious for the Ministers who are responsible for it. It may be that information with regard to the effectiveness of this idea&#x2014;I will not put it higher than that&#x2014;has not reached me, and if it is possible for the hon. and gallant Gentleman to give us some assurance as to the number of the balloons, the height to which they will go and the measures which have been taken to test their effectiveness I am sure he will be doing a useful service.</p>

<p>I wish to put one or two questions to the Air Minister. There may be certain questions which, for reasons of high policy, he may not desire to answer openly in the Committee, and I do not desire to ask any question that, would hinder the advance of the Air Service to-day. For a number of years I have received most unsatisfactory replies when I have raised matters re-relating to the progress of the Air Service in Scotland. I would remind the Committee that the Government Chief

Whip, when asked about the anti-aircraft units, told us that the position in Scotland was very satisfactory, and that when hon. Members asked for information he told us that we had two anti-aircraft units in the whole of 'Scotland. With a great flourish in the country an announcement has been made that there would be nine balloon barrage systems established. We were to have one in the North of England and one in the Glasgow area. I trust I am making myself clear; I am speaking under very great disability. When I raised the question of the balloon barrage system in the Glasgow area, I was assured that progress was being made and that the contract had been established. I hope the Minister can refute the information which I have received from a very reliable source, the representative of a national newspaper in Scotland. [<i>Laughter,</i>] The right hon. Gentleman laughs, but I would tell him that the Scottish newspapers have a reputation that is the envy of the newspapers in every other country of the world, with regard to the issuing of correct information. I have been informed that, after many months, Glasgow has now one balloon, and that it has been lent to Glasgow by London. I ask the right hon. Gentleman to assure me that that is not. so and that definite progress is being made with respect to the balloon barrage system in our area. I have continually believed, against the scepticism of many of my friends, that the balloon barrage is one of the most effective weapons of defence for the ports and shipyards of Glasgow, which would be an essential food centre for the rest of the country. I trust that this story can be refuted to-night by the right hon. Gentleman and that we may be assured that definite progress is being made.<br/>
When first I received this disquieting information I said to my friend: "One cannot wonder, because I understand that only English contractors are operating in Scotland and until the Air Ministry decide to give Scottish contractors the benefit of using the opportunities which they have of being on the spot and having labour and organisation available, this state of chaos is bound to occur in national defence." I would take the opportunity of thanking the right hon. Gentleman for the invitation he extended to us with regard to the Air Forces of Scotland, and to say that we shall be very glad to have information


to-night with regard to the progress and expenditure that are taking place in Scotland. I understand that the Defence Departments have realised for some time that Scotland is still a part of the British Empire, and that it would be dangerous to neglect the Defence Services there. I trust that I can be assured that some considerable part of this money is being expended in maintaining progress in regard to the defences of the northern part of the country. I would also like some assurance that the Auxiliary Force will be open to men who in many ways can give special service to the nation in this respect. I have seen one or two applications from men who were well fitted but who have been rejected on grounds which I cannot but regard as rather flimsy. I trust that this expenditure will result in an opening up of the Auxiliary Force to men whose capabilities will ensure their becoming useful members of that Force.</p>

<p>As has been said before, the right hon. Gentleman has had a very easy time during the last four or five months, in that he has not been questioned very much in this House as to what has been happening. I am not going to question him very much, but there are one or two points on which I should like some information. The right hon. Gentleman is asking for a good deal more money, and I should like to know a little more about what is happening at Cranwell. Cranwell is a sort of Sandhurst for the Air Force, but, as far as I can make out, it is not the policy at the present time to extend the number of entries into Cranwell for training as officers. The Air Force is, as the Minister said, being greatly expanded, and we want to know that the fabric is being built on a sound basis. The number of officers now demanded is out of all proportion to the number still at Cranwell. Is the Minister satisfied that the right method is being followed, and with the present extension of the granting of short-service commissions to people who merely have flying experience, with no experience as officers or of any responsible position?<br/>
I am not going to join issue with the hon. Member for North Aberdeen (Mr. Garro Jones) on the question of the

balloon barrage. I notice that the right hon. Gentleman says that we have a great many things in store for the bomber, but no doubt when he visits a bombing squadron he says that the bomber is going to get through into other countries. There is no doubt that in the future all defence against air attack is going to be of a nature which will be unknown to any of us until the actual facts appear, as everyone hopes they will not.</p>

<p>I cannot help contrasting the interest which was aroused among Conservative Members by the House of Commons Members Fund Bill and the interest displayed now. I feel mystified over these proceedings. If I understand aright, we are being asked to vote &#x00A3;100, and if we do the Air Ministry will be able to spend &#x00A3;40,000,000. I am trying to buy a car on the instalment system, and this makes my mouth water. I think we are entitled to protest against the magnitude of the sums which we are being asked to vote so hurriedly and at so late an hour. For "aircraft and balloons" the original Estimate was &#x00A3;93,000,000 odd and the revised Estimate is &#x00A3;107,000,000 &#x2014; an increase of &#x00A3;14,000,000. I think it a great mistake to bracket aircraft and balloons in that manner. Undoubtedly the greater amount of the expenditure is due to aircraft. It would give us a clearer picture if there were some dissection. We have had a great deal of publicity about the balloon barrage; in fact, I remember two remarkable photographs last year of the Secretary for Air. One showed him shaking hands with a <i>gendarme</i> at Monte Carlo. I was never able quite to understand why it was calculated to promote confidence in our defences, but it was a good photograph. I remember another which showed him crawling inside one of the balloons of the balloon barrage. That was very interesting indeed. I have always wondered what he saw when he got inside, but I do not know that these things have increased my confidence in the efficacy of the balloon barrage, which I am rather inclined to regard as eyewash. But, assuming that it is a good thing for London, I should be glad to know when it is to be extended to some of our provincial centres, which are equally in need of protection.


I would invite the Committee to look at page 8 of the Supplementary Estimate, to sec the enormous sums with which we are dealing in this hurried fashion at this time of night. There is a heading "Works, buildings and lands." A great many pertinent questions have been asked in this House recently about the purchase of land. Some very disquieting figures have been brought to light by the purchases of land, and here we have these Estimates. The original Estimate totalled &#x00A3;44,820,000 and the revised Estimate, &#x00A3;60,820,000. I notice that the &#x00A3;820,000 seems to correspond in a remarkable way but there is an increase of &#x00A3;16,000,000. In these days of astronomical estimates, when these enormous sums of money that we are borrowing may never be repaid, naturally one says, "What does it matter if we shove on a few more noughts?" But even in these days a sum of &#x00A3;60,820,000, involving an increase in the original Estimate of &#x00A3;16,000,000, is worth a little attention from this Committee, yet we are asked to deal with it in a few minutes at this late hour of the night, when a little intervention on the subject is possibly slightly resented by Members who would like to get home to bed.<br/>
There is only one other point to which I would like to call attention, and here I really would ask the Under-Secretary for a little information, because I think that some of it might be of an interesting nature. On page 9 we find the item for Women's Auxiliary Air Force. The original Estimate on this account was &#x00A3;3,800, but the revised Estimate is &#x00A3;18,800, an increase of &#x00A3;15,000. I imagine that hon. Members of this House probably find in their experience that women do become a little more expensive. The Minister must expect it when he embarks upon this sort of thing. Here is the Air Minister reaping the experience with which most hon. Members are familiar, that whereas he thought that he was going to get these ladies for &#x00A3;3,000, they have, in fact, cost him &#x00A3;18,000, which is &#x00A3;15,000 more than he expected. Perhaps the Under-Secretary will be able to afford the Committee some explanation.</p>

<p>I will endeavour in as short a space of time as possible to satisfy hon. Members who have asked questions on the Supplementary Estimate.

The hon. Member for Lichfield (Mr. Poole) asked about the local rates of wages paid to civilian employ&#x00E9;s at the Cannock Chase Camp, and wanted to know whether the rate which he quoted was considered to be adequate. He also said that he had not given specific notice that he was going to raise the question, so he will not expect me to deal with specific figures when I tell him and the Committee that the principle that we adopt for the payment of civilian employ&#x00E9;s is to pay the local rates applicable for the particular sort of work in the district, and, further, that there is machinery for revision periodically, and when representations are received as to whether the rates that are being paid are comparable with those that are paid in the district. The hon. Member asked my right hon. Friend a question on this subject a short time ago, and if my memory serves me rightly, my right hon. Friend said that, if the hon.

<p>I can assure the hon. Member that my Department and my right hon. Friend will see that the matter is dealt with expeditiously. The hon. Member for North Aberdeen (Mr. Garro Jones) raised the question of balloon barrage efficiency and asked me whether I was satisfied as to the value of the balloon barrage. I can give him an affirmative answer, and I may say that the same opinion is held by those who have a far greater knowledge of these matters&#x2014; the Air Staff. I can assure the hon. Member and the Committee that the Air Staff think highly of the efficacy of the balloon barrage, and that our experience up to date has not in any way disappointed our hopes. The hon. Member asked questions about cable thicknesses, which I would not go into. He also asked why it was necessary to have centralised stores in an industrial area. He did not specifically say what particular stores he was referring to nor what area, but I would inform him that the balloon barrage is essential to form a protection for industrial districts, and! therefore, in each particular area we need a depot to serve the barrage for that


particular area. The hon. Member also asked me about counter balloon barrage measures. My reply is that these matters are entirely confidential. He said he wondered whether all information did reach him. Let me give him an assurance that all information on this subject has not reached him.<br/>
The hon. Member for Berwick-on-Tweed (Sir H. Seely) asked me about Cranwell and whether that establishment was being increased in relation to the large growth of our Air Force. The Cranwell establishment has been increased. The intake of cadets this year is materially greater than last year, but we have to guard against increasing the number of permanent careers in the Air Force beyond the point at which we can safeguard careers for these officers right up to their age of retirement. Our Air Force is largely an expanding one and we have candidates from among short service officers, candidates from aircraft apprentices and from the ranks, candidates from the universities and from the Dominions as well as from Cranwell, and if we increase the numbers from one class we must proportionately increase others; and we are doing this.</p>

<p>I will try to let the hon.

I can give him an assurance that definite progress is being made, according to our plans, with the equipment, personnel and buildings for the barrage in Glasgow.

able number of months ago has, up to date, only one balloon, and that balloon has been lent to them from London. I ask specifically and definitely whether that is true.</p>

<p>The hon. Member has given me no notice of that particular question, so I do not think he can expect me to say whether the balloon barrage in Glasgow has merely got the practice balloon, which is sent to all barrages, or something more. It may have its complete number of personnel and may have its total equipment issued within, perhaps, a period of one week. You may have a barrage squadron with only one balloon and next week it may have its complete equipment.</p>

<p>I am sorry to intervene again, but the hon. and gallant Gentleman stated that the balloon barrage system in Scotland was in a satisfactory state of progress. Is it the opinion of the Air Ministry that a balloon barrage system instituted many months ago and not having one balloon is in a satisfactory state?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1939-07-25a.1424.2" speakerid="unknown" speakername="Captain Balfour" colnum="1424" time="16:35:00">
<p>The hon. Gentleman should be a little more careful in trying to repeat what I said. I said the balloon barrage in Scotland was progressing satisfactorily according to our plans. I may tell him that the date is not yet due for the Glasgow balloon barrage to be completed, but I have no reason to think that it will not be completed by the planned date, and there is no question of its lagging behind. I can assure the hon. Member that it will be completed by the time that we have planned for it so to be.</p>

<p>My right hon. Friend says he mentioned it in his Estimates speech. The date for the final completion of the provincial barrage is the end of this year, but actually it will be largely complete about September of this year.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1939-07-25a.1424.6" speakerid="unknown" speakername="Captain Balfour" colnum="1424" time="16:35:00">
<p>Let me at once answer the hon. and gallant Gentleman that not one effective balloon has been taken from London, but what we have tried to do while we are building up the organisation


of these provincial barrages is to give each unit a practice balloon in order that the men may be taught to handle the balloons so that when their equipment comes in full they are ready to handle it. The hon. Member for Maryhill also asked me about the progress of air defence expenditure in Scotland. We do not segregate the expenditure on Scotland for air defence in relation to that for England, but I can assure Scotland that it is getting full value as regards the plans for the air defence of the essential ports and cities of Scotland, and if there were in our national budgets a division as between Scotland and England it might be found that Scotland was winning.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1939-07-25a.1425.0" speakerid="unknown" speakername="Mr. Davidson" colnum="1425" time="16:35:00">
<p>I think the hon. and gallant Gentleman has misunderstood my point. A certain expenditure was allowed us in the Estimates with regard, for instance, to Wick and the training schools, and how much of that expenditure has been spent up to date? Can we have an indication as to whether the progress of the work is satisfactory?</p>

<p>If the hon. Gentleman is asking for specific items of Vote 4, works buildings, I cannot tell him without going through the complete Schedule, except to say that so far as I know works and buildings in Scotland are progressing well. If the hon. Gentleman will look at the growth of Vote 4 he will realise the tremendous task which has been undertaken by the Air Ministry in the construction of these preparations. finally, I was asked about the Women's Air Force. I cannot answer that without notice, and I would like to make this final comment on the statement of the hon. and gallant Gentleman the Member for Nuneaton (Commander Fletcher). He commented upon the magnitude of the totals. I agree that they are tremendous. But I do think that this is an indication of the money needed for expenditure on a rapidly growing force both in personnel, equipment and works and buildings. I have done my best to answer the specific questions which have been put to me, and I hope the Committee will not grudge voting this vast sum of money, because it is needed and is being well spent.</p>

<p>I only want to point out that whereas at an earlier stage hon. Members on these benches satsilent im-

patiently waiting for the debate on a small domestic matter to pass in order that we might discuss these important matters of Defence, now that we have reached these important topics the Debate has been wholly conducted by hon. Members on these benches while Government supporters have sat in silence like a dumb friends' league of the Government. They have shown no interest in the Defence of the country. Hon. Members opposite have sat in sullen and ignorant silence. I am sure that the Under-Secretary will give His Majesty's Opposition credit once more for pressing forward the Government to make provision for a more effective defence of the country and a removal of the many neglects of the past.</p>
