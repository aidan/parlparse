Let us remember that it was the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s former friend, the right hon. Alan Milburn, who panned the former Connexions service as being patchy and inefficient.

	<p pid="b.3.3/1">We have had a large number of representations about the potential effect of the English baccalaureate on religious education in schools. We are carrying out our own work to assess the extent of the changes that schools are making from next year, and we shall continue to monitor the take-up of all subjects and the associated staffing implications. Religious education remains a vital subject that it is compulsory for all schools to teach through to the age of 16.</p>

	<p pid="b.3.4/1">I have been lobbying the Government on this issue for some months now. The schools Minister has repeatedly asked for evidence to back up claims that excluding RE from the E-bac will have a negative impact on take-up and teaching provision. Last week, a report by the National Association of Teachers of Religious Education, based on evidence from half of all state schools in England, showed that a quarter of schools are not providing statutory RE for 14 to 16-year-olds. Will the Minister address the issue, now that we have the proof?</p>

	<p pid="b.3.5/1">The NATRE study cited by my hon. Friend suggests that around one in six schools anticipate a drop in religious studies entries at GCSE related to the E-bac, but it is not clear what overall effect that might have on take-up. Well over half of schools specifically indicated in that survey that there would not be a drop in GCSE entries in RS; indeed, a proportion said that there would be an increase in entries. That bears out the fact that the English baccalaureate does not prevent any school from offering RS GCSEs, and RE remains a statutory part of the curriculum.</p>

	<p pid="b.3.6/1">I do not know whether you are a fan of films of the &#8216;80s, Mr Speaker, but you might remember one called &#8220;Back to the Future&#8221;. It starred a man called Michael who was trapped in the 1950s&#8212;an echo, perhaps, of someone else in modern politics. Ministers are hopelessly stuck in the past: they drop work experience at key stage 4 and promote Latin</p>
	<p pid="b.3.6/2">above engineering, ICT and RE, yet we know religious education helps young people understand the world today.

	<p pid="b.4.0/1">We do not collect the figure centrally. We will see the effect of the English baccalaureate when we see the GCSE results this year, next year and the year after that. If the right hon. Gentleman wants a modern curriculum, he should be aware that we need modern languages to be taught in our schools. Under his watch, the numbers entering for GCSE in modern languages plummeted from 79% in the year 2000 to just 43% last year, while the proportion taking geography fell from 44% in 1997 to 27% last year. The range of subjects in the English baccalaureate is mirrored elsewhere in modern emerging economies such as Singapore, France, Japan and Alberta. [Hon. Members: &#8220;Alberta?&#8221;] In Canada. Those are the most successful education jurisdictions.</p>

	<p pid="b.4.1/1">It is just not good enough that the Minister does not know about the impact his policies are having on student choices in schools. In my constituency, about 30% of young people are opting for the English bac; what does the Minister have to say to the other 70% who have chosen not to do it? RE teachers, music teachers and art teachers are at risk of redundancy because of the English baccalaureate. No wonder nine faith leaders wrote to <i>The Daily Telegraph</i>this weekend to say that they were</p>

	<p pid="b.4.2/1">If we were to take advice from the right hon. Gentleman, we would have a cap on aspiration for young people from the most disadvantaged backgrounds. He should be ashamed of the fact that his Government left this Government a legacy whereby only 8% of pupils on free school meals were even entered for the English baccalaureate subjects, and these are subjects that the Russell group of universities regards as the facilitating subjects that give rise to progression. Only 4% of those pupils actually achieved the results in comparison with 15.6% nationally. The right hon. Gentleman had a cap on aspiration; we want to raise aspiration right across the abilities and backgrounds of young people.</p>

The Children&#8217;s Society report, which was published today, makes even more harrowing reading and reminds us of the urgency of the task. According to the report, children as young as eight are subjected to sexual exploitation, which is completely unacceptable.</p>

The Select Committee report was about services beyond the school day for young people aged between 13 and 25, yet the press release focused almost solely on the national citizens service, which is for 16-year-olds. We are running pilots this year. The purpose of pilots is to see how things work, and in this case to ensure we get value for money and the biggest bang for our buck so that as many of our 16-year-olds as possible will benefit from this wonderful scheme in years to come.

Youth service provision is very patchy across the country and needs to be modernised, and some youth services departments do not take on board what local people actually need. Above all, we must ensure that we involve all the relevant sectors and people&#8212;the voluntary and business sectors, youth workers and, most importantly, young people themselves, who are often not included in consultations on the services we provide for them.

That used to happen when I was at school under a Mr Herbert, although one could say that my ending up as a Member of Parliament does not suggest the best careers advice.</p>

	<p pid="b.14.4/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that answer. One of the great achievements of the last Conservative Government was ensuring that every child learned some British history before leaving school, but some academies are now designing alternative curricula for pupils who will not achieve a C grade in the English baccalaureate, which may mean that they do not study history at all&#8212;at secondary school at least.

	<p pid="b.14.5/1">I agree with my hon. and learned Friend about the importance of teaching history in schools, particularly British history, and we know that teachers share this view. Having the flexibility for teachers to be imaginative in how they design the curriculum within a broad and balanced context is a key feature of the academies programme, and the improvements we have seen in academies&#8217; GCSE results suggests that this approach is working well among academies. However, we hope and expect that the curriculum review will deliver a high-quality national curriculum that academies will wish to adopt. It is important that we do not limit aspiration, as my hon. and learned Friend has said, and that is why we will be publishing data specifically about the GCSE results of lower-attaining students on a school-by-school basis.</p>

	<p pid="b.14.6/1">Can the Minister confirm that the most recent Ofsted report stated that the decline in the teaching of British history was a myth?

	<p pid="b.17.6/1">I am very aware of the difficulties that many families face in accessing suitable child care, which is one of the reasons why we announced last week that we will consult on a more flexible arrangement for adopting the free entitlement so that families can access it a little earlier and a little later in the day, for example. That is exactly why we extended the free entitlement to 15 hours.</p>

	<p pid="b.18.0/1">I thank the Secretary of State for his answer. He recently mentioned that there were about 200 failing primary schools in this country, which is a shocking statistic. Although there is no list, I believe that Shelthorpe primary school in my constituency is one of them. When judging whether a school is failing, what allowances are made for pupils with moderate learning difficulties, cases of social deprivation, cases involving social care and the number of free school meals? Also, the school&#8217;s head teacher has asked me to invite the Secretary of State to visit the school.</p>

	<p pid="b.18.1/1">I am grateful for my hon. Friend&#8217;s question. We specifically take into account not just raw attainment, but the level of progress that children are making in school in order to ensure that any judgment is properly contextualised. The 200 weakest schools are those that have been below floor standards for five years. Let me be clear: that means that more than 40% of students leaving those schools over the past four years have been incapable of reading, writing or adding up to an acceptable level. We absolutely need to take action where schools are failing and where communities are aware that those schools are not performing as well as they should be. I hope that Members on both sides of the House will recognise that such action is necessary.</p>

	<p pid="b.18.3/1">It is vital to ensure that we have an accurate picture of the schools that are most in need of capital funding. One of the unfortunate consequences of decisions made by the previous Government is that in about 2006 we stopped collecting data at a national level on the state of school buildings, which means that we do not have an accurate picture of the schools that are most in need. The hon. Lady makes a very good case for a school in her constituency, which I know she represents effectively, but we have to look at the picture in the round.</p>

Mothers who want to travel with their child would have to pay for that, assuming that public transport was available. This is a complete scandal. Surely the ridiculous limits on the size of primary schools imposed by the Labour party need to be reconsidered, and before the beginning of next term.</p>

	<p pid="b.18.5/2">complex and bureaucratic and which effectively rations places in good and popular schools. That is why we are consulting on simpler and fairer admissions systems. The key point is that there are simply not enough good school places, so it was absurd that it was not possible before to raise the number of places in good schools. Increasing the flexibility to do so is therefore a major part of the new admissions code.</p>

	Open Public Services White Paper
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-07-11b.25.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40648" speakername="Oliver Letwin" speakeroffice="The Minister of State, Cabinet Office"  colnum="25"  time="015:32:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110711/debtext/110711-0001.htm#11071115000540">
	<p pid="b.25.1/1">With permission, Mr Speaker, I would like to make a statement about the open public services White Paper.</p>
	<p pid="b.25.1/2">There could not be a more important issue than this. Public services save lives, rescue people from disease and ignorance, and protect people from crime and poverty. Much of what is done by our public services is fantastic and they are among the best in the world, but we can do even better. This Government have a vision, which is set out in this White Paper, about how we can do better.</p>
	<p pid="b.25.1/3">The central point is that when public services are not up to scratch, those who are well off can pay for substitutes, but for those who are not well off, there is no opportunity to pay for substitutes. We need to give everybody the same choice in and power over the services they receive that well-off people already have. This White Paper sets out how we will put that vision of choice and power for all into practice.</p>
	<p pid="b.25.1/4">Our principles are clear. They are choice, decentralisation, diversity, fair access and accountability. We will increase choice wherever possible; power will be decentralised to the lowest appropriate level; public services will be open to a diverse range of providers; we will ensure that there is fair access and fair funding for all; and services will be accountable to users and taxpayers.</p>
	<p pid="b.25.1/5">I will give examples of how those principles will apply in specific public services that cater for specific individuals. First, we will ensure that every adult receiving social care has an individual, personal budget by 2013, and we are moving towards personal budgets in chronic health care, for children with special needs, and in housing for vulnerable people. That means that there will be more choice and power for people who need those services. They will be able to choose what their money and the taxpayer&#8217;s money is spent on.</p>
	<p pid="b.25.1/6">Secondly, we are making funding follow the pupil in schools, the student in further education, the child in child care and the patient in the NHS. That means that there will be more choice and power for people who need those services. They will be able to choose where the money is spent.</p>
	<p pid="b.25.1/7">Thirdly, we are providing fair access so that, for example, a pupil premium follows pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds and a health premium is paid to the local authorities that achieve the greatest improvements in public health for people in the least healthy parts of the country. We attach huge importance to that agenda. We want genuine equality of opportunity and genuine social mobility.</p>
	<p pid="b.25.1/8">Fourthly, we are providing open access to data so that people can make informed choices about the services they use, such as crime maps, so that people can see whether the local police are preventing crime in their street; health outcomes, so that people can see which hospitals and GPs achieve the best results; standardised satisfaction data for all public services, so that people can see exactly which service providers are providing the quality of service they want; and open, real-time data on road conditions, speeds and accidents along our motorways, so that people can make informed choices.</p>
	<p pid="b.25.1/9">Fifthly, we will provide a new system of redress, through beefed-up powers of the ombudsmen to step in when a choice to which people have a right is denied. However, we are going further than that. We are not only concerned about increased choice and power for individuals, we are also determined to increase choice and power for communities so that they can determine how money is spent on their communal public services. We will do that by making it far easier for communities to take over and run public assets and assets of community value, by giving them the right to build houses for their own children and by giving parish councils and community groups the right to challenge, enabling them to take over local services and making it easier for people to form neighbourhood councils where there are none at present. We will also give neighbourhoods vastly more power to determine their own neighbourhood planning and the ability to challenge the local police at beat meetings, informed by crime maps. Let us remember that the people at those meetings will each be electors of the local police commissioner.</p>
	<p pid="b.25.1/10">We recognise, of course, that some services will inevitably continue to be commissioned centrally, or by various levels of local government. Here, too, we are aiming at decentralisation, diversity and accountability. The White Paper sets out how we will use payment by results to transform welfare to work, the rehabilitation of offenders, drug and alcohol recovery, help for children in the foundation years and support for vulnerable adults. In all those areas, a diverse range of providers will be given a huge incentive to provide the social gains that our society so desperately needs by being rewarded for getting people into work, out of crime, off drugs and alcohol and into the opportunities that most of us take for granted.</p>
	<p pid="b.25.1/11">To strengthen accountability, the White Paper also sets out the most radical programme of transparency for Government and the public sector anywhere in the world. To unlock innovation, the White Paper commits us to diversity of provision, removing barriers to entry, stimulating entry by new types of provider and unlocking new sources of capital. To ensure that public sector providers can hold their own on a level playing field, the White Paper sets out measures to liberate public sector bodies from red tape.</p>
	<p pid="b.25.1/12">To encourage employee ownership within the public services, the White Paper sets out the measures that we are taking to promote mutualisation and employee co-operatives. To ensure that services continue if particular service providers fail, it sets out the principles for the continuity regimes that we are establishing service by service. <i>[Interruption.] </i>Marxist or not Marxist, in the past 13 months this Government have done more to increase choice and power for those served by our public services than the Labour party achieved in 13 years. The White Paper describes the comprehensive, consistent, coherent approach that we are taking to keep our public services moving in the direction of increased choice and power for service users, so that we can provide access to excellence for all. That is the aim behind the White Paper, and I commend it to the House.</p>

	<p pid="b.26.0/1">I thank the right hon. Gentleman for his courtesy in providing me with a copy of his statement ahead of time. I have to say that although I believe absolutely his</p>
	<p pid="b.26.0/2">sincerity in what he has told the House, his comparison with the Labour Government wins the parliamentary prize for blooming cheek, if that is not unparliamentary language. I would rather rely on the judgment of Reform, the right-of-centre think tank, about these proposals. It states:</p>
	<p pid="b.26.0/3">&#8220;The Coalition may argue that these inconsistencies&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.26.0/4">in the White Paper</p>
	<p pid="b.26.0/5">&#8220;are good politics. In fact they are bad politics because they undermine confidence that the Government is serious about reform.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.26.0/6">That is the problem, because there is nothing new in this White Paper.</p>
	<p pid="b.26.0/7">Today&#8217;s statement is typical of the Government&#8217;s approach to policy in general. As the right hon. Gentleman reflected, our public services, on which people of all ages in our country depend and which are often the determinant of whether their life is worth living, face significant challenges, particularly at the hands of the Tory-led coalition, which is making cuts too far and too fast. People live much longer and have ever-rising expectations, but it appears from the way in which this White Paper was launched that the Cabinet Office is more preoccupied with spin and presentation than in substantive proposals.</p>
	<p pid="b.26.0/8">The White Paper contains few new ideas and even fewer new proposals. In most of the cases to which the right hon. Gentleman referred, the Government are lagging behind the action of the previous Labour Government. He referred to personal budgets. <i>The Sunday Times</i> was told several weeks ago that the right to a personal budget, which is now used by approximately 250,000 adults, was to be extended to those with long-term conditions and to children with special needs, yet there is nothing of that in the White Paper. The right hon. Gentleman also referred to the expansion of mutuals, which was also showcased in a variety of this weekend&#8217;s newspapers. Back in November, the Minister for the Cabinet Office and Paymaster General undertook to put in place rights to provide for public sector workers, meaning that they could take over the running of services, but no time scale for such proposals has been forthcoming.</p>
	<p pid="b.26.0/9">Ahead of today&#8217;s White Paper, I set out three tests for public service reform. First, will the reforms make services more accountable and responsive to the needs of service users? Secondly, will there be clear accountability for how public money is spent, and will members of the public be protected? Thirdly and finally, will the proposals strengthen the bonds of family and community life?</p>
	<p pid="b.26.0/10">The Government are failing the test of reform, because their policies are inconsistent between Departments and sometimes within them, and nothing more has been done to put communities in control or to make people more powerful.</p>
	<p pid="b.26.0/11">My questions to the Minister, therefore, are these. Given that this much-trumpeted and much-awaited White Paper has not even caught up with the legacy of the previous Labour Government, who deleted the ambition from it: the officials or the Liberal Democrats? What are the plans for millions of people to become their own bosses, as was set out in the coalition document? What assurance does he give to those workers that there will be continuity of pensions and employment benefits?</p>
	<p pid="b.26.0/12">When will the coalition Government exceed and expand the proposals already put in place for personal budgets by the previous Labour Government? He may have received private advice that hospitals and schools should be allowed to fail, but will he make it absolutely clear, and publicly, that he will not allow that to happen? In the funding of those new services, will he also rule out competition by price?</p>
	<p pid="b.26.0/13">To return to reform, viewed as a whole, the Government&#8217;s public service reform policies are all over the place. The Government&#8217;s failure to adhere consistently to their principles gives an air of unreality to the whole programme. The losers will not be the Members of this House, or even members of the Government, but the millions of people up and down the country whose quality of life depends on the public services that they use.</p>

	<p pid="b.28.0/1">I am grateful to the right hon. Lady for her critique, but I think she has to decide whether her objection is that the White Paper does not do as many of the things that the previous Labour Government were doing already&#8212;that was part of what she seemed to be arguing&#8212;or that the proposals will do damage. If she is maintaining both positions, she must be admitting that the Labour Government did great damage, which I doubt is what she wants to admit.</p>
	<p pid="b.28.0/2">To some degree, the White Paper continues where the previous Labour Government left off&#8212;they did some things that we think were good and which we are carrying through, evolving and developing. That is a sensible and, I hope the House will agree, grown-up way of conducting politics because not everything our opponents think or do is necessarily wrong. However, the White Paper carries the previous Government&#8217;s programme much further, deeper and wider to deal with the very questions that the right hon. Lady addressed. For example, under the previous Administration, there was no proper system for continuity of service. One reason for the problems with Southern Cross&#8212;a legacy issue left by the previous Government&#8212;is that the previous Government did not design proper continuity-of-service regimes for the health and social care services. We are now attempting to design such regimes for all services. I hope that on mature reflection she will welcome that.</p>
	<p pid="b.28.0/3">The right hon. Lady asked whether we would accept competition by price, which we have made abundantly clear we will not accept, including in the NHS. We want competition by quality, which is very different, although I assume she would agree that it makes sense to accept competition partly by price when trying, as the Government are doing, to tender through central procurement. That is certainly something that the previous Government did all the time. There are differences here, but they do not amount to inconsistencies; they amount to a coherent attempt to apply a set of principles differently in different services precisely because different services demand different treatments. She must know that. If she is claiming that much of this depends on what the Labour Government did, I would point out that they certainly did different things in different places. The White Paper is about carrying forward a programme that will benefit those using public services by giving them choice and power.</p>

	<p pid="b.28.1/1">May I congratulate my right hon. Friend on basing his reforms on the admirable principles of choice and of</p>
	<p pid="b.28.1/2">giving people the information to make informed choices and, where possible, a diversity of providers to choose between? Choice is good not only for the people making the choice, but for the vast majority who will not exercise that choice but will see the quality of services rise under the influence of choice. However, may I caution him about trying to shoe-horn too many services under one elegant, all-embracing umbrella? Experience shows that it is better to do it section by section, service by service, because the real world is never as elegant as one&#8217;s intellectual constructions.</p>

	<p pid="b.29.0/1">I entirely agree with my right hon. Friend, which is why the White Paper specifically makes clear not only that we will treat individual services differently from community services and services commissioned centrally, but that we will take each service on its own merits and design a regime that applies the general principles differently. That is clearly the right way to go. However, his point is vital. The purpose of giving choice and power to individuals and communities is not just to benefit the particular individuals making the choices; it is to benefit everybody by ensuring that those choices are brought to bear in a way that improves services for all.</p>

	<p pid="b.29.1/1">The right hon. Gentleman will know that I am a long-standing supporter of decentralisation and involving more local people in their public services. His White Paper and previous statements have made much of involving social enterprises and charities and the third sector in the provision of public services. On that basis, will he confirm that there will be an asset lock when services are transferred, particularly to social enterprises, to ensure that the organisations carrying out these services are genuine social enterprises? If he really means what he says, why have 90% of major contracts for the Work programme gone to big companies such as Serco, Capita and G4S, leaving the social enterprise sector and charities to pick up the crumbs from the table?</p>

	<p pid="b.29.2/1">In answer to the right hon. Lady&#8217;s first point, I would say that when assets are being transferred provision needs to be made to ensure that they are there for the public good and on a permanent basis. We intend to do that in every case in which it applies. On her point about the Work programme, I think she is missing a vital component of what the Minister of State, Department for Work and Pensions, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40250" name="Chris Grayling">the Member for Epsom and Ewell (Chris Grayling)</phrase>, who has responsibility for employment, has done. It is a textbook case: he was concerned that not all the bids would come from consortia in the voluntary and community sector&#8212;only a few did&#8212;so he took steps to create a protocol relating the prime contractor to the subcontractors, as a result of which the prime contractors have to treat properly the small voluntary and community bodies that in many cases are also the subcontractors. We desperately need&#8212;and intend&#8212;to get that into the mainstream of how the Government go about business.</p>

	<p pid="b.29.3/2">who use them and pay for them, we will have to learn the new discipline of telling sometimes uncomfortable truths about those areas in which public services do not live up to the standards that we all want to see?

	<p pid="b.30.0/1">I completely agree with my right hon. Friend that glasnost has to precede and accompany perestroika; we cannot have reconstruction, or proper choice, without transparency. That is why we have put in place exactly what he recommends&#8212;namely, a transparency regime that will in many cases cause difficulties and embarrassments for the Government. That will be worth bearing, however, to achieve real improvement. I shall give my right hon. Friend an example. In the past, there were many people, not only Labour Members but among the public at large, who said that crime maps would have no real effect and that no one would be interested in them. However, millions of people have now started using crime maps. When we also give those people the right to use beat meetings and make them electors of locally elected police commissioners, we shall be transferring power from the central state out to the people who are being served. That is a very powerful combination.</p>

I do not think that the last Labour Government would ever have accused themselves of trying to privatise everything in sight. If the Opposition are saying that the White Paper continues measures that the last Labour Government were doing, they cannot possibly accuse us of trying to privatise everything in sight. Nor would it be sensible to privatise everything in that way. The White Paper makes it absolutely clear throughout that we are neutral as between public sector providers, voluntary sector providers, community groups, mutuals, co-operatives and the private sector. I hope that we will eventually get over this absurd ideological divide, because we want something very simple&#8212;namely, the best service for the person who is using it. We do not care who provides the best service; we just want to ensure that the best service is always available and that people have a choice between providers so that they can get it.

	<p pid="b.31.0/1">I am delighted to help out my hon. Friend and Dorset colleague on this. What he says is absolutely true: there was a vast increase in spending on public services during the last Government. Alas, the improvements in the outcomes were not as great as the inputs. That is precisely what we are trying to tackle, and we are doing it in an age-old way, by introducing innovation and diversity of supply, as well as choice and power for the people using the services, so that there is real pressure on all providers to improve. We need continuous pressure for improvement and continuous transparency on whether the services are improving, as well as a continuous ability for people who find a service being provided better elsewhere to choose the best service.

	<p pid="b.31.1/1">Most of the examples that the Minister has given are devolved, although he did mention welfare to work.

	<p pid="b.31.2/1">Yes, in the sense that this White Paper sets out a programme not to enforce diversity of provision, but to enable it. If the community wishes to leave a particular service that is provided by only one provider where it is, that will be for the community to judge. If the community believes that in some cases it is worth having a diversity of suppliers, that is what the community will be able to do. I am speaking now about areas that are mainly devolved, as the hon. Gentleman said; hence, I am speaking about England. I leave it to him and his colleagues to deal with those in Scotland. In the case of the Work programme, there is a diversity of suppliers; indeed, there had to be, in order to create competitive pressure to ensure that those who succeed also succeed in being paid, and that those who do not succeed are quickly replaced by those who will, because it is a payment-by-results programme and the aim is to get people back to work. We want the providers that are best at getting people back to work to be those that remain in business.</p>

	<p pid="b.31.3/1">I welcome my right hon. Friend&#8217;s statement and the excellent White Paper, which lays such emphasis on choice for individuals in the type of public services they wish to have. Does he agree that we cannot say that we are in favour of choice and then insist that a particular service be run by a monopolistic local authority?

	<p pid="b.32.0/1">My hon. Friend is right that we have to maintain consistency. If we are going to achieve real choice and real power for those who are served by public services, we have to allow for diversity of provision and to be on our guard always to ensure that those who can enter the market are able to do so. That is one reason why the White Paper contains specific provisions for redress where particular providers find that they are being kept out of the market. One of the techniques that we are using for doing that was developed by the previous Government. The competition and co-operation panel and its rules, which were set up by the last Labour Government, will apply in the NHS. That is the right kind of system, and we need to replicate it in a whole series of other domains where diverse providers currently have no redress if they are prevented from entering the market.</p>

	<p pid="b.32.2/1">The right hon. Gentleman is too much of an expert to need me to tell him this, but I will tell him because he asks for it. We have, of course, established a two-level system. For most planning decisions, we hope that the neighbourhood will take charge by engaging in neighbourhood planning. We believe that the incentives that we have built into the financial system&#8212;including the ability to get a meaningful proportion of the community infrastructure levy paid to the neighbourhood if it has more housing and development in its area&#8212;will lead neighbourhoods on the whole to prefer development. The presumption of sustainable development means that their neighbourhood plans will have to include development of an appropriate kind in order to pass muster. There will be an assessment of local housing need that contributes to that, which plans will have to observe.</p>
	<p pid="b.32.2/2">However, nobody is going to pretend in our Government, any more than in the right hon. Gentleman&#8217;s Government, that any neighbourhood will welcome a nuclear power station just next to it or a railway line running straight through it. Of course there will be objections in those cases, which is why we have maintained and democratised the very system that he and his colleagues set up&#8212;because they, too, operated a two-level system&#8212;in order to accelerate planning applications for major pieces of national infrastructure. There is no disagreement between us and the right hon. Gentleman on that, and there is no reason for him to invent one.</p>

Part of the reason for that is lack of innovation. In the most effective services across the world, there is continuous innovation, and that often comes from new small entrants. That is why the thrust of the White Paper is to promote and enlarge the scope for new entrants with new ideas to create innovations and more productive methods of doing things, which will, of course, result in the public&#8217;s money being used better in providing the services people want.</p>

	<p pid="b.39.3/1">Mr Speaker, the events of last week shocked the nation. Our proud tradition of journalism, which for centuries has bravely held those in positions of power to account, was shaken by the revelation of what we now know to have happened at the <i>News of the World</i>. The perpetrators of those acts not only broke the law, but preyed on the grief of families who had lost loved ones either as a result of foul murders or giving their life for their country. I hope that the law shows no mercy to those responsible and no mercy to any managers who condoned such appalling behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="b.39.3/2">As a result of what happened, the Prime Minister last week announced two independent inquiries to examine what went wrong and recommend to the Government how we can make sure that it never happens again. The first will be a full, judge-led, public inquiry into the original police investigation. Witnesses will be questioned under oath and no stone will be left unturned. As the Prime Minister announced on Friday, that inquiry will need to answer the following questions. Why did the first police investigation fail? What exactly was going on at the <i>News of the World</i> <i>,</i> and what was going on at other newspapers? The bulk of the work of this inquiry can happen only after the police investigation has finished, but we will start what we can now.</p>
	<p pid="b.39.3/3">The second will be a separate inquiry to look at the culture, practices and ethics of the British press. In particular, it will look at how our newspapers are regulated and make recommendations for the future. That inquiry should start as soon as possible, ideally this summer. As the Prime Minister said, a free press is an essential component of our democracy and our way of life, but press freedom does not mean that the press should be above the law and in announcing this inquiry the Prime Minister has invited views on the way the press should be regulated in the future.</p>
	<p pid="b.39.3/4">I also have to make a decision about News Corporation&#8217;s plans to buy the shares it does not already own in BSkyB. I know that colleagues on both sides of the House and the public at home feel very concerned at the prospect of the organisation that allegedly allowed these terrible things to happen being allowed to take control of what would become Britain&#8217;s biggest media company.</p>
	<p pid="b.39.3/5">I understand that in the last few minutes News Corporation has withdrawn its undertakings in lieu. On <phrase class="date" code="2011-01-25">25 January</phrase>, I said I was minded to refer News Corporation&#8217;s proposed merger with BSkyB to the Competition Commission in the absence of any specific undertakings in lieu.

It will mean that the Competition Commission will be able to give further full and exhaustive consideration of the merger, taking into account all relevant recent developments.</p>
	<p pid="b.40.1/2">Protecting our tradition of a strong, free and independent media is the most sacred responsibility I have as Culture Secretary. Irresponsible, illegal and callous behaviour damages that freedom by weakening public support for the self-regulation on which it has thrived. By dealing decisively with the abuses of power we have seen, hopefully on a cross-party basis, the Government intend to strengthen and not diminish press freedom&#8212;<i>[</i> <i>Interruption.</i> <i>]</i></p>

	<p pid="b.40.4/1">I accept the Culture Secretary&#8217;s apology for the late notice of his statement, but the truth is that it points to the chaos and confusion at the heart of the Government. After what we have heard and the questions that have been left unanswered, we all know that it is the Prime Minister who should be standing at the Dispatch Box today. It is quite wrong that he chose to do a press conference on Friday in Downing street about the issues but is unwilling to come to the House today. Instead, he chose to do a press conference at Canary Wharf, just 20 minutes down the road.</p>
	<p pid="b.40.4/2">The Culture Secretary has no direct responsibility for the judicial inquiry that he talked about, and he has no direct responsibility for the police and the relationship with the media, but he has been left to carry the can by a Prime Minister who knows there are too many difficult questions for him to answer. It is an insult to the House and to the British public.</p>
	<p pid="b.40.4/3">Let me ask the Culture Secretary a series of questions. First, on the subject the judge-led inquiry, as soon as an inquiry is established, tampering with or the destruction of any documents becomes a criminal offence. We already know that is relevant to the offices of the <i>News of the World</i>. It may also be relevant to any documents in No. 10 Downing street and Conservative headquarters. Will the Culture Secretary&#8212;<i>[</i> <i>Interruption.</i> <i>]</i></p>

	<p pid="b.40.5/1">Order. I said a few moments ago that the Secretary of State must be heard. The same goes for the Leader of the Opposition, and if Members are chuntering away or, worse, shouting, they had better stop it.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-07-11b.41.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40208" speakername="Edward Miliband" colnum="41"  time="016:16:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110711/debtext/110711-0001.htm#11071115000607">
	<p pid="b.41.0/1">Will the Culture Secretary now agree that the judge-led inquiry should be established immediately? Any less means there is a risk that evidence will be destroyed.</p>
	<p pid="b.41.0/2">Will he also confirm that the inquiry will be set up under the Inquiries Act 2005 so it can compel witnesses to attend? The inquiry must have the right terms of reference, including the unlawful and unethical practices in the newspaper industry and the relationship between the police and certain newspapers. Neither of those issues were in the terms of reference implied by the Secretary of State in his statement. Can he confirm that all these issues will be in the terms of reference?</p>
	<p pid="b.41.0/3">Secondly, let me talk about BSkyB. Let us be clear: the trouble that the Government are in is of their own making. Any changes they make are not because they have chosen to do so but because they fear defeat in the House on Wednesday evening. The Culture Secretary chose not to follow the recommendation of Ofcom to refer this bid to the Competition Commission and he has been insisting for months that he can proceed on the basis of assurances from News Corporation. On Friday, the Prime Minister said the same. Now the Culture Secretary has adopted the very position he has spent months resisting&#8212;and the confusion continues. The Deputy Prime Minister has joined the call I made yesterday for Rupert Murdoch to drop the bid. On BSkyB, the Government are in complete disarray. Does the Deputy Prime Minister speak for the Government? If so, is the Culture Secretary now asking Rupert Murdoch to drop the bid? Can the Culture Secretary now assure us that on the basis of his new position, no decision will be made on the BSkyB bid until the criminal investigation into phone hacking is complete? Nothing else can give the public the confidence they need.</p>
	<p pid="b.41.0/4">Thirdly, will the Culture Secretary state his position to the House on the need for responsibility to be accepted at News International? The terrible hacking of Milly Dowler&#8217;s phone happened on Rebekah Brooks&#8217;s watch, while she was editor of the <i>News of the World</i>. Last Wednesday, the Prime Minister refused to say she should go, and on Friday all he offered were weasel words. Will the Culture Secretary say what the Prime Minster refused to&#8212;that Rebekah Brooks should take responsibility for what happened on her watch and resign from her post?</p>
	<p pid="b.41.0/5">Fourthly, given the role of Andy Coulson in relation to phone hacking and other allegations of illegality, will the Culture Secretary clarify the following&#8212;<i>[</i> <i>Interruption.</i> <i>]</i> Government Members should listen to what I am saying because it is relevant to victims up and down the country. On Friday at his press conference, the Prime Minister said, about the appointment of Andy Coulson:</p>
	<p pid="b.41.0/6">&#8220;No one gave me any specific information.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.41.0/7">Yet Downing street has confirmed that <i>The Guardian</i> newspaper had discussions with Steve Hilton, the Prime Minister&#8217;s senior aide, before Andy Coulson was brought into government. Those conversations detailed Mr Coulson&#8217;s decision to rehire Jonathan Rees&#8212;a man who had been jailed for seven years for a criminal conspiracy and who is alleged to have made payments to the police on behalf of the <i>News of the World</i>. This serious and substantial information was passed by Steve Hilton to the Prime Minister&#8217;s chief of staff, Mr Ed Llewellyn. The information could not have been more specific. Now, can the Culture Secretary tell us whether</p>
	<p pid="b.41.0/8">Ed Llewellyn, the Prime Minister&#8217;s chief of staff, told the Prime Minister about this evidence against Mr Coulson, or are we seriously expected to believe that Mr Llewellyn, an experienced former civil servant, failed to pass any of this information on to the Prime Minister? Frankly, that beggars belief as an explanation. This issue goes to the heart of the Prime Minister&#8217;s integrity and we need answers from the Culture Secretary.</p>
	<p pid="b.41.0/9">Can the Culture Secretary now tell us whether it is true that the Prime Minister also received warnings from the Deputy Prime Minister and the former leader of the Liberal Democrats, Lord Ashdown, about bringing Andy Coulson into government? Unless the Prime Minister can explain what happened with Mr Coulson and apologise for his terrible error of judgment in appointing him, his reputation and that of the Government will be permanently tarnished.</p>
	<p pid="b.41.0/10">The Prime Minister was wrong not to come to the House today. As on every occasion during this crisis, he has failed to show the necessary leadership that the country expects. He saw no need for a judicial inquiry, he saw no need to change course on BSkyB and he has failed to come clean on Andy Coulson. This is a Prime Minister running scared from the decisions he made. This is a Prime Minister who is refusing to show the responsibility the country expects. The victims of the crisis deserve better, this House deserves better and the country deserves better.</p>

	<p pid="b.42.2/1">We are fighting a war. The Prime Minister arrived back from Afghanistan at around 10 o&#8217;clock last Tuesday night. By Wednesday lunchtime he had established two public inquiries. That is doing more in less than one week than the right hon. Gentleman&#8217;s party did in eight years.</p>
	<p pid="b.42.2/2">The right hon. Gentleman talked about Andy Coulson. He should be very careful not to be someone who throws sticks in glass houses. In his comments he criticised me for being willing to accept assurances from News Corp. He was willing to accept assurances from the very same people about Tom Baldwin.</p>
	<p pid="b.42.2/3">Let me answer some of the right hon. Gentleman&#8217;s specific questions. Tampering with evidence does not need a judge-led inquiry to be set up. It is a criminal offence now. We are moving as fast as we can to set up a judge-led inquiry into all the actions that were illegal or improper. We also want to set up an inquiry, with cross-party support&#8212;hopefully&#8212;to look into the unethical behaviour by the press, and we want that to start work immediately. Inquiries into illegal actions have to wait until after police investigations are complete. We are willing to talk to the right hon. Gentleman in order to get some kind of cross-party consensus so that that can happen as soon as possible. I said in my statement that we would like that to start as soon as this summer.</p>
	<p pid="b.42.2/4">With respect to the BSkyB decision, I have at every stage in this process followed the procedures laid down in the Enterprise Act 2002 that was passed by the right hon. Gentleman&#8217;s Government. Not only that, but I have done more than those processes require, because at every stage I have asked for independent advice from the expert media regulator, Ofcom, and after careful consideration at every stage I have followed that advice.</p>
	<p pid="b.42.2/5">Let me say gently to the right hon. Gentleman that he needs to show some humility in this matter. He attended Rupert Murdoch&#8217;s summer party and failed to bring up the matter of phone hacking. He was part of a Cabinet&#8212;<i>[Interruption.]</i></p>

Given the absence of a briefing today, does the Secretary of State accept that it is his duty to go back to the Department and to Downing Street and insist that a full, detailed chronology of who informed whom&#8212;or failed to inform whom&#8212;by name and what they said is published by the close of play today?</p>

	<p pid="b.45.3/1">I will tell my hon. Friend why that is the case. Typically, when there is a referral to the Competition Commission, it could decide to block the deal entirely or it could negotiate undertakings, circumstances and conditions under which it would consider it acceptable for the merger to go ahead. The Competition Commission is considering media plurality, just as I did. It is not considering broader competition issues, but if as part of that consideration it decided to accept any undertakings, it would want to be sure that they were credible, which is why compliance with the &#8220;fit and proper person&#8221; requirements of the Broadcasting Act 1990 will be extremely important.</p>

Rees, while serving time in prison, discussed his contact with reporters from <i>The Sunday Times</i>. Far from this scandal being about wrongdoing at the <i>News of the World</i>, it is a story of institutional criminality at News International. John Yates&#8217; review of the Mulcaire evidence was not an oversight. Like Andy Hayman, he chose not to act. He misled Parliament. He misled readers of <i>The Sunday Telegraph</i> only yesterday.

However, all the practices that he describes must be dealt with properly, in terms of both the specific criminal acts and the changes necessary to make sure that they do not happen again. He made one very important reference, in particular, when he pointed out the issue of computer hacking.

	<p pid="b.53.3/1">You might recall, Mr Speaker, that on <phrase class="date" code="2011-04-27">27 April</phrase>, I led an Adjournment debate in the House on the inadequacies of press self-regulation. Sadly that debate was very thinly attended. I learned from other Members afterwards that a lot of Members did not want to participate in case they were then targeted by the press. What reassurance can the Secretary of State give us that the review of press regulation will be free of intimidation?</p>

	<p pid="b.55.1/1">On a point of order, Mr Speaker. One hon. Member has already referred to <phrase class="date" code="2003-03-11">11 March 2003</phrase>. Also on that day, Andy Coulson and Rebekah Brooks appeared before the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee and cited the Milly Dowler case as a prime example of good co-operation between the press and the police. In retrospect, that seems one of the most disgusting pieces of cynical manipulation of a Select Committee ever. In addition, there has subsequently been a series of lies by News International and by the Metropolitan police to Select Committees of this House. That means that Members from all parties have been led a merry dance. That is partly because witnesses are not required to give evidence on oath, and we are therefore unable to pursue someone for perjury if they have lied to a Select Committee.</p>
	<p pid="b.55.1/2">There is now, however, going to be a judge-led inquiry in which the witnesses will have to give evidence on oath. Mr Speaker, can you ensure that it is perfectly possible for that inquiry to look at the issue of whether lies were told to Parliament, which might otherwise be covered by privilege&#8212;<i>[</i> <i>Interruption.</i> <i>]</i> I hear what the Clerk is saying, and I disagree with him. I urge you to disagree with him as well, because it is important that the judge-led public inquiry should be able to look at how Parliament could be so grossly misled, how Members could be intimidated and how people could refuse to give evidence. If that were to happen, we might come up with a stronger Parliament that is able to deal better with issues such as these in the future.</p>

	<p pid="b.55.2/1">I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his point of order, but he is somewhat inclined to invest me with powers that I do not possess. Although it is generous of him to make that attempt, I think that in all wisdom, I should resist it. I will happily reflect on the particular points that he makes, but I would emphasise to him and to the House that there is a distinction between what the Chair can do and what the House as a whole can decide to do. The hon. Gentleman will know that a Member who wishes to raise a privilege complaint &#8212;he did not use those words, but I think that that concept was there in his point of order&#8212;is required to give me written notice. That is provided for on page 273 of &#8220;Erskine May&#8221;. I understand, as I think the House now will, that the Select Committees involved in this matter&#8212;the Home Affairs Committee and the Culture, Media and Sport Committee&#8212;are themselves pursuing the matter. As the hon. Gentleman also knows, the Chair does not intervene in matters before Committees of the House. I must also add that it is of course always open to a Committee to report to the House on any matter it wishes, but that is a matter for the Committee and not for the Chair to decide. I will leave it there for today.</p>

His refusal to do so means that the House has had no opportunity to question him about these matters, whereas last Friday he gave the press the chance to do that in a press conference. Is not that a gross discourtesy to the House? Furthermore, given the number of questions asked of the Secretary of State this afternoon that he was unable to answer&#8212;I feel sorry for him, because he has been dumped in it&#8212;can you confirm that you would make time available later today for the Prime Minister to come to the House to make a statement if he can finally find the time and the will to do so?</p>

	<p pid="b.56.1/1">Further to that point of order, Mr Speaker. I have had cause on a number of occasions recently to draw your attention to the fact that Ministers have made statements and held press conferences outside this House&#8212;they have done so on a considerable number of occasions now&#8212;and then come to the House either later or not at all. We have now had the latest and worst example of this. The Secretary of State for Culture, Olympics, Media and Sport said in his last answer that everyone should be held accountable for their actions. The one person who refuses to be accountable for his actions in this is the Prime Minister. That being so&#8212;while I recognise that although you do not have power, you do have a remit&#8212;what action will you take, Mr Speaker, to make it plain to this Government that it is totally unacceptable for them constantly to insult this House by making statements outside the House and then perhaps coming here as an afterthought?</p>

First, I have repeatedly stressed&#8212;and I do so again&#8212;that important statements of policy, including changes of policy, should be made first to the House. Secondly, the Prime Minister, to whom the right hon. Gentleman referred, will be here in the House, if not before Wednesday, then on Wednesday to respond to questions. The right hon. Gentleman and other Members may seek to catch my eye on that occasion if they are so minded. Thirdly, he will have noticed that when statements are made, in an attempt always to protect the interests of the House as a whole&#8212;and in particular the interests of Back-Bench Members&#8212;I am inclined to let them run fully, so that Back Benchers have a full and unvarnished opportunity to question the Minister, whoever that Minister may be, and however senior he or she may be.</p>

	<p pid="b.56.3/1">Further to the earlier point of order, Mr Speaker. The Select Committee on Culture, Media and Sport has followed phone hacking tenaciously. In February last year we issued a report that found it inconceivable that only one rogue reporter at the <i>News of the World</i> knew about</p>
	<p pid="b.56.3/2">phone hacking. During that inquiry very senior people at the</p>
	<p pid="b.56.3/3" class="italic">News of the World</p>
	<p pid="b.56.3/4">and News International testified that a so-called second investigation, in 2007, found no further evidence of wrongdoing, and News International&#8217;s lawyers wrote us a letter confirming that. However, documents passed to the Metropolitan police by News International and held by those self-same lawyers now show that this was a blatant untruth. Several inquiries into this whole affair have already been announced, but it also prompts the question whether Select Committee powers should be made more effective&#8212;from giving powers of summons through to imposing consequences when witnesses mislead and lie with impunity. On behalf of the House, may I ask you, Mr Speaker, to give some thought not only to future reform to make Select Committee powers more effective, but to discussing the issue urgently, so that we can learn the lessons of this affair with the Government and urge them to bring forward reforms to put Select Committees in this House on a par with congressional committees in the United States?</p>

	<p pid="b.57.0/1">Once again, I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his point of order. With reference to the specifics of the matter to which he has referred, if a Committee feels dissatisfied with the information that it has been given, it is open to that Committee to reopen an investigation or to request the reappearance of a previous witness, as a number of Committees have already decided. In so far as he focused in the second part of his remarks on the cause of strengthened Select Committees, with greater powers, I would say to him that if the House wants more powerful Select Committees, with a number of specific new powers that they do not currently possess, the House can will it. That is not specifically for the Chair&#8212;the Chair has spoken on these matters on many previous occasions, and I think the Chair&#8217;s views are well known on these issues&#8212;but for the House to decide.</p>

	<p pid="b.58.2/1">I accept that this is an extremely serious matter and, in the mind of the hon. Lady and perhaps others, a matter of some urgency. She will know that, as I have just pointed out to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40633" name="Helen Jones">the hon.

Lady, who has quite properly raised this matter a number of times, will return to it before long. The Minister on the Bench and representatives of the Government will have heard what she had to say.</p>

	<p pid="b.58.3/1">On a point of order, Mr Speaker. Earlier today, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40352" name="Eric Ollerenshaw">the hon. Member for Lancaster and Fleetwood (Eric Ollerenshaw)</phrase> asked the Minister of State, Department for Education, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40113" name="Sarah Teather">the hon. Member for Brent Central (Sarah Teather)</phrase> a question about the way in which the pupil premium was spent in Lancaster. The Minister turned up, having clean forgotten to bring an answer to that question. That came hot on the heels of a recent written question that revealed that the Department for Education answers a very small number of questions on time. Can you, Mr Speaker, enable the House to hold the Department for Education to account by inquiring what problems it faces that can justify Ministers turning up unable to answer questions for which they have had a week&#8217;s notice?</p>

	<p pid="b.58.4/1">I note the point of order and the hon. Gentleman will recall that when that question was answered&#8212;or, rather, not answered, as he describes&#8212;I indicated to the Minister that it would help if Ministers read the question before answering it rather than afterwards. To be fair, the Minister took responsibility for that, and I understood her to indicate that she would look into it and seek to avoid a repetition. I hope that that is helpful, but I have a feeling that the hon. Gentleman will keep his beady eye on the matter. The House would expect nothing less.</p>

	<p pid="b.61.0/1">I certainly do not intend to delay our reaching a group of amendments in which I know my hon. Friend is particularly interested. However, as I said to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40379" name="Kelvin Hopkins">the hon. Member for Luton North (Kelvin Hopkins)</phrase>, I am in the hands of the House in terms of how long it will take us to debate the two groups of amendments that Mr Speaker has placed before the group relating to clause 18.</p>
	<p pid="b.61.0/2">The first three amendments were proposed by my right hon. and noble Friend Lord Howell of Guildford on behalf of the Government. They are essentially technical, and were intended to deal with concern that was expressed in the House of Lords about the interpretation of some of the provisions in part 1. They fall into two categories.</p>
	<p pid="b.61.0/3">Lords amendment 1 changes one of the definitions in clause 1 involving the phrase &#8220;or otherwise supporting&#8221;. The fear was expressed in the House of Lords that the Bill, as originally drafted, could inadvertently prevent Ministers and their officials from taking part constructively in negotiations about new proposals for action. That is not, and has never been, the Government&#8217;s intention. Our intention is that the United Kingdom should continue to be an active player in the European Union, engaging with our partners and ensuring that the EU delivers what it ought to be delivering for the benefit of our citizens and those of other European countries.</p>
	<p pid="b.61.0/4">Under the Bill, the Government would not be able to vote in favour of, or otherwise support, a treaty or other provision specified in part 1 when the time came for the final decision to be made in the European Council or in the Council of the European Union without the necessary approvals. The words &#8220;or otherwise supporting&#8221; are included simply because&#8212;as many Members who follow European affairs closely will know&#8212;it is possible for a proposal that is subject to unanimity to be adopted even it has not been agreed to by each member state in a formal vote. For example, a formal vote does not always take place. In certain circumstances where the Chair believes that he or she has the mood of the room, silence can be taken as assent and, when a decision requires unanimity, abstention is, effectively, counted as a supportive vote, as set out in articles 235(1) and 238(4) of the treaty on the functioning of the European Union.</p>

	<p pid="b.61.1/1">Having listened with enthusiasm and interest to my right hon. Friend&#8217;s earlier remarks about timing, on the basis that I think it is generally conceded that this particular batch of amendments is entirely uncontroversial and that the whole question of the amendments&#8217; content could be dealt with in about 30 seconds flat, will he be kind enough to address them as swiftly as possible, to ensure that the House can get its views across on all matters?</p>

	<p pid="b.61.2/1">I am encouraged by my hon. Friend&#8217;s remarks to be increasingly confident that we can reach the group of amendments on which he is anxious to speak in good time. I remind him, however, that four hours have been set aside for our deliberations on these three groups of amendments, and I think it is right that we should do justice to the consideration that the House of Lords gave to the Bill by addressing each of the amendments it approved.</p>
	<p pid="b.61.2/2">On Lords amendment 1, all I want to say further is that the phrase &#8220;or otherwise supporting&#8221; is included to remove any doubt&#8212;just as the previous Government used that phrase to remove any doubt when drafting the European Union (Amendment) Act 2008&#8212;and to ensure that a proposal could not be adopted in such a way without the appropriate authority required under the provisions of the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="b.61.2/3">Lords amendments 2 and 4 make it clear beyond doubt that, under the terms of the Bill, a referendum would not be required in the United Kingdom if a treaty change did not apply to the UK but only to Gibraltar, and this would not transfer competence or power from the United Kingdom. I say straight away that it is hard to work out a scenario in which a treaty amendment that constituted a transfer of competence or power would apply only to Gibraltar and not to the UK. It is possible in theory, and this point was raised in the other place, and we have sought to assuage that concern by proposing these two technical amendments.</p>

	<p pid="b.63.0/2">The amendments would restrict the scope or operation of the referendum lock that was approved by this House. They are contrary to our clear intention to ensure that any future proposal to amend the European Union treaties to transfer further competence or power from this country to the European Union should be subject to the consent of the British people. The purpose of the Bill is to reconnect with the people whom we serve. It aims to re-engage them with key decisions on the direction of the European Union, on which they have, in the past, been denied their say. The amendments would not deliver on those aims but, on the contrary, make it much more difficult to achieve them.</p>

	<p pid="b.63.1/1">Will my right hon. Friend join me in deploring what recent events have demonstrated? Does he, thus, agree that it would have been extremely desirable to ensure that a referendum should apply to any treaty, either current or future, which attempted to change the fundamental relationship of the United Kingdom to the European Union, including in respect of the creation of a two-tier Europe&#8212;between the eurozone and the EU&#8212;in economic governance? Does he agree that that is a matter on which a referendum is every bit as important? This is not merely a question of a transfer of competence and powers but one that goes to the very heart of the constitutional relationship between the UK and the EU.</p>

	<p pid="b.63.2/1">If, as I hope, this Bill obtains Royal Assent and goes on to the statute book, this Government and future Governments will, from the moment its powers are commenced, be bound by the provisions of this legislation with regard to the way in which they handle any future proposal to amend the European Union treaties, negotiate and agree a completely new treaty or invoke one of the passerelle clauses in the treaty of Lisbon. As my hon. Friend knows, in certain cases a Government would have to hold a referendum before a particular treaty could be ratified by this country. For any treaty change, even one that according to the provisions of this Bill would not automatically require a referendum, an Act of Parliament&#8212;primary legislation&#8212;would be needed, and it would of course be open to Parliament at that time to decide to go further even than the provisions that we are putting forward in this legislation.</p>

	<p pid="b.63.3/1">May I say that I am delighted by that delightfully disingenuous response? As my right hon. Friend knows perfectly well, I am referring to the treaty that has already been made, and I immediately realised what he was up to when he talked about &#8220;any future&#8221; treaty. I accept that an Act of Parliament may be needed, but does he not, by the same token as the principles that he has set out in great detail, also agree that we should have a referendum on the creation of such a two-tier Europe, which creates constitutional change in the relationship between the EU and ourselves?</p>

	<p pid="b.64.0/1">The principle on which the Government have consistently sought to act in preparing and introducing this legislation has been that a change to the treaties that transferred new competencies or powers from the United Kingdom to the institutions of the European Union would require the agreement of the British people in a referendum. That is the principle, so for us the test for the sort of hypothetical treaty change that my hon. Friend is describing would be whether it transferred competencies or powers from this country to the EU. I do not want to stray too far from the subject of the Lords amendments we are discussing, but the hypothesis that he describes could just as well be a question of a quite separate intergovernmental treaty between members of the eurozone, for example, as an amendment to the treaty of Lisbon, which would require the assent of the United Kingdom.</p>

	<p pid="b.64.1/1">Let me have one last shot. Does the Minister concede that there is a world of difference between the members of the coalition Government having entered into an agreement between themselves for purposes that suit them and the constitutional convention that a referendum is required when there is a fundamental constitutional change in the relationship between us and the European Union? It is as simple as that.</p>

	<p pid="b.64.2/1">We sought in this Bill to define a constitutional change of the sort that my hon. Friend describes in terms of a transfer of competencies or powers from the United Kingdom to the European Union. That seems to us to be a significant constitutional change and the definition is one that we have incorporated into the Bill. Now, if he will forgive me, never mind how delightful I find his interventions, I think I ought to make some progress in addressing the Lords amendments directly.</p>
	<p pid="b.64.2/2">Let me deal first with Lords amendments 3 and 5, which one might term the threshold amendments. They would provide for a turnout threshold of 40% for any referendum under the Bill. If that threshold were not met, regardless of the result the final decision over whether to ratify a treaty change would pass from the people back to Parliament. That runs contrary to the spirit and intention of the Bill and would leave the British people in real doubt about the effect of their vote.</p>
	<p pid="b.64.2/3">I know that the intention of colleagues in the House of Lords was to safeguard the sovereignty of Parliament, but I do not agree with them that the Bill would challenge the status of Parliament. In fact, Parliament will have a much stronger role than ever before.</p>

	<p pid="b.64.3/1">I am grateful to my right hon. Friend for being so courteous in giving way.

	<p pid="b.64.4/1">My hon. Friend is right. We get into very dangerous territory as elected representatives when we start to say that only votes or elections in which the turnout was above a given percentage are valid. What is at issue is our intention to provide for the British electorate to have the final say on whether or not the</p>
	<p pid="b.64.4/2">Government of the day can agree to transfer competencies or powers from the United Kingdom to the European Union. The outcome of a referendum should, in our view, be determined by the will of those who vote and not by how many turn up to vote.</p>
	<p pid="b.64.4/3">As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40264" name="Mark Durkan">the hon. Member for Foyle (Mark Durkan)</phrase> said earlier this year when we debated a turnout threshold for the referendum on the alternative vote:</p>
	<p pid="b.64.4/4">&#8220;If we agree to anything that passes for any sort of threshold, people in this country will have an incentive to say, &#8216;If you don&#8217;t know, don&#8217;t vote&#8217;&#8221;.&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2011-02-15.907"><i>Official Report</i>, 15 February 2011; Vol. 523, c. 907</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="b.64.4/5">A turnout threshold seems to me to be a recipe for apathy. It would undermine one of the fundamental aims of the Bill, which is to reconnect the British people and better inform them of the decisions taken in their name at European Union level.</p>

	<p pid="b.65.0/1">The argument that the Minister is very fairly advancing is reinforced by what the Electoral Commission said in advance of today&#8217;s proceedings. Its task and statutory duty in issuing a certificate following an election has to be based on a proper definition of the size of the electorate and what constitutes turnout. Does the Minister agree that the amendments add no clarity whatever to that?</p>

	<p pid="b.65.1/1">My right hon. Friend is absolutely correct about the views of the Electoral Commission, which I believe it expressed publicly in its response to the amendments passed in the other place. There could be some perverse, although unintended, I am sure, effects if the threshold amendments were upheld. In some circumstances, there would be an incentive for one side in the referendum campaign to urge abstention rather than support in an effort to keep turnout below the magic threshold of 40%. It could also mean some very peculiar outcomes. Obviously we are talking hypothetically, but if we stuck with the 40% threshold, a poll would be deemed invalid if there was a turnout of 39% in which 5% voted one way and 34% voted the other, whereas a poll with a turnout of 41%, with 21% voting one way and 20% voting the other&#8212;the 1% margin&#8212;</p>

Gentleman&#8217;s point about the imposition of the threshold then and looks back at the history of the decade after, which resulted in no move towards satisfying what were genuine aspirations for a greater degree of devolved government in Scotland and Wales, it made the public disconnection from Westminster of the people in those two countries greater over the subsequent years.

	<p pid="b.67.8/5">He repeated that a few columns later. As a Conservative politician, I feel slightly nervous trespassing on the frontier between Caerphilly and the Rhondda, but the hon. Member for Caerphilly owes the House an explanation for this departure in Labour party policy that he has presumably devised and implemented.</p>
	<p pid="b.67.8/6">Amendments 6 to 13 are very significant indeed in their impact. They would remove from the referendum lock several passerelle decisions that would transfer power and competence from Britain to the European Union. The other place accepted that decisions to adopt the euro, give up UK border controls, or create a single, integrated military force should require a referendum. That was a welcome step, but it is not enough. The coalition agreement set out clearly that</p>
	<p pid="b.67.8/7">&#8220;no further powers should be transferred to Brussels without a referendum.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.67.8/8">All the decisions included in clause 6 as it left the House of Commons would constitute such a transfer.</p>
	<p pid="b.67.8/9">Some Members of the Lords felt the original clause 6 did not provide Ministers with what they termed sufficient &#8220;pragmatic flexibility&#8221;. I would say in response that it is a direct consequence of the abuse of so-called &#8220;pragmatic flexibility&#8221; in the past that there is such lack of trust in the European Union today, and in Governments as a species, for decisions taken on European Union matters. It is that lack of trust which the Bill seeks to address. Speaking as someone who disagrees with some of my hon. Friends on the Back Benches, I want to see the United Kingdom playing a vigorous, active, constructive role on behalf of our people within the European Union. Our ability to do that and to enjoy the confidence of the British people in so doing will be enhanced if we can point to the safeguards that are provided for in the Bill included in clause 6.</p>

	<p pid="b.68.0/2">objectives will include any opportunity to renegotiate the UK&#8217;s relationship with the EU? As the Minister must know, the answer that I received today says that the Prime Minister is not going to answer that question, I am afraid, and that he has transferred it to the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs.

	<p pid="b.69.4/1">The amendments to clause 6 would introduce huge inconsistency in the referendum lock. They would make the method used to transfer competence or power the determining factor in deciding whether or not a referendum should be held, rather than the fact of the transfer of competence or power itself. There are four ways of amending the treaties to allow transfers of power and competence from the United Kingdom to the European Union. First, there is the ordinary treaty revision procedure. Secondly, there is the first part of the simplified revision procedure, which was the method used recently to agree the recent treaty change on the eurozone stability mechanism. Thirdly, the British veto could be given up using the second part of the simplified revision procedure set out in article 48(7) of the treaty on European Union. The fourth and final way is through the use of a decision or passerelle without formal treaty change.</p>
	<p pid="b.69.4/2">The Lords amendments seek to remove the last two methods from the referendum lock. I do not see the logic in this. For example, the amendments would mean that were a future UK Government to decide to give up their veto over foreign and security policy under the ordinary treaty revision procedure, there would first have to be a referendum, but if they decided to give up that veto under the passerelle decision in article 31(3), which would have exactly the same effect as a change under the ordinary revision procedure, there would be no requirement for a referendum. I do not think that the British public would understand being able to vote on a treaty change that gave up the veto but not having a say over a passerelle that did exactly the same thing, and there are other such examples. As my right hon. and noble Friend Lord Howell argued, this would be tantamount to locking the front and back doors of a house but leaving the kitchen window open. It is not the way to restore the trust of the British people.</p>
	<p pid="b.69.4/3">The amendments would also draw an artificial distinction between a possible future agreement on a common European defence that would involve the creation of a single, integrated military force and other similar decisions that would not. The amendment suggests that the only controversial element would be a decision to develop a &#8220;single, integrated military force&#8221;, but there would inevitably be confusion over the extent to which such a force would be established. For example, would the establishment of an integrated command structure, an integrated unit or integrated budgets count? That lack of clarity could allow each step to be presented as &#8220;not quite&#8221; leading to a single integrated military force, and therefore &#8220;not quite&#8221; justifying a referendum. It is important that we hold to the principle that were a British Government to decide to opt in to a common European defence, that should ultimately be subject to a decision by the British people. A common defence could undermine the pre-eminence or capability of NATO, notwithstanding any assurances provided in the EU treaties. Maintaining that pre-eminence has been a long-standing concern of this and previous British Governments.</p>

	<p pid="b.70.0/1">My right hon. Friend is making an able demolition of these unacceptable amendments, but will he describe what sorts of decisions on common defence he thinks would currently trigger a referendum, because it is difficult to see how such decisions would constitute a transfer of power under the rather narrow definition set out in the Bill?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-07-11b.70.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40051" speakername="David Lidington" colnum="70"  time="018:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110711/debtext/110711-0002.htm#11071139000408">
	<p pid="b.70.1/1">As the House debated in Committee and on Report, in the Bill it is the creation of a common European defence entity that goes beyond what is defined as a common security and defence policy, which as my hon. Friend knows is very limited in scope within the treaties as they stand. If there was to be a common European defence, that would clearly have to be defined in treaty terms, but sometimes, as he would be the first to note, language that appears quite generalised in scope, once written into a treaty, provides the basis on which numerous detailed measures can then be brought forward because there has been an overall extension of competence to the EU institutions. It could&#8212;I am not saying that it always would&#8212;spell the end of an independent UK defence policy, which was one of the previous Government&#8217;s red lines during their negotiations on the Lisbon treaty.</p>
	<p pid="b.70.1/2">The amendments would also remove any decision to participate in a European public prosecutor from the referendum requirement. Hon. Members will recall the sensitivity and divergence in views across Europe over the idea of a European public prosecutor who would be able to launch prosecutions in the United Kingdom and other member states in areas affecting the EU&#8217;s financial interests. When we considered this issue earlier this year it was accepted that people should be asked for their approval before any Government could agree to participate and allow cases to be prosecuted independently in the UK&#8217;s legal system.</p>
	<p pid="b.70.1/3">We have always guarded jealously&#8212;rightly, I think&#8212;the principle that decisions on whether to prosecute any individual or corporate entity should be taken by the designated independent prosecutors. To give those powers to some new European body that could come in and state whether a prosecution would or would not take place, irrespective of what the Crown Prosecution Service, the Director of Public Prosecutions or Her Majesty&#8217;s Revenue and Customs said about a particular case, would be a very serious shift of power and competence away from this country to Brussels. It would be right for the British people to be asked to assent to that before a Government were allowed to ratify such a decision.</p>
	<p pid="b.70.1/4">Before I move on from the Lords amendments to clause 6, I should like to express my amazement that, when the House of Lords voted for an amendment to remove from the referendum lock a decision to end the requirement for unanimity in agreement to the EU&#8217;s multi-annual financial frameworks, the official Opposition voted in favour of that proposal. I hope that the hon. Member for Caerphilly will explain on the record where the Opposition now stand on the matter. Everyone in the House, whatever their views on the EU, knows that in the next couple of years a key issue facing every Government in the EU and all the Brussels institutions is the negotiation on the new MFF which will effectively set budgetary decisions and ceilings for the next five or seven years in the EU&#8217;s life and development. It is vital that that remains subject to unanimity and that the British Government, whoever is in office, continue to have a right of veto.</p>

That exercise would have to be repeated every five years. I have looked carefully at the arguments for such a measure.

Everything that we do in the House is reversible&#8212;no single Parliament can bind its successor&#8212;so there is no reason to single the Bill out for a sunset clause, which would mean that it merely loaned power to the people of this country on the future direction of the EU for a limited time.

	<p pid="b.73.5/1">My hon. Friend is quite right. In a previous Parliament, when we voted for constitutional legislation as far-reaching as the devolution of power to the Scottish Parliament and the Assemblies in Wales and Northern Ireland, we did not vote for the inclusion of sunset clauses. Parliament took the view that if that legislation, in due course, proved not to be workable, or if there were a profound change in the public mood or a new Government were elected with a mandate from the</p>
	<p pid="b.73.5/2">people to effect changes and reverse that devolution, that was a matter for the future Parliament at that time. The idea that we should impose a sunset clause in this case simply because it is something new seems to be completely inconsistent with the way in which Parliament and successive Governments have approached previous constitutional reforms.</p>

	<p pid="b.74.0/1">I am interested in the line that my right hon. Friend is taking. Without pre-empting any other discussion, does he agree that this is also about the whole question of our membership of the European Union being only on loan from this House because under the Factortame decision Lord Bridge made it clear that it was a voluntary act and no more? Does he therefore think that inserting a reference to the European Communities Act 1972, as proposed in the amendment tabled by the former Lord Chancellor, Lord Mackay of Clashfern, would be making a profound mistake in thinking that this all hinges on the Act when in fact it depends on Parliament itself?</p>

	<p pid="b.74.1/1">My hon. Friend is inviting me to comment on the subject matter of the third group of amendments. I hope that he will forgive me if I delay commenting in that fashion until we reach those amendments.</p>
	<p pid="b.74.1/2">This Bill places Parliament at the heart of every decision to be considered. Each decision will need parliamentary approval, whether by Act or by resolution. The sunset clause would take that power away from Parliament, and until such time as part 1 was revived, none of the controls in part 1&#8212;not just the referendum lock but none of them&#8212;would apply. Some colleagues in the other place claim that the Government are binding future Governments and not themselves. However, we have already said that we will use the Bill to ratify the current treaty change on the euro zone stability mechanism, and we will also use it to consider the treaty change required for Croatia&#8217;s accession. Once the legislation is enacted, this Government, too, will be bound by it.</p>
	<p pid="b.74.1/3">There is another reason why a sunset clause is unnecessary. The previous Government set up a system of post-legislative scrutiny under which the Government of the day are required to publish a memorandum to Parliament on the operation of each Act of Parliament up to five years after the commencement of that Act. This is examined by relevant parliamentary Committees, which can decide whether to conduct a detailed examination of that legislation. I am happy to put on record that we think that this is a good idea and that a future Government must publish a full report on how this Bill has been used within five years of its becoming law. That will result in the clarity and the reflection that colleagues in the other place seek, but without arbitrarily depriving the British people of their say.</p>
	<p pid="b.74.1/4">The case for this Bill is simple: it is to give the British people the chance to have their rightful say over future changes to the EU treaties, whether through formal revision or use of the passerelles that transfer competence or power from this country to the EU. The Bill does not substitute the British people for Parliament, for Parliament will continue to have a central and strengthened role in approving such key decisions, but it provides a vital opportunity to address the disconnection that has developed over the years between the British people and the decisions</p>
	<p pid="b.74.1/5">taken in their name by Parliament and Government. This group of Lords amendments would not help us to achieve these goals&#8212;indeed, they would seriously jeopardise our chances of doing so&#8212;and that is why I hope that this House will disagree with them.</p>

	<p pid="b.75.0/1">I would like to comment briefly on Lords amendments 3 and 5 regarding the 40% threshold and on Lords amendments 6 to 13 regarding the number of referendums. I will then focus on Lords amendment 15 regarding the so-called sunset-sunrise clause.</p>
	<p pid="b.75.0/2">Some people in both Houses say that a reasonable turnout in referendums is necessary to ensure a demonstrable degree of legitimacy. That argument was advanced during the alternative vote referendum debate, but it has weaknesses. We have already heard that there is a certain perverse incentive to encourage a lower turnout than might usually be the case, and that is a fair point. It is important to remember that there has been a threshold of 40% on only one occasion&#8212;the devolution referendums for Wales and Scotland in 1979. Wales rejected the then Government&#8217;s devolution proposals by a majority of four to one, while in Scotland there was a turnout of less than 40% but a narrow majority in favour of the proposals. The result in Scotland brought this question to the fore: when is a win not a win? That is a real dilemma, and it is one of the reasons that many Labour Members have reservations about the use of the 40% threshold.</p>
	<p pid="b.75.0/3">Reference was made to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40497" name="Chris Bryant">the Member for Rhondda (Chris Bryant)</phrase>. I should point out that Rhondda is in south Wales and Ronda, as it was pronounced by the Minister for Europe, is in Spain. My hon. Friend tells me that, although he speaks Spanish, he represents to the best of his ability the constituency in south Wales.</p>
	<p pid="b.75.0/4">Amendments 6 to 13 would reduce the number of theoretically possible topics for referendums from more than 50 to three: the single currency, the creation of a single EU integrated military force, and border controls and the Schengen protocols. As Labour Members argued consistently on Second Reading and in Committee, there is an overwhelming argument for referendums to be held if ever a British Government wanted this country to join the single currency, which is extremely unlikely, and when there is a proposal for a major constitutional change. In Committee, we proposed an amendment for a Joint Committee of both Houses to examine whether a proposed treaty change was a significant constitutional change. Unfortunately, that proposal was not successful in this House, and nor did it gain sufficient support in the other place. However, that remains our position. Of course, Members in the other place are entitled to their views, but we have reservations about the proposal that referendums should be confined to these three subject areas, and it is important to put on the record that my comments set out the Labour party&#8217;s position.</p>
	<p pid="b.75.0/5">That brings me to the sunset-sunrise clause. In the other place, Lord Kerr, the distinguished former head of the diplomatic service, put forward three arguments for such a clause, one of which related to foreign policy. He argued with conviction that were the provision enacted, other European Governments could freeze Britain out of the debate through enhanced co-operation</p>
	<p pid="b.75.0/6">or by acting outside the treaties altogether. That might happen, he said, when a British negotiator in Brussels is unable to agree to something</p>
	<p pid="b.75.0/7">&#8220;because his Government back home will tell him, &#8216;Don&#8217;t be silly. That would trigger a referendum.&#8217;&#8221;&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="lords/2011-06-15.810"><i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 15 June 2011; Vol. 728, c. 810</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="b.75.0/8">He argued that a regular assessment and decision at the start of a new Parliament on whether such a system was working would be a reasonable measure to adopt. That is worthy of consideration.</p>

	<p pid="b.76.0/1">A Government would say that only if they did not think that they could win such a referendum, so how can it be right for his lordship to put the case that the British people, if they were minded to vote against such a thing, should have their role entirely negated? That seems to be the essence of the argument, and surely that is wrong.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-07-11b.76.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40137" speakername="Wayne David" colnum="76"  time="018:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110711/debtext/110711-0002.htm#11071139000430">
	<p pid="b.76.1/1">That is not entirely fair. When Lord Kerr presented his argument, he suggested that referendums could be triggered on what are universally considered as fairly technical, minor matters. It is a hypothetical situation. Nevertheless, it is important to recognise that in the minutiae of negotiations, we negotiate effectively for the United Kingdom only when we do not have it in the back of our minds that there might be hurdles to be overcome at a later stage.</p>
	<p pid="b.76.1/2">The other two arguments used in the other place were essentially constitutional. It was argued that the referendums envisaged in the Bill are essentially post-legislative. In other words, once the Government have negotiated a treaty change and Parliament has agreed to it, a referendum will be held. As the referendum is post-legislative, it is a lock. The electorate will have to decide whether to overrule the Government and Parliament of the day. Holding referendums post-legislatively in that way questions Parliament&#8217;s traditional role. Such a change should therefore be subject to constant review and reaffirmation or otherwise. That constitutional argument is worthy of consideration.</p>
	<p pid="b.76.1/3">By far the most important and powerful argument concerns the principle that a Parliament cannot bind its successor. That is a vital principle of our parliamentary democracy. In the evidence taken by the European Scrutiny Committee, which is ably chaired by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40584" name="William Cash">the hon. Member for Stone (Mr Cash)</phrase>, a number of expert witnesses explained the importance of that principle. Michael Dougan, the dean of the Liverpool law school and a professor of European law at the university of Liverpool, concluded his evidence by saying:</p>
	<p pid="b.76.1/4">&#8220;If there is a real concern about the doctrine of Parliamentary sovereignty that needs to be addressed during the passage of this Bill, it surely consists in an attempt by the Government to persuade the current Parliament to bind its successors in a manner which runs counter to accepted understandings of our constitutional order.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.76.1/5">That is a pretty powerful statement.</p>

	<p pid="b.76.2/1">Even though legislation can in a sense bind our successors, our successors can introduce legislation to annul previous legislation. There is a difference between the automatic disappearance of legislation at an election and an Opposition party coming</p>
	<p pid="b.76.2/2">into government with the commitment to reverse legislation. That is still possible, so our successors will not be bound absolutely.</p>

	<p pid="b.77.1/1">Does the hon. Gentleman accept that the question of fettering a future Parliament is secondary these days, unfortunately, to the fact that the Supreme Court could, as the European Scrutiny Committee examined in its evidence and report on this Bill, assert that it has ultimate authority in certain circumstances? That is the mischief that we must ensure does not happen under any circumstances. We will come on to debate clause 18 and the Government&#8217;s proposals, which open that door in an alarming fashion.</p>

	<p pid="b.77.2/1">Like the Minister, I do not want to stray into that debate. One thing that has been clear from this whole debate, including on Second and Third Reading, is the real threat to this institution comes from judicial activism. That threat does not come so much from the European Union as from our own judiciary. We must be mindful of that.</p>
	<p pid="b.77.2/2">Another expert witness who gave evidence to the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s Committee was Vernon Bogdanor, a research professor at King&#8217;s college London and a former tutor of the Prime Minister. He said that</p>
	<p pid="b.77.2/3">&#8220;the purpose of the bill must be to prevent a future government from supporting such an amendment or transfer without a referendum. The bill seeks, in other words, to bind a future government. That seems to me inconsistent with the declaratory proposition that Parliament is sovereign.&#8221;</p>

	<p pid="b.77.3/1">The hon. Gentleman is making a powerful case for Parliaments not binding their successors.

	<p pid="b.77.4/1">No, I do not think that that is the case. One thing that has come across clearly in this legislation and the debates in this House is the sovereignty of Parliament. We are talking about the sovereignty of Parliament in a dualist system, but Parliament nevertheless has the right to determine what legislation has primacy over the people of this country. The ultimate decision rests with this country.</p>

	<p pid="b.78.1/1">I very much hope that in this Parliament that will not be the case. I have taken heart from the rebellious comments and actions of the hon. Gentleman. I very much hope that Parliament will assert itself through the course of this Parliament and that his concerns will prove to be mistaken.</p>
	<p pid="b.78.1/2">I hope that most Members of this House would uphold the time-honoured doctrine, despite the qualifications that have been expressed, of one Parliament being unable to bind its successor. I hope that Members do not question that. We should never seek to dictate in one Parliament what should happen in the next. I concede that, strictly speaking, the European Union Bill does not bind future Parliaments because, as has been said, those future Parliaments could modify the legislation. Nevertheless, at the very least, the Bill questions that principle and strongly goes against its spirit. I say that because the heart of the Bill will effectively come into operation during the next Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="b.78.1/3">In the other place, Lord Howell said from the Government Front Bench that the Bill will be &#8220;operative&#8221; in this Parliament. He cited the Government&#8217;s commitment to bring forward an Act of Parliament on the European stability mechanism, the so-called bail-out mechanism, and its inclusion in the treaty. The Minister has just said that an Act of Parliament will be brought forward if Croatia accedes to the European Union. The Government have said consistently that they will not agree to any transfer of sovereignty to Brussels during this Parliament. That is an important qualification. There will therefore be no need to hold a referendum. Of course, we may see a significant transfer if the Government decide to opt in to the European Court of Justice opt-in provisions. The Government are illogically against holding a referendum if they decide to opt in. That reinforces the point that the main intention behind the Bill is to influence future Governments and Parliaments. What happens during this Parliament under the Bill will be relatively small beer. We are talking about a piece of legislation that will have a direct influence on the Governments and Parliaments of the future, after the next election. That is the fundamental point. Despite the qualifications that have to be expressed for the argument to hold up, that is an important and telling point.</p>

I am sure that good parliamentarians would not want to undermine or even question the doctrine of free-standing Parliaments, which is why I hope the House will support Lords amendment 15. An affirmative resolution at the start of each Parliament would both ensure the legitimacy of this Parliament in making a decision and reaffirm the doctrine that one Parliament cannot bind its successor.</p>

	<p pid="b.79.5/1">I take the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s point about an affirmative resolution, but nevertheless, that resolution would depend upon the action of the Executive. Proposed subsection (2) in the Lords amendment states that</p>
	<p pid="b.79.5/2">&#8220;the Secretary of State may by order provide&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.79.5/3">that the provision continues, so it would be entirely up to the Government. I put it to him that his point is therefore not a good one.</p>

	<p pid="b.79.6/1">With due respect, I think it is a good one. Purely in terms of procedure, as the Government have conceded, there needs to be an assessment of how this innovative constitutional legislation works in practice. That is a good idea, and I welcome the Minister&#8217;s concession on it. However, the logical extension of that is an affirmative resolution at the start of the next Parliament. If the Bill is working well, that resolution should be agreed to. If it is not, there should be an opportunity to reconsider. I therefore hope that the House will look favourably upon Lords amendment 15. It is modest, sensible and pragmatic, and above all else it reflects the principles of parliamentary sovereignty to which we all adhere.</p>

	<p pid="b.80.0/1">It gives me some pleasure to speak in support of the Government in opposing these Lords amendments. It also gives me the opportunity to address the remarks of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40137" name="Wayne David">the hon. Member for Caerphilly (Mr David)</phrase>. From listening to his description of, and support for, the so-called sunrise clause, I thought he advanced some unusual and novel arguments, albeit that they were supposedly supported by eminent people. I suggest that their words may have been a little removed from their context, because the hon. Gentleman is asking the House to adopt the relatively new constitutional doctrine that no legislation should be passed that is in any way an attempt to bind successor Governments. Legislation binds not future Parliaments but future Governments, unless Parliament chooses to change it. I think he gets the terms &#8220;Government&#8221; and &#8220;Parliament&#8221; muddled up. Every piece of legislation binds future Governments to some extent, unless they manage to obtain a majority in Parliament to change it.</p>
	<p pid="b.80.0/2">It is ironic that the hon. Gentleman advances his argument in respect of this Bill, given that the subjects of the referendums that would take place under it would be matters that really did bind future Parliaments. Why else do we think the treaties mention &#8220;irreversibility&#8221; and &#8220;irrevocability&#8221;&#8212;rather absolutist, undemocratic language? They are intended to bind member states into something that cannot be undone, even by those sovereign states.</p>
	<p pid="b.80.0/3">Today&#8217;s debate is partly about the fact that we remain a sovereign state, within which this Parliament&#8212;and the Queen in Parliament&#8212;remains the supreme and sovereign institution of our constitution. This sovereign Parliament is laying down new rules for future Governments that will require them to have referendums on certain issues before more powers are transferred to the European Union.</p>

	<p pid="b.80.1/1">But that is precisely the point. What makes the Bill special, different and innovative is that it departs from virtually all other legislation in that its main provisions are applicable not to this Parliament but to the next Parliament.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-07-11b.80.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40303" speakername="Bernard Jenkin" colnum="80"  time="018:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110711/debtext/110711-0002.htm#11071139000452">
	<p pid="b.80.2/1">But that applies to a great deal of legislation. I do not understand the distinction that the hon. Gentleman is attempting to make. Actually, what the Bill will do is restrict the ability of Governments to give away power and to reach decisions in the EU and present them to Parliament as faits accomplis without reference to the people. That seems to me a thoroughly good and democratic thing.</p>
	<p pid="b.80.2/2">The hon. Gentleman has given the game away this evening about the future direction of the Labour party&#8217;s policy. What he has told the House tonight is that he is quite happy for aspects of the Bill to go through, but he is not happy for its provisions to apply to a future Labour Government. He does not want a future Labour Government to have their hands tied by the necessity of referendums before they give away more powers. He wants to go back to the system to which my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40550" name="Andrea Leadsom">the Member for South Northamptonshire (Andrea Leadsom)</phrase> referred&#8212;of signing up to treaties, promising referendums on them and then ratting on those promises. That was the record of the Labour Government.</p>
	<p pid="b.80.2/3">I regard all these Lords amendments as completely unacceptable. Whatever shortcomings the Bill has&#8212;I am afraid there are many, because it is limited in scope&#8212;the amendments are designed to pull the guts out of this democratising measure. The vote threshold proposed in Lords amendment 3 is not a recognisable one but a perverse one. It does not suggest that unless the number of votes reaches a certain level, a decision cannot be taken. It suggests that if the votes do not reach a certain level, the Government and Parliament can carry on as they like. I thought the whole point of a threshold was to test whether there was a measure of consent for a particular constitutional change. The threshold in the amendment is not about testing whether there is a measure of consent but is more about testing whether there is a measure of resistance, or whether there is apathy.</p>
	<p pid="b.80.2/4">Unfortunately, the people who have largely guided European policy in this country for the past 20, 30 or 40 years have got away with what they have done largely by relying on people&#8217;s apathy and ignorance. The proposed threshold is designed to create an incentive for a Government who wish to transfer more powers to the EU to maintain high levels of apathy and ignorance. I am reminded of my late noble Friend Lord Whitelaw, who during the 1975 referendum accused the right hon. Anthony Wedgwood Benn of going around the country stirring up apathy. The amendment is a charter for going around the country and doing just that. It is completely unjustified and should be given very short shrift.</p>
	<p pid="b.80.2/5">Lords amendments 6 to 13, to clause 6, are simply designed to rip the guts out of the Bill. My right hon. Friend the Minister for Europe very properly went through some of the things that Governments in future would be able to do without a referendum if the amendments were not disagreed to. Under the amendments, Governments could, without a referendum, give up the veto over foreign policy and over almost anything else under article 48(7). The amendments would allow the UK to join the public prosecutor and to extend the role of the public prosecutor to any serious crime with a cross-border dimension. We should think about what that means for the criminal justice system of this country. The amendments would allow Governments, without a referendum, to give up the veto over labour laws, taxes and planning, and the multi-annual financial framework and spending of the EU. The Opposition should shed no crocodile tears over how much the EU is spending if they are prepared to give up that veto without proper consent.</p>
	<p pid="b.80.2/6">The amendments would remove the veto from all the enhanced co-operation procedures, which would enable what is effectively majority voting to come into effect in a whole lot of areas. Clearly, that is an anti-democratic provision. If there is one thing that ardent advocates of the EU should have learned, it is that that structure lacks popular consent. It legislates without popular consent. If there is one thing that true Europeans should want it is that we reconnect the decisions on how powers are exercised with popular democratic consent. The Bill goes some way towards doing that.</p>
	<p pid="b.80.2/7">The sunrise provision is simply the last gasp of a past generation who are trying to neuter what is today called Euroscepticism. The support of the hon. Member for Caerphilly for Lords amendment 15 gives the lie to the idea that the new Labour party, under its new leader, is flirting with Euroscepticism. It is not. It has no intention</p>
	<p pid="b.80.2/8">of following through. It might pretend to be, and to sound, sceptical, and it might even start talking of an in-out referendum, inviting one or two of my more radical hon. Friends to fall into the trap of thinking that that is the way out, when it probably is not. However, the fact is that we need a Government who are prepared to negotiate vigorously, and to do so with the extra leverage and strengthened hand that the requirement for a referendum gives them.</p>

	<p pid="b.82.2/1">Before my hon. Friend ends his speech, would he be good enough to allow me to put one thought to him? The number of occasions when the referendum will be required has been dramatically, drastically and absurdly reduced by the Lords amendment. However, does he agree that the fundamental question is not whether we select what functions might or might not be affected, but the whole business of our relationship with the EU, that completely failed project, which is quite clearly causing enormous damage not only to the UK but to other countries? That is the test on which a referendum should be determined. It should not be determined just on the minutiae of individual questions, including the single currency, foreign policy and so on.</p>

	<p pid="b.82.5/1">I know that my hon. Friend does not advocate an in-out referendum, but the general direction of the EU certainly merits a referendum at some stage. I still flirt with the idea that we should have a referendum on the proposed treaty amendment. As my right hon. Friend the Minister for Europe adverted to, four fifths of the British public think that we should have a referendum on any treaty amendment. That seemed to be the substance of the Government&#8217;s original commitment, which has been hedged in the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="b.82.5/2">Perish the thought that I am straying from my support for the Government on the Lords amendments&#8212;I would rather stay where I am&#8212;but I would finally wish to remark that the authors of the Lords amendments have a track record of their own. The introducers of the amendments are not minor figures. The amendment on the threshold was introduced by Lord Williamson of Horton&#8212;he who was secretary-general of the Commission during the passage of the Maastricht treaty; he who was the secretary-general who pushed through the social</p>
	<p pid="b.82.5/3">action programme, which negated any effective UK Government opt-out from the social chapter; and he who was one of the architects of economic and monetary union, which is now collapsing around our ears.</p>
	<p pid="b.82.5/4">In Lords amendment 8 to clause 6, which incidentally completely fails to define, as my right hon. Friend the Minister for Europe said,</p>
	<p pid="b.82.5/5">&#8220;a single, integrated military force&#8221;,</p>
	<p pid="b.82.5/6">Lord Williamson is pretending that we should have a referendum on defence matters. However, I would just pose this question: does NATO constitute</p>
	<p pid="b.82.5/7">&#8220;a single, integrated military force&#8221;?</p>
	<p pid="b.82.5/8">I would submit that it probably does not. We could therefore form a NATO-style command structure in the EU, which successive Governments have set their face against, and pass such powers into the treaties of the EU, without a referendum. I hardly think that the British people would vote for that.</p>
	<p pid="b.82.5/9">The noble Lord Hannay, former permanent secretary at the Foreign Office and former chief negotiator for the UK in the EU&#8212;an illustrious and distinguished person&#8212;is also an author of the Lords amendments. Do not mistake me: I have great admiration for the ability and sincerity of those people, but I just advert to their track record of advocating policy on the EU. Lord Hannay said quite recently that the single currency would be quite a good thing for the UK, as did Lord Kerr of Kinlochard. As recently as <phrase class="date" code="2009-05-26">26 May 2009</phrase>, the latter delivered a lecture in Edinburgh on monetary union, in which he lamented that we were not trying to join the single currency.</p>
	<p pid="b.82.5/10">I raise those points not to stray from the substance of the debate, but just to question whether the people who proposed the Lords amendments should not stop trying to get Britain further into the EU, and start apologising for the appalling judgment and advice that they have given to successive Governments. Their advice has put this country into a perilous economic position&#8212;because of the state of the EU and the euro&#8212;but they have also advised successive Governments to hand over more and more powers. I would not usually criticise civil servants in public, but they are now taking part in the political process having advised successive Governments to hand over more and more powers, as a result of which Governments have been in an ever-weaker position from which to defend our national interests.</p>
	<p pid="b.82.5/11">The Bill is a small step towards starting to redress the balance in the relationship between the overweening power of the EU and the people in this country governed by the laws it makes.</p>

I think that we are up against the establishment here. The establishment in this country is still wedded to the idea of ever-closer integration and even of joining the euro. I do not think that the British people or the Conservative party, which I think represents the aspirations of the British people on this subject, accept that view. I hope that there is a change of heart in Whitehall officialdom such that when the next generation of civil servants arrives, they will seek to re-establish the independence of the UK within the EU, rather than to carry on weakening it.</p>

	<p pid="b.84.3/1">I will speak on these amendments only briefly because much has been said already that I need not repeat. I took the trouble to spend some time in the Library going through the Order Paper and amendments, and I wrote against each of them, &#8220;KH against&#8221;&#8212;those are my initials, so it meant that I was personally against all of them&#8212;which seems to be in line with the Government&#8217;s position.

	<p pid="b.84.3/2">The amendments have clearly been moved by people who are trying to undermine and wreck the Bill by making it toothless. It is not a strong Bill but, with the amendments, it would be feeble indeed. To restrict referendums to these three areas only would leave enormous scope for those who want constitution creep to succeed. I do not want it to succeed; I want the Government at least to consider a referendum for any significant change to any EU constitution. As to joining the euro, I think that the Labour Front Bench has become more Eurosceptic. There is no prospect of us supporting joining the euro, and one can see that very few Labour Members are willing to come along and take a strongly pro-euro position, as was perhaps the case under the previous Government and ones before that. I am pleased about that because I have been critical about joining the euro for many years.</p>
	<p pid="b.84.3/3">The euro is in very serious trouble. As of today, we are talking about Italy&#8212;not just Ireland, Portugal and Greece&#8212;as being a significant problem.

	<p pid="b.84.3/4">and I suspect that before long the euro may unravel and that several national currencies may be re-established to allow countries to adjust to their economic needs and choose their own interest rates and parities with other currencies, including with what remains of the euro.</p>

Member for Stone (Mr Cash)</phrase> is Chair and, on the Committee, we leave no stone unturned, as I am sure he agrees. Paper clips are not a constitutional matter, although some people might argue that we do not want the EU interfering in our paper clips. On constitutional matters, we want to leave things open for Governments to choose when a referendum is appropriate, not to restrict the provisions to the areas in the amendments. There are those who would seek to use every opportunity to extend the EU&#8217;s control by skirting carefully around these tight definitions of areas that would require referendums. However, the Committee, led by our Chair, does a good job on non-constitutional matters&#8212;several of its members are in the Chamber now and would, I am sure, agree.</p>
	<p pid="b.85.1/3">The sunset clause puts the onus on a Government after an election to reintroduce the legislation, and no doubt a sensible Government would do that, but if there is no sunset clause, the onus is on the new Government to get rid of the legislation. They could do that by repealing it, but they would then face the anger of the British people for having taken away their referendum rights. A sunset clause is very different from the possibility of repeal after election. The House can repeal any legislation&#8212;even, I suspect, treaty obligations. Over time, we could say that we wish to withdraw from a treaty. No doubt we would have to give notice and negotiate, which would cause all sorts of difficulties, but the House could, if it chose, withdraw from a treaty. If there were to be a referendum on membership of the EU and there was a substantial vote in favour of withdrawing, the House would have to debate withdrawing from a treaty. It would have to tell that to the EU. I am not saying that that is going to happen any time soon, but it is a possibility. If a particular piece of legislation is not to the taste of a future Government, they could repeal it, but that is very different from having it automatically die at the point of an election. I therefore</p>
	<p pid="b.85.1/4">strongly oppose the sunset clause, and if there are Divisions on any of the Lords amendments, I will certainly vote against them.</p>

	<p pid="b.86.0/1">It is always a pleasure to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40379" name="Kelvin Hopkins">the hon. Member for Luton North (Kelvin Hopkins)</phrase>, who is a very wise and knowledgeable man in this regard.</p>
	<p pid="b.86.0/2">The European Union Bill is not exactly what I thought we were going to get at the start of this process. When I stood for Parliament, I was looking forward to a sovereignty Act or a Bill of Rights&#8212;something with quite a lot of guts in it. We have now had this forced marriage between my party and the Lib Dems, however, and the dowry that we paid involved the slight watering down of many of the items that I, standing on a Conservative manifesto, would have liked. This was one of them.</p>
	<p pid="b.86.0/3">After our debates on the Bill here and in Committee, during which it was lovely to learn all about how Parliament works, we happily sent the Bill on its way to the Lords. It was interesting to note that the Opposition decided that they did not have any views on Europe at that point. They decided not to vote; it was a matter of a one-line Whip, and they really preferred it if most of their Members went home. That gives me even more reason to admire the hon. Member for Luton North, who has stuck with the Bill through thick and thin during its progress through this place.</p>
	<p pid="b.86.0/4">At the end of the Bill&#8217;s Third Reading, I said that I could hear strange noises emanating from the other end of the building, as though tombs were opening and strange beasts appearing. The Minister for Europe is much more generous and benevolent than I am when describing the people in the other place who have amended the Bill. For me, the Lords amendments have raised a huge number of concerns.</p>
	<p pid="b.86.0/5">My first concern is about the turnout threshold. When the Lords were discussing the alternative vote referendum, not many of them were interested in thresholds; the wonderful Lord Williamson of Horton, who tabled amendments on thresholds in this Bill, was certainly not. He was much quieter on thresholds in the AV referendum, but I am sure that his views on thresholds in matters European were not in the least influenced by his time as a career civil servant who served as head of the European secretariat in the Cabinet Office from 1983 to 1987, and as Secretary-General of the European Commission from 1987 to 1997. He was ably supported on one particular amendment, which did not pass, by Lord Liddle, about whom I shall say more in a moment.</p>
	<p pid="b.86.0/6">Lord Liddle had an interesting take on why the Lords were trying to confuse what we had passed in the House of Commons. Speaking to a consequential amendment to amendment 5, he said that</p>
	<p pid="b.86.0/7">&#8220;if you are seriously committed to Britain&#8217;s participation in the European Union, you want a British Government to be able to respond flexibly to events and to be a good partner to our partners in the Union. We cannot completely tie our hands in advance when we do not know the future&#8212;as the example of the European stability mechanism shows.&#8221;&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="lords/2011-06-08.311"><i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 8 June 2011; Vol. 728, c. 311</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="b.86.0/8">I only wish that we had had this Bill before the European stability mechanism was proposed. That would have ensured a very different financial outcome for our country.</p>
	<p pid="b.86.0/9">Those were the wonderful bits about the threshold. The amendments to clause 6 also give me great cause for concern. They are the bits that cut out all the</p>
	<p pid="b.86.0/10">referendums that we in this place want to see. Lots of the amendments tabled in the other place were tabled by Lord Hannay of Chiswick. He was the UK&#8217;s permanent representative to the European Union from 1985 to 1990; he was part of the diplomatic service, bless his soul. Others were tabled by a very special man whose credentials I cannot criticise: Lord Liddle, who was a special adviser to Tony Blair when he was Prime Minister from 1997 to 2004. He then went to Lord Mandelson&#8217;s Cabinet, and he was principal adviser to the President of the European Commission from October 2007. A third person in the Lords also tabled amendments on these matters: Lord Tugendhat. He was a Conservative Member of Parliament from 1970 to 1976, after which he was a European Commissioner. Hon. Members will be able to see a theme developing here in regard to the sort of people who have tabled amendments at the other end of the corridor and who want to wreck these measures.</p>

	<p pid="b.88.0/1">The hon. Gentleman is listing a lot of important subjects. Quite frankly, I would support an EU referendum on paper clips, because, whatever the referendum was about, the British people would take the question to be one of whether or not they were in favour of the European Union. Everyone would understand that. I therefore support more items being placed in the Bill on which we would be allowed to have a referendum. What the British people want is a referendum on whether we should be in or out.</p>

	<p pid="b.88.1/2">If only those on the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s Front Bench could come clean and tell the British what they actually believe on these matters. Do they trust the British people enough to give them a vote on these matters? We are not sure, because up at the other end of the building, where the red Benches are, Labour Members&#8212;including Front Benchers&#8212;have trooped into the wrong Lobby on these matters on too many occasions. We would very much like to know where Labour Members stand on this. This is the fog of war as far as they are concerned. They want to rattle a few cages and see what comes out, but they certainly do not want to get caught stating any policy. However, these matters are fundamental to the sovereignty of the United Kingdom, and it would have been good to hear something definite from the hon. Member for Caerphilly tonight.

	<p pid="b.88.2/1">In a sense, this whole group of amendments is a con trick and an illusion. The test to be applied in regard to the number of people who vote in an election is a matter on which I spoke very strongly in the AV referendum debate. As my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40198" name="Chris Heaton-Harris">the Member for Daventry (Chris Heaton-Harris)</phrase> said, many of the people who tabled amendments on thresholds were not the slightest bit interested in them at that time. There is therefore an inconsistency of principle involved. What they are promoting, and everything that they have been doing over the past 27 years since I have been on the European Scrutiny Committee, during which time I have had the pleasure of watching their perambulations and machinations, is designed to force us further and further down the route towards European integration. They have advised Governments of all hues on the Maastricht treaty, the European Government, the exchange rate mechanism and the Nice and Amsterdam treaties.</p>
	<p pid="b.88.2/2">I must have tabled the best part of 1,000 amendments against those treaties over the past 27 years, and with great pleasure. I have devoted, I suppose, almost a political lifetime to opposing every single thing that</p>
	<p pid="b.88.2/3">those noble Lords have put forward. I do not need to specify them individually; all I will say is that I regard them as having conducted a process that has led to the destruction of the European Community and, now, the European Union. One has only to look at what is happening today and to ask who is responsible for what has occurred. It has been a concert party&#8212;a concert party involving not only the United Kingdom establishment but, worse still, the European establishment alongside the United Kingdom establishment&#8212;that has led to the mess that the European Union is in now. As I said to my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister when he came back from the European Council the other day, although we are glad that he felt obliged to deny that we would be involved in the Greek bail-out&#8212;having conceded, I am sad to say, that we would be involved in the bail-out of Portugal&#8212;he now has the opportunity, as the Prime Minister of this country, to go forward in the national interest and renegotiate the treaties, to get us out of the mess that those noble Lords, individually and collectively, have got us into.</p>

	<p pid="b.89.0/1">We are all grateful to my hon. Friend for his lifelong service on this issue, but on the esoterica of this group of amendments, can he clarify for me that, taken as a whole, they are simply spoiling amendments?</p>

	<p pid="b.89.1/1">They are, and it is for that reason that I will not be able to vote for them, even though I happen to have some sympathy for the idea of a reasonable test for referendums. However, these amendments are a blind&#8212;an attempt to get people to go along with the 40% test for the electorate on the one hand, but also to associate them with a whole range of matters that are entirely inimical to the interests of the United Kingdom. I am not particularly interested in the list that the Government have produced; as I said at the beginning of the proceedings on this Bill, I think that it is a mouse of a Bill. The issue on which we now need to concentrate is the big landscape and the fact that, as the European Council on Foreign Relations paper argued the other day, Maastricht has to be revised. We will have to return to the question of what kind of Europe we want.</p>
	<p pid="b.89.1/2">This list of proposed matters&#8212;which will never come up in this Parliament, as we know&#8212;is, therefore, a blind in its own way, but to reduce it to three core issues really makes it an absurdity. I say to my right hon. Friend the Minister that on the big landscape, this is the time for us to take a bigger, more responsible and more statesmanlike view, in the interests of the people of this country, to see the European question as the failure that it is and to get down to the serious business of renegotiating all the treaties and moving to an association of nation states, so that we can work together co-operatively, rather than by co-ordination, to deal with the real, practical problems that this country faces&#8212;the Brazils, Indias and Chinas of this world&#8212;instead of dancing on the head of a pin, as we are with most of this Bill.</p>
	<p pid="b.89.1/3">My argument to my right hon. Friend is very simple. He may have the advantage of having come forward with a few proposals that touch at the margins of this issue, but the real question is what is he&#8212;or, indeed, the Prime Minister&#8212;going to do to get us out of the mess that those treaties have got not only us but the people in Europe into? Indeed, young people aged between 18 and</p>
	<p pid="b.89.1/4">25 in several countries are now suffering unemployment of 47%. It is absolutely impossible to accept that, and as I said in the 1990s, when this whole system collapses, it would not surprise me to see the rise of the far right and massive unemployment, destabilising the entire European Union, with the most devastating consequences for the international order. That is the problem that we are faced with, and that is why these amendments are not to be accepted.</p>

	<p pid="b.90.3/1">I should like first to recognise that the issue we are debating is, to an extent, an issue of detail that has aroused some fairly intensive debate, involving some extremely experienced and high-powered lawyers. It is not an issue related to the rationale for clause 18 as a whole, and I welcome the acceptance by the House of Lords of the rationale for a provision of this nature. Indeed, the author of Lords amendment 14, Lord Mackay of Clashfern, said when he presented his amendment on Report in the other place that there was very little between his position and that of the Government on the point of principle, saying:</p>
	<p pid="b.90.3/2">&#8220;It is important that this declaratory measure&#8221;&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="b.90.3/3">that is, clause 18&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="b.90.3/4">&#8220;should be made because of the theory sometimes propounded that Community law in the United Kingdom derives from the treaty alone by virtue of the European Union legal order. I believe that it is right that we should make it plain at this juncture that that is not so.&#8221;&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="lords/2011-06-15.790"><i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 15 June 2011; Vol. 728, c. 790</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="b.90.3/5">However, noble Lords who voted in support of Lords amendment 14 took the view that the European Communities Act 1972 is the only route by which EU law takes effect in the United Kingdom, and that all the references to directly effective or applicable EU law in other Acts are linked to that Act. Lords amendment 14 therefore amends clause 18 to refer specifically to the European Communities Act 1972, rather than to the wider reference point of &#8220;an Act of Parliament&#8221;, in order to affirm that this is the sole route by which directly effective and directly applicable EU law takes effect in the UK.</p>

	<p pid="b.90.4/1">I rather suspect that my right hon. Friend expected that I would rise at about this point. Very quickly, the European Communities Act 1972 might be the Act of Parliament by virtue of which we voluntarily entered into the acceptance of European law&#8212;as it has accumulated, like a tsunami, since 1972, both widening and deepening&#8212;but does he not agree that the crucial words are those of Lord Bridge in the Factortame case,</p>
	<p pid="b.90.4/2">who said that we voluntarily did that? Therefore, the special significance of the 1972 Act has to be tempered by the fact that it was what Parliament decided at that time. That is the crucial question to which we shall turn shortly.</p>

	<p pid="b.91.0/1">I agree with my hon. Friend, and I am sure he will recall the debate on these matters on Second Reading and particularly on the first day in Committee when we spent an entire day debating clause 18. He will also recall&#8212;it is clear from the <i>Hansard&#8212;</i>that I made it clear on behalf of the Government that the European Communities Act 1972 had effect in this country, so European law had effect here insofar as it stemmed from that piece of legislation, because Parliament had willed that that should be the case. If a future Parliament were to decide to repeal that Act, it would be perfectly within that Parliament&#8217;s power so to do, although my hon. Friend would be the first to appreciate that there would be immediate consequences for the UK&#8217;s treaty obligations. There would be a political crisis at that point.

It is precisely for that reason that we should be extremely anxious to ensure that no words are imported into this clause, as the Bill leaves this House and will finally be enacted, that would in any way allow the Supreme Court to move in on that territory and claim ultimate authority.</p>

	<p pid="b.91.4/1">I make two points to my hon. Friend. First, the only reason why the Supreme Court has power to adjudicate here on European Union matters is because Parliament has provided for directly effective and directly applicable EU law to have effect in the United Kingdom legal order by virtue of passing statutes that give European law that direct effect and application here. Secondly, as I think my hon. Friend knows&#8212;he is being a bit mischievous&#8212;he is trying to tempt me again on to a much broader issue, which is the important philosophical question of whether ultimate legislative supremacy lies with Parliament or whether parliamentary sovereignty is a construct of the common law controlled by judges. Speaking as an elected parliamentarian, I am quite clear and argue quite naturally that Parliament as the elected limb of body politic must have the ultimate</p>
	<p pid="b.91.4/2">say, but in making that case we are entering into a philosophical debate that goes way beyond the parameters of the European Union Bill, let alone Lords amendment 14.</p>
	<p pid="b.91.4/3">Let me return to the Lords amendment. I am mindful of the arguments advanced by Lord Mackay of Clashfern and his supporters in the House of Lords, and I greatly appreciate their legal expertise. We considered Lord Mackay&#8217;s arguments very carefully both before the debate in the other place and following the Lords acceptance of the amendment. I sought further legal advice on this point, and the Government&#8217;s view remains that although the European Communities Act 1972 is indeed the principal means by which directly effective or directly applicable EU law takes effect in the UK, a number of other Acts of Parliament also give effect to EU law independently of the 1972 Act. For example, provisions of the Scotland Act 1998, of the Government of Wales Act 2006 and of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 put Ministers from the devolved Administrations under an obligation to act in accordance with EU law. Some of those settlements define EU obligations in a manner similar to the language used in section 2(1) of the 1972 Act&#8212;but, significantly, they do so not by reference to that Act.</p>
	<p pid="b.91.4/4">The Government are therefore concerned that, were this House to agree with the Lords amendment as it stands, it could create the risk that the courts might interpret this clause as restricting the ability of legislation other than the 1972 Act to incorporate directly applicable or directly effective EU law into UK law. That, in turn, could ultimately mean that clause 18 could be interpreted as being more than declaratory, which would rather undermine what we are trying to do with this Bill. This would not, in our view, reflect the law accurately, and so we seek to disagree with the Lords amendment as currently framed.</p>
	<p pid="b.91.4/5">In that sense, I agree entirely with the arguments put forward by my hon. Friends the Members for Stone (Mr Cash) and for Aldridge-Brownhills (Mr Shepherd), but I also recognise Lord Mackay&#8217;s point that the 1972 Act is the primary conduit for directly effective and directly applicable EU law to take effect in the United Kingdom. In recognition of this concern, the Government propose a change of wording to the Lords amendment that would retain the reference to the European Communities Act 1972 but, importantly, also refer to the existence of other Acts of Parliament that also give effect to EU law.</p>

	<p pid="b.92.0/1">I understand the right hon. Gentleman&#8217;s point and I have sympathy with his argument. Crucial to the argument, it seems to me, are the words</p>

	<p pid="b.92.1/1">I decided to include the words on the basis of the best legal advice available to me across Government at the time. When preparing the Bill for introduction into this House, I examined the wording and the question of whether a reference to the 1972 Act alone would be appropriate. I was given very clear legal advice that, because of the other statutes that make reference to the application of EU law, a simple reference</p>
	<p pid="b.92.1/2">to the 1972 legislation would not suffice. That explains the original wording of the Bill that came before the House of Commons.</p>
	<p pid="b.92.1/3">What we have sought to do in framing our amendments to the Lords amendment is to recognise the view that the other place took that clause 18 should incorporate language that recognises the particular importance of the 1972 legislation. We see no reason why we should not amend the clause to make a specific reference to the 1972 Act so long as the clause also makes reference to those other Acts that give effect to EU law. This reflects the Government&#8217;s consistent position that other Acts of Parliament&#8212; independently of the European Communities Act 1972&#8212;might also allow for the incorporation of directly effective and directly applicable EU law into the UK legal order.</p>

	<p pid="b.93.1/1">We believe that the original drafting met the tests that we had set to implement our policy of having a declaratory clause.

	<p pid="b.93.3/1">I want to make some progress.</p>
	<p pid="b.93.3/2">It is not only the devolution legislation that mentions European Union law. The Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986, the Chiropractors Act 1994 and the Competition Act 1998 are further examples of legislation that allows European Union law to have direct effect in this country. Section 9A of the Company Directors Disqualification Act requires the United Kingdom to make a disqualification order against a person in certain circumstances, including circumstances in which an undertaking commits a breach of competition law under either article 81 or article 82 of the EC treaty&#8212;now articles 101 and 102 of the treaty on the functioning of the European Union. That Act refers directly to the treaty provisions without referring to the 1972 Act.</p>
	<p pid="b.93.3/3">The amendment accepted by the other place removed the reference that makes it explicit that only by virtue of such Acts does directly effective and directly applicable EU law take effect in this country. Removing that reference leaves open the possibility of arguments that directly effective and directly applicable EU law could enter our law by other means, thus undermining the rationale behind the clause. The amendments that the Government propose seek to restore that important qualification, and to remove any doubt about whether directly effective or applicable EU law could enter United Kingdom law by other means.</p>

	<p pid="b.94.0/1">I am sorry that the Minister deemed it unnecessary, or undesirable, to accept my intervention, but that does not prevent me from making my point.</p>
	<p pid="b.94.0/2">As the Minister will recall, it was the clear view of the European Scrutiny Committee that clause 18 was unnecessary. I am glad to say that a conversation in which I engaged today with one of my&#8212;let us call him&#8212;long-standing contestants in matters European, Lord Howe of Aberavon, confirmed that he shared our view. I have great respect for his legal knowledge, and I am delighted that we have achieved such a degree of understanding.</p>
	<p pid="b.94.0/3">The Government are embarking on what is, in matters constitutional, an extremely dangerous path to tread: a primrose path that could lead to disaster. I know that there was a great deal of detailed discussion&#8212;I hear of these things&#8212;with Lord MacKay of Clashfern, who, after all, used to be Lord Chancellor, and indeed was Lord Chancellor at the time of the Maastricht treaty. I remember well, as I am sure he does, that the whole business of European government was conceded, to our deep regret; hence the rebellion which I had the pleasure to lead.</p>
	<p pid="b.94.0/4">The Government appear to have been caught on the horns of a dilemma, and I think that they should have dealt with that in a different way. On one hand they are confronted with the European Scrutiny Committee, the expert legal advice that it has received, the further consideration that it has given to these questions throughout the intervening period, and its conclusion that clause 18 is unnecessary and undesirable. On the other hand&#8212;the other horn of the dilemma&#8212;is the view of Lord MacKay of Clashfern that the amendment is merely declaratory.</p>
	<p pid="b.94.0/5">Unfortunately, in taking the line of least resistance&#8212;which, I am afraid, is their hallmark in matters European&#8212;the Government have fallen between two stools, and impaled themselves on the horns of the dilemma. I think that Members should feel impelled, as I do&#8212;for very sound reasons, which I shall now explain&#8212;to vote against the Government&#8217;s amendments and echo the concern expressed by the European Scrutiny Committee, which was supported by powerful advice.</p>
	<p pid="b.94.0/6">As I have said, our Committee took a great deal of evidence from some very distinguished constitutional and legal experts. It is all on the record, and we need not go into the detail&#8212;what we need to discuss is what has happened since then&#8212;but I will say that, as Chairman of the Committee, I ensured that the evidence was evenly balanced. We weighed up all the evidence from the greatest experts who could possibly express a view on the subject, and reached conclusions that were supported by the majority of that evidence.</p>
	<p pid="b.94.0/7">The Committee took the view that the principle of parliamentary supremacy should not be declared in statute, and that using the words</p>
	<p pid="b.94.0/8">&#8220;It is only by virtue of an Act of Parliament that&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.94.0/9">in a statutory provision such as clause 18 is tantamount to stating that there shall be parliamentary supremacy. However, the very stating of that undermines the central</p>
	<p pid="b.94.0/10">premise, which is that it does not need to be stated, and the danger of stating it is that, ultimately, the Supreme Court will be allowed into this sacrosanct arena.</p>
	<p pid="b.94.0/11">We are not talking about some technicality; we are talking about the very reasons for the existence of this House of Commons. Law is passed on the basis of views that are taken in a freely elected democratic assembly, which themselves refer to the decisions made by the electors in a general election. The issue of parliamentary sovereignty in the context of the European Union is that ever since Maastricht, and to some extent before it, decisions made, for example, by majority vote have often proved inimical to policies espoused by elements of the Conservative party, and indeed by our manifesto.</p>
	<p pid="b.94.0/12">One simple example is the repatriation of powers. The Government are faced with a conflict. In December 2005, when the Conservatives were in opposition, the present Prime Minister said that there should be a repatriation of social and employment legislation. Both Back Benchers and those now in the Government&#8212;including the Minister for Europe&#8212;opposed the Lisbon treaty in every respect. For the first time since 1972, the party was totally united. Now we find ourselves in the difficult position of being confronted with amendments that would allow an infringement of sovereignty, subject to final interpretation by the courts. The reversal of the hierarchy of norms that parliamentary supremacy implies is itself put at risk by the wording that the Government have chosen in their attempt to balance the views of Lord Mackay of Clashfern and the European Scrutiny Committee. The Government have chosen the easy way out, but it is not going to be easy&#8212;or, indeed, of any value whatever. It is extremely damaging to the national interest and the constitutional status of this House of Parliament. It may seem to be a few words, but unfortunately this issue has profound consequences.</p>
	<p pid="b.94.0/13">The debate in the House of Lords could be said to have shown that a legitimate confusion can arise from enshrining in statute an unnecessary declaratory statement. To quote a former first parliamentary counsel&#8217;s comment: &#8220;unnecessary words turn septic.&#8221; Unnecessary words do not turn Eurosceptic; rather, they turn septic. That is what first parliamentary counsel said and, unfortunately, that is what both the Government&#8217;s amendment to the amendment of Lord Mackay of Clashfern and his amendment itself achieve. They create a kind of septicaemia in the adjudication of matters of sovereignty, and will give the courts the purchase that was originally implied in the explanatory notes, which referred to the common law principle. We went into this matter both earlier in the debate and in our report. When the Bill went to the House of Lords, the Government took the infamous reference to the &#8220;common principle&#8221; out of their explanatory notes&#8212;I give them credit for having listened to us on that. They did so because they knew of the dangers inherent in respect of the courts, and certain members of the Supreme Court who have an increasing tendency to make certain comments, as expressed in the Jackson case and Lord Bingham&#8217;s criticism, by name, of the judges involved. He was extremely upset and concerned, and for very good reasons.</p>
	<p pid="b.94.0/14">Two additional problems arise from the fact that Lord Mackay&#8217;s amendment refers to the European Communities Act 1972. First, let me stress that my comments here should not be taken to prejudice the remarks I have already made that it is not about the 1972 Act exceptionally, but rather that Parliament has</p>
	<p pid="b.94.0/15">voluntarily agreed, as Lord Bridge said in the Factortame case, to incorporate that Act and therefore to allow all the consequences that flow from it, which are accumulating and, in my view, are extremely damaging to the United Kingdom and the people of this country in their daily lives. If we specify &#8220;European Communities Act 1972&#8221; rather than &#8220;an Act of Parliament&#8221;, an argument can properly be made that we are, effectively, disabling Parliament from giving effect to European law in future by means other than the European Communities Act&#8212;or, in other words, by a new Act. This is the law of unintended consequences, but made much more serious given the context of parliamentary supremacy.</p>
	<p pid="b.94.0/16">The other problem is a technical question about an important issue relating to statutory interpretation. However much we in this House may wish to regard this matter as just a matter of debate, unfortunately when it gets into the clutches of the courts and certain elements in the Supreme Court who have a tendency to want to push the envelope on these issues, the reality is that it ceases to be a technical question, and becomes a very important constitutional question. I state unequivocally that that has led me to the view that I have to resist the Government&#8217;s amendment, and I urge other Members to do the same. If we specify &#8220;European Communities Act 1972&#8221;, a question arises as to whether that reference would cover future amendments to that Act after this Bill is enacted.</p>
	<p pid="b.94.0/17">I am going into the details of all this because I want them to be on the record; the devil is in the detail. The Interpretation Act 1978 is the basis on which I believe the provision under discussion will be interpreted by the courts. Once it has left this House with these offensive words in it, as prescribed by Lord Mackay of Clashfern and the advice he has given to the House of Lords, it will become the law of the land and will then ultimately end up in the Supreme Court, with extremely unpredictable unintended consequences. There will then be a very dangerous situation. That is why I am taking the trouble to set all this out. The Supreme Court also has an obligation to consider what has been said in Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="b.94.0/18">Turning to the point about statutory interpretation, as I have said the question arises as to whether the reference to the European Communities Act 1972 would cover future amendments to it after this Bill has been enacted. Section 20(2) of the Interpretation Act is ambiguous on this very difficult point, as is said in Francis Bennion&#8217;s superb volume on statutory interpretation. Section 20 provides:</p>
	<p pid="b.94.0/19">&#8220;Where an Act refers to an enactment, the reference, unless the contrary intention appears, is a reference to that enactment as amended, and includes a reference thereto as extended or applied, by or under any other enactment, including any other provision of that Act.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.94.0/20">In a case on an analogous provision in a tax statute, the court in question held that applying it to future amendments was to give it</p>
	<p pid="b.94.0/21">&#8220;a width of application which the wording, at best equivocal, could not bear, especially in a taxing statute.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.94.0/22">The Lords amendment therefore raises a doubt about whether clause 18 will apply to future amendments of the European Communities Act 1972 and consequently raises an unnecessary doubt about the application of the principle of dualism to such future amendments&#8212;in other words, opening the door to interpretation by the courts on this fundamental question.</p>

	<p pid="b.97.1/1">Effectively yes, and that is the one thing we wanted to avoid above all else. That is why the Committee took the view that it did on clause 18, as shared by Lord Howe of Aberavon, who is by no means a Eurosceptic. On a matter of clear interpretation after very considerable consideration&#8212;he is both a former Foreign Secretary and distinguished Queen&#8217;s counsel who brought the European Communities Act into being in the House of Commons in 1972&#8212;he says that clause 18 is completely unnecessary. He agrees with the Committee, and now, for the sake of trying to counter-balance the views of Lord Mackay of Clashfern, the Government are falling into the trap that I have described and making the potential for interpretation by the courts extremely dangerous.</p>
	<p pid="b.97.1/2">If there is to be a clause 18, for the reasons that I have outlined, the version that went to the Lords from the Commons should be preferred to the Lords amendment in the name of Lord Mackay of Clashfern. As I proposed in the amendment to Government amendment (b), the words &#8220;Act of Parliament&#8221; are to be preferred to &#8220;the European Communities Act 1972&#8221;. The Government&#8217;s amendment addresses these issues, but it would be much better not to state the principle at all; the amendment fails to deal with the trap that has been set. I know Lord Mackay of Clashfern to be a distinguished and canny Scots lawyer, and he understands exactly what he intends. He has, by the most clever sleight of hand, reinserted into the provision<i>&#8212;[Interruption.]</i> I see the Minister shaking his head and I shall give way to him.</p>

For example, I remember during the Maastricht proceedings that the noble Lord was quite clear on the question of whether the Maastricht treaty took us further and deeper into the integration process. He argued that it did not make any difference in principle because the 1972 Act already conceded that there had been a change in the constitutional position and, to all intents and purposes, there was, thus, no real change in the substance of the issue. That is not to accuse anybody; it is merely to recognise that they have a constitutional viewpoint and to recognise how they really regard the encroachments on our sovereignty, which were evident in the Jackson case, in the evidence that the Committee received from many distinguished witnesses and in the fact that the Government&#8217;s previous explanatory notes led us into a situation where we criticised the Government and they withdrew the offensive words, precisely for the reasons that I am presenting.</p>
	<p pid="b.97.3/2">The reality is that we have caught out the Government on their wording and they have now acquiesced in other wording which opens the door to statutory interpretation by the Supreme Court. That is the kernel of this matter. Whether or not my right hon. Friend the Minister really likes the way in which I have expressed this is neither here nor there. The real question, on which I challenge him, is this: does he deny that the wording in the Government&#8217;s amendment, in response to the Lords amendment, imports the opportunity for the Supreme Court to apply statutory interpretation and, thereby, to create a situation that could be best avoided, as set out by Lord Howe of Aberavon, our European Scrutiny Committee and the evidence that we received from so many people, by having no clause at all, rather than the current clause 18?</p>
	<p pid="b.97.3/3">The Minister knows that I feel very strongly about the fact that we promised in our manifesto a sovereignty Act, and that was the consequence of discussions at the very highest level with the leadership. We knew that that was put into the manifesto as a direct response to the promises that were made. The bottom line is that we were given a second-rate provision that is unnecessary and that has since been criticised by the European Scrutiny Committee and eminent constitutional experts, including Lord Howe of Aberavon, and what the Government are introducing merely acquiesces to a degree in what Lord Mackay of Clashfern has proposed. That simply is not good enough and the Government should withdraw the proposed clause while they have the opportunity to do so. It is for those reasons that I shall be voting against it.</p>

	<p pid="b.98.0/1">This long debate, which has taken place over a number of months, has almost come full circle. I recall that we began our deliberations with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40584" name="William Cash">the hon. Member for Stone (Mr Cash)</phrase> and others saying that what had been originally promised was a sovereignty Act but what was proposed was a truncated, boiled-down and diluted version of their intention in the form of a solitary clause&#8212;clause 18. Whichever permutation of clause 18 one looks at, be it what was originally suggested by the Government, the Lords amendment or the Government amendment to the Lords amendment, one finds that it is basically a declaratory statement. It does not take us back or forward; it is a pious declaration, a statement of fact and a statement of the legal position at the moment. Therefore, it does not do any harm and, in fact, it could possibly be useful.</p>
	<p pid="b.98.0/2">There has been a modest change of emphasis in Government amendment (b) to the Lords amendment, and it is a sensible one. The words &#8220;by virtue of an Act of Parliament&#8221; were omitted from the Lords amendment and we were concerned that the emphasis was being placed solely on the 1972 Act. Although we recognise that that is the most important piece of legislation regarding the primacy of European law, other items of legislation are involved here. I was particularly pleased that the Minister referred to the legislation on the devolved institutions, as that is important in ensuring that we take a comprehensive approach. Therefore, the Government have put forward a modest improvement to what was suggested by the Lords. I recognise that they have gone some way towards accommodating what the Lords have said and I welcome that, which is why we will be supporting the Government amendment.</p>

	<p pid="b.99.0/1">Is the hon. Gentleman actually saying that he agrees with the Government&#8217;s proposal, notwithstanding what has been said by the European Scrutiny Committee, Lord Howe of Aberavon and all the other people I have mentioned, and notwithstanding the most powerful legal advice that has been submitted, which suggests that this is a very unwise and dangerous move, for the reasons that I have set out?</p>

	<p pid="b.99.1/1">With all due respect, I say to the hon. Gentleman that I have read in great detail all the evidence that was given to the European Scrutiny Committee and I think that his summation of it is his interpretation of the evidence given. Most of the witnesses to the European Scrutiny Committee said, as I have said, that clause 18 is a statement of fact and that it does not take us forward or back. Therefore, we should not get hot under the collar about it.</p>

	<p pid="b.99.2/1">I do not wish to detain the House for more than a few minutes. I had not intended to take part in this debate, as I took part extensively in the debate on clause 18 in Committee and I thought that we had covered all the issues then. I had become reconciled to accepting the clause as the Government had drafted it and I came to today&#8217;s debate expecting my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40584" name="William Cash">the Member for Stone (Mr Cash)</phrase> to make a technical argument, but one that would not necessarily excite me&#8212;of course I was wrong. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40137" name="Wayne David">The hon. Member for Caerphilly (Mr David)</phrase> says that the clause does not take us back and it does not take us forward, but he has missed the fundamental point about the revised drafting of the clause. I am not a lawyer&#8212;I am an amateur lawyer&#8212;but ever since we started discussing this clause earlier this year, I have had the sinking feeling that we are in very deep water and that we are potentially creating completely unnecessary problems for this House and for Parliament. I say that because the sovereignty of Parliament is axiomatic; it is self-evident and it is a historical fact.</p>
	<p pid="b.99.2/2">We do not need to legislate in any way to maintain the sovereignty of Parliament. There would have been some virtue in a declaratory Act with the legal effect of returning powers to the United Kingdom from the European Union to redress our relationship so that we had the ability to negotiate, but this clause, which has erroneously been nicknamed the &#8220;sovereignty&#8221; clause but is no such thing, does not even attempt to do that. In fact, it does not even refer to the word &#8220;sovereignty&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.99.2/3">The clause puts in statute issues that are contested by the European Union legal structures in a context that means that the Supreme Court might have to interpret them. We know that some justices of our Supreme Court question the very notion of the sovereignty of Parliament as I have described it and think it is a matter of common law rather than of history and fact. I believe they are wrong and that Parliament will always be able to prove them wrong by legislating, as statute law always overrides common law.</p>

	<p pid="b.99.3/1">Would my hon. Friend be interested to know that I was talking to an extremely eminent lawyer, although I hesitate to say who it was, and when he heard my arguments on clause 18, he said, &#8220;If a majority of the justices of the Supreme Court took the view that you are taking, it would be open to Parliament the next</p>
	<p pid="b.99.3/2">day&#8221;&#8212;he used those words&#8212;&#8220;to reverse that&#8221;? That troubles me, because if that happened it would precipitate a 100% crisis.</p>

	<p pid="b.100.0/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend for drawing the House&#8217;s attention to that conversation. We are potentially engaged in the early skirmishes of a dispute between Parliament and the judiciary about which has supremacy. By legislating on this issue, which touches on the sovereignty of the Queen in Parliament, we are tempting the justices of the Supreme Court to begin toying with those concepts. They have already done so in some of their ancillary statements to cases&#8212;I forget the right word for such statements. We know that they are tempted in that direction and putting this clause into statute, as the evidence received by the European Scrutiny Committee showed, could be the red rag to the bull, providing meat for the justices of the Supreme Court to chew on.</p>

	<p pid="b.100.2/1">I am just coming to the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s point.</p>
	<p pid="b.100.2/2">I was minded to accept that we had done such a thing before I heard my hon. Friend the Member for Stone speak, but he has described how the situation might have been made worse than it would have been under the previous drafting of the clause. He referred to section 20 of the Interpretation Act 1978, which, if I understand it correctly, already stipulates that when an Act is referred to in an Act of Parliament that Act is deemed not to be constantly updated by subsequent amendments. The Act referred to in an Act of Parliament stands as it stood at the time of enactment and by specifying the European Communities Act 1972 in this clause we are opening up the possibility that at some stage in the future the 1972 Act will be amended but this clause will not apply to the amended Act or to the amendments to the Act, but only to the Act as it stands now. Should there be a dispute between the Supreme Court and Parliament about the sovereignty issues that touch on our relationship with the European Union, the question would be left open with more ambiguity rather than less.</p>
	<p pid="b.100.2/3">Given that we started from an entirely unsatisfactory position, I must say that I will support my hon. Friend the Member for Stone in the Lobby tonight if his amendment is put to a vote. It is important to put it on the record that the situation is unsatisfactory, that it is not as we wanted it to be when we set out our manifesto and that we are possibly making the situation worse. If we accept the amendment from the other place, we might make the situation even worse, and the very fact that my right hon. Friend the Minister has adjusted his position to accommodate the wording from the other place adds to the sinking feeling that the Government do not stand on stable legal ground and that they can be pushed around by extremely able, intelligent and clever people who nevertheless have a different view from my right hon. Friend and I on the question of our future relationship with the European Union. I am left uneasy and I want to register that unease tonight.</p>

Friends the Members for Stone (Mr Cash) and for Harwich and North Essex (Mr Jenkin) for their participation in the debate and I shall be brief in my response.

	<p pid="b.101.1/1">Before the Minister goes on, may I cast his mind back to the trenchant criticism from the European Scrutiny Committee about the explanatory notes that accompanied the Bill and, in particular, those on clause 18? I seem to recall the Minister giving the House a commitment that the explanatory notes would be examined and, if necessary, redrafted. Has that redrafting occurred and will there be further redrafting in the context of his amendment tonight?</p>

	<p pid="b.101.2/1">The explanatory notes were changed when they were reprinted before the Bill was introduced in the House of Lords, just as I gave the House an undertaking that they would be. We amended the notes to make it clear that the references to common law in the relevant section were meant in contradistinction to statute law and that we were not commenting, as a Government and in either the Bill or the notes, on the important but much broader philosophical debate about the origins of parliamentary sovereignty.</p>
	<p pid="b.101.2/2">Let me deal first with the point of general principle to which my hon. Friend the Member for Stone, in particular, referred. It has always been the Government&#8217;s position that clause 18 is declaratory of the existing state of our law in making it clear that European Union law has direct effect and application in this country for one reason and one reason only: namely, Parliament has given it that effect through primary legislation. I differ from my hon. Friend in that I continue to believe that it is valuable for us to have this declaratory clause on the statute book to serve as a clear expression of Parliament&#8217;s will and as an abiding point of reference for the courts if they are invited in future to consider again the sort of arguments that have previously been brought before them, most notably by the prosecution in the metric martyrs case, to the effect that European law has acquired over time an autonomous authority of its own that does not derive from Acts of Parliament.</p>

	<p pid="b.101.3/1">May I say how grateful I am that my right hon. Friend has given this clear statement of the Government&#8217;s and Parliament&#8217;s intent? We appear to have disappeared into such esoterica that even for one who takes a close interest in the clause it is almost impossible to understand the debate. Will the Minister confirm that should judges need to rule on this clause, they will be able to refer to <i>Hansard</i> to be absolutely clear what Parliament&#8217;s intent was?</p>

	<p pid="b.101.4/1">Judges will of course look first at statute but it is also the case, following the Pepper <i>v.</i> Hart judgment, that if the courts are in any way uncertain about the meaning of a piece of legislation, they can look at what the Minister of the day said on behalf of the Government, as recorded in <i>Hansard</i>, as an aid to interpretation.</p>

	<p pid="b.102.1/1">My hon. Friend has made his point. Not only Lord Mackay but the Lords Constitution Committee recognised that clause 18 is a reflection of the existing position in United Kingdom law. I do not want to get into a long argument with my hon. Friend the Member for Stone about the report of the European Scrutiny Committee, but that report focused largely on the bigger question of whether parliamentary sovereignty was a common-law principle. I repeat to the House what I said during Committee&#8212;that this clause does not get into that issue at all. It makes clear the basis on which European law takes effect in our domestic legal order.</p>
	<p pid="b.102.1/2">Let me address the detailed point that has been put. Both my hon. Friends the Members for Stone and for Harwich and North Essex argued that the reference to the 1972 Act taken together with the Interpretation Act meant there was a risk of future amendments to the 1972 Act falling outside the scope of clause 18. This point was specifically considered in the drafting of the Government&#8217;s amendments to the Lords amendment. That is exactly why the Government&#8217;s amendments, especially amendment (b), do not limit the clause to the 1972 Act but also take account of all Acts that might give rise to directly applicable and enforceable EU law, which will include any Acts amending the 1972 Act. I hope that with that reassurance colleagues on both sides of the House will be able to endorse the Government&#8217;s amendments.</p>

	Rights and Protection of Victims
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-07-11b.111.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40513" speakername="Kenneth Clarke" speakeroffice="The Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice"  colnum="111"  time="020:58:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110711/debtext/110711-0003.htm#11071150002234">
	<p pid="b.111.1/1" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move,</p>
	<p pid="b.111.1/2" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">That this House takes note of European Union Documents No. 10610/11 and Addenda 1 and 2 relating to the Draft Directive establishing minimum standards on the rights, support and protection of victims of crime, No. 10613/11 and Addenda 1 and 2 relating to the Draft Regulation on mutual recognition of protection measures in civil matters, No. 10612/11 and Addenda 1 and 2 relating to a Commission Communication&#8211;strengthening victims&#8217; rights in the EU and the unnumbered Explanatory Memorandum dated <phrase class="date" code="2011-05-16">16 May 2011</phrase> relating to a Council Resolution on a Roadmap for strengthening the rights and protection of victims, in particular in criminal proceedings; and welcomes the opportunity to consider views on whether the UK should opt in to the draft Directive establishing minimum standards on the rights, support and protection of victims and the Draft Regulation on mutual recognition of protection measures in civil matters.</p>
	<p pid="b.111.1/3">I thank the European Scrutiny Committee for calling the debate. The Government are currently actively considering in detail the European Commission&#8217;s proposals on victims, and in particular whether the United Kingdom should opt into the proposed directive on victims and regulation on protection orders. There has already been some scrutiny of the protection order regulation, but it is useful to have this opportunity to hear Members&#8217; views on the proposals on the Floor of the House, to inform our decisions.</p>
	<p pid="b.111.1/4">The Government are obviously committed to supporting the victims of crime. One of the main objects of the criminal justice system, as well as punishing those guilty of serious criminal offences, is offering protection and support to the victims of crime. We welcome the priority that the European Commission is giving the matter and the further impetus provided by the Hungarian Government, who will hold the presidency of the European Union for the second half of this year. There was a Budapest declaration setting out their intention, supported by the Council of the European Union, to deal with various matters concerning the victims of crime in the course of their presidency.</p>
	<p pid="b.111.1/5">I am glad to say that this country is seen by the Commission as an example of best practice on supporting victims. The Government hope to strengthen what we do, but there is no doubt that we are well ahead of the vast majority of members of the European Union in what we do now.</p>
	<p pid="b.111.1/6">The thing that the House should particularly have regard to is that our own citizens are increasingly travelling and working across the EU. If a British citizen is unfortunate enough to fall victim to crime in another member state, I do not think that they always get the level of support that they would expect in similar circumstances in the United Kingdom. The Government see one of the main attractions of this package of work as, among other things, helping our citizens to get the full support that they ought to have in a modern and civilised state when they are victims of crime. We want to ensure that British citizens are provided with the information, support and protection that they rightly expect to receive when they fall victim to crime in any EU member state.</p>
	<p pid="b.111.1/7">My officials have been working with the Commission to share our experiences of supporting victims, and to consider how the existing EU framework agreement on</p>
	<p pid="b.111.1/8">the subject might be improved. The Commission, I am glad to say, has taken on board many of our suggestions in its recent proposals. I am especially pleased that the proposed directive takes into account the particular role of victims in our common law system. We encounter drafting problems at least in quite a lot of proposals in this field, because, like the Irish, Cypriots and Maltese, we tend to have a common law system, whereas the rest of Europe does not. It is necessary to ensure that the procedural differences and the practices of different countries are respected in such proposals.</p>
	<p pid="b.111.1/9">The Government are committed to targeting resources towards those victims who need them the most. We continue to develop our own proposals on victims&#8212;we hope to come forward with some in the autumn&#8212;but meanwhile, we will continue to work with our European partners to ensure that any EU action on victims supports our approach. We are particularly trying to ensure that any requirements imposed upon or accepted by member states are proportionate to the needs of victims and properly targeted on those with the most important needs.</p>
	<p pid="b.111.1/10">I wait to hear whether there are any objections in principle to the objectives being pursued by the Commission and the Hungarian presidency, and the vast majority of the member states on the European Council&#8212;as far as I am aware, that means all member states on the Council&#8212;but I think they are unlikely. It is plainly desirable that we consider spreading best practice across the Union when it comes to protecting victims of any nationality who have the misfortune to fall prey to crime in any of our countries. However, I look forward to hearing the views of right hon. and hon. Members on any particular aspects of the package of proposals before us to which they want to draw the House&#8217;s and the Government&#8217;s attention.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-07-11b.112.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40373" speakername="Stephen Twigg" colnum="112"  time="021:03:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110711/debtext/110711-0003.htm#11071150002235">
	<p pid="b.112.0/1">I welcome the opportunity for the House to debate this important draft European Union directive. I am sure that Members on both sides of the House will have constituents who have been affected by crimes elsewhere in the EU, and I want to take this opportunity to share with the House the case of my constituents, Lesley and Steve Dunne, which highlights the very serious shortcomings in current practice and legislation.</p>
	<p pid="b.112.0/2">I echo the Secretary of State&#8217;s opening remarks. As he said, we want proper support that reflects our modern and civilised state. He also said that we should require a directive to be both proportionate and properly targeted, and I very much agree with him on that. Mr and Mrs Dunne were badly let down by the legal system in Spain. They had lived there and their son Gary was murdered there in 2006. It took the family three years to have their son&#8217;s body repatriated to the United Kingdom. Throughout their campaign to have his body returned, Mr and Mrs Dunne, whom I now count as good friends, showed great courage, fortitude and incredible dignity in the face of the many barriers and hurdles to securing what most families would take for granted&#8212;being able to bury their son.</p>
	<p pid="b.112.0/3">The draft directive before the House will go some way to addressing some of the problems that they faced and which other families have faced as well. It seeks to ensure that member states recognise that, where a person&#8217;s death has been caused by a criminal offence, the family</p>
	<p pid="b.112.0/4">members are to be defined as victims. Mr and Mrs Dunne were not treated with the respect that the House would expect for the parents of a murdered son. The Secretary of State was right that in many regards this country is at the forefront of best practice in the treatment of victims. We have a long way to go, but compared with the experience in Spain that I am outlining, we are well advanced. The draft directive sets a minimum standard for access to information and support. If this is adopted successfully across the EU, I sincerely hope that other families affected by the death of a loved one in Europe will not have to endure what Mr and Mrs Dunne have.</p>
	<p pid="b.112.0/5">Steve and Lee Dunne learned of their son&#8217;s murder not from the Spanish or British authorities, but from a friend in Spain who had heard of the murderer&#8217;s arrest not from the Spanish authorities, but from another friend who had read about it in the local press. When Steve and Lee received a call from the authorities informing them that the perpetrator had been arrested, they flew immediately to Spain in the belief that it meant that Gary&#8217;s body could be repatriated for a funeral in their home city of Liverpool. This was not the case, however. They flew to Spain, where they discovered that they had been called there simply for the courts to ask them whether they wanted the suspect prosecuted. The suspect had fled Spain to evade capture.</p>
	<p pid="b.112.0/6">Mr and Mrs Dunne were appalled. They had not been properly advised of the reason they had been called to Spain. As far as they were concerned, of course they wanted their son&#8217;s alleged murderer to face justice in a Spanish court. I hope that the provisions on information and support in the draft directive will ensure that in the future clear information will be given to families in similar situations. This lack of access to information was compounded by the absence of officially provided translators or interpreters during the prosecution. I am pleased therefore that this specific issue is covered in the draft directive. Lee and Steve ended up having to hire translators and interpreters at their own expense, which has contributed to them incurring costs in the region of &#163;40,000 to run their ultimately successful campaign to secure Gary&#8217;s repatriation. I will return to that point in a moment.</p>
	<p pid="b.112.0/7">This lack of financial support was exacerbated by the lack of victim support. Legal aid was neither offered nor available. No counselling or bereavement support was available to help the family through what inevitably was a difficult and traumatic time.</p>
	<p pid="b.112.0/8">That the draft directive seeks to treat the families of murder victims as victims themselves is a welcome recognition of the very real personal dangers that families can be exposed to when they pursue prosecution in other countries. Mr and Mrs Dunne certainly felt that their safety was at risk on a number of occasions during the judicial process in Spain. For example, unpleasant threats were made by acquaintances of the accused during the proceedings, and they felt that there was a lack of support and information about what was going on throughout the trial.</p>
	<p pid="b.112.0/9">Steve and Lee have not received financial support from the Spanish authorities towards meeting the costs that they incurred in their attempts to repatriate their late son&#8217;s body. Members of the public in this country, particularly in Liverpool, have given generously in donations, which have offered some assistance to the family, but as I said earlier, they incurred significant</p>
	<p pid="b.112.0/10">costs of more than &#163;40,000 simply trying to secure the burial of their son. They eventually learned that they had been granted compensation by the Spanish court of &#163;125,000, to be paid by the perpetrator, but they did not find out about it until two years after the ruling had been made to award the compensation. So far, they have received less than &#163;1,500 of the &#163;125,000 that they were granted, and the payments have now stopped.</p>
	<p pid="b.112.0/11">This highlights two problems that are addressed by the draft directive. The first is the very limited progress that has been made in getting the compensation to the family; I shall return to that matter later. The second is the fact that the information channels were so poor that they did not find out about the granting of the compensation until two years after the decision, in a period in which the family was struggling financially owing to having had to raise the money to fight their case to have their son&#8217;s body returned.</p>
	<p pid="b.112.0/12">Mr and Mrs Dunne came to London to visit Parliament earlier today, in advance of tonight&#8217;s debate. They asked me to describe their ordeal in this way to demonstrate the appalling shortcomings in the system. They are tireless campaigners whose drive, courage and determination to prevent any other family from going through what they went through are an inspiration to us all. As well as campaigning on the issues that we are discussing this evening, they have visited schools across Merseyside to educate young people about the dangers of knife crime.</p>
	<p pid="b.112.0/13">Gary Dunne&#8217;s body was ultimately returned for a family funeral in Liverpool in 2009. On behalf of the family, I place on record their appreciation of the hard work of the Member of the European Parliament for North West England, Arlene McCarthy, and of my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40361" name="Andy Burnham">the Member for Leigh (Andy Burnham)</phrase>, both of whom raised Gary&#8217;s case consistently throughout the family&#8217;s ordeal. They raised the case with the then Prime Minister, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40348" name="Gordon Brown">the Member for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath (Mr Brown)</phrase>, who responded to the campaign by raising Mr and Mrs Dunne&#8217;s situation directly with the Spanish Prime Minister, Se&#241;or Zapatero, who intervened personally. That intervention resulted in the repatriation of Gary&#8217;s body. That was clearly a welcome development for the Dunne family, but it cannot be right that they had to go through three years of heartache before they could bury their son, or that they secured his repatriation only after a vigorous campaign that culminated in the British Prime Minister raising the case with his Spanish counterpart.</p>
	<p pid="b.112.0/14">Last October, I raised the case with the present Prime Minister, and I was delighted that he agreed to meet Mr and Mrs Dunne. That meeting took place in January this year, when they had the opportunity to raise with him the changes that they wished to see that would ensure that no other family would have to go through what they had been through. They told the Prime Minister about their long-fought struggle and about both the shortcomings that I have described in the Spanish system and the shortcomings in the British consular services, in terms of the support offered to them and other families affected by the loss of a loved one overseas, and in particular in the European Union, which is what we are addressing this evening. It was a positive meeting, and the Prime Minister agreed to address those shortcomings, suggesting that there may be opportunities for a pilot scheme for improved consular services. Mr and Mrs Dunne agreed that their case</p>
	<p pid="b.112.0/15">could be used as a test case&#8212;an example case&#8212;to set up training programmes to ensure that British consular services give sufficient support to British families on the ground, particularly given that those families are themselves victims, as the directive describes them.</p>
	<p pid="b.112.0/16">As the Secretary of State said, the proposed directive seeks to address the shortcomings in the current 2001 Council framework decision on the standing of victims in criminal proceedings. I know that Members from across the House will be moved by the case of my constituents, Mr and Mrs Dunne, whose treatment throughout the past five years has been truly appalling. An opt-in to the directive would go some way towards ensuring that others do not go through similar experiences in future. Not all the issues that have affected Mr and Mrs Dunne are covered by the draft directive. Some of them relate to United Kingdom policy in practice&#8212;I have referred to consular support. Frankly, some of them are challenges for Spain&#8212;for Spanish law and Spanish practice on the repatriation of bodies, compensation and access to justice. I will be seeking a meeting with the Spanish ambassador in London to press for Mr and Mrs Dunne&#8217;s compensation to be paid in full and immediately.</p>
	<p pid="b.112.0/17">I welcome the opportunity to share the appalling experience of my constituents Mr and Mrs Dunne with the House this evening and to pay tribute to them for their campaign, their fortitude and how they have turned their grief into something positive, so that other families do not have to go through what they went through. I thank the Government for giving me this opportunity to address this important subject.</p>

	<p pid="b.115.0/1">I pay tribute to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40373" name="Stephen Twigg">the hon. Member for Liverpool, West Derby (Stephen Twigg)</phrase> for giving a very moving speech.</p>
	<p pid="b.115.0/2">I address the Chamber as chairman of the all-party group on retail and business crime, and, by virtue of that, as someone concerned about victims of crime, both at home and abroad. Although there are some parts of our criminal justice system that can clearly be improved on, I understand from the organisation Victim Support&#8212;we heard this point earlier, too&#8212;that we generally enjoy a better standard of treatment for victims of crime than is the case across Europe. It does not take a huge stretch of the imagination to realise that victims of crime are at their most vulnerable when they are abroad. Perhaps they do not speak the language, and they would probably have little idea of where to go, what to do, or even what processes are in place to assist them in the event of crime. Moreover, many unscrupulous criminals specifically target foreign nationals&#8212;tourists in particular&#8212;for those very reasons.</p>
	<p pid="b.115.0/3">In this instance, I feel that EU support would benefit the British abroad, so I call on the Government to support the draft directive in question, which deals with a minimum standard of treatment for victims of crime across Europe. Indeed, it has been carefully argued by the charity Victim Support that the directive would benefit the British at home also. I would not usually back EU interference&#8212;the EU meddles in so much that it should not meddle in, plus it is a ridiculous, wasteful organisation and unnecessarily bureaucratic&#8212;but in</p>
	<p pid="b.115.0/4">this instance it has actually come up with something that should be addressed for the common European good. With regard to offenders&#8217; release dates, the directive would certainly increase the rights of victims in the UK. At present, a victim has the right to know only when an offender has been released from custody in the case of sexual or violent crime where an offender has been sentenced to more than 12 months in custody. The directive would extend that right to all victims.</p>

	<p pid="b.116.0/1">I am listening with great interest to my hon. Friend. I very much applaud and welcome his and the Government&#8217;s intent, but does he realise that we could achieve the same end without opting in to this EU directive? We could negotiate a separate arrangement with opt-outs, which would not be available under an EU directive.</p>

	<p pid="b.116.1/1">I thank my hon. Friend for his intervention, but I am afraid that he is sadly mistaken, for various reasons that I shall come to. I agree that the EU quite often meddles unnecessarily, but occasionally some standardisation across Europe is welcome, and this is one of those situations.</p>
	<p pid="b.116.1/2">I mentioned that our system of victim support is better than those of other countries around Europe, but this position is by no means assured. After all, it has been eroded in several key areas. One is the example of funding for Victim Support&#8212;a charity that provides an invaluable service to victims of crime. Its funding has been cut, which is a great shame. Also, over a number of years, we have seen certain crimes such as shoplifting downgraded. Indeed, the Sentencing Commission does not formally recognise the vulnerability of shop workers as particular victims of crime, despite last year being a record period for crimes committed in shops, ranging from shoplifting to murders in the process of robbery. The Government could also do more to support the private sector in schemes such as Facewatch, piloted in London by the Metropolitan police and now spreading across the UK.</p>
	<p pid="b.116.1/3">Victims of crime currently have the right to receive a basic level of service for each criminal justice agency under the code of practice for victims of crime. Everything that victims are entitled to under the code is pretty basic and the sort of thing that one would assume victims would receive automatically. The Government, however, have already removed the duty on local criminal justice boards to report their compliance with the victims code, which means no one is monitoring compliance with the code or holding agencies to account when they fail to comply with it. There is a danger that the Government will seek to downgrade the code or abolish it altogether. That would mean that a victim of crime would have no statutory right to a decent level of service from the criminal justice system. Abolishing or downgrading the code would be a serious retrograde step that would turn the clock back on victims&#8217; rights.</p>

	<p pid="b.116.2/1">I would like to give my hon. Friend an assurance on that in case I forget to reply to his point later. We realise that the code needs modernising, but we do not have the faintest intention of repealing or abolishing it. I can give my hon. Friend that assurance straight away&#8212;before some rumour is accidentally set flying.</p>

	<p pid="b.117.0/1">I am most grateful to the Secretary of State for that intervention.

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-07-11b.117.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40584" speakername="William Cash" colnum="117"  time="021:22:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110711/debtext/110711-0003.htm#1107121000675">
	<p pid="b.117.1/1">The Secretary of State and Lord Chancellor made his point clear at the beginning. He might have been slightly concerned that there would be some kind of Division, but as far as I am concerned, there will be nothing of the kind. To me, this debate is about recognising the fact that this is an important issue. Furthermore, I view it as the job of the European Scrutiny Committee to recommend for debate matters of legal or political importance. Nobody is in any doubt that this is a matter of very considerable importance.</p>
	<p pid="b.117.1/2">The communication from the European Commission, &#8220;Strengthening victims&#8217; rights in the EU&#8221;, starts with the question: &#8220;Why do victims matter?&#8221; Let me give a brief indication of what the European Commission states in this particular context. The communication talks about the many millions of people who fall victim to crime. It notes that about</p>
	<p pid="b.117.1/3">&#8220;30 million crimes against persons or property are recorded annually&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.117.1/4">in the EU. It continues:</p>
	<p pid="b.117.1/5">&#8220;Crime often affects more than one victim&#8230;This leads to a qualified estimate that there is likely to be up to 75 million direct victims of crime every year.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.117.1/6">So in quantitative terms, we are talking about something in the order of 75 million people affected.</p>
	<p pid="b.117.1/7">Road accidents are also discussed, with a million across the EU mentioned, along with the loss of 30,700 lives in 2010. People are constantly travelling and moving across borders and it notes that about 11.3 million Europeans are residing</p>
	<p pid="b.117.1/8">&#8220;permanently outside their own home country&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.117.1/9">It mentions that</p>
	<p pid="b.117.1/10">&#8220;10% of Europeans have lived and worked abroad during a period of their lives and 13% have gone abroad for education or training.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.117.1/11">The European Commission states:</p>
	<p pid="b.117.1/12">&#8220;These numbers show the importance of ensuring proper, effective action on the rights of those who fall victim to crime or to road accidents, in their own country or while travelling or living abroad.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.117.1/13">It claims that that is</p>
	<p pid="b.117.1/14">&#8220;both a cross-border and a domestic problem that calls for EU action.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.117.1/15">It also mentions the impact on women in the European Union.</p>
	<p pid="b.117.1/16">The Commission describes compensation as one of the basic needs of victims. In a section headed &#8220;A specific focus on victims of crime&#8212;what do they need?&#8221;, it states:</p>
	<p pid="b.117.1/17">&#8220;Many people fall victim to crime in the EU every year&#8221;,</p>
	<p pid="b.117.1/18">and refers to</p>
	<p pid="b.117.1/19">&#8220;the need to be recognised and treated with respect and dignity&#8221;&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="b.117.1/20">we say amen to that&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="b.117.1/21">&#8220;to be protected and supported; to have access to justice; and to get compensation and restoration.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.117.1/22">On the subject of that compensation and restoration, it states:</p>
	<p pid="b.117.1/23">&#8220;Persons who have suffered harm because of the acts of others often expect to get some form of financial compensation, whether from the State or the offender. Compensation aims at repairing immediate and longer-term financial damage. It may also act as a form of acknowledgement through a symbolic payment.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.117.1/24">It continues:</p>
	<p pid="b.117.1/25">&#8220;Restorative justice, which is a relatively new concept in criminal proceedings, goes beyond purely financial compensation to focus on the recovery of the victim.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.117.1/26">As Chairman of the European Scrutiny Committee, I want to explain a little of the background to the four documents that are before us. I am grateful to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40373" name="Stephen Twigg">the hon. Member for Liverpool, West Derby (Stephen Twigg)</phrase> and to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40324" name="Mike Weatherley">the Member for Hove (Mike Weatherley)</phrase> for their contributions, to which I listened carefully. I was very moved by what the hon. Gentleman said about the difficulties experienced by the Dunne family.</p>
	<p pid="b.117.1/27">The documents comprise part of a package that is a recent initiative to bolster the rights afforded and support given to victims in criminal and civil legal proceedings throughout the European Union. Let me add to what the Minister has said by giving the House the European Scrutiny Committee&#8217;s summary of each of the documents.</p>
	<p pid="b.117.1/28">The road map is a statement by member states of how far they intend to implement the Commission&#8217;s victims&#8217; package, which is quite far. The draft directive, which is binding on member states when implemented, lays down comprehensive and far-reaching rules governing the rights of victims of crime. As I have said, the Commission&#8217;s communication indicates that further legislation on victims&#8217; compensation, and on the law to be applied in cross-border traffic accidents, is in the pipeline. The draft regulation, which is automatically binding on member states once adopted in Brussels, provides for the automatic recognition in all member states of a civil protection order, such as a non-molestation order, granted by a civil court in one member state. A parallel proposal for protection orders granted by criminal courts is also being negotiated, but is not subject to this debate. As I think the Lord Chancellor will confirm, the Government have opted in to that provision.</p>
	<p pid="b.117.1/29">As we have heard, the draft directive and regulation are subject to the opt-in protocol referred to by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40676" name="Steven Baker">the Member for Wycombe (Steve Baker)</phrase>, under which the UK is presumed not to want to be legally bound by them unless it notifies the Commission of the contrary within three months of the publication of the proposals. In the opinion of my Committee, the Government should take into account several factors when making their decision.</p>
	<p pid="b.117.1/30">First, the Government should consider whether the UK can influence negotiations more successfully once it has opted in, and should weigh that possibility against the chance that it could end up being bound by damaging legislation. Secondly&#8212;I think this equally important&#8212;they should consider the financial impact of the proposal. However much we may agree that there is a case for compensation in general terms, I am sure that the sheer range, extent and potential cost concern the Government</p>
	<p pid="b.117.1/31">particularly, given our current position. Lastly, I repeat that once these obligations are imposed on us, they will necessarily give rise to grave financial implications, and that will be the case across the range of the victims I have identified&#8212;as many as 75 million, a figure I put on the record earlier.</p>
	<p pid="b.117.1/32">There is also the question of whether the proposal will require legislative change in the United Kingdom. The Government&#8217;s explanatory memorandum demonstrates that they are broadly in favour of the two legislative proposals but that they need to look at their resource and administrative implications. By contrast, the Government question the need for further legislation on compensating victims. The Secretary of State will, I hope, give us some indication in respect of that before the end of the debate. That is the Government&#8217;s position, but I have already indicated the scale, range and extent of what needs to be done.</p>
	<p pid="b.117.1/33">The European Scrutiny Committee recommended holding this debate for the following reasons: the victims&#8217; package marks a significant changing up of gear in the EU&#8217;s policy on victims; the resource and administrative implications for the UK will be substantial, especially with regard to the regulation, as can be seen from pages 27 to 31 of the relevant report; and, as my hon. Friend the Member for Hove said, the rights of victims in the UK are currently a matter of concern and, at times, controversy.</p>
	<p pid="b.117.1/34">Finally, if this needs saying at all, we ask the Government to consider long and hard the views expressed in this debate before deciding whether to opt in.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-07-11b.119.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40152" speakername="Tom Brake" colnum="119"  time="021:31:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110711/debtext/110711-0003.htm#1107121000676">
	<p pid="b.119.0/1">It gives me great pleasure to be able to make a brief contribution about the road map draft directive and draft regulation. The road map includes a package of proposed legislative measures designed to ensure that all 27 member states, especially some of the poorer performing new and southern states, meet minimum standards in providing for the rights of victims of crime. Many states are seeking to put into law existing Council of Europe conventions in this area, which are by and large designed to ensure that any EU citizen who is a victim of crime anywhere in the EU is guaranteed to have their rights met.</p>
	<p pid="b.119.0/2">I shall follow the example of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40373" name="Stephen Twigg">the hon. Member for Liverpool, West Derby (Stephen Twigg)</phrase> by referring briefly to a constituency case, as it serves to illustrate why these changes are needed. The case, which I have raised in the House on a number of occasions, relates to Robbie Hughes, who was seriously attacked when on holiday in Malia in Crete, allegedly by British tourists&#8212;it is still going through the courts, so I cannot say much more than that. He suffered severe head injuries as a result of the attack. Since then, his mother has been campaigning to ensure that the support available for victims of crime abroad is enhanced. She has done a lot of work, such as by helping the Foreign and Commonwealth Office improve its website and put extra information on it. She has also done a lot of work with travel agents to put pressure on the travel reps to stop encouraging British tourists to go out and get blind drunk by telling them where the cheapest venues</p>
	<p pid="b.119.0/3">are for getting the most potent alcohol, with the inevitable consequences in places such as Malia in Crete where, I am afraid, British tourists have a very poor reputation.</p>
	<p pid="b.119.0/4">Robbie and his mother faced a whole host of issues and problems, with which I am sure the Dunnes, to whom the hon. Gentleman referred, will be very familiar. There is a problem in accessing health care, and people also need to be encouraged to take out insurance. They may think, &#8220;I&#8217;m safe because I&#8217;m going to an EU country,&#8221; but the descriptions of health care in Greece suggest that it leaves something to be desired. There are also language issues, and although legal aid is available in Greece, that is not immediately apparent to a British citizen who is sent a form written in Greek. There are translation issues therefore, and there are clearly significant communication issues. Some of them are simple, such as whether the person abroad is able to use their mobile phone and whether, if they clock up a large bill, they will be cut off before having been able to help their loved one abroad.</p>
	<p pid="b.119.0/5">We also need to address issues relating to the police and the application of different standards. For example, in some countries the police are not willing to register crimes and fail simply to get out of the starting blocks in getting a crime addressed. There are also problems relating to money and to extradition, where a case subsequently does come to court. That is a good example of an area where the European Union has put in place measures to address the situation.</p>
	<p pid="b.119.0/6">Many of the issues that these two families experienced would benefit greatly from this standardisation of a minimum level of support for victims of crime. During a debate on victim support on <phrase class="date" code="2011-06-08">8 June</phrase>, I expressed reservations about what we are debating tonight, but I did so on the basis of not having a clear appreciation of the extent to which the UK Government had been involved in drawing up the proposal. I also had concerns that the UK&#8217;s strong position on supporting victims would be diluted by this approach, but we are clearly setting a minimum standard that other countries can and should go beyond. I also had concerns about whether this approach would place an undue burden on the UK, but it is clear, again, that the UK&#8217;s high standards on victim support mean that although the UK Government might have to take some additional steps, they are relatively small in the scheme of things. On that basis, I think that this is a very positive contribution and I hope that the Ministry of Justice will be minded to push it forward swiftly.</p>

	<p pid="b.120.0/1">I have a similar tale to tell to the one told by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40373" name="Stephen Twigg">the hon. Member for Liverpool, West Derby (Stephen Twigg)</phrase>. I do not wish to go into the precise details, but the case came to me within days of my becoming Member of Parliament for Ipswich and relates to a terrible situation involving a constituent who was a murdered by another constituent in Spain. The family were faced with the most appalling series of choices and negotiations to be made with the Spanish authorities. Unfortunately, the family had to deal with Andalusian law as it applied in the Canary islands, which even in Spanish terms is seen as rather arcane.</p>
	<p pid="b.120.0/2">The process of bringing the body back to the United Kingdom was frustrated by the offender, who had come back to this country. The reason it happened rather</p>
	<p pid="b.120.0/3">more quickly than in the case of the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s constituent was the European arrest warrant, which made a considerable difference to the speed with which the case could be dealt. That is one good example of the arrest warrant significantly improving things for victims in this country. In a similar manner to the hon. Gentleman's case, although not to the same extent, it took the pulling of strings in Spain by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, by me and by people who really should not have been involved to bring about more speedily the returning of my constituent&#8217;s body to the family in Ipswich. That is why the directive will bring about a real improvement for constituents who are faced with such terrible problems.</p>
	<p pid="b.120.0/4">The problem will get bigger and bigger as more and more people seek to work in the European Union and go on holiday there. As such, as we have heard from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40152" name="Tom Brake">the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Tom Brake)</phrase>, acts of violence and drunkenness and situations where constituents might be put before the law will increase. We all know from our casework&#8212;even I know from my short time as a Member of Parliament&#8212;how constituents in such situations can be distinctly disadvantaged. That can happen with very minor offences and with the most serious and grave.</p>
	<p pid="b.120.0/5">It is therefore nice that we can come together in this House for the first time in a long time to agree on a new piece of European legislation that every Member believes will be bring an improvement for our constituents. It represents a sharing and pooling of sovereignty which will improve the lives of those whom we seek to represent. I agree with and approve of what the Government are trying to do in this instance. I hope that they will be able to bring the directive to fulfilment as quickly as possible and that its implementation will ensure that those European neighbours who are not so assiduous in their treatment of victims of crime are made to protect and enhance the rights of our constituents as rapidly as possible.</p>

	<p pid="b.121.0/1">Over recent weeks, the treatment of victims and their families has come to the fore in the UK. We have seen the family of Milly Dowler speak about the appalling treatment they received at the hands of defence lawyers acting for Levi Bellfield; we have read the report from the victims commissioner, Louise Casey, about the needs of families bereaved by homicide; and most recently we have been sickened by the revelations that the mobile phones of victims and others have been hacked into by elements of the media for whom the story comes before any sense of morality.</p>
	<p pid="b.121.0/2">Under the previous Labour Government, great strides forward were made in championing the rights and needs of victims and their families, although we would be the first to admit that there was and is more that could be done. Under Labour, we saw the introduction of the national victims service&#8212;an &#163;8 million support scheme for relatives of manslaughter and murder victims that offered victims a dedicated support worker&#8212;in response, of course, to the report published by Labour&#8217;s first ever victims champion, Sara Payne. As a result, the CPS now has a victim focus scheme committing it to a post-charge and post-conviction meeting for murder, manslaughter and road death cases in the Crown court. There is also a new protocol for Her Majesty's Courts and Tribunals Service for bereaved families and a statutory</p>
	<p pid="b.121.0/3">victims code of practice that commits the police, the Crown Prosecution Service, the courts, the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority, the probation service and others to providing information within certain time scales. The CPS has a prosecutors&#8217; pledge, setting out how Crown prosecutors should conduct the case, and the probation service provides a victim liaison scheme for certain victims of crime or their next of kin as regards some elements of the offender&#8217;s movements within the prison estate and release information.</p>
	<p pid="b.121.0/4">Labour introduced the victim personal statement scheme and the policing pledge, and in April 2010 we launched a &#163;2 million homicide service, with the police allocating a family liaison officer to each family following a homicide or a culpable road death. In January 2010, Labour also introduced the compensation scheme for British victims of terrorism abroad as part of the Crime and Security Act 2010 and declared that it would be retrospective to 2002. I hope that the Lord Chancellor will take on board the fact that it is still to be implemented. All those measures came on top of a cut of 43% in crime, which reduced the likelihood of being a victim of crime.</p>
	<p pid="b.121.0/5">Although the Government have made the right noises about victims being at the heart of their approach, it is fair to say that they have stumbled a few times: over how legal aid cuts have been targeted, over the changes to remand proposed in the latest justice legislation and over the dropped manifesto commitment on knife crime, for example. Let me be clear that although we will hold the Government to account when we feel they have taken a wrong turn, we will support them when they do the right thing by victims, as they have with the welcome announcement of an additional &#163;500,000 for practical changes following Louise Casey&#8217;s report.</p>
	<p pid="b.121.0/6">For now, we are debating a draft directive from the European Union that gives the Government the opportunity to pick themselves up and show that they can be on the side of the victim. We are considering four things this evening: the draft directive that establishes minimum standards for the rights, support and protection of victims of crime; a draft regulation on mutual recognition of protection measures in civil matters; a Commission communication on strengthening victims&#8217; rights in the EU; and the explanatory memorandum dated <phrase class="date" code="2011-05-16">16 May 2011</phrase> to a Council resolution on a road map for strengthening the rights and protection of victims, particularly in criminal proceedings.</p>
	<p pid="b.121.0/7">I am grateful to the Secretary of State for setting out the Government&#8217;s position on those four documents. Let me add to the debate by setting out our view of these important documents and the improvements they could make for all member states. Although the UK leads the way, as the Lord Chancellor said, I think he would also readily accept that more is required of the UK in its treatment of victims of crime.</p>
	<p pid="b.121.0/8">Let us consider the scale of the issues that challenge us. From Louise Casey&#8217;s report on the needs of families bereaved by homicide, we know that the vast majority of victims&#8217; families&#8212;more than 80%&#8212;have suffered trauma-related symptoms, that three-quarters have suffered depression and that one in every five have become addicted to alcohol. Every person in the survey said that their health had been affected in some way. Some 59% found it difficult to manage their finances following the bereavement and one in four stopped working permanently. The average cost of the homicide to each</p>
	<p pid="b.121.0/9">family was &#163;37,000, with costs ranging from those for probate to those for funerals, travel to and from court and even for cleaning up the crime scene. The majority of those people got no help with those costs and some were forced into debt. The victims commissioner&#8217;s review shows that such effects persist for many years.</p>
	<p pid="b.121.0/10">The scale of the issue comes more into focus when we consider that, as the Chairman of the European Scrutiny Committee said, 30 million crimes against persons or property are recorded each year across the European Union, resulting in about 75 million direct victims of crime every year across the Union. The number of homicides will, thankfully, be only a small proportion of that number, but the impact of any crime on victims will have many of the characteristics I have mentioned, with the most horrendous crimes bringing the hardest burdens of all.</p>

	<p pid="b.123.0/1">I thank my hon. Friend for giving way as I have not been here for the whole debate. One thing that concerns me and that exacerbates all the problems is the free movement of people within the European Union. If we had borders that were enforced, criminals would not be able to travel so freely through the European Union and individuals going on holiday would be more conscious of the fact that they were going to different jurisdictions with different standards and levels of health protection and be more wary and concerned. Above all, traffickers in human beings, particularly in children, would have a more difficult time if we had internal borders.</p>

	<p pid="b.123.1/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his intervention. He makes his points very well and I will return to some of those issues shortly.</p>
	<p pid="b.123.1/2">British citizens should receive the highest standards in any member state when they are the victim of a crime. In the draft directive, the European Union has sought to build on the 2001 Council framework decision, which established general minimum standards. The rationale behind it is that the 2001 framework was not implemented across member states in a satisfactory way, with some member states doing more than others&#8212;I think the UK can hold its head high in that regard&#8212;leaving a patchwork of uneven standards of protection and support for victims. One of the Commission&#8217;s conclusions that speaks volumes in light of the Dowler family&#8217;s experience is that</p>
	<p pid="b.123.1/3">&#8220;Member States generally do not ensure that victims are treated in a manner equivalent to that of a party to proceedings.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.123.1/4">The Commission found that there was &#8220;ambiguous drafting&#8221;, a &#8220;lack of concrete obligations&#8221; and a &#8220;lack of infringement possibilities&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.123.1/5">In the Lord Chancellor&#8217;s comments on each of the articles in the draft directive, there are some positives which are very welcome, but there are some less welcome and possibly worrying observations too. The Government straight away use the phrase</p>
	<p pid="b.123.1/6">&#8220;proportionate to the needs of victims&#8221;,</p>
	<p pid="b.123.1/7">but we have seen from the victims commissioner&#8217;s recent report that the needs of victims are not being met, so who will judge what is proportionate to the needs of victims? Will it be the Lord Chancellor, his Department or the victims commissioner? Who will decide?</p>
	<p pid="b.123.1/8">It is vital that the directive should help to provide greater uniformity across the EU to improve the service that UK citizens can expect. More must be done to ensure that victims&#8217; families do not have to suffer unnecessary delays and further trauma following the loss of a family member abroad. At this point I pay tribute to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40373" name="Stephen Twigg">the Member for Liverpool, West Derby (Stephen Twigg)</phrase> for raising the terrible and tragic issue of Gary Dunne and the work being done by Lesley and Steve Dunne to whom our sympathies must go out. It is also important to raise the cases that were mentioned by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40332" name="Ben Gummer">the hon. Member for Ipswich (Ben Gummer)</phrase> and by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40152" name="Tom Brake">the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Tom Brake)</phrase>, whom I congratulate on his imminent esteemed elevation to the Privy Council. I suspect that we all have examples of such tragedies in our constituencies. For example, a constituent of mine died in Tenerife last year. Again, because of the Spanish coronial system, the victim&#8217;s family had to wait months before the body was repatriated to the UK.</p>
	<p pid="b.123.1/9">I turn to some of the articles. Article 2 is welcome. It sets out the wider impact of a crime beyond the person who has been killed or suffered some immediate injustice. It should not be the subject of detailed clarification. Some clarification is required, but the Government&#8217;s comments about the need for clarification are a little troubling.</p>
	<p pid="b.123.1/10">The first part of article 4 deals with the provision of information to victims. Although the Lord Chancellor says he is confident that this article is generally compatible with current practice across the UK, I wonder just how confident he is about the uniformity and quality of current practice across the UK in the light of the Victims Commissioner&#8217;s report. The second part of article 4 covers the sensitive issue of informing victims of the release of an offender. I agree that we should be mindful of the risks to the offender. We do not want to see lynch mobs at the prison gates, but we also do not want to see victims unexpectedly coming face to face with the offender in a supermarket because no one has forewarned them, as has happened time and again.</p>
	<p pid="b.123.1/11">I am not sure that in their response to article 9 the Government fully understand how variable is the use of the victim personal statement. I suggest that the Lord Chancellor takes a moment or two to read the strategic audit of the criminal justice system, a report prepared by Victim Support. It makes sombre reading about the use of the victim personal statement. It notes that the police are responsible for offering victims the opportunity to make a statement, but that they are not required to do so by law, and VPSs are not even mentioned in the Government&#8217;s primary document setting out the services that the victim can expect.</p>
	<p pid="b.123.1/12">The report from Victim Support continues:</p>
	<p pid="b.123.1/13">&#8220;The actual situation on the ground is poor&#8212;of those whose cases reach court, less than half recall being offered the opportunity to make a VPS. Moreover, of those who did make a VPS, only two-thirds felt it was taken into account. Furthermore, the likelihood of being given the chance to make a VPS varies considerably across England and Wales. For example, victims living in London were less than half as likely to be offered it as those living in Northumbria. The likelihood of the victim feeling that the VPS is taken into account also varies considerably across regions.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.123.1/14">Article 13 deals with the reimbursement of victims&#8217; expenses. Once again, it is concerning that the Government appear to be back-peddling on the concrete commitments that the directive is supposed to require. Once more, we</p>
	<p pid="b.123.1/15">must remind ourselves that the victims commissioner&#8217;s findings are damning of the cost barriers for victims&#8217; families who want to see justice done. I am hopeful that the Government, despite their heavily caveated words in response to article 19, will take on board the needs of victims to avoid contact with offenders and their families, and thereby avoid the all too frequent situation where a victim&#8217;s family sit alongside that of the defendant, listening to them laughing, joking and making hurtful comments.</p>
	<p pid="b.123.1/16">The Government&#8217;s comments on article 20 worry me greatly. Although I have some sympathy with the view that not all victims need necessarily be interviewed, provided that other methods for hearing the voice of victims are strengthened, it feels as though the Lord Chancellor is going behind the term &#8220;proportionate&#8221; again.</p>
	<p pid="b.123.1/17">I would like to spend a moment on article 23 and the relationship between the media and the privacy of victims. In much the same way as a few bad apples spoiled the reputation of the House, so the behaviour of irresponsible and, it seems, criminal elements of the media have severely damaged that profession. With reference to Bellfield&#8217;s trial, Chief Constable Mark Rowley has called for greater protection of victims and witnesses during court cases. Rowley said it was a</p>
	<p pid="b.123.1/18">&#8220;most bizarre and distressing coincidence&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.123.1/19">that the Dowler family had their privacy destroyed at a time when footballers and celebrities were being granted super-injunctions to protect details of their personal lives.</p>
	<p pid="b.123.1/20">It is all well and good for the Lord Chancellor to ask that article 23 respect the principle of media independence, but at what cost? The case of Milly Dowler shows the need for greater training of professions, notably the judiciary, in how victims&#8217; families are treated. The draft directive is a good starting point, but there are things that are not in it&#8212;notably, despite the European Commission's identifying why the 2001 framework failed, where are the teeth in these proposals? Where is the mechanism for effective redress when member states do not provide the services or support that the draft directive requires? Where are the rights to request a review of the decision on what charge the offender will face? The draft directive is an opportunity for the Government to negotiate a better deal for victims at EU level; it should not be used to make what we already do look like it fits with the directive as it is written.</p>
	<p pid="b.123.1/21">Turning to the draft regulation on mutual recognition of protection measures in civil matters, it can only be a positive thing that civil law protection measures issued in one member state should be recognised and applied in another, so the draft regulation is to be welcomed. I note that the European Scrutiny Committee has its reservations about safeguarding the rights of the person subject to the order as well as the person who has requested it, and although I fully understand the need to give the person subject to the order the opportunity to safeguard their rights, I have concerns about how any such safeguarding could be applied.</p>
	<p pid="b.123.1/22">For example, if the person with a civil law protection measure goes on an extended holiday or goes to work in another European country for a year, would the person subject to the order need to know when and where? The regulation as drafted seems already to provide adequately,</p>
	<p pid="b.123.1/23">through the certification process, that an existing measure can be recognised and applied throughout the Union within the limits of the original application. Indeed, the fundamental rights safeguard at article 10 and, of course, the rights of the person subject to the order at the time it was applied for seem more than adequate, but I look forward to hearing from right hon. and hon. Members if they think otherwise on this point. I am pleased that the Secretary of State, in his explanatory memorandum dated <phrase class="date" code="2011-06-02">2 June</phrase>, seems to welcome this regulation.</p>
	<p pid="b.123.1/24">I will turn now to the council resolution on the road map. The road map essentially shows how both the draft directive and the draft regulation fit into an overall scheme for improving the EU&#8217;s approach to victims&#8217; rights. Given the reasons why the Commission felt that the 2001 framework failed, it is a little sad to see the Government seeking to press for less detailed measures on how the victims directive can be brought into effect. The European Scrutiny Committee, in putting forward the document for debate on the Floor of the House, asked the Government to provide more information on the probable substance of each measure that the Commission is to propose as part of the road map.</p>
	<p pid="b.123.1/25">I am grateful to the Lord Chancellor for welcoming this evening&#8217;s debate and recognise that the Government have provided a good explanation of their views in the memorandum, but sadly we seem to be lacking the additional detail this evening that the Committee requested. That point is worth repeating: the European Scrutiny Committee, in putting forward the document for debate on the Floor of the House, asked the Government to provide more information on the substance of each of the measures that the Commission is to propose. I am not sure whether the Lord Chancellor intends to provide that when he winds up&#8212;I can only hope.</p>
	<p pid="b.123.1/26">A good place to begin my concluding remarks on the matters before us is the question of how the Commission&#8217;s proposals compare with the victims law for homicide cases proposed by Louise Casey. The victims commissioner has addressed the situation in the UK in homicide cases, and to my mind that is a good benchmark for what we should expect for all victims across the EU. The victims commissioner believes that a victims law should make it clear that the coroner will release the body to the family for burial within 28 days, unless exceptional circumstances apply. The proposals before us do not mention that at all, and yet we have heard from right hon. and hon. Members this evening that this is one of the fundamental issues that they feel passionately about and that affects constituents up and down the country time and again. In my humble opinion the Government are plain wrong in their stubborn refusal to implement the position of the chief coroner, and I hope that when they are made to see sense, they will also ensure that the chief coroner addresses this distressing issue and that such measures will be raised with the Commission in negotiations on the road map.</p>
	<p pid="b.123.1/27">The victims commissioner also believes that the police should legally have to keep families updated at each stage of the investigation, and I believe that the draft directive addresses that key point. It must not be watered down in negotiations. Similarly, Louise Casey believes that a police protocol should be put in place for reviewing cases that remain unsolved and that it should set out clearly how and when families are to be consulted and</p>
	<p pid="b.123.1/28">kept updated. Again, although not part of the draft directive or road map, that is clearly an area that the Lord Chancellor&#8217;s Department should raise with the Commission.</p>
	<p pid="b.123.1/29">Another point made by the victims commissioner is that families should have the right to information from the Crown Prosecution Service, and to meet the CPS lawyer at key stages of the process, including on conviction or acquittal, and on appeal. That is covered by the draft directive, and should be strongly pursued. Those needs are addressed in the draft directive, but they should be enshrined in law, with the right of redress when not met.</p>
	<p pid="b.123.1/30">In conclusion, the Opposition welcome the Commission&#8217;s approach, and urge the Government not to procrastinate or seek to gain wriggle room, but to embrace the opportunity to turn the page on their recent errors of judgment, and give their approval to measures that should ensure that victims of crime across the European Union have at the very least a minimum standard on which they can rely.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-07-11b.127.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40513" speakername="Kenneth Clarke" colnum="127"  time="022:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110711/debtext/110711-0003.htm#1107121000683">
	<p pid="b.127.2/1">I will not weigh up the issue of whether Stafford has lost or gained, or whether Stone has benefited or been deprived, but I enjoyed the debates on the Maastricht treaty. We were not quite as close on that occasion as we are on the directive.</p>
	<p pid="b.127.2/2">This is an extremely important subject, and there is general agreement that the framework agreement of 2001 is not adequate and should be improved, which is the objective of the Commission&#8217;s documents. The proposals have received extremely widespread support, and were movingly supported by Members whose constituents had been adversely affected. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40373" name="Stephen Twigg">The hon. Member for Liverpool, West Derby (Stephen Twigg)</phrase> cited the case of Mr and Mrs Dunne, and a constituent of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40332" name="Ben Gummer">the Member for Ipswich (Ben Gummer)</phrase> was murdered in Spain. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40152" name="Tom Brake">The hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Tom Brake)</phrase> discussed difficulties that he had encountered. As I said at the beginning of our debate, we are trying to raise European standards on the issue because many British citizens go abroad and their families would benefit if minimum standards&#8212;and we hope very adequate standards&#8212;were in place throughout all member countries.</p>
	<p pid="b.127.2/3">It was claimed that that could be achieved by bilateral agreements with other member states. With respect, I do not think that that is practicable. The notion that</p>
	<p pid="b.127.2/4">bilateral agreements have to be negotiated with 26 EU member states, where the tradition of supporting victims is variable and in some cases far below that in the UK, is not the best way to proceed. I was urged by other speakers to support the Commission and the Hungarian presidency&#8217;s Budapest declaration to see what we can do to strengthen support for everyone.</p>
	<p pid="b.127.2/5">Reference was made to the work of Louise Casey, the victims commissioner, who shares the views of my hon. Friends and of the hon. Member for Liverpool, West Derby about the importance of considering the problems experienced by bereaved families. Victim Support, the biggest organisation in the field of victim support, supports the proposed directive, and it has urged the Government to take a constructive approach to it. It was said that its funding had been cut, but we have responded to the opinions expressed by the victims commissioner. We need to make sure that specialist, targeted support is available for vulnerable victims. Many hon. Members have been victims of crime&#8212;probably, almost everyone&#8212;but people do not always need counselling and support afterwards. Bereaved families, however, are a particular concern of Louise Casey, who has produced a report on the subject. We have given extra support to specialist services for bereaved families and victims of rape and sexual assault. More targeted support is required. We have a code of practice in this country that also needs to be revised and improved in the light of experience, and everybody is pressing in the same direction on that.</p>
	<p pid="b.127.2/6"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40583" name="Robert Flello">The hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent South (Robert Flello)</phrase> was pretty supportive of the proposals before us. Like my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40584" name="William Cash">the Member for Stone (Mr Cash)</phrase>, he talked particularly about protection orders. The idea of mutual recognition of protection orders throughout the European Union is very valuable. These orders are usually given when someone is being harassed, often by a husband, partner or spouse with a history of domestic violence. If we do not have mutual recognition of the orders, the consequence is that every time anybody travels in Europe, they are obliged to try to get a fresh court order in the area where they are then living and give evidence again about the same experiences. Where possible, we should support this move. We have already opted into the criminal law directive on the subject, and we will do so on the civil order once we have scrutinised it to make sure that the two will work together and that particular burdens are not put on us.</p>
	<p pid="b.127.2/7">My hon. Friend the Member for Stone talked about the possible resource and administrative implications for this country. I do not see any insuperable problems in the proposals, but we will obviously have to scrutinise them in detail because we cannot accept unnecessary extra resources or administrative burdens being demanded of us. That is highly unlikely because we are so far ahead in the field compared with most other member states, but we will bear that concern in mind.</p>

Member for Stoke-on-Trent South raised, as he was quite entitled to, all kinds of aspects of victim support of a wholly domestic nature to which we will pay attention, as we are hoping to modernise our own code. I assure right hon. and hon. Members that we work very closely with the victims commissioner in this whole field and greatly value the contribution that she makes as an advocate of the victim&#8217;s cause. I also assure Members that decisions on opt-ins are guided, in the end, by what we regard as in the interests of British citizens and the national interest within the European Union. However, I take on board the feeling in the House that increased co-operation in this respect is plainly desirable as a benefit to all those Europeans who travel frequently throughout the Union. We will certainly take on board the views expressed by Members who have taken part in the debate when we take our decisions on all these subjects.</p>

	<p pid="b.135.3/1">Thank you, Mr Speaker. It is privilege to speak this evening on a subject that is close not only to my heart, but to the hearts of my constituents. Many in the House would not know the relevance of Carnforth station other than knowing that it was the site for the filming of &#8220;Brief Encounter&#8221;. Since then, however, the station has unfortunately fallen into disrepair, and during the Beeching era, all the trains were brought to Carnforth to be scrapped. Today, I am imploring the Minister to take on board my remarks because Carnforth station is the centre of the railway universe in this country. Everything passes through it from Edinburgh to London but nothing stops there.</p>
	<p pid="b.135.3/2">I thank the Minister for being here to listen and respond to this important debate. I must stress that I speak for the whole community of Carnforth. That community has been built up from a railway town. Years ago the nearest major town was Warton, where the Washingtons were from, but then Carnforth developed because it was a railway town. Eleven years ago, a friend of mine, Peter Yates MBE, whom I am pleased to say is here today, brought the community together and raised &#163;1.4 million to rebuild this historic station not just for the sake of the station, the community, the &#8220;Brief Encounter&#8221; caf&#233; and the iconic clock&#8212;if anybody goes to Carnforth, they will see just what an amazing place the station is&#8212;but so that the station can be used as a railway station once again.</p>
	<p pid="b.135.3/3">Although we would not have used the phrase at the time, this was a big society project&#8212;before the phrase was even coined. The community is united in asking for help for the next step in reopening the west coast main line and the trans-Pennine platforms. However, we are in a Catch-22 situation. The trans-Pennine and west coast main line trains cannot stop at Carnforth because there are no platforms there&#8212;it is a chicken and egg situation. Carnforth was not even included in the route utilisation strategies report to any great extent because the trains could not stop there, yet everything goes through it. We cannot put the platforms in, however, until the rail operators agree to stop there.</p>
	<p pid="b.135.3/4">As a community, therefore, the people of Carnforth have suggested that we take the bull by the horns and request that we start negotiations with the Department for Transport and Network Rail to start rebuilding the platforms. We need to cut through this Catch-22 situation, which is nobody&#8217;s fault but highly damaging to the whole community. We envisage a future in which trains from north, south, east and west will use Carnforth as a hub for north Lancashire and the south lakes. With all the will in the world, Oxenholme is, with respect, too small to be the hub. We have tried it for many years but it has not worked. The Lake district is full of cars because existing rail services cannot cope with the capacity.</p>
	<p pid="b.135.3/5">I recently spoke to Chris Gibb from Virgin Trains about this subject, and happily he agreed that Carnforth is in a strong position to be a rail-ride hub. Not only do we have the space and direct and fast access to the Lake district via the M6; we have a comprehensive road network in the area. Virgin was clear that anything that pushed more lakeland tourism into the west coast main line would get its support, and now we have agreed an action plan under which Virgin will agree to stop trains there if it is satisfied with Carnforth. We also have the solid support of councillor Tim Ashton, the head of transport at Lancashire county council, who was good enough to accompany me to the last meeting we had with the Department.</p>
	<p pid="b.135.3/6">It is not only tourists who would benefit from these platforms being rebuilt. At the moment, it is hard to travel between the Furness peninsula and Kendal. It would be an easy and short journey if passengers could change at Carnforth and it would enable ease of access to the lakes for those on the east coast. Enabling commuters to move around our area by public transport would bring huge economic and environmental benefits to north Lancashire and the south lakes. When the now Minister of State, Department for Transport, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40169" name="Theresa Villiers">the Member for Chipping Barnet (Mrs Villiers)</phrase> visited Carnforth during the election, the train stopped in the station for 10 minutes. That was my cue to get her to Lancaster. If anybody has ever driven around Lancaster, they will know that it is the biggest car park in Europe. I had to park the car up, transport myself through the streets and put her on the train that had stopped at Carnforth half an hour before.</p>
	<p pid="b.135.3/7">With an expanding population and given the space that it needs to grow, it seems logical to give Carnforth the chance to live up to its potential. This Government have already taken important steps to boost connectivity in our area. They have started the first serious negotiations on open access to the west coast with Alliance Rail. For those right hon. and hon. Members who are not familiar with the proposal, Alliance plans to run services in competition with Virgin using free space in the timetable. Those services would use brand-new hybrid trains, which are good for the environment and would enhance the whole network. Because the services would go to Barrow rather than Glasgow, they could stop at the existing platforms at Carnforth and potentially provide a direct London service, but that welcome new service would be even better with our new platforms. The proposal is very welcome, and I think I speak for everyone in my constituency, and certainly for the community in Carnforth, when I say that I hope the negotiations will lead to Alliance Rail becoming a reality.</p>
	<p pid="b.135.3/8">The Government, despite opposition, are pushing ahead with High Speed 2. Once HS2 is built, we will be able to stop west coast trains at many more stations. We want Carnforth to be one of the stations that benefits, and with the platforms already in place we would be a prime location. But we could also offer lots in return, enabling west coast passengers to enjoy all the benefits of rail ride that I talked about earlier. This would be a real integrated transport system whose benefits would far outstrip the cost of the platforms.</p>
	<p pid="b.135.3/9">On the subject of cost, the &#163;1.4 million previously raised by my friend Peter was not from Department for Transport rail budgets; it was raised through one-off grants and local fundraising. If we get permission to build the new platforms, I would like to stress that we</p>
	<p pid="b.135.3/10">will not come with a begging bowl to either the Department or Network Rail. We will raise our own funds for our project. That is unheard of, but we can do it. We have already rebuilt the station from a shell, and we can re-lay the platforms. In a time of difficulty, it is only fair that we pay our way, and we are doing that, as people in Carnforth have always done.</p>
	<p pid="b.135.3/11">Today, I have tried to sketch out in the simplest detail why this complex proposal would have huge benefits for our region. Clearly, I have left out certain details because of time and complexity, and as this is the last speech of the day, I am sure that we would all like to go home. However, this is very important for the whole community in Carnforth, including the Railway Trust. Peter Yates has prepared an excellent report that I am happy to supply to anyone who requests it. We have everything in place to be a real transport hub&#8212;except the platforms. We are committed as a community to put them in; we just need Government support.</p>
	<p pid="b.135.3/12">I know that this is a strange request, but let us look at the benefits. We are not going to ask for any Government money. We have a proven track in our community projects of rebuilding and the whole community is behind the proposal. This is the big society in its highest form. We want to integrate with an infrastructure network that has been serving our country for more than 100 years, and I would like to ask for formal negotiations to begin, so that we can talk to everyone concerned about re-establishing the platforms for the benefit of the whole community of Carnforth.</p>

	<p pid="b.137.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40410" name="David Morris">the Member for Morecambe and Lunesdale (David Morris)</phrase> on securing this timely debate on the important subject of platforms at Carnforth station, and on enabling us to have this brief encounter tonight. He has set out with great clarity the arguments in favour of reinstating the fast-line platforms at the station, and his passion and commitment cannot be doubted. I also pay tribute to the work carried out by local people in restoring the station to its former glory.</p>
	<p pid="b.137.0/2">In 1945, David Lean filmed his romantic classic &#8220;Brief Encounter&#8221;, starring Celia Johnson and Trevor Howard, at Carnforth station. Many will remember the key role that the station played in the film. The image of the station clock remains resonant for many filmgoers, as my hon. Friend mentioned. However, a long period of decline set in, following the Beeching era. By the early 1990s, the once splendid station had fallen into disrepair. The Carnforth Station and Railway Trust Company Ltd was formed as a local initiative in November 1996 to restore the derelict buildings. A &#163;1.5 million project was commenced in late 2000 in co-operation with Railtrack. After three years work, the Brief Encounter refreshment room and visitor centre was opened on <phrase class="date" code="2003-10-17">17 October 2003</phrase>. That represented a remarkable achievement by local people in the Carnforth area, which I commend.</p>
	<p pid="b.137.0/3">As my hon. Friend explained, local ambitions at Carnforth now focus on the reinstatement of the mainline platforms at Carnforth station, which closed in 1970. However, it would not be possible to discuss the reinstatement of the mainline platforms without referring to the planned developments for the inter-city rail services on the west coast main line. In January, the Government</p>
	<p pid="b.137.0/4">issued a consultation on the specification for the new inter-city west coast franchise, which is due to commence in 2012 and will replace the current Virgin Trains rail franchise. The current franchise operates more than 300 train services a day, delivering more than 26 million passenger journeys and 3.2 billion passenger miles a year, providing train services along the west coast main line from Euston to Glasgow in Scotland. It serves the key cities of Birmingham, Liverpool, Manchester, Edinburgh and Glasgow, and north Wales. Passenger growth has shown a continuous increase since 2003. The effects of the volcanic ash clouds in 2010 and earlier this year and the associated aviation disruption have contributed to a considerable modal shift from air to rail&#8212;something that the Government very much welcome for climate change reasons. The objectives for the new franchise set out in January therefore include exploiting the full potential of the route and maximising capacity.</p>
	<p pid="b.137.0/5">The Government believe that the former system of franchising had become too prescriptive at the point of bidding and lacked flexibility once operational. A new franchising system has been devised to facilitate and encourage significant private investment, and is designed to deliver important benefits for passengers. The Government also believe that longer franchises are necessary to encourage such investment, build successful long-term working relationships with Network Rail, focus franchises more strongly on the quality of outcomes for passengers and deliver the best possible value for money for the taxpayer in a highly constrained public spending environment.</p>
	<p pid="b.137.0/6">Where does all that fit in with the Carnforth station platform request? Let me turn to the local aspirations for the station once again to become a stop on long-distance services. It is important to emphasise that both the current Virgin Trains franchise and the new inter-city west coast franchise have to accommodate many different markets. A key issue in any proper consideration of the matter is whether a proposal to stop London train services at reinstated platforms at Carnforth would work operationally and commercially. Initial analysis by the Department suggests that a call at Carnforth would require a stop at another station to be deleted. Therefore, a potential gain at Carnforth would result in a disbenefit to passengers from other stations on the route. Obviously that would require some hard and careful decision making.</p>

	<p pid="b.138.0/1">I should point out that Virgin trains stop in Carnforth for 20 minutes in the morning and evening, but they do not let passengers on. I spoke to Chris Gibb about this subject less than 12 months ago, and he said that if we had the platforms, those trains could take passengers on. The issue is something to do with the schedule for cleaning the trains.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-07-11b.138.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40362" speakername="Norman Baker" colnum="138"  time="022:33:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110711/debtext/110711-0004.htm#1107123000038">
	<p pid="b.138.1/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that information, which I was not aware of. I will investigate that to see whether it represents a way forward. My point, however, is that there is a potential trade-off between extra stops on the service and the speed of the journey between two key points where the main market is. In an ideal world, we would obviously like to meet both requirements&#8212;the local aspirations that exist, as well as the need to get longer-distance traffic transferred</p>
	<p pid="b.138.1/2">from air to rail&#8212;and journey times are key to delivering that. However, I will certainly look at his point, which is valid.</p>
	<p pid="b.138.1/3">It is fair to say that the west coast main line is heavily used in the Carnforth area, with up to three long-distance services an hour between London, Birmingham or Manchester and Glasgow or Edinburgh, plus regular freight services. Those trains are already popular and well loaded. Capacity problems already exist, and growth in demand continues. Indeed, it is interesting to note that, even in the recession, we have seen buoyant markets for rail that have continued to expand at a time when other forms of transport have not seen the same response. Despite the &#163;8.8 billion upgrade, the west coast main line is already suffering some congestion when it comes to access for freight services and local services, so we have to ensure that the line is used to best capacity.</p>
	<p pid="b.138.1/4">Network Rail&#8217;s route utilisation strategy for the west coast main line was published on <phrase class="date" code="2011-07-01">1 July</phrase>. It corroborates the heavy usage of the line and the resulting capacity issues, but as my hon. Friend said, it did not consider the reinstatement of the platforms at Carnforth. The Department&#8217;s analysis is that journey times would be increased by around five minutes to accommodate calls at reinstated platforms at Carnforth. That has to be borne in mind and weighed against the significant journey savings and more frequent services that have resulted from the upgrade to the west coast main line. London to Glasgow is now 30 minutes quicker than it was before the changes, with a very competitive four hour and 50 minute journey time, while trains from Manchester airport and Birmingham to Glasgow and Edinburgh are now around 20 to 30 minutes faster.</p>
	<p pid="b.138.1/5">These enhancements have delivered significant revenue growth since December 2008 and increased rail&#8217;s share of the total travel market on the routes served by the west coast main line. These are markets rail serves well and there are strong calls for further journey time reductions, as my hon. Friend will recognise. All these and a number of other issues mean that stopping long-distance London services at Carnforth would probably involve a number of trade-offs that are less straightforward than might first seem to be the case. As I said, however, I will investigate the specific point that my hon. Friend raised with me and write to him about it subsequently.</p>
	<p pid="b.138.1/6">Similar considerations apply to the other train services that operate on the west coast main line, which might also be candidates for additional stops at reinstated platforms, such as the services currently originating in Birmingham and Manchester. It is already possible to travel direct between Carnforth and other stations to the south. This seems to imply that the main benefit of stopping non-London services at reinstated main line</p>
	<p pid="b.138.1/7">platforms at Carnforth would be to create new direct journey opportunities between Carnforth and stations to the north&#8212;including Oxenholme, Penrith, Carlisle and other northern destinations into Scotland.</p>
	<p pid="b.138.1/8">As can be seen from what I have said today, nobody should underestimate the fact that reinstating the fast-line platforms at Carnforth station would involve more than some hard decision making. It is not simply a question of finding the money for the platforms, although I pay tribute to the tremendous spirit that my hon. Friend and his constituents are demonstrating in their willingness and determination to try to secure their reinstatement. Local funding is, of course, important for platform reinstatement, but it does not necessarily determine whether a future franchise would require trains to stop there. It is certainly a way forward and clear willingness has been shown to secure money for that particular end. Indeed, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, local people have already demonstrated what they can achieve with the improvements already made to Carnforth station.</p>
	<p pid="b.138.1/9">Such local funding, if enough could be found to cover the potentially substantial costs, would reduce the initial financial burden. However, we would also have to ensure that the ongoing additional maintenance and renewal costs were covered. The next step for those in favour of reinstating the fast-line platforms at Carnforth would therefore be to identify how this reinstatement could be delivered and, indeed, funded in the longer term in respect of those additional maintenance and renewal costs. The Government believe that the local authority would also have an important role to play and we would wish to see whether it supported such a move as part of its transport strategy. Equally, it would be vital that there was clear support from a train operating company for such a move.</p>
	<p pid="b.138.1/10">In conclusion, the Government welcome local initiatives to improve rail services as fitting their wider localism agenda. The Department is always very happy to provide advice and guidance, but we think that decisions like this are best made locally. At the end of this debate, let me say to my hon. Friend that I recognise and sympathise with the case he has put forward. There are significant problems, which I have identified&#8212;stopping services and the penalty in journey times&#8212;but I will go back to my officials and raise with them one more time the points that he has raised tonight to see if there is any way we can make any progress, without me making any commitments from the Dispatch Box tonight. I will write to him about both the general and specific points he has raised.</p>
	<p pid="b.138.1/11" class="italic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="b.138.1/12" class="italic">House adjourned.</p>
