	<p pid="a.167.1/1">With permission, Mr. Speaker, I should like to make a statement on the European Union. Earlier today, my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary published a White Paper on prospects for the European Union. Copies are available in the Vote Office. He has asked me to pass on his apologies to the House for the fact that he is not present in the Chamber, as he is attending the conference on Afghanistan this afternoon.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.1/2">In April 2004, the Government decided to publish the first in a series of reports intended to stimulate the closer and deeper involvement of Members of both Houses in EU affairs. Today's White Paper is the fifth such report. It looks at future challenges and provides a detailed report on our presidency, set against the objectives that we set ourselves in the White Paper, published on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-30">30 June 2005</phrase> and relayed in a statement to the House on the same day by my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.1/3">Notwithstanding the EU's historical achievements, it has faced the pressing challenge in recent years of adapting to an increasingly globalised political and economic environment and of reconnecting as an institution to its citizens. That need was highlighted graphically last spring, when two member states rejected the constitutional treaty and the European Council failed to agree a deal for the next financial perspective&mdash;the European budget.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.1/4">So when the United Kingdom took over the reins of the presidency in July, we were faced with three tasks. The first task was to follow through on Europe's promise to open accession negotiations with Turkey, against a backdrop of growing uncertainty in some parts of the EU about that aspect of future enlargement. The second task was to agree a deal for the coming financial perspective, and the third task was to begin the process of better preparing the EU for the globalised world.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.1/5">First, I turn to enlargement. On <phrase class="date" code="">3 October</phrase>, we opened accession talks with Turkey&mdash;that decision was welcomed on, and supported by, both sides of the House. That has the potential to bring huge economic and political benefits to Turkey, Britain and the European Union, not least through the Union's relationship with the wider Islamic world. At the same time, and in a welcome sign of how far the western Balkans has come in recent years, we opened accession negotiations with Croatia, began stabilisation and association agreement negotiations with Bosnia and Serbia and Montenegro, and granted candidate status to Macedonia.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.1/6">On the budget, we brokered a deal that will shift spending towards the economic development of the newer, poorer member states and also mean that similar sized economies such as France and Italy will finally be making payments roughly on a par with the United Kingdom. The Council also agreed a full, wide-ranging review covering all aspects of EU spending, including the common agricultural policy, to report in 2008&ndash;09.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.1/7">Finally, we took practical steps to strengthen economic reform within the European Union. Along with the European Commission, we agreed better ways of assessing the effects of proposed regulation on business. We also reached agreement on the capital requirements directive, which will help the European banking sector to remain competitive, and agreed the registration, evaluation and authorisation of chemicals&mdash;REACH&mdash;regulation. In two other areas directly related to the competitiveness agenda&mdash;the services directive and the working time directive&mdash;we made some progress during our presidency, and we will work to ensure that that is built on over the coming months.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.1/8">Alongside those practical measures, we also began a broader debate on the future of Europe. The special summit of European leaders here in the United Kingdom at Hampton Court in October has already led to detailed work on areas such as improving European universities, increasing support for research and development and establishing a common European energy policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.1/9">The issues of Turkish accession and the European budget and the debate on the future direction of Europe set the context of our Presidency, but so, too, did other international challenges. As the White Paper reflects, development was a key priority for both the EU and the G8. The European Union agreed, for the first time, a common vision and set out common objectives and principles for development work, as well as a comprehensive strategy on Africa. That will be backed up by the more and better development aid agreed by European member states last year, with aid doubled to $80 billion a year by 2010 and commitments on achieving the UN 0.7 per cent. gross national income target by 2015. The international finance facility for immunisation that we launched in September has the potential to prevent 5 million children from dying over the next 10 years. The deal on sugar reform will reduce trade distortion and, at the same time, save European Union consumers between $3.5 billion and $4 billion a year from 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.1/10">Another key area of work was the increasing role of the European Union outside its direct borders. During our presidency, we oversaw the launch of European security and defence policy missions, notably to monitor the Rafah border crossing and the peace agreement in Aceh in Indonesia. The EU worked closely with partners to support Israeli disengagement from Gaza and provided policing and electoral support in Iraq. The E3 continued to lead the ongoing and complex negotiations on Iran's nuclear ambitions.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.1/11">During our presidency, the EU also engaged in dialogue with Russia, Ukraine, China and India and agreed a comprehensive work programme for economic co-operation with the United States of America. At the UN climate change negotiations in Montreal, against expectations, it was agreed, with European support, to begin UN talks on long-term action to address climate change and launch a process for agreeing targets beyond 2012.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.1/12">We had always planned to ensure that counter-terrorism efforts would be a feature of our presidency. Those efforts inevitably gained far wider currency after the tragic events of <phrase class="date" code="">7 July</phrase> here in London. During our presidency, the EU endorsed a new counter-terrorism strategy, agreed that phone and internet data from across Europe will be stored for use in criminal and terrorist investigations and set out an action plan to tackle radicalisation and the recruitment of terrorists.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.1/13">We thus handed over to the Austrians a European Union that was stronger and more confident in the future than the one that we inherited back in July. Just as we inherited an agenda from the Luxembourg presidency, there are a number of areas of work that the Austrians are charged with taking forward. Over the coming year, enlargement will continue to be high on the European agenda. We are confident that Bulgaria and Romania will be ready to join in 2007, but only if they take urgent and vigorous action to address the main areas of concern recently identified by the European Commission. We will continue to provide significant bilateral assistance to help them to achieve that goal.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.1/14">We expect both Turkey and Croatia to be ready to open accession negotiations on some individual chapters early in 2006. During his visit to Turkey and Cyprus last week, my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary reiterated the need for Turkey to ratify and implement the protocol to the Ankara agreement. We are committed, too, to ending the isolation of the Turkish Cypriot community and finding a way in which it can trade with European Union member states. I am sure that all members of the House would agree on the importance of achieving a successful and ambitious outcome to the Doha development round of world trade talks. We want to build on the frankly disappointing outcome of the Hong Kong ministerial meeting in December, and we will continue to do all that we can to enable the round to be concluded this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.1/15">That means committing to significantly increased market access for developing countries, particularly in agriculture; substantial reductions in all trade-distorting subsidies, including the elimination of export subsidies, as agreed at Hong Kong; and effective special and differential treatment for developing countries. In the first half of this year, the European Union will take stock of the &quot;period of reflection&quot; agreed by the European Council last June. Among other things, that means evaluating the status of the constitutional treaty. The United Kingdom has always made it very clear that the priority in this period of reflection and, indeed, for the European Union more generally is economic reform and a determined effort to advance work that actually makes a difference to the lives of Europeans.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.1/16">That view was endorsed only this month by the President of the Commission, Jos&eacute; Manuel Barroso, who said that we should</p>
	<p pid="a.167.1/17" class="indent">&quot;avoid a new division in Europe about institutions. The most important concern now of EU citizens is not institutional problems, but jobs and growth.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.167.1/18">The focus of the spring European Council will therefore be economic. An important part of that agenda will be the work that the European Union will take forward on the six priority areas agreed at Hampton Court in October: research and development, universities, energy, demographics, security and immigration, and the common foreign and security policy. Finally, the future financial arrangements for the Union, agreed at December's Council, now have to be agreed with the European Parliament through a new inter-institutional agreement on budgetary discipline, which will provide the necessary formal basis for EU spending for the period 2007&ndash;13.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.1/19">I have set out for the House the key features of the United Kingdom presidency as well as priority areas of work for the European Union over the coming six months. The fuller details in the White Paper published this morning give some sense of the depth of the business done and that which is left to do. As the White Paper makes clear, the Government are convinced that Britain's national interest is best served as a strong, active and influential member of the European Union, and I commend it to the House.</p>

	<p pid="a.170.0/1">May I begin by sending on behalf of the official Opposition our deep condolences to the families and friends of the two British soldiers who were sadly killed in Iraq, the second one being the 100th British soldier killed there? We send our best wishes to the soldiers who were injured.</p>
	<p pid="a.170.0/2">I thank the Minister for giving me advance sight of the statement, and for informing the House about the Government White Paper. Having read and heard the statement, however, many of us regard it as a non-event, to say the least. It is a curious time and place to make a statement but, nevertheless, it raises a number of interesting questions, not least because more than two thirds of the statement was retrospective and did not look at prospects for the EU in 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.170.0/3">The coming year may not be as dramatic as the last for the European Union, but we should be in no doubt of its importance for the EU's future. It will be the time for the EU to reflect on the constitution's rejection and the long-term strategic issues that it faces on competitiveness, security and its own future as an institution in the 21st century. The Minister stated the Government's position with his usual confidence, but does he remember that when the Foreign Secretary introduced a similar statement last year, he went into detail about the Government's position on the EU budget? He told the House that the Government were working</p>
	<p pid="a.170.0/4" class="indent">&quot;to ensure that future EU budgets are limited to 1 per cent. of Europe's economic output and that that money is spent where it most adds value.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-03">3 February 2005</phrase>; Vol. 430, c. 994.]</p>
	<p pid="a.170.0/5">However, the Government ended up agreeing a rise in the EU budget to 1.045 per cent., which is an increase of &pound;25 billion, but they obtained no guarantee of further common agricultural policy reform. The Foreign Secretary assured the House that Britain's rebate &quot;remains fully justified&quot; and reminded hon. Members that Britain had a veto. We all know what happened next&mdash;the rebate was cut by &pound;7 billion for the budget period. Does the Minister understand that hon. Members are suspicious whether what the Government say will match what the Government actually achieve?</p>
	<p pid="a.170.0/6">The White Paper rightly underlines the need for economic reform. Does the Minister agree that the services directive is essential in achieving a more competitive Europe? The European Parliament will vote on the directive in a fortnight. Does the Minister agree that the main aim for member states is to reach a political agreement in the Council by the March economic summit? Does he agree that there has already been extensive consultation with social partners? It would be unacceptable if further consultation became an excuse for yet more delay. Does he agree that the European Parliament's internal market and consumer protection committee has produced a balanced text to ensure the freedom to provide services, and that it should be our common goal to maintain it, particularly with regard to article 16?</p>
	<p pid="a.170.0/7">Turning to trade, many hon. Members on both sides of the House were disturbed to hear Commissioner Mandelson say two or three weeks ago that the Chancellor of the Exchequer had not spoken to him recently&mdash;it appears that the Chancellor of the Exchequer has been ignoring him&mdash;which is causing much upset on the Government Benches. I understand that the Minister is a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of both Commissioner Mandelson and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, which means that he is caught between a rock and a hard place. Nevertheless, will he use his good offices to get them talking? It is good to talk, but on such a crucial issue, it is vital.</p>
	<p pid="a.170.0/8">Does the Minister agree that Britain's opt-out from the working time directive is vital to our competitiveness in a globalised marketplace? Will the Government ensure that our opt-out is maintained in its entirety and that it will not be negotiated away in any form?</p>
	<p pid="a.170.0/9">Paragraph 143 of the White Paper rightly emphasises the importance of energy security. Does the Minister agree that recent events in Ukraine and Georgia prove the need for secure and diverse supplies? Will the Minister outline in more concrete terms how the Government plan to achieve that?</p>
	<p pid="a.170.0/10">All hon. Members agree that Europe's greatest achievement over the past two decades has been the spread of democracy throughout the continent. In March, a presidential election will be held in Europe's last remaining authoritarian state, Belarus. Why does the White Paper not mention that election? What steps will the Government and our European partners take to ensure that that election is free and fair?</p>
	<p pid="a.170.0/11">The middle east is a vital area for our security and for the cause of peace in the world, so Hamas's election victory must be a matter of the deepest concern. Will the Minister tell the House the criteria by which the continued funding of the Palestinian Authority by the EU will be judged? Is it not essential that Europe and America hold a united position in dealing with Hamas? Does he agree that if a Hamas-led Palestinian Authority remains wedded to terror, it should not receive EU funding?</p>
	<p pid="a.170.0/12">One of the most important questions for the European Union concerns how it can modernise itself to meet the demands of the 21st century. The constitution's defeat in last year's referendums proves that the old model of integration is failing Europe and alienating its people. Does the Minister agree that a British vision of an open, flexible Europe has never been more relevant? Is not that the issue for British leadership? Will the Minister explain why no British Minister attended last week's important sound of Europe conference in Salzburg? How do the Government expect to influence the debate, if they do not participate?</p>
	<p pid="a.170.0/13">We all agree that the EU needs to be more open and accountable. To that end, what steps are the Government taking to achieve open voting in the Council and a stronger say&mdash;the so-called yellow-card procedure&mdash;on subsidiarity for national Parliaments? Some member states and EU commissioners still insist that the EU constitution will soon be ripe for revival. This month, the Foreign Secretary told us that</p>
	<p pid="a.170.0/14" class="indent">&quot;it is difficult to argue that the constitution is not dead.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-10">10 January 2006</phrase>; Vol. 441, c. 147.]</p>
	<p pid="a.170.0/15">The dead parrot syndrome. Should not a British Government, leading in Europe, have a clearer view than &quot;perhaps yes&quot; or &quot;perhaps no&quot;?</p>
	<p pid="a.170.0/16">Britain's last presidency was marked by the contrast between the hype in the last paper presented to Parliament, and a failure to deliver fully in many areas. Over the next year, we will support the Government where they take practical steps to reform the EU to meet its long-term challenges. But it is now time for the Government to outline a British vision of Europe that can meet those challenges, rather than merely parroting what the EU requires.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-01-31a.185.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1946" speakername="Mark Pritchard" colnum="185"  time="016:33:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060131/debtext/60131-11.htm#60131-11_spnew9">
	<p pid="a.185.1/1" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move,</p>
	<p pid="a.185.1/2" class="indent" pwmotiontext="yes">That leave be given to bring in a Bill to end the trade in endangered animals on the internet; and for connected purposes.</p>
	<p pid="a.185.1/3">The trade of endangered animals on the internet is a growing and serious problem. Independent commentators estimate that the trade is worth up to &pound;25 billion globally and up to &pound;3 billion involving UK websites and consumers. Those large figures include both live and dead animals and animal products. Today, I would like to disaggregate those figures and focus on the millions of pounds being spent in the sale of live endangered animals on the internet, driving some of those species near to extinction.</p>
	<p pid="a.185.1/4">It may come as a shock to some hon. Members to discover that this morning, in my office at the House of Commons, I logged on to the internet and could have purchased a leopard, a zebra, sea turtles, chimpanzees, an American bald eagle, an alligator, a dromedary, a mountain lion and a Lear's macaw. Sadly, the list goes on and on. I was very interested to hear from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1875" name="Andrew MacKinlay">the hon. Member for Thurrock (Andrew Mackinlay)</phrase> about the elephant in the room at the Foreign Office. That escaped my research, but I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will pass on the details to me.</p>
	<p pid="a.185.1/5">In August 2005, the International Fund for Animal Welfare found that 9,000 endangered live animals were offered for sale online in one week. That search was limited to five categories of animal, but I am sure that the House will be interested to know that animals of all categories are sold every minute of every day, year after year. That same research found that 146 primates were available for sale in the UK. All of the sales were illegal: all the animals were endangered, and all were being traded through UK-registered websites. We do not know where the animals involved in such sales come from, how they are transported, or the conditions in which they are kept.</p>
	<p pid="a.185.1/6">The Government rightly recognise the need to protect the environment, but what about the natural environment? Given the obvious scale of the problem, is not it incumbent on the Government, industry and us all to do far more to tackle this serious problem? The Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1548" name="Jim Knight">the hon. Member for South Dorset (Jim Knight)</phrase>, is attending the debate, and I know that he is a good-natured man who takes animal welfare very seriously. I hope that he will consider the suggestions that I have to make, especially given that the Animal Welfare Bill is currently before the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.185.1/7">What could the Government do? First, I encourage them to work in collaboration with internet service providers and auction houses to launch a public awareness campaign on this matter. That campaign should be targeted at both consumers and traders and should inform them about what is lawful and what is not. Secondly, I encourage the Government to establish a hotline&mdash;for telephones and/or emails&mdash;so that illegal activity can be reported to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. That information should then be shared with wildlife crime officers and the police.</p>
	<p pid="a.185.1/8">Thirdly, a legal help desk should be set up so that people who are not sure about the law can contact someone to obtain clarification. Very often, the terms and conditions of websites involved in this trade are hidden somewhere in the back of beyond in the ISP's terms and conditions. We need to expose what is lawful and what is not. Finally, as I said earlier, the Government should liaise more closely with crime enforcement agencies.</p>
	<p pid="a.185.1/9">Earlier, I saw the Home Secretary appear briefly in the Chamber before dashing out. I wish that he had stayed, because I know that the Government are keen on targets. I hope that the Minister will speak gentle words of encouragement in the right hon. Gentleman's ear about the adoption of a new Home Office target to ensure that police forces around the country bring successful prosecutions of those involved in this illegal trade, leading to their conviction. The House will be astounded to hear that only two successful prosecutions were brought last year for trade involving endangered animals. In both cases, the animals were dead and stuffed, but we know that there is a trade in live animals. With the greatest respect, I believe that the fact that there has not been a single prosecution in respect of the trade in live animals is an indictment of the Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.185.1/10">The Government and the Minister could take the lead in this matter, both in this country and in Europe. Under the convention on international trade in endangered species, they could use our EU block vote to lead the way internationally. There is a CITES conference in June next year: I hope that the Minister will go there and declare that the UK is leading the way on animal welfare and that it has forged agreement in Europe about a new way forward on the matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.185.1/11">Possibly the best and most immediate way to deal with the illegal trade in endangered animals is to establish a code of conduct for all ISPs and those involved in the internet market place to ensure that they do not facilitate the sale of endangered animals, directly or indirectly, through their products and services. As a Conservative, I hope that that could be achieved through a voluntary code, not a statutory one. We will have to wait and see whether the ISPs are prepared to go along with that.</p>
	<p pid="a.185.1/12">What can ISPs do? We know that web content can be curbed because we have seen the excellent work of the Internet Watch Foundation, which works to prevent access to child pornography. ISPs should work in partnership, perhaps with the Government, to extend their remit to involve animal watch internet work. If they are not prepared, or are unable, to do that, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs needs to work with them to set up a dedicated animal watch foundation to ensure that that evil trade stops.</p>
	<p pid="a.185.1/13">It is no longer good enough for ISPs or the Government to argue that such a task is too great, too complex or the amount of data too overwhelming. We know that when ISPs have a will, they can find a way. For example, they can monitor, block and stop links from sites that promote political thought or messages. We have seen that with Google in China in the past week. If Google and other ISPs can regulate free speech in China, the least they can do is regulate the sale of endangered animals on the internet in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.185.1/14">ISPs should also co-operate with Government and each other in agreeing a code of conduct. They should make it easier to report illegal activity, because current abuse processes are not user friendly, and provide better training for staff. ISPs should not see this Bill as a threat to their business, but as an opportunity to differentiate their products so that discerning and promiscuous&mdash;in the marketing sense&mdash;consumers can say, &quot;I do not want to give my money to this ISP if it is not animal welfare friendly.&quot; Consumers should make the choice. They should email their ISP and threaten to take their business elsewhere unless this issue is taken seriously. I hope that the Government will take the lead on that. ISPs could gain a competitive advantage by taking this matter seriously.</p>
	<p pid="a.185.1/15">If ISPs do not take action, consumers will, and the courts might. There is a case before the courts at present, but I shall not go into detail. However, we know that the courts may take action if the Government do not. This is a serious and growing problem and I hope that the Government will take it more seriously. I know that the Minister is serious about animal welfare&mdash;this is his opportunity to prove that to the country and to put an end to this abhorrent trade.</p>
	<p pid="a.185.1/16" class="italic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="a.185.1/17">Bill ordered to be brought in by Mark Pritchard, Mr. Roger Gale, Jeremy Wright, David Howarth, Mr. Eric Martlew, Hugh Robertson, Mr. David Drew, Michael Fabricant, Ms Celia Barlow, Mr. John Randall, David T. C. Davies and Mr. Edward Vaizey.</p>

	<p pid="a.189.5/1">This promises to be yet another interesting and wide-ranging debate on an important issue. In moving the motions in the name of my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary let me make it clear to the House that the Government support Lords amendments Nos. 1 and 3, but not Lords amendments Nos. 2 and 4.</p>
	<p pid="a.189.5/2">The Bill was last debated in the House on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-11">11 July 2005</phrase>, on Report and Third Reading. A number of hon. Members expressed concerns, not so much about the Government's policy aims, but about what they feared would be unintended consequences in relation to the freedom of expression. The Bill passed with a substantial majority, but further debate and Divisions in the other place resulted in substantial changes being made.</p>
	<p pid="a.189.5/3">The Lords amendments make four significant alterations. They separate the religious hatred offences from the racial hatred offences. They remove what was known as the &quot;likely limb&quot;, so that only intentional behaviour will be caught. They insert a wide-ranging freedom of expression provision and remove the words &quot;abusive and insulting&quot; from the offence, so that only threatening speech and behaviour will be caught. Those changes considerably reduce the scope of the Bill, to the extent that, in our view, it would be virtually impossible to bring a successful prosecution.</p>

	<p pid="a.195.2/1">I have made one substantive point and I have three more to make. As I have said, I am relaxed about taking interventions but I must make progress.</p>
	<p pid="a.195.2/2">The second effect of the amendments agreed by their Lordships is the removal of what was known as the &quot;likely limb&quot;, leaving only intent as the threshold for prosecutions under the offence. It remains our clear view that intent by itself is not enough, but rather than seeking to reinstate the likely limb, we have decided to introduce an additional test of subjective recklessness, so for a prosecution to succeed, it would be necessary to prove either that someone intended to stir up hatred, or that they were aware that their actions or words would stir up religious hatred, yet they continued. No one could be caught out inadvertently, as some have feared.</p>
	<p pid="a.195.2/3">It is worth pointing out that, in Committee, Opposition Members suggested that a recklessness provision might be a good substitute for <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1394" name="Dominic Grieve">the likely limb. Indeed, the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve)</phrase> said that such a provision</p>

	<p pid="a.195.2/6" class="indent">&quot;I understand that the law uses recklessness as a benchmark to judge whether the perpetrator knew what they were doing and what the likely consequences of it would be, but proceeded to do it anyway.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee E,</i> <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-30">30 June 2005</phrase>; col. 85.]</p>

	<p pid="a.206.5/1">One of the reasons why Iqbal Sacranie is so much in favour of the Bill is, no doubt, the letter that the Home Secretary sent to mosques at the time of the general election. It said that he merely wanted to give Muslims the protection enjoyed by Jews and Sikhs. I understand that right-thinking Muslims are concerned, but that is a complete misreading of existing legislation. The fact is that Jews and Sikhs are protected only by racial laws: there is no protection for the religions of Judaism and Sikhism.</p>

	<p pid="a.217.0/1">I shall attempt to emulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1639" name="Frank Dobson">the brevity of the right hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Frank Dobson)</phrase>, but I am afraid that I would seek to follow little else in his speech. He still seems suck in the same problem as the one that the Government have been stuck with throughout the proceedings on the Bill&mdash;trying to create some sort of equivalence between the treatment of people according to their race with that according to their religion. Those are very different aspects and they must be treated very differently.</p>
	<p pid="a.217.0/2">I wish to associate myself with the remarks about <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1394" name="Dominic Grieve">the Minister made by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve)</phrase>. The debates have often been difficult and emotive, as we have heard today, and I want to place on the record my appreciation of the Minister for the fact that he has been unfailingly courteous to those who have opposed him throughout the proceedings on the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.217.0/3">The Liberal Democrats invite the House not to agree with the Government's motions to disagree with the other place. The arguments about the Bill in its broadest sense have been well rehearsed, and I do not intend to repeat them. However, by saying that there will not be a huge number of prosecutions under the legislation, the Minister does not bring any great comfort to the House. I seem to recall that the same arguments were advanced with regard to demonstrations in Parliament square, but in excess of 28 people have been arrested on allegations of breaching that legislation merely a few months after it came into force. Such reassurance does not address our concern that there will be a fundamental chilling of the freedom of expression.</p>
	<p pid="a.217.0/4">In our view, the Bill is very much improved by the amendments that have been made in the other place, and we very much regret that the Government again seek to change it in two ways. First, they want to expand the state of mind involved from merely making the crime one of intent by including recklessness. That is our most fundamental objection, and I will expand on that later. Secondly, the expansion to include conduct that is covered by abusive or insulting words or behaviour is also exceptionally worrying and very wrong. In fact, we find the combination of both those elements fundamentally obnoxious. If the crime were merely one of intent, I could probably live with the extension to include abusive and insulting behaviour.</p>

	<p pid="a.222.0/1">I will certainly be brief. On Report on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-11">11 July 2005</phrase>, I said that I supported what the Government intended to do, but had certain reservations. To some extent, my reservations were being echoed by Rowan Atkinson and others who were saying that if the Bill were passed, it would be difficult to criticise religion. I believe that the Government should take that matter very seriously. I have no religion myself&mdash;I am virtually a lifelong non-believer&mdash;but it goes without saying that I believe in people's right to practise, or not to practise, a religion. I certainly take the view that religion should be the subject of criticism. That applies to any religion, although it is mainly the Christian religion that is the subject of satire. There is no reason, as I said on <phrase class="date" code="">11 July</phrase>, why Islam, or the Jewish, Hindu or Sikh religions should not face the same ridicule and criticism that the Christian religion has faced over the past 25 years or so. I am pleased with the Government's supplementary provisions&mdash;I know that they will not satisfy the critics because, frankly, nothing will, given that they are largely opposed to the measure&mdash;which make it perfectly clear that someone is not guilty of an offence unless they are</p>
	<p pid="a.222.0/2" class="indent">&quot;reckless as to whether religious hatred would be stirred up&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.222.0/3">Moreover, the provisions state that</p>
	<p pid="a.222.0/4" class="indent">&quot;a person is not guilty of an offence under this Part of intending to stir up religious hatred if he intends to stir up hatred against a religion, religious belief or religious practice&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.222.0/5">To a large extent, the Government have tried to meet the criticism of those of us who were concerned that Rowan Atkinson had a valid point. He may not be satisfied, as critics are generally not satisfied, but the Government have tried to tackle concerns, and they should be congratulated.</p>
	<p pid="a.222.0/6">In our debate, as on previous occasions, the Government have repeatedly been asked to give examples. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1478" name="Tony Wright">My hon. Friend the Member for Cannock Chase (Dr. Wright)</phrase>, for instance, wanted them to give examples of offences that are not covered by existing law and the Minister tried to explain the position.</p>
	<p pid="a.222.0/7">To return to the core issue, why are the Government introducing the legislation? The cynical, simplistic view, certainly of the Opposition, is that it is a tactic to attract Muslim votes. That may be a crude way of putting it, but I do not believe that is the case. Neither do I believe that Muslims will vote Labour simply because of the measure. There is no evidence in the past 40 years that people of Jewish origin or people who practise the Jewish religion said that they would vote Labour because of legislation on incitement to race hatred. Indeed, if we look at the Jewish vote, we can see that it turned to Labour when the lower-middle class and the middle class proper started to vote Labour in 1997. I simply do not believe that the Muslim population will say, &quot;Ah, the Government have passed a measure on the religious hatred. That's a good reason to vote Labour.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.222.0/8">The Government are genuinely concerned, as has been pointed out by my hon. Friends today and on previous occasions, about people who are being victimised, spat on, looked on with contempt and spoken of in a certain way simply because they belong to the Muslim faith. That is the reason why they have acted, just as, more than 40 years ago, previous Labour Governments&mdash;not Conservative Governments&mdash;introduced the measures to which I referred and which were the subject of intense criticism and opposition by the Conservatives. Reference has been made to political correctness. If political correctness means in effect that people are protected in law against religious or racial abuse and so on, I am very much in favour of it. Whatever it has brought about&mdash;there are some distortions and exaggerations&mdash;it is better than the situation that existed before those laws were passed.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-01-31a.251.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1793" speakername="Philip Hammond" colnum="251"  time="020:46:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060131/debtext/60131-31.htm#60131-31_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.251.0/1">This debate was always at risk of being an anti-climax after events earlier in the evening, but it is none the less about a big issue, which is important for all of us&mdash;those of us already drawing a pension, those of us approaching retirement and even those of us at the beginning of our working life.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.0/2">We are faced with some truly long-term decisions, which our adversarial party political system with its four or five-year cycle may not be ideally designed to address. We caught a little of that in the Secretary of State's tone of voice. He tells us that he wants to build consensus, and the Opposition have certainly come to the debate with that intention. The British people will expect us to lift the debate out of the party political arena and genuinely attempt to build a consensus that gives them the security to plan for the long term, knowing that the settlement we eventually reach will not be unravelled by a spin of the wheel of political fortune.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.0/3">This is the first opportunity that we have had to discuss pensions since the publication of the Turner report and at this stage an Adjournment debate is a good forum in which to conduct our discussions. Such is the magnitude of the issue, however, that we shall need further debates, and I am pleased that the Secretary of State acknowledged that that would be possible. I want to consider some of the preliminary issues that we feel need to be addressed to allow us to hold a serious and open debate in the attempt to reach consensus about the long-term future of our pension system. My main focus will be Turner.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.0/4">Turner said that there is no immediate crisis. Although there may be no immediate crisis in relation to the state pension or the public sector's ever-mounting liability in respect of its pensions, many people coming up to retirement, who are stakeholders in private pension schemes, are experiencing something that feels remarkably like a crisis. I want to deal with that issue, as I am sure that many Members will want to raise it.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.0/5">There are several reasons for the real, current crisis in the private pension sector&mdash;significantly lower investment returns and rising life expectancy, which is good news for everybody except actuaries. Nobody, not even in our most rabid moments, could hold the Government responsible for those issues. There are other things for which the Government must take responsibility, such as the Chancellor's &pound;5 billion-a-year raid on pension funds, which has wiped about &pound;125 million off the value of pension funds.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.0/6">I hope that the Minister will refer to one issue in particular that is outside the scope of the big, long-term debate, although the Government could address it in the shorter term. It is the extent to which the regulatory regime under the Pensions Act 2004, which is supposed to encourage and protect private pensions, is encouraging a retreat from higher risk, higher return assets in favour of liability-driven investment in gilts, with a series of self-reinforcing and rather negative outcomes that we are seeing at the moment. That has driven up demand for long-dated gilts, thus driving down yields. Pension fund liabilities are calculated by reference to the yield on the long-dated gilt, which in turn has increased the deficits of those pensions and fuelled the next round of liability-driven gilt buying. Meanwhile, the funds have missed out on a recovery in the equity markets and perhaps an opportunity to repair the damage that previous stock market downturns have done to their balance sheets.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.0/7">I certainly subscribe to the view that politicians, especially Opposition politicians, should not lecture the Debt Management Office on how it manages the public sector debt, so I shall not offer the Minister any recommendation about how the Government should fund their debt, and I urge my colleagues to follow that lead. However, the Minister could look at the demand side of the problem. He could consider the regulatory environment that is driving the flight from risk to gilts. He could also consider the extent to which the regulatory regime and the risk-based pension protection fund levy, which is now anticipated, are reinforcing patterns of investment behaviour that are making it more and more difficult for companies to plug the holes in their pension funds. I should be grateful if the Minister would say something about that very immediate problem tonight.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.0/8">While the Minister is responding, he might just take a quick look at the financial assistance scheme, which was set up with a great fanfare nearly two years ago to provide a solution for the estimated 85,000 people who have been left high and dry by the collapse of pension funds. The financial assistance scheme has so far paid out to just 15 people, and that figure represents an advance. The latest published Government figure shows that 13 people have benefited, but we are grateful to the Minister for yesterday updating that figure to 15 people. If we could deal with those short-term, immediate issues, that would be great.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.0/9">Let us go back to the long-term reform agenda. The Turner report represents a serious analysis of the twin challenges that the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions has spelled out, namely, of dealing with the demographic changes in Britain's population while maintaining Britain's world competitiveness, which is essential to the prosperity of all of us. Pensioners, those in work and those unable to work all depend on that international competitiveness for our future prosperity.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.0/10">Whether or not the Opposition or, indeed, any other hon. Member adopts Lord Turner's recommendations in the end, we should treat his report with respect and use it as the basis of an attempt to build the great consensus that the Secretary of State spoke about&mdash;a consensus between political parties in the House, between generations in the country, between the sexes and between different groups in our society. The Opposition are formulating our response to Turner's proposals on the basis of the principles of fairness, sustainability, security and affordability. The settlement must be fair by embracing all types of pension&mdash;state, public and private sector&mdash;and it must recognise the differences in people's life expectancy and the need for flexibility to accommodate them. It must address the discrimination against women that is built into the present state system.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.0/11">On security, people must be given a clear understanding of what the state will and will not do. That security must be based on a consensus that gives people the confidence to plan ahead and make their own arrangements, with an understanding that the settlement that is reached will endure for many years. On sustainability, the settlement must be durable in the long term. It must provide a solution for today's pensioners, as well as people in work and those who are not yet of working age. Of course, the settlement must be affordable, both now and in the future, against an objective baseline of the likely future cost of the present system, if it remains unaltered.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.0/12">As we analyse and consult on the Turner proposals, which the Government are also doing, the big questions are becoming clear. Is the trade-off of a higher state pension age for higher state pensions the right one? Is it affordable and can it be made sufficiently flexible to be fair to those whose life expectancy will be different from the rising average? What degree of compulsion should be employed when encouraging people to save for a second pension? Should employers be required to contribute and, if so, how much? Should there be special arrangements&mdash;either subsidies or exemptions&mdash;for small and medium-sized enterprises? How should such a second savings scheme be managed and how will it impact on the existing pensions industry? As the Secretary of State said, the Government are actively pursuing answers to those questions and a lively debate has already begun. Is the balance between public and private provision that Turner proposes the right one for Britain in the 21st century?</p>
	<p pid="a.251.0/13">The process is not competitive because we are not trying to get better answers than the Secretary of State. I genuinely hope that by separately pursuing the answers to those questions, we will find not that we get precisely the same answers&mdash;that would be too much to expect&mdash;but that our answers are sufficiently close to make it possible to build a genuine consensus across the political divide. If we are to have a genuine debate and a real consensus is to be formed, the Government must come to the debate with an open mind. They must be ready to engage in some give and take, because without that we cannot build a consensus.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.0/14">The political reality is that if all bar one member of the population reaches a consensus and the one is the Chancellor of the Exchequer, we will not have a way forward. It was thus disappointing to those of us who want a consensus that the Chancellor tried to shut down the debate before it got started. He positioned himself from the outset as the road block to pension reform. If we are to have a proper debate, we need transparency, flexibility and impartiality. Nothing must be ruled out and nothing must be off limits in advance of the debate. I have to say that the Government's track record on that is not good, although that is no reflection on the Secretary of State or the Minister for Pensions Reform, because the culprits in this case are the Secretary of State's predecessor but one and the Chancellor of the Exchequer.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.0/15">Although private sector pension stakeholders are facing tough choices and often negotiating against the constraint of the viability of their employers in the face of burgeoning pension deficits, public sector unions face no such constraints. Whether funded or unfunded, any gap in public sector pension provision must be met by the taxpayer. The Secretary of State's party fatally undermined any claim it could make to be addressing the matter impartially when it caved in to the public sector unions on retirement at 60 before the general election, and caved in again in October last year. If we are to have a serious debate and face up to the tough decisions that must be made, the burden of adjustment must be shared equitably. There can be no exclusions or favours for specific groups. We must all be in this together.</p>

	<p pid="a.254.1/1">The Secretary of State should talk to his right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer. The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry said that the deal is done and that it is set in stone. However, according to the minutes recording the Chancellor's appearance at the Treasury Select Committee on 15 or <phrase class="date" code="">16 December</phrase>, the Chancellor clearly suggested that that was not the case and that it was not set in stone. He said there was merely a framework in place and that negotiations are still to be conducted.</p>
	<p pid="a.254.1/2">There is therefore a chink of light, and we need to understand what the Government's position is. Everyone needs to understand their position on this vital issue. <i>[Interruption.]</i> My position is that we are all in this together, whether we have a state, public, or private sector pension. A sometimes painful and difficult adjustment must be made if we are to achieve a sustainable settlement. May I tell the Secretary of State that it is not sustainable to say, before the debate begins, that any group in society should be excluded from facing up to the realities of demographic change, reduced investment returns and all the other factors&mdash;<i>[Interruption.]</i> The Secretary of State may talk about U-turns now that the election is over, but his Government took on the public sector unions only to back off for party political reasons when the election was called.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-01-31a.258.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1951" speakername="David Laws" colnum="258"  time="021:18:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060131/debtext/60131-33.htm#60131-33_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.258.0/1">This is a short debate on a big subject, although we have already had some good contributions, including the thoughtful one we have just heard from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1410" name="Frank Field">the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field)</phrase>. Given that we have only three hours, it is tempting to suggest that we should have more of these debates over the next few months and more time available for contributions, but we have had much consultation on pensions and pension reform, not only over the past year, but since the Government came to power in 1997.</p>
	<p pid="a.258.0/2">Many in the House and in the country are desperate to see some proposals from the Government that arrive on the promised time scale, so that we can get stuck into a meaningful debate knowing that there is a clear position on the part of the Government as a whole and that we will not be strung along for a long time before we get some half-baked, small-scale proposals that command the support of the various members of the Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.258.0/3">I will make some relatively short comments on the broad aspects of the direction of pensions policy. I hope that, in time, the Government's own pensions policy will turn up so that everybody, including outside groups, can engage seriously in the debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.258.0/4">I join <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1793" name="Philip Hammond">the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond)</phrase> in congratulating Lord Turner on his contribution to the debate in his excellent and well thought through report. Liberal Democrat Members strongly agree with some of his principal conclusions, including his view that the existing pension system</p>
	<p pid="a.258.0/5" class="indent">&quot;is not fit for purpose looking forward&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.258.0/6">that</p>
	<p pid="a.258.0/7" class="indent">&quot;the current state system will deliver increasingly inadequate and unequal results&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.258.0/8">and that</p>
	<p pid="a.258.0/9" class="indent">&quot;significant future growth of means-testing would . . . undermine voluntary private pension saving by the very groups of people . . . most in danger of under-provision.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.258.0/10">Lord Turner's report was a powerful indictment of the future direction of Government pension policy. It clearly shows that, in his view and in that of the other commissioners, a fairly significant change will be needed if we are to have a pension system that the country can rely on in the decades ahead.</p>
	<p pid="a.258.0/11">I welcome the contributions that the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions made to the debate. They have been modest and hedged with various conditions, but on the whole what I hear from him is promising, as is what I hear from the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister was rather quiet when Lord Turner's report emerged and did not take any opportunities to get involved in the rather sharp-edged debate that was going on between Lord Turner, the Department for Work and Pensions and the Treasury. However, his speech to the CBI conference on <phrase class="date" code="">29 November</phrase> will command broad support across the country. The Minister is no doubt aware of his comments, but I remind him of what he said:</p>
	<p pid="a.258.0/12" class="indent">&quot;On any basis, we will need to spend more on retirement if there are more retired people&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.258.0/13">That is an obvious statement that does not seem to have hit home in the Treasury as yet. He went on:</p>
	<p pid="a.258.0/14" class="indent">&quot;We need a system that enshrines a decent basic state pension, funded by the tax-payer; that allows top-ups in a way that is easy to save; a retirement age that begins, over time, to reflect the changing demographic reality; and a proper balance between the obligations of the employer, the employee and the state. And, of course, any reform has to be affordable.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.258.0/15">He also said:</p>
	<p pid="a.258.0/16" class="indent">&quot;The basic construct of Turner is right; it addresses these requirements.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.258.0/17">We very much agree with the broad thrust of those comments and with the broad thrust of Turner, although there is immense detail, particularly in the proposals on the basic state pension architecture, that people will want to debate further. Lord Turner has done a good job, the DWP has, cautiously, done a good job, and the Prime Minister has, very cautiously, done a good job.</p>
	<p pid="a.258.0/18">It is tedious to have to go back to the issue that dominated Lord Turner's report&mdash;the battle between the Treasury and Lord Turner&mdash;but it is fair to say that the contributions of the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Treasury to the pensions debate have not been very constructive. In particular, they have confused the issues of affordability, which any Treasury will be concerned about, and sustainability, which those who design the state pension system must be concerned about. At the moment, we have an affordable system that is not sustainable. Unless the Chancellor can hold both those concepts in his mind at the same time, we will have a problem. It is significant that, after Lord Turner's report was published, he had to publish a document rebutting Treasury allegations about his figures entitled, &quot;Sanity in Figures&quot;. When <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> asked him in an interview on <phrase class="date" code="">3 December</phrase> whether it followed that he believed that some of the briefing by the so-called Brownites was insane, he replied:</p>
	<p pid="a.258.0/19" class="indent">&quot;Yes . . . The Treasury has a legitimate role in looking at the cost implications . . . but we have to have a sensible debate about the figures.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.258.0/20">He is right.</p>
	<p pid="a.258.0/21">We must hold a sensible debate about the point that the Prime Minister made gently in his speech to the CBI conference when he mentioned that our pensioner population will increase by approximately 50 per cent. in the next three or four decades. Yet the Government forecast that the amount of gross domestic product that goes into the state pension architecture will remain roughly stable. As the Pensions Commission has pointed out for months, that can only mean pensioners becoming significantly poorer compared with the rest of the population.</p>
	<p pid="a.258.0/22">It is unrealistic to believe that any party, let alone the Labour party, would allow pensioners at the bottom of the pile to fall behind the rest of the population by ceasing to link means-tested benefits to average earnings and reverting to prices. No Labour Member seriously believes that any Government would entertain that option for long.</p>
	<p pid="a.258.0/23">We are left with several key issues. We must consider what to do with the basic state pension architecture. Our view is similar to that of the Prime Minister and Lord Turner: there should be a much better and simpler basic state pension. There is a big debate to be held about its nature, how women are dealt with, whether it is a citizens pension and whether the contributory principle will be respected. However, the basic principle is a much simpler state pension that everybody can understand and that lifts people out of poverty. The Government's job is to fund that properly to ensure that people can rely on it. We need as much consensus as possible across the political spectrum so that it lasts.</p>

	<p pid="a.262.1/1">I agree with the hon. Gentleman that there are major issues involved and that remuneration needs to be looked at as a passage. Often, however, the better pension benefits in the public sector do not look as though they are simply compensating for lower pay, although that seems to be what most economic evidence suggests today. Of course the hon. Gentleman is right to say that there should be negotiation on these matters.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.1/2">Whenever I have discussed these issues with people in my constituency who work in the public sector, I have found that they are far more grown up than we assume. They understand that there are no blank cheques to be signed in this regard. Many of them, including people in the local government scheme, have suggested that they should be paying higher employee contributions. They ask why employee contributions have not risen over time, even though people are living longer. One of the mistakes that we make in politics is to treat people as though they are children who cannot understand these basic issues, but most people understand that there is no such thing as a free lunch, and that Governments of all parties have to grapple with these difficult issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.1/3">Another issue that needs to be looked at if we are to afford a better basic state pension architecture is the state pension age. The Government appear to have made a significant change in their policy in this area; I think I heard the Secretary of State say today that he thought an increase in the state pension age was inevitable. That is quite a striking change in Government policy from that of the Secretary of State's predecessor but one, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1755" name="Andrew Smith">the right hon.

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-01-31a.264.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1440" speakername="Terry Rooney" colnum="264"  time="021:37:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060131/debtext/60131-34.htm#60131-34_spnew4">
	<p pid="a.264.0/1">We on the Select Committee had the pleasure of the company of Lord Turner and John Hills at our hearing on <phrase class="date" code="">14 December</phrase>. I want to give a word of warning to any Members who intend to invite Lord Turner to a meeting: they will find a man who is sincere, passionate and knowledgeable&mdash;he can recite reams of his report without notes&mdash;but extremely loquacious. If the meeting is for one hour, allow two.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.0/2">The key thing with Turner is that the analysis is superb, but the problems come with the solutions he offers. I do not think I am breaking any secrets when I say that I chaired a parliamentary Labour party meeting about a month ago where 31 people were present and 28 different solutions were on offer. That is the situation we are going to be in.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.0/3">There is such a wide range of ways out in terms of how Turner analyses things and I am intrigued, but also concerned, by the use of the word &quot;consensus&quot;. Who are we aiming to get consensus with and between? Is it with and between men and women, because that has never been there before? Is it between young and old? Is it between contributors and beneficiaries? Is it between the public and private sectors? Is it between professionals and manual workers? Let us not forget that if we move at some time to a retirement age of 69, a less than academically gifted child who leaves school at 16 will have to work for 53 years. A professional person, however, will have a working life of around 40 years. That is a huge difference in terms of retirement age.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.0/4">Consensus between the various parties in the House is the most dangerous consensus of all. In 1975, we had that consensus across all parties in the House including the Scottish National party, and it lasted five years. With the best will in the world towards Opposition Members, it is an absolute betrayal to pretend that they agree with something and will stand by it should there be a change of Government. That is a pretence and a sham. The consensus needs to be among the public, consumers and those most affected by the issue, not between the Government and Opposition Benches.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.0/5">There is no doubt that there is a crisis of confidence among consumers about the pensions and savings industry. Often, that crisis of confidence is used by individuals to justify not doing something that they had no intention of doing in the first place. We must recognise, however, that there have been successive broken promises, mainly by Governments but also by financial institutions&mdash;changes to the state earnings-related pension scheme, pensions mis-selling, low-cost endowment policies&mdash;</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-01-31a.271.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1596" speakername="Peter Viggers" colnum="271"  time="022:05:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060131/debtext/60131-37.htm#60131-37_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.271.0/1">Like <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1598" name="Quentin Davies">my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford (Mr. Davies)</phrase>, I did not approach the debate in a particularly consensual mood. I have a declared interest in relation to the pensions industry. Although the pension fund of which I am chairman is well funded and robust, it brings me into contact with a wide range of people in the pensions field, so I know of the distress and difficulty caused to them and to the employees of their companies by the difficulty in which the industry has been put.</p>
	<p pid="a.271.0/2">Currently, a large number of people can live with some dignity in retirement&mdash;the high proportion of people who retired on final salary pensions. However, I do not share the sturdy optimism that seems to permeate the Turner report and I fear for the future pensions of people in their 30s and 40s. The situation will deteriorate, and badly.</p>
	<p pid="a.271.0/3">Why? I have heard some people simplistically blame the Chancellor of the Exchequer for the impost of &pound;5 billion a year on the pensions industry in 1997, but that does not put things into the correct context. The causes of this massive crisis&mdash;the shortfall of funding in the pensions industry&mdash;are more varied. The Association of Consulting Actuaries has estimated the deficit at &pound;130 billion. That is a massive deficit and it is difficult to see how it can be overcome. Its first cause is longevity.</p>
	<p pid="a.271.0/4">For continuous mortality investigation&mdash;CMI&mdash;actuaries normally use the mortality tables of the 92 series, which means that they are basing mortality estimates on the period from 1991 to 1994. They will not be using the 00 series, which covers 1999 to 2002, until much later; indeed, that series will not even be published until the late spring of 2006. The difference in projecting tables forward is dramatic. Forward projections using the 92 tables, making the assumptions on which the 00 tables are based&mdash;even those are not fully up to date&mdash;would be that a 60-year-old man in 2006 would live to between 85 and three quarters and 92 and three quarters, with a central assumption of 88 and three quarter years. That is one and a quarter to eight and a quarter years more than the previous central assumption of four and three quarter years. In case anyone writes to me after the debate saying that the sums do not add up, I point out that they are actuarial figures not arithmetical ones. The numbers are dramatic and they throw out of gear most of the previous calculations.</p>
	<p pid="a.271.0/5">The second cause of the shortfall was stock exchange weakness, which has led to a rush into gilts. The gilts yield has gone down, thereby increasing the problem of covering projected pension costs, because of asset liability modelling.</p>
	<p pid="a.271.0/6">Thirdly, FRS 17 accounting standards have caused companies to include pensions in their general accounts. Fourthly, the ACA says that the increasing regulation and cost of pension fund administration causes a considerable burden. Fifthly, there is the unreality of final salary schemes&mdash;defined benefits&mdash;and unsustainable benefits. To a certain extent, we all lived in a fool's paradise in the 1980s and 1990s, failing to realise that the aspirations of those who were due to retire could not be sustained.</p>
	<p pid="a.271.0/7">Finally, there is the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who in 1997 failed to see the weakness of the pensions industry and kicked the patient downstairs. A range of measures were taken in the 1997, of which the then Financial Secretary said,</p>
	<p pid="a.271.0/8" class="indent">&quot;this should benefit all investors&mdash;including pension funds&quot;.&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2002-11-07">7 November 2002</phrase>; Vol. 392, c. 766W.]</p>
	<p pid="a.271.0/9">In fact, the Chancellor of the Exchequer imposed a &pound;3 billion charge on pension funds and actuaries took account of that; they factored it in and adjusted their figures accordingly, so &pound;3 billion a year has been taken out of the pensions industry since 1997, which has caused this massive crisis.</p>
	<p pid="a.271.0/10">What are the problems to be faced? First, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1793" name="Philip Hammond">my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond)</phrase>, who spoke from the Front Bench, made the fair point that the Chancellor of the Exchequer must accept that the solution to the pensions crisis will cost public funds a great deal of money. When I first became involved in the pensions industry, I used to take a factor of 18 to multiply the amount that would be needed to generate a pension&mdash;so to generate a pension of &pound;10,000 a year, for instance, one would need a fund of &pound;180,000. Now I take a factor of 24 to 26. It would take &pound;240,000 to &pound;260,000 to generate a pension of &pound;10,000 a year. There is no such thing as a cheap pension.</p>
	<p pid="a.271.0/11">Secondly, I agree with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1598" name="Quentin Davies">my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford (Mr. Davies)</phrase> in saying that, having considered the matter carefully, there is no alternative to compulsion. I cannot understand how we can succeed in persuading enough people to go in for the amount of pension that is needed without compulsion. That leads me to the third point: incentives or means-testing.</p>
	<p pid="a.271.0/12">A couple of days ago, we who serve on the Treasury Committee had before us witnesses who gave evidence about the corrosive effect of means-testing. We were told that means-testing does not really have much effect on savings, because the people involved in means-testing would not bother to save anyway. In fact, means-testing has a corrosive effect, and we cannot continue with the present rate of means-testing. The percentage of pensioners on means-testing is now rising well above 50 per cent. and approaching 60 per cent. That is totally unsustainable. We must therefore have incentives.</p>
	<p pid="a.271.0/13">The next point is defined benefits, and I accept with reluctance that defined benefits are now dated. It is most unusual for someone to start with a firm and stay with that employer&mdash;unless it is the public sector&mdash;for two or three decades. I therefore accept that defined contributions are the logical way ahead, but it is also a fact that employers have tended to put 12 to 15 per cent. of employees' wages into defined benefit schemes, whereas the amount going into defined contributions schemes will be much lower&mdash;6 to 7 per cent. or thereabouts and sometimes as low as 4 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.271.0/14">The fifth point that we must face is the private-public gap. It is natural for those in the public sector to wish to hold on to their pension advantages and their great advantage of having the benefit of early retirement. Ministers have made much of the fact that the public sector will save &pound;13 billion from adjustments to the age of retirement; but, in fact, that is a &pound;13 billion adjustment between people who are fortunate enough to be on the escalator of earlier retirement and those who are unfortunate enough to come in later. That is most unfair.</p>
	<p pid="a.271.0/15">My sixth point is the Pension Protection Fund. I recently attended a meeting with the regulator, David Norgrove, who was very charming, competent and capable&mdash;I wish him well&mdash;but the massive burden that the PPF will impose on business has been widely misunderstood and underestimated. It will be a major problem, and the classification of companies, which will cause some to pay many times more than others, will cause immense disadvantages and difficulties. It will drag down bad companies and, finally, it will drag down good companies. I fear that, in the medium term, the PPF will impose a burden on private sector companies that is simply not understood at the moment.</p>
	<p pid="a.271.0/16">In summary, I accept the main thrust of the Turner commission. First, I agree that there should be a new earnings-related provision&mdash;it should be private&mdash;and I would not rule out the national pensions savings system. I suspect that such a system might well change its spots and evolve into something very different with time, so it deserves study. Secondly, the state pension must be reformed, with a consequent reduction in means-testing. Thirdly, everyone, including the Chancellor of the Exchequer, must accept that public expenditure on pensions will need to rise. Fourthly, the pension age must be addressed and, I think, raised. We need to face up to our problems. We need to be frank and open about the numbers and the problems, and I submit that Ministers have not always done so. We must encourage informed debate. That is the democratic way.</p>

	<p pid="a.276.0/1">I offer the House an opinion:</p>
	<p pid="a.276.0/2" class="indent">&quot;When Labour came to power we had one of the strongest pension provisions in Europe . . . and now we have some of the weakest.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.276.0/3">That is not my view, but the view of the former welfare reform Minister, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1410" name="Frank Field">the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field)</phrase>. A major cause of the crisis is the Government's decision in 1997 to remove the right of pension funds to reclaim dividend tax on the equities that they owned. That decision has created a loss of &pound;5 billion, discouraged the country's savings culture and increased the spread of means testing.</p>
	<p pid="a.276.0/4">The Pensions Commission's first report in 2004 exposed a large hole in the country's private pension provision and funds. The Commission found that</p>
	<p pid="a.276.0/5" class="indent">&quot;in 2002&ndash;03, 11.3 million people in work were not making contributions to any private pension scheme&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.276.0/6">To compound the problem, in recent years, many final salary company pension schemes have been wound up, as has been said. The Pension Protection Fund and the financial assistance scheme were introduced to address the problems relating to the winding-up of pension schemes. However, the Government's response to the crisis has been inadequate. The financial assistance scheme, which involves the payment of &pound;400 million of public money over 20 years, is welcome, but with only &pound;20 million a year, it cannot live up to the billing that the Government gave it, hence the narrow criteria for entitlement to assistance. The Government presented the FAS as an answer to many of the problems of pension scheme wind-ups. In raising expectations so high, it is inevitable that many people will be disappointed when they face the reality of the FAS.</p>
	<p pid="a.276.0/7">The Government also appear to be badly informed about the scale of the problem. In a written answer, they revealed that they do not know how many occupational pension schemes started winding-up in each year since 1997:</p>
	<p pid="a.276.0/8" class="indent">&quot;Figures on schemes starting to wind up between 1997 and 2000 are not available as the register does not contain information on whether the schemes that started to wind up before 2000 started before or after 1997.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-20">20 July 2005</phrase>; Vol. 436, c. 1821W.]</p>
	<p pid="a.276.0/9">In a further written answer, the Government revealed that they do not know how many occupational pension scheme members face losses to their pension savings due to their schemes being wound up by their employers:</p>
	<p pid="a.276.0/10" class="indent">&quot;We have not made any estimate of the total number of occupational pension scheme members who are facing losses to their pension savings due to their schemes being wound up by their employers.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-21">21 July 2005</phrase>; Vol. 436, c. 2023W.]</p>
	<p pid="a.276.0/11">In recent years, we have also seen plenty of debate, but little action, on the reform of the local government pension scheme. Much of the contention has been focused on the 85-year rule. The system allows anyone whose age, added to their number of years of service, comes to 85 or more to retire on an unreduced pension, even if they have not yet reached the age of 65. Last year, the Government attempted to standardise the pension age by removing the rule. However, on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-18">18 March 2005</phrase>, faced with an imminent strike, the Deputy Prime Minister announced that he would revoke the regulations with retrospective effect.</p>
	<p pid="a.276.0/12">Local authority employers estimate that that U-turn cost councils an extra &pound;450 million a year, and private businesses have complained about it bitterly. Private businesses are outraged by the high cost of protecting public sector pensions, while private sector pensions face increasing pressure. David Frost, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, has highlighted the disparity:</p>
	<p pid="a.276.0/13" class="indent">&quot;On the one hand, we have the private sector workforce being told it must work longer and put more money into their own pension pot, but here we have the public sector workforce who can still retire at 60&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.276.0/14">Sir Digby Jones, director general of the CBI, has also criticised the decision:</p>
	<p pid="a.276.0/15" class="indent">&quot;This is a bad deal for the taxpayer. The government has capitulated to the threat of public sector strikes&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.276.0/16">The crisis was reignited last week after union leaders, fed up with the lack of progress in the resumed negotiations with local authority employers, decided to ballot members. The unions are seeking a similar deal to that agreed between Ministers and unions last autumn, under which the pension age for public sector workers would be raised to 65 for new recruits but kept at 60 for existing employees. Dave Prentice of Unison has warned:</p>
	<p pid="a.276.0/17" class="indent">&quot;The local government employers, the LGA and the Government should be in no doubt of how serious we are . . . The clock is ticking, but there is a window of opportunity and I would urge everyone concerned to make the most of it&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.276.0/18">Long-term solutions are required. The people of this country want and deserve retirement security, and the Government must act quickly to deal with the issue.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-01-31a.278.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1696" speakername="Philip Dunne" colnum="278"  time="022:29:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060131/debtext/60131-38.htm#60131-38_spnew1">
	<p pid="a.278.0/1">I declare an interest, which is in the register. I am the director of an investment management company, which, while it is not directly involved in pensions, has some relevance to the debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.278.0/2">I welcome the debate and the Turner commission's contribution to it. The lack of attention to the pensions crisis, which has been growing over the past eight years, is one of the major failings of this Government. I am delighted that they now plan to make some proposals, which we will study with interest when they are released.</p>
	<p pid="a.278.0/3">I agree that there is a dire need to address the lack of savings in this country. The savings ratio has more than halved under this Government, from 9.3 per cent. in 1997 to 4.25 per cent. in 2004, according to the pre-Budget report. The UK has a substantially lower savings rate than our main European competitors&mdash;France, Germany and Italy&mdash;all of whom have a rate in the range of 10 to 11 per cent. The Secretary of State referred to the level of under-saving; indeed, some 10 million people in this country are not saving. It is clear that this group in particular need to increase their level of saving in order to make some contribution to providing for their old age.</p>
	<p pid="a.278.0/4">My contention is that accelerating the means-testing of pension credit has significantly accelerated the disincentive to save that we have witnessed under this Government. I know that they do not agree with me because earlier this month, when I raised this issue with the Minister for Pensions Reform in this place, he said:</p>
	<p pid="a.278.0/5" class="indent">&quot;There is very little evidence that means-testing, under the previous Government or this Government, has reduced saving on the part of pensioners, but since 1997 there has been much greater confidence in the economy . . . In 1992, when there was deep anxiety about the future of the economy, people saved more. Today they are more confident.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report,</i> <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-09">9 January 2006</phrase>; Vol. 441, c. 14.]</p>
	<p pid="a.278.0/6">Well, I am pleased that the Minister is here to respond and I urge him to read, if he has not already done so, the contribution of the Association of British Insurers. A report that it commissioned from the Personal Finance Society</p>
	<p pid="a.278.0/7" class="indent">&quot;shows that means-testing is already starting to have a negative impact on public attitudes to saving and on the willingness of financial advisers to discuss saving with lower earners.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.278.0/8">In looking at Lord Turner's proposals, it is important that the Government are a bit more ambitious than Lord Turner has been in reducing the proportion of pensioners covered by the pension credit, given its means-testing nature. Currently, some 40 per cent. are on pension credit. That figure is supposed to come down by a mere 7 per cent., to 33 per cent., through the report's recommendations. I regard that reduction as insufficient if we are to change this country's savings culture.</p>
	<p pid="a.278.0/9">I invite the Government, in considering the report's recommendations, to address the issue of consumer protection, which was touched on by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1410" name="Frank Field">the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field)</phrase>. The Secretary of State mentioned in his opening remarks the difficulties that the pension mis-selling problems of the past pose for the culture of saving and for the credibility of the pensions regime. I agree that they undoubtedly contributed to a lack of public confidence in pensions and in saving for retirement. I also agree with Lord Turner that introducing greater simplicity into the pensions industry is a desirable objective, but simplicity does not equal suitability. Means-testing, by definition, gives rise to the need for a suitability test. As we have heard, individuals will need to be willing and able to save a substantial amount of money to be confident of an adequate return in their retirement&mdash;one that will exceed funds available from the state under the proposed arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="a.278.0/10">I raised this issue with Lord Turner when he appeared before the Select Committee last month. I asked him whether he had consulted the Financial Services Authority regarding the mis-selling risks associated with his proposed national pension saving scheme. He said:</p>
	<p pid="a.278.0/11" class="indent">&quot;We have not directly consulted the FSA on this.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.278.0/12">I found that a very surprising response, given the diligence that he had shown in producing such a comprehensive report.</p>
	<p pid="a.278.0/13">Consumer protection is, I assume, of considerable concern to all hon. Members. I therefore urge the Government to address the issue when they consider Lord Turner's proposals. We all know of people across all income groups, particularly the lower paid, who, at various stages of their lives, have other commitments and are not in a position to set aside money to save. For those people, some element of consumer protection and advice should be available.</p>
	<p pid="a.278.0/14">Another problematic aspect of the national pension savings scheme is asset allocation. Who is to decide whether it is appropriate for some individuals to have their assets invested in predominantly fixed income returns, compared with equities? Other hon. Members referred to that earlier. It is difficult to produce a one-size-fits-all investment policy for the entire population. That is why I agree with other hon. Members who recommended a mixed approach. There may need to be some form of state-sponsored provider, but there must a role for private providers to come up with alternative schemes to allow choice. That again raises the question of suitability and advice. If suitability and consumer protection can be ignored, as Lord Turner suggests, is that appropriate Government policy? Does it not leave the Government exposed to the risk of mis-selling? It is a risk that the Government must consider carefully.</p>
	<p pid="a.278.0/15">In the remaining few minutes, I shall highlight specific issues relating to the NPSS. In the absence of compulsion, the combination of auto-enrolment and a very low cost offering will replace existing pension schemes. That is not just my view; it is the view of leading consultants in this area, Cazalet Consulting, who were quoted in the <i>Financial Times</i> earlier this week. I shall read one conclusion from their report on pensions profitability, which states that</p>
	<p pid="a.278.0/16" class="indent">&quot;the Turner NPSS system, if implemented, would be likely to cause a surge in life company pension plan lapses as consumers move to take advantage of the very low proposed pricing levels. We doubt whether the NPSS could ever work as planned, however, as the best case persistency assumptions used in that report anticipate a dramatic improvement in persistency, which is at odds with the current reality of steadily deteriorating lapse rates.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.278.0/17">To put that in layman's language, the current average lapse rate of pension schemes&mdash;both individual and group corporate schemes&mdash;is about 18 per cent. a year. In other words, 18 per cent. of people contributing cease contributing. In the Turner report that rate is estimated to be 10 per cent. a year, and the heroic assumption is made for the NPSS that the lapse rate will fall to 2.5 per cent. a year. That seems an ambitious assumption, to say the least. It raises the question whether employers will put pressure on employees to encourage opt-outs from a voluntary system, and whether it is feasible to achieve adequate investment management skills to manage funds on such a low commission basis. With a 30 basis-point charge, at least 22 per cent. would go in administration costs, which leave only eight basis points&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="a.286.2/1">I certainly do not agree that we should return to the arrangement whereby large numbers of single pensioners were living on &pound;69 a week. Were we to go back, that would be the position. At the moment, every single pensioner is entitled to an income of at least &pound;109.45 per week, and the Turner report proposes that auto-enrolling people into the national pension savings scheme will enable them to build up savings and a pension, which, over time, would reduce the extent of means-testing. We certainly must not, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1598" name="Quentin Davies">the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford (Mr. Davies)</phrase> was calling for, go back to the time when large numbers of people were on extremely low incomes. I, too, am delighted to be debating these matters with him again. His earlier contribution took me back to 1999.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.2/2">We have introduced the state second pension, greatly boosting the savings of those on low incomes and carers. We have also introduced stakeholder pensions, which the hon. Gentleman mentioned, of which there are 2.5 million, making an important contribution and enabling people who could not save economically in the past to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.2/3">We now have a foundation that opens up the chance of an enduring pensions settlement for the UK. I hope that the optimism expressed across the Chamber today will be fulfilled over the next few weeks as we move towards proposals for reform and a consensus about what we should do.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.2/4"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1793" name="Philip Hammond">The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond)</phrase> was right to draw attention to Lord Turner's statement that there was no immediate crisis for pensioner incomes. I think he was trying to make out that there was a crisis, but I believe that Lord Turner was right.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.2/5">I welcome the hon. Gentleman's commitment to a constructive contribution on his party's behalf. He asked a question about something that he has mentioned to me a couple of times, about which I know he has written to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State. He wanted to know whether he and his colleagues could have access to PENSIM2. He will have a response from my right hon. Friend tomorrow. I believe that the position is not entirely straightforward, but my right hon. Friend certainly wants to be helpful.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.2/6"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1410" name="Frank Field">My right hon. Friend the Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field)</phrase> expressed some clear views about what was the right way in which to proceed. He was very critical of the Turner proposals. He mentioned a worry to which a number of people have drawn attention, about the danger of levelling down. That is an important point, although given that many employers currently make significant contributions to defined-benefit and defined-contribution pension schemes, I do not see why, if we made 3 per cent. the minimum, employers would necessarily think it appropriate to reduce their contributions.</p>
