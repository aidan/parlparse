<p>I have reviewed the rules under which officers have been required to relinquish temporary rank on ceasing to perform the duties for which the rank was granted. I have come to the conclusion that there are good grounds for giving the holder of temporary rank, which may have been held for long periods, a greater degree of security in his rank. This I propose to bring into effect as follows. In future an officer holding temporary rank will be permitted to retain it while on a course of instruction. He will retain it during the interval between being posted away from one Unit and joining his new unit provided he is fit and available for duty during the whole period and any delay in his joining is due solely to the exigencies of the service; this will cover the voyage period in the case of officers ordered overseas. In addition officers will be permitted to retain temporary rank while absent sick up to a period of two months (provided that the sickness is not their own fault) and, as previously, for three months if wounded in action.</p>

<p>Yes, Sir. I very sincerely deplore the untimely death of this young soldier, and I have the greatest sympathy with the parents in their

grievous loss. On the other hand, I am satisfied that negligence cannot be imputed to any of the officers or others who were concerned in the accident. The risk to which this soldier was exposed was a risk of his service, and though the circumstances of the case are undoubtedly distressing, I could not distinguish it from those other cases in which soldiers lose their life not in the presence of the enemy. As regards the last part of the Question, the parents are in the same position as the parents of other soldiers whose death has been attributable to service. This means that an application may be made to the Ministry of Pensions if the parents are in pecuniary need arising from old age, infirmity, etc. I understand that a claim would not be successful at the present time, but it could be made in the event of the conditions being satisfied at some other time.</p>

<p>asked the Secretary of State for War whether, in view of the number of accidents occurring to children by live explosives which they have picked

<p>Although a member of the public injured owing to the negligence of military personnel on duty has no right of action against the Crown, it has been for many years the invariable practice to make <i>ex gratia</i> awards of compensation. No such payment would be made where contributory negligence is established on the part of the injured person. The question of contributory negligence does not usually arise in the case of children of tender years who are not normally regarded as being capable of negligence. Children between the ages of 10 and 16 are normally regarded in law as capable of contributory negligence. While I cannot give the assurance my hon. Friend desires, if he knows of any case in which he thinks a claim has been unfairly rejected on that ground, perhaps he will let me have particulars.</p>

<p>As regards Singapore, a relatively short official list of names of prisoners of war has been received within the last few days from Tokyo through the agency of the International Red Cross Committee. The next-of-kin have in many cases been informed, and the notifications are being completed as quickly as possible. As regards Hong Kong, the majority of names of British Army personnel have been reported by the Japanese authorities. As regards the care and welfare of prisoners of war, a certain amount of information has been collected from various sources, and I will circulate a statement on the subject in the OFFICIAL REPORT.<br/>
The House will wish to know that, in view of the delays which are taking place in the receipt of complete lists of prisoners from the enemy Powers, it has been decided that the normal period, for which Army family and dependants' allowances and soldiers allotments continue to be paid in respect of officers and soldiers reported as missing, shall be extended in future from the existing 17 weeks to 26 weeks from the date the relatives are notified that the officer or soldier is missing.<br/>
The position of the relatives of the comparatively small numbers who are still regarded as missing after the surrenders in Hong Kong has also been considered, and it has been decided in their case that the allowances already specially extended shall be further extended to 31st January next.<br/>
The position in relation to those reported missing in other Far Eastern theatres of operations is being kept under constant review. The special extension of the allowances in these cases will not generally begin to expire until the end of the year, and I am not in a position to announce any further extension at the moment; but the House can rest assured that a further extension will be made in their case if we do not receive from the Japanese Government in the near future anything like a full list of names of those who are prisoners.<br/>

<p>In general, Irish agricultural workers who are accustomed to come over to Scotland for short-term seasonal employment work long hours, and consequently, when paid at hourly, piece or contract rates, they earn comparatively high wages. Wages for flax-pulling&#x2014;a particularly heavy job&#x2014;are fixed by the Ministry of Supply, for whom the crop is grown. The basis is a piece-rate of &#x00A3;6 10s. per acre for average conditions, and &#x00A3;7 per acre for poor conditions. If an Irishman is continuously resident in this country for more than six months of the Income Tax year, or, even if he is not continuously resident for that period, if he has regular annual residence, he becomes liable for payment of British Income Tax. Lodging allowances are paid by the Ministry of Labour and National Service to Irish workers with dependants, in the same way as to other transferred workers. Minimum rates of wages, applying equally to Irishmen and others, are laid down in the Orders of the Scottish Agricultural Wages Board. Otherwise, in accordance with the general policy of the Government, wages are regarded as a matter for bargaining between employers and workers.</p>

<p>Recruitment of Irish workers for agriculture falls into two distinct categories: (1) Short-term casual workers for employment during busy seasons, e.g. harvest and potato lifting, and (2) Long-term workers for employment throughout the year. Under (1), recruitment is effected by contact between the employer and the worker either direct or through an agency. In this type of case, the rate of wages is a matter for agreement between parties (subject to there being no breach of the relative Wages Order). In the majority of cases falling under heading (2) the employers are the Scottish Agricultural Executive Committees and direct contact is made by a representative of the Committees in Eire with such Irish workers who have volunteered for agricultural work in Scotland at their local employment exchanges. The contract of employment in these cases provides for weekly engagement and wages at the minimum rates prescribed in the respective Orders of the Scottish Agricultural Wages Board. Wherever possible, employment is arranged on a piece or contract basis at the rates usual in the district. There are no restrictions upon the movements of Irish agricultural workers as a class in this country, but those who arrived from Eire on or after 8th August, 1941 are required to register with the police of the district in which they are first employed, are prohibited from taking employment in other than agricultural work without the permission of the Departments concerned, and police consent is necessary for any stay in excess of three months.</p>

<p>So far as I am aware, these trust deeds do not impose a bar on the acceptance of paid employment by pensioners but they commonly provide that the pension which would otherwise have been payable is to be suspended or reduced so long as the employee concerned is employed by the firm paying the pension. My right hon. Friend has

no evidence that this is having any appreciable effect on the continuance of pensioners on work either with their former employers or with some other employer, and in the absence of such evidence he would not feel justified in taking steps to interfere with the conditions on which these pensions are granted.</p>

<p>There is no scheme of this nature, but a certain amount of control is exercised by my Department owing to the fact that, in general, aliens can only be employed under permit from my Department.

<p>Since my last statement on the Madagascar operations our Forces have continued to advance southwards, hampered by road blocks and obstructions. On 2nd October there was a sharp engagement approximately 70 miles south of the capital, as a result of which Antsirabe was occupied. The local populace gave our troops an enthusiastic welcome.<br/>
The Vichy resistance was next encountered about 130 miles south of Tananarive, but as a result of vigorous action by our Forces, Ambositra and Ivato were occupied on 19th October. The last organised resistance north of Fianarantsoa, which is the chief town in the south of the island and is approximately 180 miles to the south of the capital, was overcome on 29th October, and the town was occupied on the evening of the same day. Upwards of 1,000 prisoners were taken during this period.<br/>
The advance southwards continued, but a French emissary arrived at our forward brigade headquarters on 5th November and asked for an armistice. At 2 o'clock in the afternoon hostilities ceased. The armistice was signed at midnight on 5th&#x2013;6th November, and everything is proceeding very smoothly.<br/>
Between 10th September&#x2014;when further operations in Madagascar began with the assault on Majunda&#x2014;and 17th October we lost only 17 killed and 45 wounded. Since 17th October our casualties have been extremely light, but details are not known.</p>

<p>The repair of the heavy war damage inflicted by the enemy on Malta is clearly a task which would be beyond the unaided financial resources of the Government of Malta and the property owners within any reasonable postwar period. I think there will be general agreement that the outstanding gallantry shown by the people of Malta in the face of enemy atacks of unprecedented length and severity, calls for some special recognition. In view, therefore, of the unique position of Malta and of the extraordinary sufferings which it has so gallantry undergone, His Majesty's Government propose


to seek the approval of Parliament for a free gift of &#x00A3;10,000,000 to the Government of Malta to be used for the purpose of restoration of war damage and the rebuilding of Malta after the war. They propose that this sum should be paid in the first place to Trustees to be nominated who will make the money available to the Government of Malta as and when required. The gift will be available for meeting liabilities under legislation which with the approval of His Majesty's Government the Government of Malta have put before the Council of Government providing for schemes of compensation for war damage of property on lines generally similar to those in this country, as well as any other expenses incidental to post-war rebuilding. If the actual expenditure under those heads falls short of the total voted, the balance will be applied to other purposes beneficial to Malta after the war.<br/>
If, on the other hand, the total liability of the Government of Malta for compensation and rebuilding, after allowing for contributions from property owners, exceeds the sum of &#x00A3;10,000,000, His Majesty's Government will be prepared to make available such further sums as may be required to meet liabilities which are found, in the circumstances as existing after the war, to be beyond the capacity of the Government of Malta to meet from its own resources, having regard to all other calls upon these resources at that time.<br/>
A Vote will be submitted to Parliament for this purpose as soon as possible.</p>

<p>My right hon.

<p>asked the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of War Transport whether any recent consideration has been given to the position of sailors of the Merchant Service, who, leaving the pool for reason of sickness, are solely dependent on national health benefit, with the result that, in some cases, there is inconvenience and in others hardship to the dependants?</p>

<p>In 1941 the National Maritime Board decided that as from 1st January,. 1942, officers and seamen of the Merchant Navy who fell sick and were left in overseas ports, should continue to be paid by their employers. Since that date, such officers and seamen have continued to-receive their basic wages and their differential money while they are abroad. Payments are made for periods up to, but not exceeding, twelve weeks. Officers who are sick and away from duty in the United Kingdom receive their pool pay for periods up to eight weeks. Seamen who are sick in the united Kingdom are entitled to sickness benefit under the National Health Insurance Acts. If an officer or man suffers from an organic disease which is attributable to a normal risk of seafaring life, and if this risk has been substantially increased by war conditions, he may be granted a disability allowance by the Ministry of Pensions under the provisions of the Pensions (Mercantile Marine) Act, 1942.</p>
