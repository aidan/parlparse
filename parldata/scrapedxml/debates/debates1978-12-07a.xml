<p>Does the Secretary of State recognise that the violence in South Armagh presents a very serious situation, and that the statistics he has given us today include the deaths of 10 innocent people, soldiers, UDR men, policemen and civilians?

Wilson) took in 1976 to combat the growth of terrorism in South Armagh and perhaps reintroduce those measures?</p>

represents a big improvement on the whole of 1977.</p>

<p>Is the Secretary of State aware that this increase in the month of November indicates that the IRA is trying to raise the level of violence? Is he aware that it is vital that the IRA does not succeed in its objective of provoking a reaction from other sections of the community?

<p>I am sure that the hon. Gentleman recognises that the local commanders in the towns of Northern Ireland work with the local security committees. Local politicians, members of the local populace, business men and traders are on those local security committees, and they themselves in spite of the bombing attacks by the Provisional IRA in recent weeks, have taken the decision not to erect the barriers and not to allow the PIRA to defeat them.</p>

<p>We recognise that the Secretary of State had to postpone yesterday's visit to London by the Irish Foreign Minister, but will he take urgent steps to resuscitate that arrangement, and will he call the attention of the Irish Government to the fact that supplies, money and explosives are drifting up to the North from the South? Moreover, will he ask the Minister to correct the wrong impression which was given recently in the Dail, where statements were made to the effect that there would be dead prisoners in the Maze before Christmas?</p>

<p>Yes, Sir. I am not aware that there will be dead prisoners in the Maze before Christmas. The situation there is well in hand. The prison officers are doing a remarkably good job, and they are cleaning and disinfecting all those cells every three weeks. They are not allowing that situation to get out of hand.<br/>
On the other matter, yes, of course, I shall see the Foreign Minister of the Republic as soon as possible. I am sorry that the visit was postponed, first, because of a change of parliamentary business, and second, because he would have been dashing back from the EMS conference. But I must tell the hon. Gentleman, on the security plane, that we discuss the situation every time we meet, and there is increasing co-operation between the North and the South. In fact, the Garda Commissioner came to Belfast in September this year to discuss the improvements with the Chief Constable.</p>

<p>A number of measures have already been taken to encourage home ownership in Northern Ireland. Other measures at present under active consideration include the sale of Housing Executive dwellings to sitting tenants in areas where housing need has been met, and the need for official action to secure the provision of sites for private house building. Moreover, when a current study of the factors governing the level of house prices in

Northern Ireland is complete, I intend considering what further measures, if any, might be taken.</p>

<p>But is the Minister aware that the shortage of home loans in the Province has almost reached crisis proportions? Further, does he appreciate that, by restricting lending to what are virtually substandard dwellings, the Housing Executive has placed a large part of the housing market out of the reach of the buyer?</p>
</speech>

<p>I am sorry, but the hon. Gentleman clearly does not know enough about private home ownership in Northern Ireland. The truth is that we probably have the best arrangement with the building societies of any region in the United Kingdom, and the Executive certainly places no undue limit currently on the question of loans to those who wish to buy their own property.</p>
</speech>

<p>I appreciate the contribution which the Housing Executive's home loans scheme makes to the possibility of house purchase in the Province, but will the Minister accept that the home loans department of the Executive takes an inordinately long time to process applications, thereby occasioning payments on bridging loans by the applicants?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1978-12-07a.1598.3" hansard_membership_id="2159" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/30774" speakername="Mr. Carter" colnum="1598" time="">
<p>I am not aware of that, but if the hon. Gentleman has examples that he can forward to me I shall take the matter up. The Housing Executive is bearing a rather unfair share of the burden of providing loans to people who wish to buy their homes in Northern Ireland. Undoubtedly, its organisation is overstrained, but by and large I think that it copes.</p>

<p>Will my hon. Friend accept the congratulations of the House on the initiative which his Department has shown in bringing forward the home purchase scheme? Does not part of the problem of housing in Northern Ireland relate to the outdated and outmoded practices in the private rented sector, and can my hon. Friend indicate what is the prospective house building outturn for the coming year?</p>

<p>In both private and public sectors we shall not achieve quite what we wanted to achieve this year, for a variety of reasons. However, in the


private sector we have probably the most imaginative and wide-ranging programme to stimulate private sector acquisition of any region of the United Kingdom. Some hon. Members&#x2014;the hon. Member for Bexleyheath (Mr. Townsend) in particular&#x2014;ought to be made aware of that, and I shall write to the hon.

<p>There has been significant progress. The Government recently announced a &#x00A3;1 million community development project for a 10-acre site in the Shankill area of West Belfast. On the industrial front, the first two neighbourhood business units are expected to be operational early in the new year. These units are specially designed to accommodate small businesses in areas affected by redevelopment.<br/>
The Belfast city council, the Belfast education and library board, the Eastern health and social services board and the Northern Ireland Housing Executive are making good progress with special Belfast areas of need programmes, which include provision of sports, recreation, community health and social service facilities, an educational programme, and special cleanup efforts.<br/>
Progress continues to be made on the schedule of projects to be financed from the initial &#x00A3;2 million allocation of United Kingdom inner city funds. To date, about 16 projects have been completed, and the remaining schemes will be completed in 1979.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1978-12-07a.1599.3" hansard_membership_id="7426" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/22680" speakername="Mr. Woodall" colnum="1599" time="">
<p>I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that reply but, although I acknowledge that progress has been made, I should be glad to know whether the views of the ordinary man in the street have been sought in deciding the priorities. Further, have all the schemes come forward from public enterprise or has private enterprise come forward with any proposals?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1978-12-07a.1599.4" hansard_membership_id="2159" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/30774" speakername="Mr. Carter" colnum="1599" time="">
<p>On the last point, sadly, the vast majority&#x2014;if not all&#x2014;of the money which has been disbursed on these

projects has been public money. We should like to see private money coming in and playing a part in the whole enterprise of revitalising the inner part of Belfast.<br/>
On the first point, every conceivable effort is made to ensure that the local community and all the community groups which proliferate in Belfast are made aware of what we intend and what we should like to do. Similarly, we listen to everything which they would like us to do.. Therefore, from the point of view of the man in the street, I think that we make every effort as a Government to carry everyone with us.</p>

<p>I have no plans substantially to increase the powers of the existing district councils; nor do I think that it would be right to establish in Northern Ireland a system of local government similar to that in England and Wales or Scotland.

<p>Is not the real point that regional services should be restored to Northern Ireland people as soon as possible, and, since little progress is being made at present in the Secretary of State's talks, will he now consider ways of improving direct rule in the short term other than those which he has devised so far?

<p>I do not want to disappoint the hon. Gentleman again with regard to his suggestion on the Macrory intervention, but I think that it is premature.

<p>There has certainly been a quickening of interest in the Province among American companies. I pay tribute to the work of my right hon. Friend the Minister of State in his investment drive in Western Europe and in America. I have also been in America and Japan on the same campaign. This year, 29 American firms have visited Northern Ireland for the first time, compared with two over the whole of last year. Five new American companies have come into Northern Ireland for first time. They are investing &#x00A3;180 million in Northern Ireland and they will generate 3,500 jobs. That is the measure of the success that we are having for those companies which come, see for themselves, cross the threshold of disbelief, and then, on their own hard-headed business criteria, decide to invest in the Province.</p>

<p>Yes. I indicated to the House yesterday how we were countering that. Our ambassador in Washington has been aiding us in that campaign. I hope that the hon.

In addition, the Department has the right to request any other financial information which it may require.<br/>
The Northern Ireland Development Agency is also entitled to designate two of the company's directors for as long as it holds shares in the company, or while there is any outstanding loan or guarantee of indebtedness issued by the Department or the agency to the company or its subsidiaries or affiliates.

The outright grants to the firm comprise &#x00A3;28'5 million of total Government involvement. Investment of &#x00A3;17'5 million is in equity capital by the Northern Ireland Development Agency and it has been made on a normal commercial basis. A loan of &#x00A3;6'7 million has been made by the Department of Commerce and will be repaid with interest when the company is able to do so.

<p>Yes, Sir. Officials of various Government Departments, public agencies and voluntary organisations act speedily to provide emergency help when people in any part of Northern Ireland have to vacate their homes through bombings or other terrorist activities.

<p>My hon. Friend is right. We probably all underestimate the shock

<p>I met representatives of Blue Circle Ltd. on 28th November and expressed my concern at the recent acute shortage of cement in Northern Ireland and at the delay in implementing plans for new plant to cover longer term needs. As a result, the company is studying both problems urgently and is currently discussing its proposals for their solution with the interested parties. I am glad to be able to tell the House that production is now back to normal.<br/>
In addition, at my meeting I obtained the company's agreement to the creation of a joint working group within the Northern Ireland construction industry advisory council to monitor and progress plans for the adequate supply of cement in Northern Ireland. The construction industry and the trade unions, I am glad to say, have agreed to take part.</p>

It is unfortunate that there are too few Catholics in the force. I think that is recognised by all. It is also unfortunate

that not sufficient encouragement is given in certain quarters to see that more Catholics join the force. I think that we are in accord on that matter. We hope that more will be done in future in this respect.</p>

<p>Does my hon.

Therefore, is it not absolutely relevant and necessary for us to know whether the minority community has any confidence in and is joining that force? Can we not somehow get at the numbers?

<p>There was rather a division of opinion on this matter at the NEDC meeting yesterday. I think that it was generally agreed that none of us could forecast the impact on unemployment.

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Speaker.

In a supplementary reply he said

<q> It is remarkable that the Opposition's spokesman on foreign affairs&#x2026;should regard it as a disgrace when we defend our national interests."&#x2014;[Official Report, 6th December 1978; Vol. 969, c. 1427.]</q>
I have checked very carefully, Mr. Speaker. I never used those words. Not only that; I have never used words to which that interpretation could be given.

I certainly do not want to make a lot of this&#x2014;I withdraw anything if the right hon. Gentleman feels it improper to be said&#x2014;but I do hope that we shall not be too sensitive on these matters.

<p>I deplore the outbreak of unofficial industrial action at the West London and Charing Cross hospitals which is depriving patients of treatment. I understand that the action is a protest against the dismissal of three employees from the West London hospital. There are established procedures in the National Health Service which protect staff against unfair dismissal. These have not been used, although management has made clear its willingness to set up an appeals panel immediately.<br/>
The action of NUPE members at the West London hospital is having little effect on patient services there. Pickets from the AUEW and EEPTU at Charing Cross hospital are turning away deliveries and, as a result, shortage of essential supplies are limiting surgery to urgent cases.<br/>
I understand that local discussions are going on at present and I hope that these will be successful in resolving the dispute. I renew my appeal to the staff concerned to return to work immediately in order that services to patients may be resumed in both hospitals as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>Is the right hon. Gentleman aware that the House will warmly endorse his condemnation of this unofficial action? But will he go further? Will he say whether he unequivocally supports management in seeking to discipline staff who have acted illegally and dangerously in switching off the boilers at the West London hospital last month, to the immediate danger of patients?<br/>
Is the right hon. Gentleman aware that the two union officials involved, Mr. Hunt and Mr. Penfold, who have been willing to use the appeals procedure to which he has referred in respect of members of the union, have been totally unwilling to use it in respect of themselves?<br/>
Is the right hon. Gentleman further aware that the area officer of NUPE, Mr. Bernie Grant, has claimed to management that whatever his union officials may have done, whether it be illegal or otherwise, they are fully protected in law under the present Government's legislation? Does the right hon. Gentleman agree that, if that is in fact right, he and his colleagues bear a heavy responsibility for what is now happening?<br/>
How much longer have patients in the Health Service to go on putting up with strike-happy union branches using these patients as pawns in their struggles?</p>

<p>I am sorry that the right hon. Gentleman has used this as an occasion for delivering a lecture on his experience of industrial action. He will know that I strongly condemned the action when it was originally taken and the boilers were switched off. I made clear yesterday my attitude to the action that has been taken now, and I think that it is pretty clear that the public also know the attitude taken by the Secretary of State for Social Services.<br/>
I have also made it clear that the management has offered, straight away, to set in motion the appeals panel procedure and that it applies now. I think that to make further comment when negotiations are taking place at this time would not ease the matter. After all, this is a local dispute, and it is right that it should be resolved locally.<br/>
When the right hon. Gentleman says"How much longer?" I must make two points to him. First, of course a dispute such as this receives enormous publicity. It is right that it should receive it, because I think that it is deplorable. But, in general, the record of industrial action in the Health Service is not that which is conveyed by right hon. and hon. Members of the Opposition. Secondly, in terms of what action I should take, the right hon. Gentleman well knows that, as a result of discussions that I had with the leaders of the unions and the leaders of the professions, there is now being considered by the general Whitley Council a new disputes procedure to operate at a local level, which I believe when carried out will remove this sort of disturbance.</p>

<p>I very much agree with the point made by my right hon. Friend. I hope that the House will respect this, because I hope that the talks that are taking place now will lead to an end of the dispute.<br/>
In relation to the situation at Charing Cross, pickets at the hospital, from two engineering unions, as I have said&#x2014;the AUEW and the EEPTU&#x2014;are preventing supplies being sent in. Urgent surgery is still taking place, but non-urgent admissions have been stopped. As supplies run short, it will be progressively more difficult to maintain services, and it is not certain that all surgical lists can be maintained tomorrow, even for urgent cases. That emphasises the importance of reaching a solution today.</p>

the Second Reading of the Consolidated Fund Bill, but if we allow the Estimates to go through by default now or vote for them, there will be little point in raising any quesions next week, because the Estimates will already have been passed by the House.<br/>
It has been suggested that on other occasions we can vote on documents that include these Estimates, but I do not think that that is so in relation to the Supplementary Estimates. I shall not go into detail on those Estimates, but it is clear that considerable increases are demanded across a whole range of services.<br/>
The hon. Members who signed the motion to reduce the defence Supplementary Estimate did so because they are opposed to the Government's demand that we should spend another &#x00A3;250 million on defence. They are not opposed to spending the money that is required to meet increases in the pay of members of the armed services. That is why the motion includes the figure of about &#x00A3;143 million.<br/>
It is well known that the proportion of Britain's GNP that is spent on defence is more than that of any other European NATO country. We believe that it should be brought down at least to the average of those countries.</p>

<p>Yes, Mr. Speaker. I know that some of my hon. Friends want to say something about this matter. May I appeal to you to allow us to vote on the separate Estimates? There will be five motions before the House, and many of us wish to express our disapproval in the Lobby about the final motion on the defence Supplementary Estimates.

The winter defence Supplementary Estimates of &#x00A3;248,547,000 before the House are almost entirely pay allowances, pensions and price increases. Moreover, all the Votes will come before the House again and any of them could be the subject of the remaining 26 Supply Days.<br/>
Although I appreciate the case that my hon. Friends have put and accept that they may wish to press it further&#x2014;knowing that they raised the matter a year ago &#x2014;I hope that they will also be able to take this matter into account. It is the fact

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. That statement, though technically correct, might be misinterpreted by those who, unlike you, Mr. Speaker, do not understand the procedures of the House. I wonder whether you would confirm that these resolutions, if passed today, have no validity in law.

<p>I repudiate what my right hon. Friend the Leader of the House has just said. Twelve months ago, I asked:
<q> On a point of order. Am I right in believing that if this is voted on today, any subsequent debate would be completely worthless and ineffective?</q>
You replied, Mr. Speaker:
<q> If this motion is carried, I shall put the Question without discussion on each of the Estimates. That is what it means."&#x2014;[<i>Official Report</i>, 12th December 1977; Vol. 941, c. 46.]</q>
This means, Mr. Speaker, that without debate we shall pass a large sum of money today and there will be no opportunity to debate whether that is good.<br/>
I intend, Mr. Speaker, to abide strictly by your limits. I am not questioning the merits of this vast expenditure on arms, which, I am sure I do not need to tell you, hardly warms the cockles of my heart or those of my hon. Friends. I shall stick strictly to the point. I wish to oppose the acceptance by the House of this motion from the Prime Minister because it means that, without any debate, the spending of an additional sum of &#x00A3;248 million on defence will take place.<br/>
I must reply to one point that the Leader of the House has just made. This question arose 12 months ago. A deputation


of hon. Members went to see the Lord President. There are hon. Members here today who will say that on that occasion my right hon. Friend promised that it would not happen again and that there would be an opportunity for debate. I ask him whether he will reply to that point.<br/>
One of the origins of parliamentary democracy, on which I am not attempting to lecture you, Mr. Speaker, is that before expenditure takes place there should be a debate, a vote and a decision. Indeed, you, Mr. Speaker, have the responsibility to see that that right is fully observed. You also have a second responsibility, Mr. Speaker&#x2014;that is, to preserve the rights of Back Benchers. On this occasion, because the two Front Benches are united in spending more on arms, they have decided that there will be no debate on this matter. Labour Back Benchers &#x2014;I do not notice that Tory Members are vociferous on this point&#x2014;are denied the rights that you, Mr. Speaker, are here to defend.<br/>
I hate to address my remarks to you, Mr. Speaker, as I do not blame you. I blame the two Front Benches for the predicament in which we are being placed. Usually, Mr. Speaker, there is a full debate in this House before a large sum of money&#x2014;</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman is right in some respects. Today is an example. Usually, if there is an item involving several millions of pounds, a whole day's debate may take place on it. Today we are debating an item of several hundred millions of pounds without a debate at all. It can hardly be argued that shortage of parliamentary time has prevented a debate. We have just heard the dates of the Christmas Recess. We have had a Summer Recess the like of which I have never experienced before in my 23 years in the House. One might say, without being disrespectful to the House, that it is becoming almost a temporary holiday home<br/>
What we are doing today would certainly not be acceptable in the United States legislature. This is part of the 3 per cent. per annum increase in arms spending decided by the House last March

&#x2014;a costly and foolish decision because it will encourage similar increases by the Russians. In the United States, Congressmen are challenging the 3 per cent. Parliamentary procedure is not prohibiting American Congressmen debating this subject. If this is taking place in the American Congress, why should not we have an opportunity to discuss this matter? Irrespective of whether Congress decides to drop the 3 per cent., why should we not be allowed to discuss the issue?<br/>
Our arms bill is raised from a little over the monstrous sum of &#x00A3;7 billion a year by another &#x00A3;248 million and no one is allowed to say a word. There is no explanation at all of some of the items we are being asked to pass. I refer to one of them. We are told that an additional &#x00A3;49 million is being sought to compensate for delays in production receipts for air systems. Perhaps some hon. Member could explain what that means. I do not understand it, and quite a lot of people outside the House will not understand it. There is no word of explanation.<br/>
To whom are we selling? To which country? What kind of weapons or stores are we selling? Nobody knows. Yet this sum is to go through the House without discussion, just as the decision to make the first atom bomb went through the Cabinet without discussion. This is government without explanation, government by concealment. It is happening continually, and it is eroding our democracy. There have been no fewer than 16 Supplementary Estimates for defence in the past five years. I think that you will have some doubts about this process, Mr. Speaker.<br/>
I ask you, Mr. Speaker, to answer this question. If this procedural vote is taken this afternoon, can there be any subsequent debate before the expenditure is sanctioned? If there cannot be such a debate, we are making a mockery of democracy.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1978-12-07a.1642.0" hansard_membership_id="4042" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/14603" speakername="Mr. English" colnum="1642" time="">
<p>This is a matter of some importance, as I hope Tory Members, on another occasion, will be the first to realise. The situation is that no expenditure may lawfully be incurred by Her Majesty's Government without the approval of Parliament as a whole. That is done by an Appropriation Act.<br/>
Pending the Appropriation Act, published and agreed once a year, there are Consolidated Fund Acts such as the one due to be dealt with on Tuesday next. By tradition, the Committee stage of a Consolidated Fund Bill is never debated upon any amendment. I believe that there may be a technical amendment, involving the word"may ", to the extent of saying the Government"may"or may not spend some money. The details cannot be amended.<br/>
The reason for this, Mr. Speaker, is that your predecessors in the Chair have said upon successive occasions that it would be pointless for the House to discuss something twice. We may not move an amendment to any item of public expenditure on the Consolidated Fund Bill on Tuesday night, first, because we are taking the Second Reading and, secondly, because immediately afterwards, on that night or on the Wednesday, the Committee stage will be taken formally, when no amendment will be possible.<br/>
The reason for this is that, theoretically, we have discussed all the issues upon Supply resolutions. Those Supply resolutions, like any other resolutions of the House, have no force in law of themselves. They do have force, however, because of the Public Accounts and Charges Act 1891 which, in effect, makes them temporary Consolidated Fund Acts. It gives them a temporary legal force and makes them temporary appropriations under section 2(1) of the Act from the time a Consolidated Fund Act is passed. In other words, that thing which we are not allowed to discuss in detail on Tuesday night will validate what we are allowed to vote on today.<br/>
This is an extraordinary procedure which has grown up over a period. The theory is that the expenditure of a Government must not be discussed anywhere save upon the Floor of the House. This is what is at fault. We are supposed to discuss these things upon a group of Supply Days. Wisely and properly, in a democracy, we have said that the subject for debate on those Supply Days is entirely a matter for the Opposition Front Bench. The right hon. Lady and her colleagues decide what we are to discuss today. They wish to discuss the Ford sanctions and connected matters, something entirely proper to be discussed in that this is obviously an issue of public

importance. However, for every day that one of these subjects of public importance is discussed, some portion of the expenditure of the Government is not discussed. Today we are to discuss sanctions against Ford. That is well and good. The moment we do so we lose for ever the possibility of discussing public expenditure totalling tens of thousands of millions of pounds. That cannot be a right and proper procedure.<br/>
This is why my colleagues&#x2014;and by that I mean every hon. Member of this House belonging to every party who has signed the motion relating to the report on Me Civil Service that I mentioned in business questions today&#x2014;wishes to have debates upon the report on the Civil Service by the Expenditure Committee and upon the Procedure Committee's report. It cannot be right that the whole of public expenditure is ignored because it cannot be discussed anywhere once we decide to discuss another subject on a Supply Day. The delay on the part of my right hon. Friend in bringing forward these matters for discussion is simply causing him more trouble than he need have got into.<br/>
Today is a good example. We are faced with sums of money totalling tens of thousands of millions of pounds. We have only to look at the Order Paper to see such sums. There is the sum of &#x00A3;17,470,584,900 on the first motion alone. On the third motion, the figure is &#x00A3;1,860,115,000 and on the fourth motion it is &#x00A3;3,155,066,000. Such sums are not to be discussed. All that we are to be allowed to do, as you have correctly ruled, Mr. Speaker, is to say that we should discuss them. If this motion is passed, as it probably will be, because the Opposition Front Bench wants to see it passed as much as the Government Front Bench, there will be no opportunity of voting on any amendment to this expenditure.<br/>
I direct your attention, Mr. Speaker, to the slightly different practice of some of the Commonwealth countries and the United States Congress, which have taken our original procedures and used them. In other countries there are things known as appropriations committees, which are allowed to discuss public expenditure and to say No, you should not spend so much on a particular subject. You should. perhaps, spend more on some other subject." I imagine that many of my hon.<br/>
Friends who have raised this matter would say that we should spend less on defence and more on social security. Many hon. Members opposite would no doubt wish to say that we should spend more on defence and, perhaps, less on social security. The interesting point is that none of them will be allowed to say what he believes.<br/>
On whichever side of the House hon. Members may sit, whatever the electorate decides about who should govern and who should be in opposition, the same individuals will not be allowed to discuss these matters unless they are in the Government and unless they are, above all, Treasury Ministers. That is why the Expenditure Committee recommended in its fourteenth report&#x2014;the last report of last Session&#x2014;that the financial procedures of this House needed alteration. That is why, more than 15 months ago, in its report on the Civil Service, the Expenditure Committee recommended a much-needed change in our financial procedure. That is why the Procedure Committee made similar recommendations. That is why when, on Monday evening, we were discussing the reports of the Public Accounts Committee, everyone who spoke said that these procedures needed revision. That is why the right hon. Member for Cambridgeshire (Mr. Pym) said that these reports should be debated. They have not been debated and it has not been announced that they are to be debated. We now have a situation in which we have to say that the expenditure of these tens of thousands of million of pounds is not to be discussed.</p>

<p>I wish to speak against the motion relating to the Supplementary Estimates. Like my hon. Friend the Member for Salford, East (Mr. Allaun), I have considerable misgivings about the proposals concerning military items in these Estimates. I also feel strongly about the principle, which has been raised by my hon. Friends, of approving the expenditure of large sums of money without debate. My hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, West (Mr. English) pointed out that there was a means whereby we could negate the motion that we may approve today if we seek to vote against the Consolidated Fund Bill.<br/>
Many of us would not wish for one moment to vote against this fund, because it includes many items of which

we are in wholehearted support. In those circumstances, that is no substitute for hon. Members having the opportunity of a proper debate on these items here today before they are put to the House. Therefore, I wish to speak against the Prime Minister's motion that is before the House.<br/>
The original Estimates that were before the House were fully debated before any decision was reached upon them. No one in this House, no one who believes in democratic principles, would argue that expenditure should be incurred by the Government, within the original Estimates, after being approved without a debate, but here today we are taking a decision which means that this expenditure will be added to very considerably without any discussion being allowed on those items which we are being asked to approve.<br/>
I argue that the Supplementary Estimates now before the House alter, in a number of respects, the character of our original decision on the Estimates earlier this year. This raises a principle that we as a House have a right to debate. In the first place, all of us are aware of the arguments that have been advanced in recent years, from both sides of the House, for the containment of public expenditure. On a number of occasions over the course of recent years the House has approved cuts in public expenditure to which a number of my hon. Friends and I have been wholeheartedly and completely opposed.<br/>
If we approved of those cuts I am quite sure that we did so only after a certain amount of soul searching, and had we been aware originally that additional moneys were to be made available, we would certainly not have agreed that those cuts or limitations should have been imposed. We would have opposed the addition of the supplementary sums that are being proposed here today.<br/>
For that reason it is quite wrong that those sums should be approved without a full debate, as is proposed in the motion of the Prime Minister today. The present Supplementary Estimates deeply affect the attitude of all of us to the whole package of public expenditure that the House is being asked to accept for the whole year. The House did not approve the carrying out of certain policies or the expenditure of money on


certain items without regard to the expense. The House approved certain expenditure, bearing in mind the need for economies and the priorities that the House then had in view. The fact that certain additional sums of money are now to be made available demands that we in this House should have an opportunity, in debate, of arguing where those additional sums should be expended.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Rutland and Stamford (Mr. Lewis) raised a point that in many ways impugns the views of many of those who signed the amendment, which is not being debated.

<p>I apologise, Mr. Speaker, for responding in that way. I hope that you will forgive me, Sir, for having been distracted from my argument by the intervention of the hon. Member for Rutland and Stamford. He showed how important it is that the House should have an opportunity to discuss these matters. For reasons that I fully understand, many hon. Members are denied the opportunity of advancing their arguments on these different items, which would be debated if this motion before the House were defeated&#x2014;because I take it that if this motion were defeated it would be incumbent upon the Leader of the House to find means whereby we would have the opportunity to debate these matters.<br/>
For this reason I believe that hon. and right hon. Members on the Conservative

Benches, who so often argue about the need to contain public expenditure, should vote with us when we oppose this motion, because it would give the whole House the opportunity to debate these items in detail. I make no bones of the fact that I am wholeheartedly in favour of much of the expenditure that is proposed, but in the form in which this motion is placed before the House it does not give us the opportunity of differentiating between expenditures that we think are desirable and those that we would wish to reject. Part of the funds relates to defence expenditure. some hon. Members are in favour of more expenditure while others, like myself, are in favour of much more drastic cuts than anything we have seen.<br/>
I have already made clear to the hon. Member for Rutland and Stamford that I strongly sympathise with the pay needs of the armed forces and I certainly would not wish to cut that item back. On the other hand, we oppose other items that are involved here. Therefore, it is necessary that they should be taken separately, with the opportunity for a debate on particular items about which we feel extremely strongly.<br/>
In the document"Supplementary Estimates 1978/79"it is stated on page 3 that we are being asked to provide some of these funds for new services. If we are being asked to obtain additional money to meet the cost of any new services, it means that the very principle involved in the provision of these new services affects the House very pertinently. Why should the House be asked to accept this without debating the principles that are involved? Why should we have to walk through the Lobbies&#x2014;or perhaps not even take it to a Division&#x2014;to approve new services the objectives of which are not implicit?</p>

<p>I should certainly be happy if my right hon. Friend the Leader of the House were here to hear what 1 am saying on this important issue. I realise that he may have other pressing engagements, but it is important for the House to consider the approval of expenditure of this character and dimension without the opportunity of discussing the issues.<br/>
The Supply Estimates provide that new services can be developed with the funds that we are being asked to approve today.<br/>
Those new services might involve principles about which many of us would feel extreme concern. For example, many of us are wholeheartedly opposed to the development of a new generation of nuclear weapons. This expenditure could possibly relate to such development. In the past, the House decided on the question of nuclear weapons without even members of the Cabinet being aware of the implications of the decision. We have the right to ask what this money will be spent upon.<br/>
Many of us have the impression that it is being spent on nuclear weapons, but we shall be precluded from debating that if we pass the motion.<br/>
The House has the right to question Ministers, but no Defence Minister is present&#x2014;</p>

<p>I apologise. I am glad to see my right hon. Friend present. I missed him because he was snuggled down on the Front Bench.<br/>
Other services can be provided for out of these funds, and this may include the question of the SAS. In pressing for an adequate debate I remind hon. Members that the House often spends long periods discussing trivial matters, but the voting through of huge sums such as this is done on the nod.<br/>
If we pass the motion the amendment that stands in the names of many of my hon. Friends and myself will not be put to the House. It is totally undemocratic to deprive hon. Members of a proper vote and discussion.<br/>
Another aspect arises out of the defence Supplementary Estimates. Many of us feel that a quantitative addition to the sum total expended will involve an important question of principle. The Government are committed to reducing the percentage of gross national product spent on defence to that of the average of our NATO allies. Approval of this expenditure today may well change the direction of that policy so that we are spending more, not less. If the Government have decided to change their policy in that respect, that is a question of principle that the House should have the chance to debate. This should not be achieved by stealth.<br/>
This issue involves a global sum of public expenditure&#x2014;a further matter of great importance. Many hon. Members believe that increases in public expenditure are a cause of inflation and that the House should turn its attention to the subject of public expenditure. The Opposition have frequently asked for much greater cuts than the Government have made. Therefore, we need to examine the effects of these Supplementary Estimates on the global sum and to consider their inflationary effect. It is only right that we should have an opportunity to discuss these matters before decisions are taken. It is not enough merely to take these matters on a vote.</p>

<p>Does not my hon. Friend accept that expenditure of this nature is important in terms of the Government's economic policy? Defence expenditure tends to be more inflationary than much other expenditure because there is no production of goods and services to meet the demand created by the vast majority of people, who are not in the armed services.</p>

<p>I agree with my hon. Friend. That is a further reason why the House should not let this expenditure go through on the nod.<br/>
We are being asked to approve expenditure that will add to inflationary pressure. Those Members of the Opposition who constantly call for cuts in public expenditure will be blaming Labour Members for calling for greater amounts of civil public expenditure and will accuse us of being responsible for inflation. Therefore, we have a right to advance our views on this subject and, unless this matter is debated fully, we shall be prevented from so doing.<br/>

<p>I agree that the mattcr that is now before the House is serious. If Parliament means anything and is not to be taken as a rubber-stamping farce, we should be able to debate these matters.<br/>
I take great exception to the remarks of the hon. Member for Gillingham (Mr. Burden). I am sure that he and his hon. Friends in a General Election campaign will attack Labour Members of Parliament for arguing in favour of greater public expenditure in certain respects. The hon.

<p>The hon. Gentleman is being carried away by his own vehemence. Obviously he did not hear what my hon. Friend the Member for Gillingham (Mr. Burden) said.

<p>My hon. Friends and I have argued on many occasions that the House should debate issues about which we feel deeply. However, on many occasions the procedure has been such&#x2014;this has been acceded to by both Front Benches&#x2014;that these matters have been precluded from debate. Therefore, my hon. Friends and I have no alternative but to take our present course because this is the only means of bringing these matters to the notice of the House. It is scandalous that we should be prevented from debating these issues because certain hon. Members want to get on with the usual rigmarole.</p>

<p>Is there not an ominous parallel with the situation that arises out of much of the business relating to the EEC? The House is asked to deal with matters retrospectively, or is not given adequate time to discuss the EEC budget, or we find that the budget is presented in a misleading and compressed form. A similar arbitrary way of dealing with expenditure is now spilling over into the procedures of this House. Should we not resist this process so far as we can?</p>

<p>I agree with my hon. Friend. The House knows that I do not normally participate in trifling arguments. This is a matter of great principle, and I am sure that some Opposition Members sympathise with me. On this motion we are being asked to do something that is wrong and are being prevented from carrying out our job as Back Benchers.<br/>
The Opposition have argued on many occasions for cuts in public expenditure relating to health, education and the welfare services. If on this motion we agree additional military expenditure, the Opposition may argue that the global sum needs to be contained. Therefore, the pressure for more cuts in civil expenditure&#x2014;expenditure that many Labour Members favour&#x2014;may increase.<br/>
Later today the House will discuss the subject of inflation in general. Decisions could be taken in other spheres which

would lead my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer to introduce an additional Budget. If that happens, expenditure on health, welfare and education may be cut so that we may contain expenditure of a military nature of the type we are being asked to approve today.<br/>
In my view, these Supplementary Estimates could themselves contribute considerably to inflation, and I therefore argue that the House has a right to debate these matters on another occasion. I hope that something will be done to make this possible. The idea that the House should pass a huge sum on the nod, without proper debate, must be considered&#x2014;</p>

<p>I was saying that the idea that the House should pass huge sums of money on the nod without proper debate must be considered against the background of the way in which we normally work in the House, devoting enormous time and consideration to quite trivial issues.<br/>
Mr. hon. Friends and I strongly object to the procedure proposed, and I have spoken on this occasion because I believe that the House should take this matter very seriously indeed. Last year, as my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, North-West (Mr. Thomas) pointed out, we raised this matter and we were given some sort of promise that an opportunity would be provided for us to discuss these issues. That opportunity has not been provided, and once again we are being asked to pass a motion in precisely the terms of that which was passed last year. When I went to the Vote Office last night, I checked it. The motion is word for word the same as the one passed last year.<br/>
In these circumstances we have a right to ask, as Back Benchers, what exactly


are our powers here. Are we just rubber stamps who walk through the Lobbies to approve the expenditure of huge sums of money without debate? My hon. Friends and I wish to protest at this state of affairs. We think it quite outrageous that we should be asked to do that. It is totally wrong that we should be called upon to approve as part of a package military expenditures to which we are absolutely opposed.<br/>
In these circumstances, we feel that we have only one option open to us, which is to oppose the Prime Minister's motion presently before us. Therefore, I make no apology for having opposed it at length. I hope that right hon. and hon. Members on both sides will recognise that we have not come here today to discuss this issue lightly. We must pay heed to the opinions of the British people. They hear the heehawing and the noise at Question Time, and if they realised at the same time that we permit this sort of thing to be done, they will think it a disgrace and ask why on earth hon. Members on both sides of the House do not stand up and say something about it.<br/>
On this occasion, I thought it timely that I should make a clear statement on the issue. Although there is a certain amount of merriment in the House over this matter, I assure the House that that does not mean that my hon. Friends and I regard this as a matter that can be taken lightly. I hope that my right hon. Friend and right hon. and hon. Members next year will see to it that hon. Members who represent a sizeable section of opinion in this country have the opportunity to be heard, which is their right. That is what we are demanding today, and that is why we shall vote against the Prime Minister's motion, believing that that is the only way of making our protest clear.</p>

<p>I, too, should like to make a contribution on the subject of the Supplementary Estimates and the need for the House to be given an opportunity to debate them. It may surprise the House to know that I tabled a number of Questions asking how many Ford motor cars that were to be purchased by the Government would subsequently not be purchased as a result of sanctions. To my astonishment, these Questions were transferred to the Ministry of Defence, and I have now got the answers in today's <i>Hansard</i>. I asked how many&#x2014;</p>

<p>Order. I have no doubt that the hon. Gentleman asked the right Questions&#x2014;I say nothing about the answers&#x2014;but we are debating the business motion, which has been discussed at length by the hon. Member for Harlow (Mr. Newens).</p>

<p>I suggest that it is relevant, Mr. Speaker, because the Ministry of Defence is apparently to incur expenditure on purchasing more expensive motor cars than might have been available if it had purchased Ford motor cars. Presumably, the &#x00A3;248,547,000 is in the Supplementary Estimate for the purchase of Japanese cars at greater expense for Ministry of Defence mandarins and Service Ministers.<br/>
It is clear that there is no intention of buying military vehicles with this money. It is all for motor cars, as I understand it, and this seems to be a point which the House should debate today. I had thought that the House would debate it today. I thought that that was the substance of the debate, but, since I am not able to make my speech on the later motion, I should like to make my speech on the desirability of not pursuing policies represented by this Supplementary Estimate for the Ministry of Defence.</p>

<p>Order. The hon. Gentleman has been very helpful to me. I realise now the direction in which he is going.

<p>I should like to discuss the Estimates. That is why I rose. I should like the Government to provide an appropriate opportunity for me to discuss them, but you have made it abundantly clear, Mr. Speaker, and I entirely accept your ruling, that we may not discuss the substance of the Estimates on this occasion. It therefore seems to me to be futile to try to prevail in this debate in making the point that we should be able to discuss the Estimates on a later occasion, whereas that is the only point, as you so rightly put it, that we may make in this debate.<br/>
My worry about this Estimate relates to exactly how much of this money is going to buy expensive motor cars, as a stupid and arrogant retaliatory action against Ford, but I cannot make the point on this occasion. It would be quite out of order, and I should entirely accept your view, Mr. Speaker, if you were to rule me out of order.<br/>
My suggestion is that we pass the motion now and deal with the Estimates and then proceed to discuss the matter of substance which is the one issue that I want to raise on the defence Supplementary Estimate, but that I am precluded from discussing now by the rules of order.</p>

<p>I shall be brief and confine myself strictly to the Prime Minister's motion. One morning, two or three days ago, I was listening to the radio waiting for the cricket score from Australia when I heard the right hon. Member for Taunton (Mr. du Cann) being interviewed. We all know that the right hon. Member takes seriously his responsibilities as Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee. He devotes to the functions of that office a great deal of skill and expertise.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman argued strongly&#x2014;I agreed with every word that he said&#x2014;that the extent to which the House controls the expenditure of Government, or Supply, has become less and less with every year that passes.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman's solution to this problem was, in one way ot another, to do some of the scrutiny in Committee. That was the solution that 1 understood my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, West (Mr. English) to advocate a little while ago. One right hon. Member of the House who would not go along with that idea, as we all

know, is the Leader of the House. He has always been opposed to any increase in or extension of the Select Committee system. He has always argued, with his own particular cogency, that we should do our important business on the Floor of the House. If we are properly to scrutinise expenditure, according to my right hon. Friend, the House should be able to look in detail at Estimates.</p>

<p>If we had had a debate, which I know we cannot have, my speech would have been purely interrogatory. I had a number of questions to ask. I should be surprised if many other hon.

<p>One cannot say whether one agrees with an Estimate when one does not understand what the item means. The Estimates are drawn up by accountants. Accountants are adept at using records to disguise rather than to clarify what is taking place. These Estimates in particular are riddled with jargon. If we are to scrutinise expenditure we must understand it.<br/>
I should have liked to ask"What does this mean?" of four items. I should have liked to ask"To whom does the money go, and for what? ".<br/>
I remember in the 1951 Parliament an all-night debate on the Army Estimates. There were a number of items about which I asked the then Under-Secretary of State for War"What are they and what do they mean? ". I can remember only one of those items. It involved the salary of paper-keepers. I asked the Minister"What are paper-keepers?"There was a great deal of flurrying and to-ing and fro-ing between the Benches and the space behind Mr. Speaker's right hand. The Minister had to blabber on for three-quarters of an hours before he got the answer and told us what paper-keepers were. [HON. MEMBERS:"What are they? "]</p>

<p>With respect, Mr. Speaker, it is relevant. I told the story because it is an example of an item in the accounts which Members do not understand and cannot therefore scrutinise. [HON. MEMBERS:"What are paper-keepers."' I deliberately refrain from answering that question because by doing so I would breach your guidance, Mr. Speaker. I shall tell hon. Members afterwards.<br/>
Three items in the five Estimates are Greek to me. They are written in jargon. I do not know whether it is right to spend the money that is involved, because I do not know what they mean. I am not allowed to ask what they mean. That means that hon. Members who are charged with the responsibility for scrutinising expenditure have to agree to public money being spent on something when they do not know A from a bull's foot. If that is proper parliamentary control of expenditure and proper parliamentary democracy, we shall have to do some fresh thinking.</p>

<p>The motion is really about the House approving the expenditure of &#x00A3;25,000 million without debate. That is what it comes to. One understands why that produces a certain sense of shock. Unfortunately, if we had not had this short discussion today, or if the motion were not on the Order Paper, the matter would be subject to a guillotine and be approved in the Consolidated Fund Bill next week.</p>

<p>which we have become all too accustomed. It is a procedure to which my right hon. Friend the Member for Taunton (Mr. du Cann) has been drawing attention for a long time. I certainly do not wish to take up the time of the House when an important debate is pending.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1978-12-07a.1660.1" colnum="1660" time="">
<p>I say to the Leader of the House and to the Financial Secretary to the Treasury that it is provoking the House to put down these Votes as a nominal justification for the debate that follows. We are used to nominal Votes leading to a debate on a matter of general interest, but when a motion involving &#x00A3;25.000 million is to be passed on the nod, the issue is brought to the surface.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1978-12-07a.1660.2" colnum="1660" time="">
<p>By a growing convention we have abandoned financial control over Government activities. The lesson that we might learn from today's debate is that we must set up a Committee procedure to deal with these Estimates. At present the whole system is a farce. We are asked to approve this enormous expenditure on the nod in order that we may properly have a debate in the House on another important subject.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1978-12-07a.1660.3" colnum="1660" time="">
<p>I hope that we shall get on to that subject now or soon. This matter should have focused our minds on the fact that we are engaged in an outrageous farce about the control of public expenditure. We must do something to give reality to our scrutiny of expenditure.</p>

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. During our debate on the Estimates I specifically asked you about a Government reply to our discussion. You were kind enough to say that should the Minister wish to catch your eye you would give him the chance so to do. I am sure you will agree that many important points were raised in that debate, but unfortunately the Opposition Chief Whip blundered into the House and broke up our democratic discussion.<br/>
I seek clarification. The general convention of the House, which you, Mr. Speaker, enforce with rigorous fairness, is that before a closure motion is accepted two hours of debate must elapse. In those circumstances, with no Government reply to our debate, it was disturbing for us to discover that less than one and a quarter hours had been allowed for the debate.<br/>
Is it possible for you to allow the Minister to reply now, since you indicated that you would give him an opportunity to do so, and I understand that he was most willing to reply? If it is not possible for him to reply, that demonstrates the urgency and importance of the point we made earlier that these Estimates should not be adopted without proper scrutiny.<br/>
I shall be pleased if you will give the Minister an opportunity to address the House, because he no doubt has a great deal of valuable information to divulge.</p>

<p>Order. I intend to take serious, not frivolous, points of order. Today is a Supply Day. By long tradition, those who table a motion for debate are entitled to their debate.<br/>
There is no stipulation as to the time that should be allowed before Mr. Speaker accepts a closure motion. I had already twice declined to accept such a motion before eventually accepting it.</p>

<p>There can be nothing further to raise on that point of order. I have answered it. I had given the matter consideration, and it was completely within my discretion whether to accept the closure.</p>

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. It is confusing to the public at large if, on a Supply Day, when the business is determined by the Opposition, the motion that precedes it is in the name of the Prime Minister. We here understand why that should be so&#x2014;</p>

<p>Will you in future, as a matter of order, Mr. Speaker, rule that on Supply Days, which are the responsibility of the Opposition, all motions tabled should be in the name of the Opposition?</p>

<p>Order. That has been dealt with, and I gave my reply. It was within my complete discretion to decide when to accept the closure.</p>

<p>On a fresh point of order, Mr. Speaker. It arises from your comments about the right of the Opposition to debate Supply motions. I recall that when Labour Members were anxious to debate the Employment Protection Bill on a Friday and to ensure that it became law, they were prevented from doing so because closure motions, designed to speed up the progress of the Bill, were not accepted by the Chair because insufficient time had elapsed in debate in accordance with the established practice. We have


broken with that practice today, and I regret&#x2014;</p>

<p>On a fresh point of order, Mr. Speaker. You referred earlier to the long traditions of the House. It is those traditions that the public outside do not understand. They are some aspects that some of us have been sent here to change. How can I, as I am unable, I understand, to raise a debate under Standing Order No. 9 on proceedings that have taken place here today, explain to the public why things happened today as they have done? How do we explain why &#x00A3;23 billion of public expenditure went through on the nod&#x2014;</p>

<p>Order. The hon. Member is renewing the earlier argument. How he explains all that to the public is a matter for him, but no doubt if he is as eloquent outside as he is in the House, he will do it well.</p>
</speech>

<p>Order. I misunderstood the hon. Gentleman. He is not allowed to challenge my ruling except by Notice of Motion on the Order Paper. He is entitled to pursue that course if he wishes to say that I accepted the closure too soon.</p>

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. Does not the business that we have been discussing today come under the heading of Supply, and is it not therefore legitimate business for the House to discuss? We have been discussing the motion tabled by my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister, which should take precedence over any other business. If that is so, and as we have put forward a number of arguments on the motion, are we not entitled at some point to a ministerial reply? We understand that it is not possible now for us to have a reply from a Minister, and I personally feel that that is unfortunate. We realise that we must accept your ruling&#x2014;</p>

<p>Further to that point of order, Mr. Speaker. If the Minister does not get an opportunity to reply, might not the conclusion be drawn that he is reluctant to speak? Would not that be unfortunate for us all?</p>

<p>May I raise a fresh point of order, Mr. Speaker? I am sorry to detain you and the House, but I have been endeavouring to raise this point of order since the business motion was put. Unfortunately, at that time there was considerable competition for your eye. On Tuesday, at column 1,225, the hon. Member for Rutland and Stamford (Mr. Lewis) raised a point of order about the picketing of this House by the National Union of Journalists. At that time on Tuesday&#x2014;</p>

<p>Order. We must abide by some rules in this House. As I was saying, the hon. Gentleman knows that it was open to him this afternoon at the end of Question Time, when somebody else raised a point of order, to deal with the matter. I do not want to deal with the subject of picketing now, because it has nothing to do with this issue.</p>

<p>Further to that point of order, Mr. Speaker. I was on my feet, together with the hon. Member for Bristol, North-West (Mr. Thomas), seeking to raise a point of order at the time you called him. We then entered upon the debate on the motion and subsequently took the votes on the Estimates. I sought to raise my point of order at that time, but did not catch your eye.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Chelmsford (Mr. St. John-Stevas) is so recent a Shadow that I have not necessarily noticed his presence. This is a serious point. Nobody wishes to deprive the Opposition of their due democratic right to discuss matters on a Supply Day.

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. As you have rightly said, the Opposition have their rights on a Supply Day, which might have been frustrated by the Government having lost control of a large section of their own party. In these circumstances, may I ask the Leader of the House to tell the House what he intends to do to give us time next week to debate this subject, which is vital to hundreds of thousands of workers, and because of the issues of freedom involved, which are of importance for every citizen in this country?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1978-12-07a.1693.2" hansard_membership_id="4533" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/14996" speakername="The Lord President of the Council and Leader of the House of Commons (Mr. Michael Foot)" colnum="1693" time="">
<p>The question that the hon. Gentleman has put to me is, of course, important and I should like time to consider it. I have had only a moment for consideration, and I must tell him that I do not accept the prelude to his remarks, because my hon. Friends who raised the matter earlier&#x2014;it was on the Order Paper &#x2014;dealt with it as they were entitled.<br/>
Moreover, it was not a debate in which only my hon. Friends participated. Several hon. Members from the Opposition Benches also took part. Therefore, the matter being on the Order Paper as it was, I cannot accept that my hon. Friends were not entitled to do what the rules of the House permit them to do. Whether I would desire them to do it is another question altogether, but hon. Members on the Opposition Benches must learn that Members in all parts of the House have their rights according to the normal orders of the House of Commons. If any of my hon. Friends had been out of order, I am sure that you would have called them to order, Mr. Speaker, but that was not the case.<br/>
I say in response to the hon. Gentleman that I shall certainly consider what he has said, but I suggest that the House should now proceed with the matter on the Order Paper. I fully accept that it would be impossible to reach a proper conclusion by 10 o'clock, and therefore I suggest that we initiate the debate now. I agree that we cannot reach a conclusion, but we can have

further discussions on how we might proceed later.<br/>
I believe that it would be quite wrong to respond to the hon. Gentleman's request by saying that I accept it immediately. I am entitled to consider it. In the meantime I suggest that the House should proceed with the matter on the Order Paper. I fully accept that we cannot reach a conclusion on the matter, but I should like time to consider the proposition that the hon. Gentleman put to me a minute or two ago. That was the first I had heard of it, and I think it perfectly reasonable that I should have time for consideration.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1978-12-07a.1694.0" hansard_membership_id="6655" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/20939" speakername="Mr. St. John-Stevas" colnum="1694" time="">
<p>Further to the point of order, Mr. Speaker. All of us in this place are anxious that the House should not be brought into disrepute. The Lord President has suggested that the debate be initiated this evening. If the House is in fact allowed to do so, the Opposition would be happy to follow that course provided that we have an opportunity this evening not only to debate the matter but to vote in the Division Lobbies.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1978-12-07a.1694.1" hansard_membership_id="4533" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/14996" speakername="Mr. Foot" colnum="1694" time="">
<p>Further to that point of order, Mr. Speaker. The question whether a vote shall take place after a certain period is not for the hon. Gentleman to decide. It is a question for Mr. Speaker to decide. I suggest to the House&#x2014;I fully understand that the feelings of many hon. Members, after the discussions that we have had, have run high on these questions&#x2014;that it is proper that the House should take some time to consider the matter. In my opinion&#x2014;others may disagree&#x2014;on a matter of this significance, if we started the debate now it would be improper to reach a conclusion at 10 o'clock. That is my view. I believe that there should be a longer period than that. But I do not see any difficulty in starting the debate now, and I am quite prepared to consider the matter put to me by the hon. Gentleman.<br/>
I am not prepared, at a moment's notice, to give a response without considering the other implications, such as those for the business for next week. We have all these matters to consider, and I am asked by the hon. Gentleman to give an off-the-cuff reply at a minute's notice. I do not think that that is a reasonable way for the House to proceed.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1978-12-07a.1695.0" hansard_membership_id="6655" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/20939" speakername="Mr. St. John-Stevas" colnum="1695" time="">
<p>Further to the point of order, Mr. Speaker. The Opposition are perfectly happy to follow the suggestion of the Lord President that the debate be initiated, provided that we can have some indication from the Chair that we shall be able to reach a conclusion this evening. If you find it impossible, Mr. Speaker, to give such an indication, we must ask the Lord President for a full day's debate next week on this vital issue.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1978-12-07a.1695.1" hansard_membership_id="4533" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/14996" speakername="Mr. Foot" colnum="1695" time="">
<p>I am prepared to consider representations from the Opposition. What I am suggesting is that we should start the debate now and that we should continue with the business on the Order Paper as it was agreed. Indeed, the order of business today was agreed by the Opposition as well as by us. I suggest that we continue on that basis. We would then have time to consider what should be the next step. I certainly agree that it would not be proper to try to bring the debate to a close at 10 o'clock, and that also, in my view, has to be taken into account. I think that we should have time to consider these matters and, in order that we may do so, I think it right that the debate should now be initiated.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1978-12-07a.1695.2" hansard_membership_id="2357" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/21007" speakername="Mr. David Steel" colnum="1695" time="">
<p>Further to that point of order, Mr. Speaker. is not the difficulty in which the House finds itself that there are two groups of hon. Members with quite legitimate interests to pursue, namely, those who feel that it was wrong to pass such large sums of money on the nod and who have legitimately used the procedures of the House to express their displeasure, and, on the other hand, those on the Opposition Benches who have thereby lost their right to a full Supply Day?<br/>
I submit to you, Mr. Speaker, that it really cannot make sense to follow the course suggested by the Leader of the House, namely, that we should begin a debate not knowing when it might end. Surely, that is quite unreasonable. Nor, with respect to the Shadow Leader of the House, do I think that it can make sense to have a decision of this magnitude after a debate of two and a quarter hours, when plainly there are hon. Members&#x2014;I am not one of them&#x2014;who represent constituencies vitally affected by these matters. I am certainly hoping to catch your eye. Mr. Speaker, and I know that

I have certain privileges in that respect, but I am seeking to protect the rights of those who have constituency interests, of whom, as I say, I am not one.<br/>
I do not think that either course is sensible. I feel that we must accept that, sadly, we have lost today and a lesson must be learnt for the future as to the procedure of tabling these motions on a day such as this, and the Opposition should be given their Supply Day next week.</p>

<p>Order. If we begin the debate now, I am not prepared to tell the House at this point whether I would take the closure. It would not be the first time that it had been taken after a two-hour debate. It will be three-quarters of an hour short of an emergency debate it we begin now. I do not wish to commit myself at all. I shall see what happens in the debate.</p>
</speech>

<p>Further to that point of order and to your ruling, Mr. Speaker. We cannot start this important debate. The Leader of the House has had three hours to know exactly what is going on. It has gone on before his very eyes&#x2014;or, if it has not, the reason is that he was not present in the Chamber. The Government have run away from a debate on sanctions. They have deliberately done so because they were afraid that they would not win it, and this despite the fact that it is an extremely important subject which affects almost every constituency.<br/>
I demand from the Lord President a Supply Day to discuss the subject. Otherwise, he must understand that all co-operation through the usual channels will be withdrawn.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1978-12-07a.1696.3" hansard_membership_id="4533" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/14996" speakername="Mr. Foot" colnum="1696" time="">
<p>I shall certainly take into account the submissions that have been made both by the hon. Member for Chelmsford (Mr. St. John-Stevas) and by the right hon. Lady the Leader of the Opposition, but I am entitled to have some time to consider those submissions. The first submission that we have had from the Opposition&#x2014;that we should adjourn the debate and not proceed&#x2014;was put by the hon. Member for Chelmsford.<br/>
The Opposition agreed to the procedures under which we were operating


today, and therefore the right hon. Lady is not entitled to make such charges at all. What we are seeking to discover is how best we can use the time and how best we can consider also the business for next week.<br/>
I am entitled, and the Government are entitled, to consider what is the business for next week before we accept representations of that character. If the Opposition want to have discussions through the usual channels about the business, of course we are prepared to do so, but we are not prepared to accept it under the threat that, if we do not accept a particular demand, all the facilities or arrangements through the usual channels are to be broken off. Let us have discussions through the usual channels. That, of course, is exactly what I was proposing.<br/>
I suggest that this debate could have been started. I feel that we could have proceeded in that way, but if the House does not want to proceed with the debate this evening, we shall have to consider what is to be done in the future. I have to take into account the representations of other Members, and I have to take into account the position of the House. I am not prepared to agree to a proposition put by the Opposition in these circumstances in this way without considering the full implications.</p>

<p>Before things get any worse, Mr. Speaker, may I ask whether it would be possible to suspend the sitting for a brief period&#x2014;[HON. MEMBERS: "No."]&#x2014;so that the suggestion put forward by the Lord President can be followed up?</p>

<p>I was not prepared to lose that order, Mr. Speaker. I was hoping that we could deal with that first before turning to the Adjournment of the House. I was explaining that I do not think that we should proceed with the subject tabled by the Opposition for debate. Tomorrow morning there will be a meeting of the usual channels to discuss future business, and I shall make a fresh Business Statement to the House at 11 o'clock tomorrow.<br/>
We have to consider the whole position of the business that is before the House, and I think that we are fully entitled to take that into account.

<p>Every cloud&#x2014;[<i>Interruption</i>]&#x2014;has a silver lining. It seems that I now have a little more time at my disposal. If that is not so, at least there are others who may care to take part in the debate within the period that is available to us. I notice, Mr. Speaker, that at the bottom of the desk there is a tin of red paint which you might care to have removed.<br/>
On 23rd March 1977 a decision was taken by Preston council to submit a compulsory purchase order in respect of a number of properties in an area where there was considerable unfit housing. The council wished to clear the area and to make alternative arrangements for the land that would become available. The Preston (Plungington No. 2) compulsory purchase order 1977 was the subject of a public inquiry on 9th May 1978, about

six months ago. I understand that the North-West economic planning council is about 12 months behind schedule in dealing with decisions on compulsory purchase orders, and I recognise that within the Department of the Environment there is a backlog of similar requests by local authorities in areas where there is a need to demolish&#x2014;</p>

<p>I was saying, Mr. Speaker, that we are concerned with a compulsory purchase order in respect of a number of properties broadly within an area of about two miles in the Springfield Street-Aqueduct Street area. In that area there are land, workshops and 67 properties, of which properties 58 are unfit houses. Some of the unfit houses are in a deplorable condition.<br/>
Unhappily, the application for the compulsory purchase order is made


against a background that must be considered by the Department of the Environment. The Department will not be unfamiliar with the present housing situation in Preston generally. There are about 2,500 people in the Preston area who are waiting for suitable housing accommodation. The bulk of those people need accommodation urgently. Many of them are medical cases.<br/>
The local housing authority's policy is to build 100 new houses per year. The Preston council is Conservative-controlled. The policy of building 100 houses a year is its way of dealing with the situation that I have described. Therefore, some of the families in need of housing will, clearly, never be rehoused in good accommodation. Some of their children will be married and 25 years older before they are likely to obtain reasonable housing accommodation.<br/>
One of the unfortunate aspects of this compulsory purchase order application&#x2014;it is not uncommon in a number of towns and cities&#x2014;is that the local authority has indicated its complete unwillingness to rehouse the occupants of some of the unfit dwellings pending the Department's decision on the compulsory purchase order. It implies that it cannot rehouse them until that decision has been made. The Minister knows better than I do that there is no rule in any housing or other Act which prevents a local authority from rehousing tenants in unfit accommodation in advance of a decision on a compulsory purchase order. Unhappily, the Minister has no direct power to intervene, but my plea is that Preston borough council should attempt to rehouse some of the worst cases involved in this compulsory purchase order area.<br/>
The Minister will recall that I was fortunate enough to have an Adjournment debate some months ago on the question of housing. In that debate we were considering the problems of multi-storey dwellings in the Avenham and other areas of Preston. The Minister offered to intervene in the sense of being willing, should the local authority make a request to him, to give advice on changing that situation.<br/>
I should be interested to hear whether the local authority has taken up that offer of advice. It seems to me, particularly when I read statements made by

the chairman of the local housing committee and observations which are made in council when housing is discussed, that advice is something from which the Preston housing authority could well benefit.<br/>
There has been&#x2014;and the Minister probably has a similar problem in his constituency&#x2014;a growth in my correspondence over the last 12 months containing pleas for me to intervene and assist constituents with rehousing. You, Mr. Deputy Speaker, will no doubt recall from your experience that it is not the job of a Member of Parliament to seek to intervene in housing allocations or lettings in his constituency. That is a job for local councillors. In regard to this compulsory purchase order, one of the local councillors, Joe Ward, has been extremely active in pressing for rehousing for some tenants.<br/>
I want to give the Minister every opportunity to reply in depth, and I do not want to go outside the terms of this Adjournment debate, but there is often &#x2014;and it is true in this instance&#x2014; a correlation between deprivation which arises from unfit housing and other forms of social deprivation. So it is with some of the families involved. As I said earlier, they are a mixture of elderly couples. Some of them have been owner-occupiers but, in the main, as might be expected, it is landlord-tenant accommodation with which I am concerned.<br/>
In recent years these people have found it extremely difficult to attempt to redecorate and to deal with water seeping through roofs and so on. Some of them, it must be admitted, have given up the fight. They have virtually closed the upper parts of their houses and are living almost entirely downstairs. I went into one house which did not have a stick of furniture upstairs. The walls were black because of damp and moss was evident near the windows. Therefore, one could understand why they had deserted their upper storey accommodation.<br/>
The Hewitson family in Springfield Street has for some years been seeking rehousing because of its deplorable conditions, but without success, and that applies to other families in the street.<br/>
I recall seeing three houses in that area which were to be demolished, but they are now propped up by beams of wood at


the rear. That poor families&#x2014;there is such a family, with small children&#x2014;have to live in those conditions is a tremendous reflection on how the Preston housing authority is prepared to ignore their plight. It is a deplorable situation. The whale area is a blot on the Preston landscape and a disgrace to any housing authority.<br/>
I should be glad to learn from the Minister that he has high expectations of giving an early decision. Certainly that would considerably help the worst cases in this area. Some indication of an early decision would help me to apply further pressure on the Preston council to make advance lettings to a number of these families. I should welcome the Minister's remarks in this regard.</p>

<p>I welcome the opportunity of responding to my hon. Friend the Member for Preston, South (Mr. Thorne). Apart from the occasions on which he has raised the problem of housing in his constituency in Adjournment debates, he has been a constant pressure group on my Department. I welcome his interest in and deep concern about the conditions in which some of his constituents live.<br/>
My hon. Friend, in the reasonable way in which he put his argument, put his finger on a quandary which confronts us all. The problem of compulsory purchase orders is difficult and vital. It is a question, on the one hand, of the onus on both central and local government to minimise hardship to residents in areas affected by the prospect of compulsory purchase and, on the other hand, of the rights of individual citizens, some as property owners objecting to compulsory purchase orders, to have recourse to the proper legal procedures. That can sometimes take a considerable time.<br/>
My hon. Friend will understand that I must avoid touching on the merits or demerits of the order to which he has referred. To do so would open the door to counter representations which would have to be considered, and that could mean further delay.<br/>
My hon. Friend is particularly concerned about the welfare of residents in the clearance area which include Springfield Street and Aqueduct Street&#x2014;the

Preston (Plungington No. 2) compulsory purchase order 1977. In correspondence with my hon. Friend I have explained some of the reasons for the time taken in dealing with this order. I very much regret the backlog of compulsory purchase orders, because I appreciate that we are dealing not with paper statistics, and so on, but with living conditions and with people who are in desperate need of new and decent homes. Therefore, I appreciate my hon. Friend's concern.<br/>
It is a fact that in the North-West region the number of applications for CPOs has grown tremendously. From January to November 1977, 166 decisions were made for the North-West region, and in the same period this year that number increased to 308. I am sure my hon. Friend will appreciate that the staff have been under great pressure indeed.<br/>
This CPO was submitted to my Department for confirmation on 15th September 1977. I can well understand that those affected are wondering why it has taken so long to come to a decision. It is the local council's intention that these homes be demolished and the land redeveloped for light industry. Objections were made to the inclusion of various homes in the order and a public local inquiry had to be held. That took place on 9th May 1978. The inspector's report has been received and the order is now with the Department's North-West regional office in the queue awaiting consideration. My hon. Friend has already been advised that a decision should be issued early next year. I shall have something to say about that later.<br/>
I accept that such a long delay between public inquiry and decision is, to say the least, unsatisfactory. The delay stems from the large threefold increase in the number of orders which have been submitted by local authorities in the North-West during the last three years. Last year the regional office received 45 per cent. of all the slum clearance orders submitted in England. This has overstretched staff resources, which are already limited by manpower constraints. Nevertheless, despite there being until recently no increase in staff&#x2014;as I indicated in the numbers that I gave&#x2014;special efforts have secured an 85 per cent. increase in the output of decisions so far this year compared with the same period last year. I


am glad to say that steps have now been taken to allocate more staff to this work. but with new orders coming in all the time it will take some time to clear the accumulated backlog.<br/>
As my hon. Friend pointed out, Preston is an old industrial town with a high proportion of worn out and substandard terraced houses built to high densities in streets of grid-iron pattern. The local councils policy in relation to this obsolescent housing has over the past 25 years been one of phased clearance, starting with the worst areas first. One problem in achieving this aim has been the shortage of available land. The clearance of areas of older housing has been necessary, not only to eliminate unfit dwellings but to produce in-town sites which can be redeveloped for new housing accommodation.<br/>
Following the Housing Act 1974 and my Department's recommendation that wholesale clearance was no longer the only desirable method of dealing with substandard housing, the borough council decided on a thorough and detailed review of the houses contained in its present slum clearance programme. Many houses originally classed as suitable for some slum clearance at some future date have, in the context of present-day policies, been found to be capable of improvement. In Preston more than 2,500 houses have been removed from the clearance programme. The new emphasis on improvement is a major task.<br/>
I know my hon. Friend understands the new system that we have introduced, which gives us much more detailed information of the strategy of the local housing authority. The housing investment programme submitted under that new policy, covering the period from April 1979 to March 1983, envisages the improvement of 3,000 substandard houses during that period. In the case of council-owned property, this is to be achieved by direct action by the borough council and local housing associations, and in the private sector by making available improvement grants and local authority loans, supplemented by mortgages under the building societies support scheme.<br/>
The 3,000 dwellings represented half the present substandard stock, having allowed for the clearance of about 1,000 homes which cannot be saved. I wish the

borough council well in its efforts. There are, of course, still areas of older housing stock where clearance will be the only satisfactory form of action. Urban renewal is a gradual process&#x2014;the improvement of some houses, the selective clearance and replacement of those beyond the pale. The borough council's submitted housing strategy recognises the need for an increase in the overall dwelling stock to accommodate demand from residents of clearance areas, as well as other needs such as overcrowding, the housing waiting list, and the anticipated increase in population.<br/>
The council's building programme, supplemented by housing association activity, is intended to cope with this demand. Altogether, 850 council houses are expected to be completed in the next five years, and housing associations are expected to add a further 900 dwellings. Additionally, the Central Lancashire new town development corporation will be building to meet local needs as well as the needs of the incoming population.<br/>
I turn to action in the Plungington area. The local council's main priority for urban renewal is the Plungington area, where it is fortunate in having the assistance of the Central Lancashire new town development corporation. The borough is working in partnership with the development corporation urban renewal team. A study has commenced of the whole area, involving some 2,500 properties, with a view to assessing the correct approach. This partnership is to be applauded. The development corporation's help includes making staff available, financial assistance towards improvements and the provision of new dwellings on cleared sites in and around improvement areas.<br/>
Action in the Plungington area is to consist largely of improvement. One general improvement area has already been declared, and the borough council hopes to declare further areas&#x2014;covering as many as 1,000 dwellings&#x2014;in the near future.<br/>
I can understand my hon. Friend's concern for the plight of residents occupying houses which the council wishes to clear. The hardship of those living in the CPO area is well understood by me. The responsibility for alleviating this rests with the borough council. Local authorities have been advised in circulars that they should do everything possible to assist


residents during what is often a disturbing change in their pattern of living. They should encourage owners to carry out essential repairs or modest improvements needed to make conditions more tolerable. In the case of tenanted properties, there is no reason why the local authority should not acquire the properties and undertake the work themselves.<br/>
It is open to owner-occupiers to serve a blight notice requiring the local authority to acquire their property in advance of the decision on an order. But local authorities should themselves do everything in their power to counteract the effects of blight, although blight always presents considerable difficulties for everybody concerned. They should intensify the provision of housekeeping services such as street cleaning, refuse collection, adequate rodent control and general maintenance of the surroundings.<br/>
I have not had any representations from councils or, indeed, from residents about living conditions in the area. If the local authority requests that priority be given to this order because there is evidence that people are suffering such severe hardship, I shall be prepared to consider taking it out of turn so that a decision on the order can be brought forward.<br/>
With that in mind I shall read carefully what my hon. Friend has said tonight. If necessary I shall get in touch with him, and certainly I shall be in contact again with my officers in the regional office. I have no doubt that the Preston borough council will take note of what my hon. Friend has said and, indeed. of my reply to this debate.</p>

<p>It is instructive that there are far more Members on the Government Benches for this important debate on sanctions than there are on the Opposition Benches. Tonight we have witnessed the Tory Opposition in high dudgeon, in fact, in hysteria about this policy, yet not one hon. Member from the Conservative Party is here to continue the debate as we wanted to earlier and as we intend to do now.<br/>
The Tories ran away from their own debate just as they ran away from a substantive motion. This is an extremely important issue for every constituency in the country and, indeed, for every worker in the country and it needs to be debated fully and openly in the House.<br/>
I have been a critic of the sanctions policy for a long time. In fact, it was I who first inveigled the Government into admitting the existence of the so-called black list. I have never accepted sanctions as an appropriate part of the Government's economic strategy and I believe that Parliament would never have given the Government discretionary powers under the Industry Act or the Export Credit Guarantee provisions had it known how they would be used.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) is correct. Given the amount of hysteria that has been generated here tonight I do not think that the Opposition are taking this matter seriously enough. Not one of them has been prepared to wait until the comparatively early hour of 9.45 p.m. in the hope of catching your eye, Mr. Deputy Speaker.<br/>
I do not believe that Parliament would have given discretionary powers to the Government had it known that they were likely to be used in a way that was unintended and unexpected. Had it known that the Government would use the powers in this arbitrary and unjust fashion, discriminating not against the companies but against the workers of those companies in reality, it would never have approved them.<br/>
It is strange that although the Government have made a great deal of their industrial strategy to create and protect jobs and their economic strategy to bring down inflation, and have also introduced a whole variety of temporary employment measures to assist and sustain employment in areas such as Merseyside. they should use discretionary powers in an arbitrary and unjust manner to jeopardise the jobs already in existence.<br/>
It is clearly possible that it temporary employment subsidy is withdrawn from a firm, if a firm is refused export credit guarantees or a variety of Government assistance under the Industry Act, it will have a serious impact on employment within that company. That would have been the case with Otis Elevator Company in Kirkby in my constituency, which last year settled above the 10 per cent. pay guideline&#x2014;at 10&#x00E7;5 per cent.&#x2014;at the same time applying for temporary employment subsidy for 250 workmen. Had the Government carried out their threat to withhold temporary employment subsidy from Otis Elevator it would have led to the loss of 200 jobs in an area of excessively high unemployment. We have


enough serious unemployment as it is. especially in Merseyside and Kirkby.<br/>
Only today I heard that Kirkby's workers' co-operative is likely to be wound up, with the loss not of 260 jobs but of all 700 jobs, because the prospective private enterprise company which might have taken it over backed out of the operation. We cannot afford to lose those jobs. We cannot afford to lose the many hundreds and thousands of jobs that we have lost in the past few months in Kirkby and Merseyside, and then have a further threat to other jobs in the region as the result of the application of the Government's discretionary sanctions.</p>

<p>Does my hon. Friend agree that, apart from the policy of sanctions against certain firms being indefensible, there are only a limited number of firms against which they can be applied? They cannot be applied against British Oxygen, because doing so would bring the whole of British industry to a standstill. Does my hon. Friend also agree that there are hundreds of provincial NUJ members on very low rates of pay who are on strike, and it would be indefensible if the Government attempted to use sanctions against newspapers?</p>

<p>I entirely agree with my hon. Friend. It would be totally indefensible and immoral if the Government were to use sanctions against farm workers. Everyone accepts that farm workers are at poverty level and on a minimum wage. They are asking for an increase well beyond the 5 per cent. If they get that increase, will the Government take discretionary action against farmers? If they do, the farmers, being subsidised, will no longer be able to continue in production. That would be indefensible.<br/>
My hon. Friend takes me on to one of the most unjust elements of the sanctions policy. It hits the weak; it hits those in the public sector, who will be discriminated against more effectively and thoroughly than those in the private sector. The only policy that the Government have for upholding their non-statutory pay policy&#x2014;it is not an incomes policy&#x2014;is the imposition of sanctions. Even in the private sector, in the main, with the exception of firms like Ford,

sanctions can be applied only to the weak private sector companies, the companies which need Government assistance. whether through loans and subsidies under the Industry Act or through temporary employment subsidy, in order to maintain employment.<br/>
It is the weaker companies and the weaker workers in the companies within the private sector who are susceptible to the imposition of Government sanctions. Workers in companies which are strong, viable and profitable, and which do not rely upon Government orders, contracts or assistance, escape unscathed. That, clearly, is both unfair and intolerable. There can be no defence for a policy which in practice discriminates against the weak and allows the strong to get away with it. It is an efficient punishment not of the companies but of the workers in those companies.</p>

<p>Does my hon. Friend agree that the proposed sanctions against Ford are farcical, because Ford has a lot of leeway to make up in fulfilling its orders? How far can the sanctions be effective? It is local authorities which normally order motor vehicles.<br/>
The Government's decision may be a blessing in disguise for Ford and may enable the company to fulfil its obligations in the international market. We have here all the ramifications of a multinational company's operations. The Granada, Ford's biggest and most successful car, is produced in Germany, with much Turkish labour; the Cortina is produced in Belgium; and the Ford small cars are produced in Dagenham and are in great demand in this country. Does my hon. Friend agree that the whole idea of threatening sanctions takes on a farcical character?</p>

<p>My hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Southall (Mr. Bidwell) is right. There is a farcical facet to the whole concept of sanctions and to the way in which they have been imposed.

<p>No. I must get on. Many of my hon. Friends who have been here throughout the day wish to speak. The hon. Gentleman has only just walked in.<br/>
There is another aspect to Government policy. Until relatively recently it was shrouded in the mists of secrecy. We did not know what companies were being subjected to sanctions. I learnt only from newspapers that a company called High-Speed Turnings, in Kirkby, was being subjected to sanctions. We do not know to what sanctions these firms were or are being subjected, or for what reasons, or for what length of time. We also do not know what impact those sanctions were having on the companies concerned.<br/>

<p>I must make clear to the hon. Member for Orpington (Mr. Stanbrook) that I am not in the mood to give way to interventions from Conservative Members. We can do without flippant interventions. This is a serious subject.<br/>
I should make it clear that, although I am highly critical of the Government's use of sanctions in this context, I am not opposed to the use of sanctions as a matter of general policy. I should like to see the greater use of sanctions for more positive and constructive things. I should like to see sanctions imposed against companies that do not employ their proper quota of disabled workers. There are many such cases, particularly in Government Departments.<br/>
The same applies to those companies which practise some form, open or subtle, of racial or sexual discrimination, or involve themselves in some way in exploiting their workers, either through low pay or inadequate working conditions.<br/>

<p>The sanctions policy is the use of other means of implementing the Government's so-called incomes policy. We do not have an incomes policy. What we have is a pay policy which is unfair, unjust, and riddled with anomalies&#x2014;anomalies which mean that it is always the same people who are subjected to pay restraint and the imposition of sanctions of one kind or another. Equally, it is always the same people, whether stockbrokers, lawyers, estate agents or the self-employed, who escape


entirely from the imposition of the pay policy. That is true now, it was true last year and the year before, and it has been true under every Administration's implementation of so-called pay restraint policies since 1947. It is always my constituents and those of my hon. Friend who are asked to put their noses to the grindstone and make sacrifices.</p>

<p>Does my hon. Friend agree that most professional people often charge fees that are percentages of prices, which means that they have a direct interest in increasing inflation? Estate agency is one example, because whenever house prices rise, estate agents increase their commission.</p>

<p>I agree. Not only do they increase their commission in that way, not only are such people enabled to determine and announce their own pay increases; they are also&#x2014;this happens throughout management in industry, commerce and the service industries&#x2014;able to escape the implications and consequences of any pay policy by giving themselves all kinds of non-monetary perks. It is clearly indefensible that a pay policy riddled with such anomalies and injustices &#x2014;a pay policy such as that which we now have&#x2014;should be implemented by the Government.<br/>
I am very much in favour of an incomes policy, but it must be a Socialist incomes policy&#x2014;one that takes account of incomes and wealth, and in which the resources of society are distributed fairly and equitably according to rational criteria. We do not have such a policy. Without the implementation of such a policy, I cannot in any circumstances give my support to other policies which, in reality, amount to no more than a restraint upon the income of the working class.</p>

<p>That is precisely the point that I was making. I am deeply in favour of an incomes policy, so long as it takes account of all forms of income, earned and unearned, and other wealth. As a prerequisite for the implementation

of that policy we must have a Socialist society that is seen to be fair and just as between all sections of the community. That is clearly and demonstrably not the case at the moment, and it has not been the case in the past.<br/>
It is totally unreasonable continually to ask the same people to be making the same sacrifices when they see the obscene wealth displayed in other parts of the country by certain individuals and while we have such enormous disparities of income and wealth in our society. While such conditions exist there cannot be any justification for, or defence of, any kind of pay restraint.</p>

The Government's policies are contrary to the will of the Labour movement as a whole. It amazes us to find the Government pursuing policies that are at variance with

<p>The hon. Gentleman says that he and his party are opposed to sanctions. Does he remember the most horrific and terrible sanctions ever imposed? It was called the Industrial Relations Act, under which the entire trade union movement was subjected to the power of the courts, with a new chairman specially put there to penalise the unions. Was not that the most terrible sanction of all? How can the hon. Gentleman pretend to be against sanctions when he applauded that monstrous sanction that his party imposed?</p>

<p>I do not think that that was the most terrible sanction of all, because if there is one great evil against which we in this country have to fight and contend with all the time it is irresponsible trade unionism. Say what one may about the Industrial Relations Act, it was an attempt to cure that evil. That evil was so well recognised that even the Labour Government of 1966 to 1970 attempted to cure it in their own way by producing their White Paper"In Place of Strife ".<br/>
It so happens that the ideas that formed the basis of that document received support in the country as a whole but were opposed by the trade union movement, and especially by the irresponsible section of it. Unfortunately for the country, the Labour Government were unsuccessful in their attempt to cure that evil, and when the Conservative Government tried to cure it by their methods they, too, were unsuccessful.</p>

<p>I remind my hon. Friend that during that period of the Labour Government between 1966 and 1970, when proposals were brought forward by the right hon.

proposed were far more severe than any that were introduced by the Conservative Government.</p>

<p>I am much obliged to my hon. Friend. That is true. In some ways the proposals of the Labour Government were more draconian than those of the Conservative Government, so it cannot be said that this evil of irresponsible trade unions is not well recognised, even by members of the hon.

One of the greatest tragedies was that the Conservative Government's attempt to deal with the problem did not receive the support that it should have done from the then Labour Opposition.</p>

<p>I cannot speak for the actions of my Front Bench should it be in a position to make immediate proposals. I say only that the evil remains and must be dealt with. I hope that a future Conservative Government will deal with it, though perhaps not in the same way as the Conservative Government of 1970 to 1974. Perhaps they will adopt a more acceptable approach, with more consultation, and perhaps, best of all, based upon the proposals laid before Parliament by the Labour Government of 1966 to 1970.<br/>
In some ways there was a great deal to be said for those proposals. It was a great shame that the Conservative Government did not take them up and introduce them, putting them through the House with the commendation of the right hon. Member for Blackburn and the right hon. Member for Huyton (Sir H. Wilson) who were, after all, the godparents of those proposals.<br/>
They were defeated by a section of the Labour Party, and now they are passing from the scene. One hopes, however, that the Labour Party will see reason as time passes and will not be taken over by its Left wing, and that it will never have control of the government of this country again. Until the country recognises this evil with acceptable and effective proposals which will deal with the monster of irresponsible trade unionism, it will never solve any of its problems.<br/>
I revert, however, to the main subject of the debate, which concerns the sanctions policy of the Government against firms which do not comply with the Government's incomes policy. This is perhaps a subject of tremendous fundamental importance. The power granted to Ministers to act within the discretion allowed to them by Parliament is conferred by statute. Every statute giving a Minister power of this kind is devoted to a particular purpose. When a Minister exercises his discretion outside the objectives of the relevant statute, I believe that he is acting unlawfully.<br/>
It cannot be said, can it, in this country which, thank God, is still free, that a Minister is entitled to act beyond the purposes, spirit and intention of Acts which give him the power to act within his discretion? It must be wrong, if an Act gives him power to grant or to withhold assistance for the purposes of export credits or industrial training, for him to act out of motives dissimilar to those contained in the legislation or outside the comprehension of Parliament when it enacted that legislation.</p>

<p>If the trade union movement was the irresponsible creature that the hon. Member has sought to depict in his historic narrative, which is entirely faulty, there would be justification for the Government's policies. However, the hon. Member's narrative is totally wrong. The element of trade unionism which can be described as irresponsible is minuscule in proportion to the overall size of the movement in which a great number of workers, especially in skilled occupations, engage in responsible negotiations. I speak as a sponsored member of the Transport and General Workers Union which is involved in the current difficulties over Ford.<br/>
The trade unionists there engaged in responsible negotiations against a background of the stupendous profits made by that company. That is why those men are getting up tight against the Government's attitude which does not accord with the realities of industrial life. If the hon. Member's portrayal of wild and wanton trade unionists were correct, there might be some need for the Government's actions. However, as the hon. Member is wrong, the Government's action is also wrong.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman has missed the fact that I have passed from the topic of his remarks to the subject of this debate, namely, sanctions. The Labour Government are caught in a trap of their own making. They were faced by a monster in the form of irresponsible trade unionism. In attempting to appease that monster, they gave it the industrial and political power that it wanted. That Government put through this House legislation which would not have been enacted if that Government had represented the people and had fairly expressed the wishes of the people in regard to trade unions.<br/>
The Labour Government have since created a situation in which the trade unions have a stranglehold over our economy. The result is that, whereas originally the trade unions were prepared to co-operate in return for these concessions, now they are not. Perhaps there was a vestige of the original trade union purpose of benefiting their members, but the trade union movement seems now to realise that an incomes policy such as that devised by the Labour Government is good neither for the country nor for trade unionists.<br/>
The trade unions not only have a political and economic stranglehold on the country; they determine the life of the Labour Government. The sooner the execution takes place, the better. The whole nation is awaiting the opportunity to get rid of the Labour Government who have so dishonoured their early promises.<br/>
I wish now to deal with the economic sanctions that the Labour Government seek to impose. I believe that the action that they have taken is unlawful. Their policy is riddled with inconsistencies. We are all waiting for the sanctions to be imposed on the TUC for its breaches of incomes policy. If the Government are determined to impose sanctions on Ford, they must in all justice impose similar sanctions on the TUC. The TUC receives at least &#x00A3;1 million from the Government in respect of training. Why should that figure not be cut off completely? It is a discretionary power in the hands of the Minister, who can decide whether or not to grant that money. Surely it is well established that action against the TUC should follow action taken against any individual company.<br/>
This is a fundamental problem. Magna Carta, 763 years ago, first established that no man should be punished except for a breach of the law. If we apply that principle to current circumstances, we wonder what kind of breach of the law Ford has committed. There is no statute that says that Ford may not pay more than 5 per cent. Indeed, if the Labour Government were more honest they would have enacted such a statute, but they have not had the courage to do so. At least the Government headed by my right hon. Friend the Member for Sidcup (Mr. Heath) displayed that courage.</p>

<p>Does the hon. Gentleman agree that just over 100 years ago the men of Dorset, the Tolpuddle martyrs, when attempting to organise trade unions in order to deal with the vicious attacks on them by their employers, were condemned and sent to penal colonies? Perhaps the hon. Gentleman is thinking of returning to that stage in our history. He displayed in his speech a violent hostility to the trade union movement. Perhaps he will try to define the difference between irresponsible and responsible trade unionists.<br/>
It appears that what the Conservative Party wants is a trade union movement that is weak and ineffective. It would call that a responsible trade union movement. The British trade union movement was built up out of sheer necessity and the conditions of the time in which it emerged, but the attitudes of those times have been inherited by the Conservative Party in our politics today. When he talks about the trade union movement, the hon. Gentleman should remember that in the recent past that movement has acted in a most responsible manner in assisting this country out of its economic difficulties. The trade unionists feel, and I feel with them, that it is about time they began to get some of the rewards for the sacrifices which they have made in the past.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman has referred to sanctions. I wish to make clear that there is a sharp distinction between Labour Members' approach to sanctions and the approach of the Conservative Opposition. I cannot for a moment understand how a party that could contrive the Industrial Relations Act could say with any degree

of honesty that it was opposed to sanctions, yet that is what we hear from it.<br/>
Will the hon. Gentleman tell us what sort of policies would be introduced by a Conservative Government, if there should ever be one, to deal with the so-called irresponsible trade union movement? The House might learn something from this debate if he told us exactly what the position would be if&#x2014;God forbid&#x2014;the Opposition were ever to form the Government of the day.</p>

<p>I thank the hon. Gentleman for that most helpful intervention, but it is he who is living in the past. All those who talk in terms of the trade union movement as he does are still living in the past&#x2014;he referred to the Tolpuddle martyrs&#x2014;because it was the Conservative Party that established the trade unions on a legal footing and probably gave them more assistance in their formative stages than did any other party in this country.<br/>
It is the Conservative Party that accepts that an institution whose membership is composed of individual workers is entitled to operate within the law in the interests of those members, and that institution is, indeed, given a special privileged position in our law. That is the position, and it certainly was the position up to the second world war.<br/>
All those victories of the past having been won, one would have expected trade unions to continue in that function. Unfortunately, for historical reasons, they own the Labour Party. They created it, and they still pay for it. The result is that they think that they can call its tune. A further result has been that this Government, in their desire to preserve such power as they had, were prepared to condone tyranny and, indeed, to appease it by granting political power.</p>

<p>Before my hon. Friend continues to reply in such good terms to the intervention of the hon. Member for Liverpool, Garston (Mr. Loyden), may I underline the significance of the demonstration of rebellion on the Government Back Benches which we witnessed this


evening, when more than 30 hon. Members assembled to support the hon. Member for Ormskirk (Mr. Kilroy-Silk), who initiated this Adjournment debate?<br/>
In view of the extreme terms of criticism which have been applied to Government policy tonight, is it not clear that the hon. Members who assembled this evening could not possibly support the Government on future occasions in any matter relating to sanctions or incomes policy? I ask my hon. Friend to recognise the great political significance of the protest and demonstration which have taken place in the Chamber tonight.</p>

<p>I am grateful to my hon. Friend for pointing that out. We have a rather curious situation here, in which a large section of the Labour Party, so it appears, is opposed to the current policies of the Government whom it is supporting in power. I noted that some hon. Members now present voted against the defence Estimates this afternoon, which also seems rather significant. I have always thought that defence in this country was almost sacrosanct in political terms, it being recognised that the first duty of any nation is to defend itself adequately. It is clear that in the priorities adopted by some hon. Members the defence of our country comes a long way down the scale.<br/>
It is obvious that the Opposition are determined to maintain the defence of the realm against its enemies internally and externally, but that Government Members do not regard defence as a high priority on public expenditure. On the contrary, they are willing to support a tyranny that has been created, fostered and strengthened in the country by their party. One therefore wonders whose interests such hon. Members have at heart, since they support such tyrannies and are, at the same time, willing to vote against the defence of our country.<br/>
If there were a touchstone it would be that of defence Estimates. Government Members either believe that we should have adequate men and that they should have adequate arms and equipment&#x2014;</p>

<p>It had crossed my mind that the Minister, with whom personally I have no quarrel, was going to make his contribution, like so many of his hon. Friends, by an intervention to my speech. He appears not to wish to do that. I wish to advance the constitutional progress of the House so I shall sit down if the Minister wishes to intervene.</p>

<p>I have listened with interest to the arguments. I could not understand whether hon. Members realised that the monster that they are facing is not the monster of trade unionism, as envisaged by the hon. Member for Orpington (Mr. Stanbrook), or even the small monster of Toryism&#x2014;or the nil monster of Toryism &#x2014;that we have seen from the Opposition Front Bench. Crucial to what is happening now and to the prospects for the future is the rate of inflation. Nobody disputes that. The TUC does not dispute it.<br/>
Our success in getting the inflation rate down from 27 per cent. in 1975 to 8 per cent. today is there for all to see. We have come through the worst recession experienced in the West in recent times. Output is rising. Investment has risen and is still rising. We can keep output growing. Living standards rose by 7 per cent. in the second quarter of the year and, certainly, it improved further in the third quarter. Unemployment has fallen by 100,000 in the year.<br/>
But we cannot be complacent. Our unit wages costs in manufacturing have been rising faster than in any other major industrial country. If that continues we shall see inflation roar away again. Progressively we shall lose out to foreign competition. Inflation exports jobs and depresses home demand overall. Faced with inflation people save more but think twice about investing in industry.<br/>
The present policy is designed to keep inflation within single figures, and if possible to reduce it further. Our policy is not a negative policy or restraint. Under our policy there is scope for genuine self-financing productivity beyond the 5 per cent. limit. We shall achieve sustained improvement in real incomes, as opposed to confetti money, only by sustained improvement in productivity deals.<br/>
There is scope, particularly in large bargaining groups, to deal with differentials. Other pay anomalies can be sorted out on the"kitty"principle. There are special provisions to allow higher rises for the lower-paid. The opinion polls have

shown that the majority of voters are solidly behind our approach to incomes policy.<br/>
It is our duty to do what we can to persuade employers in the public and private sectors to reach settlements that are within the guidelines. We shall take such action which is within our legal discretion&#x2014;</p>
